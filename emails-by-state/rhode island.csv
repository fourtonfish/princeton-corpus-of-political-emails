Message from the Chair
Dear Friend:
I hope this letter finds you healthy and safe during this difficult time. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected every one of us, and as someone who is assisting a family member with a chronic illness, I can tell you it's always ""OK"" to ask for help. With that in mind, I'm sharing a list of resources that may prove helpful, if you or a loved one become sick. If you do, please call your health care provider immediately; for those without a healthcare provider, please contact:

In the General Assembly, we are working with the R.I. Department of Education to refine our remote learning programs. We are grateful to our dedicated teachers and administrators for stepping up during this challenging time, and the many parents, who make this novel approach to learning a reality.
We can't begin to thank the many women and men in our public safety and medical communities, and the countless small businesses and workers that deliver critical services and everyday necessities at this time. We know well and respect the many risks you, too, face in doing so.
Finally, as Chair of the R.I. House of Representatives Committee on Health, Education and Welfare, I'm been working closely with the Governor, House and Senate leadership and members, and mayors and other local leaders, to make sure adequate resources are available to our communities. Below is a list of some of those resources:

RI Democratic Party,info@ridemocrats.org,Statement on the Passing of Edna O'Neill Mattson,"Statement on the Passing of
Edna O'Neill Mattson
By Joseph M. McNamara, Chair of the R.I. Democratic Party
WARWICK, R.I. (March 23, 2020) – “It is with great sadness and heavy hearts that we’ve learned today of the passing of Edna O’Neill Mattson,” said Rhode Island Democratic Party Chair Joseph M. McNamara.
“Edna was our state’s Democratic National Committeewoman for decades and a legend for her fiery red hair and fiery personality, and her service to community. If the late Senator Ted Kennedy was the Lion of the Senate, then she surely was the Lioness of this state’s Democratic Party,” McNamara said.
“Everything Edna cared about, she cared deeply about: her beloved family, the Community College of Rhode Island, the Democratic Party, the Navy Relief Society and American Red Cross. She was the first woman Democratic town chair, a charter member of the state Democratic City and Town Chair Association, and a delegate to every National Democratic Convention since 1976,” he said.
“Edna proudly served this party her whole life, and fittingly ended it as our state’s Democratic National Committee woman,” McNamara. “We will miss her: there will never be another Edna.”

George Floyd
Last week, we learned that George Floyd was brutally murdered by police officers in Minneapolis. This is beyond infuriating. What is evident from watching the horrific video footage is our communities deserve better - no one, regardless of their race, should have to worry about being killed by the people we pay to ""protect and to serve.""
It has often been said that the journey of 1000 miles begins with one step. As we all reflect on this tragedy, I hope you'll join me in recommitting ourselves to the work of tearing down the structures of systemic racism in all aspects of our society. By doing so, we'll continue to bend the arc of the moral universe Dr. King described toward justice and equality for all.

RI Democratic Party,info@ridemocrats.org,"RI Democratic Party- Statement on the Passing of Edna O'Neill
 Mattson","Statement on the Passing of Edna O'Neill Mattson
By Joseph M. McNamara, Chair of the R.I. Democratic Party
WARWICK, R.I. (March 23, 2020) – “It is with great sadness and heavy hearts that we’ve learned today of the passing of Edna O’Neill Mattson,” said Rhode Island Democratic Party Chair Joseph M. McNamara.
“Edna was our state’s Democratic National Committeewoman for decades and a legend for her fiery red hair and fiery personality, and her service to community. If the late Senator Ted Kennedy was the Lion of the Senate, then she surely was the Lioness of this state’s Democratic Party,” McNamara said.
“Everything Edna cared about, she cared deeply about: her beloved family, the Community College of Rhode Island, the Democratic Party, the Navy Relief Society and American Red Cross. She was the first woman Democratic town chair, a charter member of the state Democratic City and Town Chair Association, and a delegate to every National Democratic Convention since 1976,” he said.
“Edna proudly served this party her whole life, and fittingly ended it as our state’s Democratic National Committee woman,” McNamara. “We will miss her: there will never be another Edna.”

Gaspee Day
Everyone should know a little more about the tale of the HMS Gaspee, a British ship that met its demise in Narragansett Bay. It's a story that represents the grit and tenacity that define Rhode Islanders - and it's also a hell of a yarn.
Since we can't get together in person, Senator Whitehouse put together a video telling the story of the events in question. It's not quite the same as the in-person experience, but it's the next best thing.
The burning of the Gaspee was one of the defining events leading to the American Revolution, and it deserves greater renown outside Rhode Island state lines. I encourage you to click here and listen to the rousing tale of one of the Ocean State's proudest moments.

Message from the Chair
Dear Friend:
I hope this letter finds you healthy and safe during this difficult time. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected every one of us, and as someone who is assisting a family member with a chronic illness, I can tell you it's always ""OK"" to ask for help. With that in mind, I'm sharing a list of resources that may prove helpful, if you or a loved one become sick. If you do, please call your health care provider immediately; for those without a healthcare provider, please contact:

In the General Assembly, we are working with the R.I. Department of Education to refine our remote learning programs. We are grateful to our dedicated teachers and administrators for stepping up during this challenging time, and the many parents, who make this novel approach to learning a reality.
We can't begin to thank the many women and men in our public safety and medical communities, and the countless small businesses and workers that deliver critical services and everyday necessities at this time. We know well and respect the many risks you, too, face in doing so.
Finally, as Chair of the R.I. House of Representatives Committee on Health, Education and Welfare, I'm been working closely with the Governor, House and Senate leadership and members, and mayors and other local leaders, to make sure adequate resources are available to our communities. Below is a list of some of those resources:

Juneteenth
Today marks 155 years since the last enslaved Africans took their first step of freedom in Galveston, Texas. Those protesting at this very moment know that journey is far from finished and that much work remains to ensure true justice and equality for black people in America. This week, during our virtual convention, Chairman McNamara reminded Democrats in our state that each of us, working together, can help make that happen.

RHODE ISLAND (April 6, 2020) – Thanks to a partnership with CVS Health, free rapid COVID-19 tests are now available to all Rhode Islanders, at a drive-up site at Twin River Casino in Lincoln. Residents must register for an appointment first at [[URL REDACTED]] [[URL REDACTED]]
You will receive results on the spot for the first time, thanks to a new Abbott ID Now system. CVS is overseeing these free tests with licensed health care professionals from CVS Minute Clinic.

# Special Convention
Join us for the special convention at The Woods Tavern. We are meeting for election of delegates to the national convention in May in Austin, Texas. If you are a national member in good standing, you are eligible to be elected as a delegate. If you are a local member in good standing, you are eligible to vote for delegates. If you are not a member, come hang out and get to know other libertarians. Our monthly meet-up, a less formal, more social gathering. It's an opportunity to network, ask questions, discuss issues and share ideas. Come and go as you please.
The next meet-up is on Monday, December 16 at 7 p.m. Join us at The Woods Tavern, easy-off | easy-on Interstate 95 in West Greenwich, at 45 Nooseneck Hill Rd.
\------------------------
We'll also discuss the latest headlines: corporate welfare, confiscation of private property, thwarting the will of the people, and silencing the voice of the people in the form of the latest plans for Pawtucket -- and the legislation that made it all possible.

Libertarian Party of RI,news@lpri.us,LPRI's First-Ever Virtual Convention (and Meet-Up),"# LPRI's First-Ever Virtual Convention
The COVID-19 outbreak – and the world’s reaction to it – has changed everything about the way we function as a society and how we interact with each other and in groups. In the span of a few weeks – in some cases, literally overnight – policies and behaviors changed, and “social distancing” and “flatten the curve” became part of a new lexicon.
Among the recent changes to longstanding tradition is the way the Libertarian Party of Rhode Island held its annual convention on Monday, April 20, 2020: over Google Hangouts Meet. The virtual environment, combined with a simple but effective, anonymous real-time voting system, ensured efficient transaction of important party business while permitting safe social mingling before and after.
At the 2020 State Convention of the Libertarian Party of Rhode Island, Mike Rinaldi was re-elected vice chairman for a two-year term, Billy Hunt was re-elected to a two-year term as secretary, and Shawn Mizener was elected to the one-year term of member-at-large. The terms of Chairman Pat Ford and Treasurer Beth Richardson are in effect through 2021.
Chairman Ford called the convention to order and presided over the business meeting, including review, discussion, and votes to approve or reject various proposed amendments to the Bylaws. Bylaws, as newly amended, are available at [[URL REDACTED]]
The next MEET UP will also be virtual. There's a lot to discuss about the current status of the state's COVID-19 shut-down and just how and when to re-open the state. They call it a ""new normal"" but is it? Does it have to be? And what about the staggering economic impact this is having now and in the future?
Or maybe we keep it light and just enjoy each other's company. Being in separate locations does not have to alter that standard quality of our Meet-Ups!
So, put away your mask and come ""hang out"" with LPRI in Google Hang Outs on Monday, May 18 at this link.
You serve up your own beverage and snack food of choice, bring your topics and questions, and we'll serve up the latest news and info for open discussion starting at 7 p.m. Hope to ""see"" you there!
Support your freedom in three ways:
1\. Join the LPRI (invest in your liberty)
2\. Donate (added gifts are appreciated)
3\. Volunteer (give as much or as little time as you can spare)

# Happy New Year!
It's a big year ahead - RI General Assembly is back in session so our eagle eyes, led by Policy Director Shawn Mizener, are sharply focused on seeking out exploitative and liberty-robbing legislation in the blizzard of paper grandstanding we expect every year, but particularly in an election year. Already there is legislation against 3D-printed guns...
Speaking of election year, it's also another Presidential Election Year, and the battle lines are being drawn within the Libertarian Party in the most interesting ways. ICYMI (and not sure how you could), the biggest news locally has to be the announcement from former Republican mayor and US Senator, and former independent RI Governor, and former Democratic presidential candidate Lincoln Chafee that he has (within the past one year) relocated to Wyoming, registered with the Libertarian Party and promptly threw his hat into the ring for Libertarian Party candidate for president. President of the United States, yes. It's been a diverse and busy political career for Linc so far, and he shows no signs of slowing in 2020.
When local news and talk shows sought out Chairman Pat Ford for his comments, he said, ""Welcome to the Party, Senator!""
He is not running for office himself, but Chairman Pat Ford will be busy this campaign season as well. Starting January 11, LPRI chairman will attend regional conventions as the elected alternate representative of the national committee. Nice way to advance advocacy for local party efforts while working to improve - and have a say - on the national party scene. Stay tuned for updates from or on behalf of the chairman on the newsblog at [[URL REDACTED]]
Actively participate in protecting your freedom - join us! Sign up to attend a public hearing, agree to call or write to elected officials, volunteer to get a local defender elected. Would you serve on a committee to organize events, corral volunteers, help research and track legislation? There are many opportunities to make a difference throughout the year. One of the first and easiest ways to make a difference is become a sustaining member of LPRI. Help support your freedom now.
January Meet-Up is at Murphy's Law in Pawtucket
Come hang out and get to know other libertarians. Join us at our monthly meet-up. A less formal, more social gathering, it's an ongoing opportunity to discuss issues and share ideas, ask questions, and network. Come and go as you please.
