"We're now just four days away from 2020. Let's sprint to the finish line!
Friends,
We're now just four days away from 2020. Let's sprint to the finish line!
Your help in 2019 has been MONUMENTAL in terms of fundraising, as we work to find and elect common sense Republicans and reelect President Donald J. Trump in 2020.
Let's keep it going right up until the ball drops Tuesday at midnight.
Click here and donate and help us KEEP AMERICA GREAT!
An AFP report released Thursday, which tracked the American and international markets, boasted the following pun for a headline:
""Santa rally slays record""
Funny, for sure, but what's happening is no joke -- under President Trump's leadership: ""all of Wall Street's three main indices pushed off record closes and into new intra-day heights.""
News like this is what scares the stockings off the Democrats.
Economic success like this is simply bad news for the Radical Left, especially our all-Democratic Massachusetts Congressional delegation, which voted in lockstep in support of this month's partisan impeachment vote.
Chip in today by clicking here and help us close out 2019 with a bang!

"Friends,
We’re almost there.
The year 2020 is less than 36 hours away, and today our countdown continues. In 2016, Massachusetts delivered for President Trump on primary day. We are confident Massachusetts will deliver again in 2020, but now is not the time to sit back.
You have shown over the last several days that you mean business. If you haven’t already, won’t you chip in today by clicking here so we can ride this momentum into 2020?
DID YOU [[URL REDACTED]] are set to close out 2019 with the lowest American unemployment rate in 50 years? But don’t take our word for it, here’s what CNN’s Phil Mattingly had to say about the state of the American economy under President Trump:
“There are very good reasons the president’s team wants to make this the focus, the economy, and here’s [[URL REDACTED]] unemployment rate at 3.5 percent is the lowest since 1969, that’s a pretty good number to tout.”
If the Democrats could impeach the economy as a means of taking the White House in 2020, they would!
The last time our own U.S. Rep. Seth Moulton tweeted about unemployment was back in May. Why so long ago? Simple. The Democrats simply don’t want to talk about our shared economic successes.
Donate today and help us find and elect great Republicans who can take on the likes of Rep. Moulton and make sure President Trump has the support he needs in the House!

"We are now just three days away from 2020, and the beginning of what should be a triumphant year for Republicans.
Friends,
We are now just three days away from 2020, and the beginning of what should be a triumphant year for Republicans.
Under President Donald J. Trump’s, the year 2019 saw a dramatic rise in wages for the average American worker.
According to the Wall Street Journal, “wages for rank-and-file workers are rising at the quickest pace in more than a decade, even faster than for bosses.”
The 2020 presidential election will be crucial. Chip in today by clicking here to help make sure the Trump economy will roar for another four!
In case you missed it:
In case you missed it, our own U.S. Rep. Katherine Clark recently claimed in a Boston Globe interview that “House Democrats put principals over politics” during their partisan impeachment circus.
It takes a stunning lack of self-awareness to make this claim, as anyone who paid even the slightest amount of attention to the Democrats’ partisan impeachment debacle could see that this was the exact opposite.
Donate today to help us find and elect Republican candidates who can unseat the likes of Rep. Clark.
President Trump’s economy is smashing records and breaking the backs of Democrats like Clark, who think the only way to beat President Trump in 2020 is by holding obstructionist stunts like this recent impeachment circus.

"Friends,
In less than six hours, 2019 will be history.
Let’s honor 2019 by making sure that 2020 is even better. With your help, we can close out 2019 in grand style.
When you donate today through WinRed, you help us not only continue the record-smashing fundraising streak enjoyed by President Donald J. Trump, you also help us find and run great Republican congressional candidates right here in Massachusetts.
You might have heard our own U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren claim today that impeachment is necessary so President Trump “won’t try to cheat his way through yet another election.”
These are the kinds of deranged accusations that Sen. Warren specializes in. The American economy is at its healthiest in recent history. These types of unfounded accusations are all the Democrats have to run on in 2020.
We both know that Sen. Warren has zero chance of occupying the Oval Office in 2021.
We also know that with the right campaign, candidate, and message, Massachusetts voters will dump the likes of Sen. Warren in favor of someone who will actually represent the Commonwealth in Congress.
This kind of change can only happen with your help, so please visit our donation page here and give what you can.
Your contribution will go a long way in terms of helping President Trump serve another four years and helping us recruit and elect the kinds of Massachusetts candidates that can take on Sen. Warren.

"Friends,
We watched House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s interview Sunday so you wouldn’t have to, and -- surprise -- she is still peddling the same debunked Russian conspiracy theory that Democrats have run with to explain Hillary Clinton’s 2016 defeat.
And members of our all-Democrat Massachusetts delegation, such as U.S. Rep. Katherine Clark, continue to parrot whatever Pelosi says.
Had enough? Same here. Please consider donating today by clicking here.
When you donate through WinRed, your donation not only goes towards President Trump’s reelection campaign, but also to our growing federal account which we believe will be crucial to future Massachusetts congressional races.
DONATE TODAY!
Massachusetts Congressional Democrats are following Pelosi’s lead because they have no choice: America is simply too strong and too prosperous under President Trump for them to take back the White House in 2020.
Dragging out this phony impeachment charade is the only play they have left.

"Yes, sadly.
Friends,
How many more Americans needed to die before President Donald J. Trump ordered the precise hit that killed an Iranian general responsible for the deaths of thousands of innocent civilians?
If you’ve been following the reactions of our all-Democratic Massachusetts Congressional delegation, you won’t like their answer. Each member has said in unison that President Trump should have asked for their authorization first.
We all know what would have happened if he had -- one of the world's worst terrorists would still be alive today.
Won’t you chip in by clicking here and help us find and elect Republicans who will SUPPORT President Trump?
When you donate through WinRed, your donation not only goes towards President Trump’s reelection campaign, but also to our growing federal account which we believe will be crucial to future Massachusetts congressional races.
Not a single Massachusetts Democrat objected to any of the hundreds of drone strikes carried out by former President Barack Obama.
Yet after a drone strike executed under President Trump successfully took out Iran’s no. 1 terrorist with zero civilian casualties, Massachusetts Democrats decided to cry foul.
Donate today! Click here and send a message to these Democrats: stop playing political games when our embassies are under attack and Americans are in harm's way!

"Elizabeth Warren is up to the same old tricks!
Friends,
Elizabeth Warren has been up to her old tricks again.
In case you missed it, her latest trick was a throwback to 2012, when she pretended to be a victim of sexism during her campaign against Republican Scott Brown.
This time, she accused Democratic socialist Bernie Sanders of misogyny, and used a hot mic and an assist from a fawning CNN to drill her phony point home.
Can you chip in today to help us send Sen. Warren home?
>> RUSH A SECURE CONTRIBUTION <<
Your urgent donations will help MassGOP recruit candidates and put up a strong fight against candidates like Elizabeth Warren. Can we count on you?
Never forget, before Elizabeth Warren pretended to be a victim of sexism, she pretended to be a minority Native American.
Now, she's pretending to be the next president.
Donate today and give Elizabeth Warren a much-needed dose of realism as we work to Keep America Great

"Friends,
Only two days remain in 2019.
Our countdown to 2020 is almost over, and with your help, we can make sure that President Donald J. Trump spends another four years furthering the trend of employment growth America has enjoyed since his victorious election in 2016.
The dirty little secret among the Democrats is this: they know a plunging unemployment rate weakens their party. They need more government dependence, not less, in order to succeed.
Chip in today by clicking here so we can help reelect President Trump and keep America great!
November’s job gains smashed records, and December’s numbers are certain to keep unemployment at 50-year lows.
So why are Democrats like Massachusetts' own U.S. Rep. Richard Neal trying so desperately to keep this impeachment charade going?
Because they know they have zero shot of reclaiming the White House with an American economy as strong as it has been under President Trump. Impeachment is the only card they have to play, and the Democrats’ desperation is obvious.
Donate today and help us recruit and run common-sense Republican candidates who can beat the likes of Rep. Neal.
Another four years of economic success under President Trump could put the Radical Left out of business, and with your help, we can make it happen!

"""I see the MassGOP Veterans Coalition as a broad coalition of veteran activists and a bullpen for future political candidates.""
Aug. 11, 2020
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT:
Evan Lips, communications director
617-523-5005 ext. 245
WOBURN -- The Massachusetts Republican Party announced on Tuesday the launch of the MassGOP Veterans Coalition, an outreach organization that founder John MacDonald said is geared towards providing Massachusetts veterans with a Republican-based platform.
""As a veterans advocate, for years I have spoken with my fellow veterans who have expressed aggravation with politicians and often misguided policies that effect veterans' benefits,"" said MacDonald. ""This coalition will be a way for those who served to get involved, specifically, a vehicle with which veterans can find and recruit fellow veterans to run for public office.""
S I G N U P H E R E
MacDonald, who served during Operation Desert Storm, added that the coalition ""will be an opportunity for veterans to organize and harness their energies to protect our state and country from the socialist influences of far-left Democrats.""
""Signing up veterans and making themselves known to the MassGOP is the key,"" said MacDonald. ""Organizing ourselves by district and putting ourselves to work to create more opportunities for outreach will be critical to our success.""
Massachusetts Republican Party Chairman Jim Lyons said he's fully endorsed the venture.
""I'm not only looking forward to seeing more Massachusetts veterans get involved with the MassGOP, but what they can create for themselves if provided with the right tools for outreach and organizing,"" said Lyons. ""The MassGOP can be that connection for veterans looking to have a stake in policymaking, looking to have that stake as to what happens in Massachusetts.""
Added MacDonald:
""I see the MassGOP Veterans Coalition as a broad coalition of veteran activists and a bullpen for future political candidates. Sharing information, better communication, producing veteran legislation, fighting against bad legislation and organizing veterans into a coalition will have a profound positive impact of local, state and federal elections.""

Waging a legal fight for the right to compete in 2020
Dear Friends,
The COVID-19 pandemic has made life difficult for all, and the Massachusetts Republican Party has been no exception. Over the past several months, MassGOP staff worked tirelessly to ensure positions for Republicans on the 2020 ballot, but some of the roadblocks that sprung up came not from the virus, but from the Democrats’ apparent insistence on using the emergency conditions as a means of minimizing Republican threats to their power.
Consider the situation that confronted Helen Brady.
Brady, a strong Republican who played by the signature-collecting rules implemented by the Supreme Judicial Court after Beacon Hill Democrats stubbornly refused to address the issue, is challenging entrenched incumbent and career politician, U.S. Rep. Bill Keating.
The vice chairman of the Massachusetts Democratic Party lodged a complaint with the Massachusetts Secretary of State, triggering a state Ballot Law Commission review. Incredibly, the SBLC upheld the complaint.
Once again, just like the effort to amend the signature-collecting process to align with pandemic-related safeguards, we were forced to go to court.
Once again, we won.
I reflected on Helen’s ordeal in an opinion piece that ran in the Boston Herald last month.
Here's the short version: Simply gaining access to the ballot ""required the intervention of the Supreme Judicial Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to stop the Democrat power brokers from thwarting democracy in the 9th Congressional District.""
Fighting these legal battles just to ensure voters have a choice in November has not been cheap. It is with this in mind that a new MassGOP legal fund was created. According to reports, Joe Biden's presidential campaign has hired more than 600 lawyers, and you can bet that the radical Democrats here in Massachusetts will try to litigate away any November outcome here in Massachusetts that they don't like.
Meanwhile, there's much work to be done ahead of the election. As you'll read in this newsletter, we have a slate of reliable conservatives running for Congress, and we have identified winnable state House and Senate districts, all being contested by Republicans.
The 2020 crop of Republicans candidates will give Massachusetts voters a choice -- either Beacon Hill continues to hurl itself down a chute to socialism, or the values of freedom, independence and liberty for all, and American exceptionalism prevail.
What does it say to the future of our commonwealth when immediately following a night of violence, rioting, and looting in downtown Boston, our own Democrat attorney general cheerfully explains it away by exclaiming in remarks, ""yes, America is burning -- but that's how forests grow.""
Earlier this summer, the Democrat-dominated Massachusetts state Senate rammed through during the predawn hour a reform bill intended to harm police, without a single public hearing. Our own Republican State Committeeman Dennis Galvin, a retired Massachusetts State Police major, has shared his thoughts in this newsletter on the equally disastrous House version of this bill, passed late last month.
Meanwhile, the Democrats are also busy eyeing tax increases as a means of correcting the impending state budget shortfall. Increasing the ranks of Republicans in the state Legislature is needed now, more than ever.
The successful reelection of President Donald J. Trump remains a top priority. Despite the cancellation of the 2020 Republican National Convention in Jacksonville, enthusiasm for President Trump among Republicans remains high. The majority of Americans are rightfully concerned about the Democrats' platform of defunding police and encouraging mob rule to dominate the streets of American cities.
The Democrats' current vision involves not only condemning the past, but hijacking the future.
Republicans know this, and the MassGOP stands committed to providing voters with a pro-America alternative. Candidates matter, and the party is defining itself with a blue-collar mentality. Just like in 2016, current polls do not tell the whole story. Ours is the party of jobs, energy independence, strong borders, and the rule of law. Theirs is the party that prefers to police speech instead of crime, thumbs its collective nose at patriotism, and actively encourages mob rule.
When presented with a choice, and Americans will indeed be presented with one in November, they will be choosing between two drastically different futures: one that celebrates and honors America's founding principles, and another undoubtedly ushering in an era of Big Government socialism.
I am confident that Americans will choose the former.
To victory,
Jim Lyons
Chairman, Massachusetts Republican Party
2020 House Congressional Candidates
2nd District﻿
Tracy Lovvorn risked her career in order to fight corruption, waste, fraud and abuse within skilled nursing facilities across the country. She is responsible for the return of hundreds of millions of dollars to Medicare, and the better protecting of many of our most frail and elderly citizens. Tracy is ready to bring this same energy and fight to help end the political extremism in DC that has been tearing our country apart. This is her second bid to unseat entrenched incumbent Democrat U.S. Rep. Jim McGovern. In 2018, as a political outsider, Tracy earned 33% of the vote while being outspent 37-1. Tracy is an unwavering defender of the Constitution and also supports Congressional term limits. Learn more about Tracy by visiting her website here, following her on Twitter here, or checking in with her on Facebook here.
4th District﻿
Julie Hall, who served in the U.S. Air Force for more than three decades, achieving the rank of colonel, has a message for voters: “Just as I served our country for more than 30 years, I am prepared to serve the 4th Congressional District as your next United States Representative.” The former Attleboro city councilor is a staunch believer in America’s founding principles, and counts border security as one of her top priorities. Visit Julie’s website here, follow her on Facebook here, or connect with her on Twitter here.
5th District
Stoneham Selectwoman Caroline Colarusso is someone with a genuine love for community involvement, so stepping up to offer a Republican choice for Congress should come as no surprise. Colarusso “has always given back to the community,” whether it’s serving on the Stoneham Board of Selectmen or coaching youth hockey. The mother of three has already received an endorsement from the National Federation of Independent Businesses. Visit Caroline’s website here, follow her on Twitter here, or interact with her on Facebook here.
6th District
When John Paul Moran founded Grand Opportunity USA, he did so knowing there are more young adults who believe in the power of the individual and personal responsibility than media coverage would lead us to believe. The Billerica-based entrepreneur, author, and activist is a self-described “unconventional candidate” and “opportunity Republican.” John Paul vows to “oppose dictator economics –socialism – and foster a pro-business environment to provide economic opportunity for all.” Visit John Paul’s website here, follow him on Twitter here, or interact with him on Facebook here.
7th District
She may be forced into running a write-in campaign, but underestimate Randolph resident Rayla Campbell at your own peril, because the Democrats have already been forced to take notice of her ability to fight and can-do attitude. Campbell fell just short of reaching the ballot signature threshold, as the COVID-19 pandemic has hit the commonwealth’s sole minority-majority district particularly hard. Yet that hasn’t stopped this mother of three from campaigning up a storm in the Boston area. Visit Rayla’s website here, connect with her on Facebook here, or follow her on Twitter here.
9th District
Weeks into her campaign to oust an entrenched South Coast Democrat, Helen Brady is already battle-tested. Helen had to appeal to the commonwealth’s highest court just to earn her place on the ballot, after Democrats tried to have her disqualified amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Helen prevailed, and showed she’s only just begun to fight. Helen, a mother of four, is a no-nonsense Republican who is “fed up with the radical left agenda” and is more than ready to “give ‘em Helen.” She’s also the business director at the Boston Symphony Orchestra for the Boston Pops. Visit Helen’s website here, follow her on Twitter here, or interact with her on Facebook here.
2020 Senate Congressional Candidates
Kevin O'Connor
Dover-based attorney Kevin O'Connor, a father of four and the son of a journalist and public school teacher, is campaigning on the platform that includes a vow to ""always insist on the fair and impartial application of our Constitute and laws for all, regardless of station in life."" O'Connor, who helped lead the legal fight to adjust ballot signature requirements amid the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, believes that a Congressional delegation that includes a Republican like himself can better advocate across the aisle for local issues. Visit Kevin's website here, follow him on Twitter here, or interact with her on Facebook here.
Dr. Shiva Ayyadurai
Dr. Shiva Ayyadurai, an Indian-American, is an MIT-educated scientist and holds the patent for the creation of email. Dr. Shiva notes that he and his parents ""left the caste system of India in 1970 where we were considered low caste “Untouchables” and “Deplorables."" The scientist from Belmont is a free speech absolutist who isn't shy to express what's on his mind. Visit Dr. Shiva's website here, follow him on Twitter here, or interact with her on Facebook here.
The Massachusetts Republican Senate Primary is scheduled for Sept. 1
Beacon Hill campaign rundown
After a spring spent scrambling to qualify as many Republican candidates as possible for the 2020 ballot, MassGOP Political Director John Milligan said he's feeling confident heading into primary season.
Q: Merely getting Republicans to qualify for the 2020 ballot was a challenge. Can you tell us what some of the biggest hurdles were, and how we managed to work with the Secretary of State's office to establish a workable way to safely secure ballot signatures?
JM: Obviously collecting signatures in the middle of a pandemic is not easy. The first thing we did was work with the secretary of state's office to allow us to resize the signature sheets so people could print them in their own homes. Republican State Committeeman John Miller helped us with this effort, producing PDFs for candidates up and down the ballot. The next major win came with the Supreme Judicial Court ruling allowing electronic collection of signatures. We were then able to use peer-to-peer texting, power dialer software, and emails to help our candidates make the 2020 ballot.
Q: How many Republicans are challenging Democrats in 2020?
JM: We currently have 30 Republicans challenging incumbent Democrats in the state Legislature, including three competitive GOP Primaries. At the Federal level, we have a U.S. Senate primary and GOP challengers in six out of our nine congressional districts.
Q: What do you see as our greatest strength in 2020? Our greatest weakness?
JM: Our greatest strength is that polling consistently shows conservative voters want to come out and vote on election day despite the current climate. This however is a double-edged sword. Mail in voting is here to stay and we need to make sure we can compete with the Democrats.
Q: It's daunting to knock on doors during a health pandemic. What has been the response like so far for those who are door-knocking?
JM: Chairman Lyons and I have been crisscrossing the state, meeting with candidates and spending afternoons ""on the bells,"" as Jim would say. I have yet to experience any push back because of the virus and our candidates are receiving tremendous responses. Knocking in a mask isn't always fun, especially in the recent weather, but our candidates are getting it done.
Eleven MassGOP candidates to watch
These 11 state Republican House candidates -- 10 upstarts and one incumbent -- is a group to watch for this fall. Each have stood out in their own way during the 2020 campaign season. Between racking up high door-knocking counts, amplifying a pro-Republican message, and finding ways to work around the new COVID-19 rules, this group stands to help usher in a new era of Republicans serving on Beacon Hill.
Tatyana Semyrog, making her first run for state representative, is competing in the winnable 6th Plymouth House District. Tatyana, a refugee and mother of three from the former Soviety Union, is a natural workhorse who has already overcome more adversity than most of us will see in a lifetime.
Tatyana writes: ""Coming to America was the greatest gift for me. The freedom this country gives is a miracle. Sadly, it’s being chipped away. I'm greatly concerned by what I'm seeing happening to our beloved country. Freedom is so easy to lose and is nearly impossible to get back, as is evident in my former homeland.""
Alec DiFruscia of Tewksbury launched his campaign last fall with his sights set on knocking off a first-termer in the 19th Middlesex District, a region that has long opposed the sort of radical left-wing leadership now popular among entrenched Beacon Hill Democrats.
Alec writes: ""I’m not a career politician. I’ve worked in the private sector my whole life, so I feel the pain of endless taxes, too much regulation, and the impact of bad politics on our community. But I've always been a fighter. Now, I want to give back to the community that made me who I am. I will never vote for a tax increase, I can promise that now.""
Summer Schmaling, making her second run after a solid 2018 showing, is the chairman of the Halifax School Committee. She has knocked on more than 4,200 doors in the 12th Plymouth House District.
Summer writes: “I’ve received a great deal of support and encouragement from voters to run for State Representative. The voters tell me taxes are too high and they want transparency on how their State Representative votes in Boston - these votes affect their families, jobs, and businesses.”
Bob May, whose “MayDay” team is responsible for amplifying a popular Republican message in his hometown of Peabody, is running for an open seat. May, a businessman, is primed to become the first Republican in more than 40 years to represent the 13th Essex House District.
Bob writes: ""I see an opportunity to provide the business experience that is desperately needed on Beacon Hill. I want to apply the same common sense principles of business to the fiscal challenges facing the Commonwealth. I will be the leader you can count on to push back on the radical left-wing proposals that are gaining traction in the Legislature.""
Gardner resident Bruce Chester \-- retired Army National Guard captain, Operation Iraqi Freedom veteran, teacher, author. Bruce has been making a name for himself in the 2nd Worcester House District, and counts full police funding as part of his platform.
Bruce writes: ""I come from a proud family that has been a part of Central Massachusetts for generations. I've been a military leader and now I want to bring that leadership to my district. We need to not only improve the economy of the area but we must preserve the individual liberties that our military has sacrificed so much to maintain.""
Susan Smiley, running for the open 12th Worcester House District seat, has been involved in her hometown of Lancaster for years, having served on the Board of Selectmen. The Republican State Committeewoman was sworn-in last month to serve on the Lancaster Finance Committee.
Susan writes:
""Yes, I am Republican and my core principles reflect sound fiscal responsibility, understanding that we are a society of free individuals and that no one should be excluded from the opportunity to pursue their own economic success. Each individual and their contributions deserve fair and accountable government representation, with NO special treatment. I am a person who believes the rules should be the same for all and we are all equal.""
James ""Chip"" Harrington, of Ludlow, has been making the most of his campaign to win the open 7th Hampshire District House seat. Chip is a father of two and has carved out a rewarding career in corrections and law enforcement and currently serves on the Ludlow School Committee.
Chip writes: ""My love of this region and building community with others is what I am all about. From founding the Ludlow Football Association, to spearheading the effort to create the solar farm on the former Ludlow Landfill, to successfully advocating for all-day Kindergarten in my town, I am about building community and consensus to assure our people and our families succeed.""
Retired Army combat pilot Ingrid Centurion of Sudbury, the daughter of an Argentinian father and a Puerto Rican mother, has 22 years of active service under her belt. She has a deep love for her country and is determined to bring strong Republican leadership to the 13th Middlesex House District.
Ingrid writes: ""I have seen no sacrifice from the legislature like the private sector is experiencing. It is business as usual when it comes to government paychecks. As the next State Representative, I will be a forward thinking Representative -- not a go-along-to-get-along bench warmer.""
Frank Collins, a former U.S. Marine from Braintree, has helped organize rallies to ""Back the Blue"" in the Fifth Norfolk House District, and believes that Massachusetts men and women serving in law enforcement deserve our support, now more than ever.
Frank writes: ""These brave men and women go to work everyday to keep our communities safe. As your State Representative I will always back our law enforcement and will oppose efforts to hastily 'reform' our police with a bad bill that will make our streets less safe and put our officers lives in danger.""
Evan Gendreau of Westport, currently a research assistant at the Public Policy Center at UMass-Dartmouth, may be younger than most candidates but he sees that as an advantage. He has been busy making a name for himself in the Eighth Bristol House District. A native of Fall River, Evan believes there is a growing demand on the South Coast for common sense Republican leadership.
Gendreau writes: ""I am committed to listening to the concerns of people throughout the district, including teachers, law enforcement, business owners, and other members of the community. I will be a strong voice for Westport, Fall River, New Bedford, and Freetown.""
Rep. Nick Boldyga, who drew a surprise primary opponent, has proven himself to be one of the most reliable Republican voices on Beacon Hill. Rep. Boldyga deserves all of our help in 2020 as a show of our gratitude for his established conservative track record representing the 3rd Hampden House District.
Nick writes: ""Representing Agawam, Granville, and Southwick has been a privilege, and I love this job. I have a proven track record of putting people before politics. I've voted against misguided police reform legislation, and am a guaranteed vote against any and all tax increases. I am very proud to represent the citizens of our district at the State House and work on the issues that are crucial to our commonwealth.""
Expect to receive additional candidate briefs ahead of the Nov.3 general election, as we continue to identify and recognize candidates whose campaign work -- win or lose -- continues to inspire us all. The full roster of candidates and links to their social media/campaign websites continues below.

FAKE POLICE REFORM
Will Boston Become Portland or Seattle?
By Dennis Galvin
(*Editor's note -- this column was written as the Massachusetts police reform package was in the process of advancing into conference committee, where it currently remains as of Aug. 12*)
Recent legislation passed by the Massachusetts House of Representative (H4860) is an attack on the police in the commonwealth, not an effort to reform them. The legislative process was flawed from the start reflecting the most blatant political opportunism yet seen by an overwhelmingly left-wing Massachusetts state Legislature. The aim of this legislation was never to improve the accountability and quality of policing -- it was instead to restrict legitimate police action and thwart sensible and informed efforts to improve it by burying them under layers of political bureaucracy.
The political intent of this legislation became apparent in the process used to bring this bill forward. Despite the fact that police reform efforts had been pending in the legislature for years, a crisis in another state (the death of George Floyd in Minnesota) was used to trigger a feigned crisis in Massachusetts. No public hearings were called and the parties with the most at stake, most prominently the average, peace loving taxpayer, were excluded from having input.
The House bill creates the Massachusetts Police Standards and Training Commission, which will have overarching authority to establish training procedures and establish qualifications for police officer certification. It will have the authority to revoke and suspend certifications for individual police officers based on cause, prohibiting them from working temporarily or permanently in the state. These policies are not new ideas, they have been long advocated by police reformers, many of whom were current and former police officers, yet they languished for years on Beacon Hill.
Additionally, reformers strongly advocated that the Commission be staffed by trained, knowledgeable law enforcement professionals. However, politics overruled professionalism, those with police experience are banned by this bill from appointment, so those completely unfamiliar with the police service will be evaluating performance and prescribing rules for training and conduct.
Appointments will be political, made by the governor and attorney general. Neither Gov. Charlie Baker nor Attorney General Maura Healy can boast an overly impressive record of rooting out corruption. Consider their response to the State Police scandals both reacting with inaction and obfuscation.
Meanwhile, the most significant impact will be felt on the streets.
The bill will place significant restrictions on police use of force. Officers will only be allowed to use force to prevent “imminent harm”. In every case, they will be forced to justify, why de-escalation techniques either didn’t work or were inappropriate, leaving them open to a slew of legal action by opportunistic attorneys.
It also appears that police officers can no longer conduct protective “pat downs” of suspects, who may be about to commit crimes, an action previously affirmed by the US Supreme Court in Terry v. Ohio. This provision will create a “chilling effect” among officers, causing them to hesitate in situations where they would otherwise have acted to prevent a crime.
The bottom line is the House police reform bill is a product of a radical Democrat state Legislature that has taken over Massachusetts.
To leftists, the police are nothing more than props in their theater of the politically absurd. They have no interest in building a professional force capable of consistently operating in a safe, effective and constitutional manner.
Their intent is to set the police up for continual failure, and in so doing jeopardize the lives of not only conscientious police officers, but the innocent people, who depend upon them, as well.
When Antifa comes to town and riots, kicking and punching grandma and grandpa trying to get to Walgreen’s for their meds, if the police stand and watch, like they did in Portland and Seattle, the Police Reform Bill of 2020 will be the reason why.

MassGOP Leadership Update
Aug. 3 election update
With the Aug. 3 meeting of the Massachusetts Republican State Committee in the books, here is the current leadership roster.
Chairman: Jim Lyons
National Committeeman: Ron Kaufman
National Committeewoman: Janet Fogarty
Vice Chairman: Tom Mountain
Treasurer: Patrick Crowley
Secretary: KathyJo Boss
Assistant Treasurer: Anthony Ventresca
Assistant Secretary: Lindsay Valanzola
Commentary from State Committeeman Dr. Jay Fleitman
(Note: This piece originally ran in the Aug. 3 edition of the Hampshire Gazette)
Three new video clips of Joe Biden surfaced on television news this week.
In one of them, he was talking to three interviewers when he related a recent medical encounter he had in which a nurse leaned over and whispered in his ear that if anything medically serious would happen to him, that she could breathe up through his nose and bring him back to health.
He found this to be amazing. I found this to be shocking. It is not clear what this medical encounter was about, it is not clear that it even happened, but it was clearly bizarre.
The other two clips that I also saw on television was one of a recent speech in which he clearly did not know where he was, and another in which he was answering a question about the 2020 census, and in his answer he added the qualification that it happened two or three years ago.
These are not lovable Joe Biden gaffes. I have been involved in patient care for over 40 years, and have no doubt that these are signs of significant cognitive defects. I don’t know if Joe Biden has Alzheimer’s disease, but he clearly has a degenerative neurological disorder in which dementia is a part. If Biden, who turns 78 on Nov. 20, is elected he will be the oldest president to win the office, and older than Ronald Reagan was when he left the presidency just before he turned 78. Donald Trump, who was the oldest person to assume the presidency at age 70 in 2016, turned 74 in June. This is not necessarily purely an age-related issue, but Biden appears not to be aging well. And Democrats know this.
So far the Biden campaign is one in absentia.
It is a hidden campaign, in which he has been kept mostly hidden from view, never answering questions at press conferences, and otherwise only making public statements that are funneled through his campaign team. After all, the campaign has problems with Biden statements like his recent claim that 120 million Americans have died of COVID.
The Democrat on the street knows this as well, though no one wants to name it. I have overheard several conversations in which people who clearly support the Biden campaign expressed the hope that he stays out of public, does little speaking, does not engage in any debates, and that they are sure that the Democrats will surround a prospective President Biden with a well-functioning team if he wins.
Biden, of course, cannot be replaced on the ticket. He won the nomination in the primaries, and if he were to be removed, Bernie Sanders supporters would demand that their man has the rightful claim to the candidacy.
Electing a medically precarious president has precedence.
Franklin Roosevelt ran for a fourth term in 1944, and everyone around him knew he was dying. He ran again, and the Democratic Party ran him again, even though it was clear he did not have long to live. He was sworn in in January 1945, and died in April 1945.
He selected Harry Truman as his running mate for vice president, not with the thought that he would make for a good president when Roosevelt died, but only out of consideration that he did not damage the ticket’s chance of winning. The Democrats had to win, and the well-being of the country came second. The country was lucky that Truman turned out to be a very good president.
The parallels to the Biden campaign are clear, and we are awaiting his choice for a vice presidential running mate. I hope his team is looking for someone who will be a competent chief executive to take over if Biden becomes untenable in the position. It seems that the search has other criteria.
Whoever is making this decision seems to have restricted the choice to “women of color.”
This is intended at this fractious time to ensure that minorities are included in the nation’s power structure, but it in fact excludes from consideration other available candidates of different ethnicities and gender at a time when the presidential candidate himself is likely impaired.
Maybe I am all wrong, and we will see a sharp Joe Biden in the debates. The Democratic leaning press and media often raise questions of Trump’s competency to be president. He is characterized as being narcissistic, blustery, erratic, and unintelligent or uninterested. It is impossible to be outside the White House and Trump’s personal orbit to know what if any of this is true.
So please don’t get me wrong, I’m not giving my side a pass on questionable behavior, but I am asking Democrats not to turn a blind eye to what is in plain sight about Joe Biden for president.
The Massachusetts Republican Party is proud to announce the launch of a new coalition devoted to amplifying the voices of Republican veterans.
In the Q&A below, John MacDonald, an Air Force veteran who served during the Operation Desert Storm, answers several questions regarding the purpose of the coalition and details on its founding.
Q: This idea of yours -- to offer Massachusetts veterans a MassGOP-backed coalition, essentially a vehicle to advocate for candidates they believe will fight to improve the policies that affect them most -- was there anything in particular that prompted you to come up with this?
A: As a veterans advocate, for years I have spoken with my fellow veterans who have expressed aggravation with politicians and often misguided policies that effect veterans benefits. “Those who don’t serve, don’t know. Sometimes those who don’t know… don’t care.” Those veterans that have served our country abroad, most often recognize the stark difference between the United States of America, its values and moral compass, versus many… many other places in the world that do not offer the same freedoms or values, which we have fought to preserve here in the United States. Veterans took an oath to protect the country and the constitution. Fighting for candidates and elected officials that believe in our state and country is a natural for veterans. Harnessing the power of our mutual bond seems like a natural fit with the MassGOP. Coming together and finding an outlet to express this I believe will be a valuable resource for the MassGOP, the commonwealth and country.
Q: You served during the first Gulf War. After you returned to civilian life, when did you start getting involved politically?
A: I have been paying attention to politics most of my life. Serving my country affirmed my belief in our country. I saw many of the failed policies of the Clinton Administration related to the military adversely affect people I served with by way of base closures and force reductions. Locally I became active, volunteering to help local city council candidates when I purchased my first home in 1998. I became politically active with national politics in the 2000 Presidential election. I had volunteered for the McCain 2000 campaign and then the George W. Bush campaign. That’s where it all began.
What are some of the greatest challenges facing veterans in 2020 and beyond?
Protecting and preserving the benefits already promised to our veterans is number one. Finding effective treatments and hopefully a cure for PTSD, while reducing veteran suicide is number 1A. Making sure the country remains committed to the constitution and remains free of socialism and communism is another high priority.
This project is in its infancy, but what do you see as crucial to getting it up and running?
Awareness of the opportunity is critical for veterans. Communication has always been one of the biggest problems for the veteran community in general. Creating this coalition is an opportunity for veterans to organize and harness their energies to protect our state and country from radical progressive Democrats. Signing up and making themselves know to the MassGOP is the key, then organizing ourselves by district and putting those resources to work will be key. Action, less talk… and fast.
Do you think American Legions and other brick-and-mortar type establishments are becoming outdated?
Veterans clubs are seeing dwindling memberships and have been for years. They have their own challenges, which they need to resolve. COVID 19 will cause many clubs to remain closed permanently. These clubs have value, but they need to find ways to remain relevant and accessible to younger veterans. The MassGOP Veterans Coalition might be able to brainstorm on this and come up with actionable ideas.
As best as you can describe -- what’s your vision for this new organization? Where do you see it five years from today?
I see the MassGOP as a broad coalition of veteran activists and a bullpen for future political candidates. Sharing information, better communication, producing veteran legislation, fighting against bad legislation and organizing veterans into a coalition will have a profound positive impact of local, state and federal elections.
What can people do to get involved? (Talk about how we are setting up a Facebook page, how people can expect a press release within the coming weeks providing links to the Facebook page and a Twitter account to follow that we’ll set up.)
They can get involved by signing up for the Veterans Coalition through the MassGOP portal here. Spreading the word to their fellow veterans will be key. I will encourage all interested veterans to share the information via social media.
Republican activity around the Commonwealth
""Back the Blue"" rallies, candidate events, and more
On Aug. 9, the Westford Republican Town Committee held its ""Back the Blue"" rally to celebrate local law enforcement, an event Westford resident and Republican State Committeewoman Kathy Lynch said drew hundreds of cheering supporters.
""It's time for people to stand up for their country,"" Lynch wrote on Facebook. ""Defend all those who take an oath to follow the Constitution!""
The Billerica Republican Town Committee and Republican State Committeeman Anthony Ventresca helped promote and host a campaign fundraiser on Aug. 6 for Congressional candidate John Paul Moran.
Recently elected Massachusetts Republican Party Vice Chairman Tom Mountain reports that the MA Trump Campaign event in Wellesley was a success:
""We managed to keep our numbers under 100 at the home of MA RNC Delegate Ginny Greiman, with State Committee Members, 2020 Delegates, and even a makeshift reunion of 2016 Delegates, all joined together to support the re-election of our President. MA Trump Campaign Chair Sheriff Tom Hodgson, National Committeewoman Janet Fogarty, State Committeewomen Patricia Saint Aubin and Amy Carnevale and yours truly welcomed our Republican crowd that included Senate Candidate Kevin O’Connor, Congressional Candidates John Paul Moran, Julie Hall, Tracy Lovvron, and State Rep Candidates Ingrid Centurion and Frank Collins, along with State Committee Members Nathan Bech, Susan Huffman, Evelyn Curley, Paul Ronkaitus, and Steve Fruzzetti. All in all, a great time was had by all!""
The East Bridgewater Republican Town Committee writes on Facebook: ""We'd like to thank the residents of East Bridgewater for the out pouring of support over the last few weeks. We aren't charging for these signs, but many folks have donated to the committee to offset the cost, and we appreciate that. Money raised will go back to local Republican candidates this fall.""
The Orange Republican Town Committee recently shared Republican state Rep. candidate Ingrid Centurion's letter calling on Gov. Charlie Baker to veto police reform legislation:
Dear Governor Baker,
I am writing to encourage you to veto the Police Reform bill that is now in conference committee.
Being multicultural, I understand the anger of the minority community concerning the death of George Floyd at the hands of a police officer. It should have never happened. I am pleased that police officer is now being held accountable by our judicial system.
However, our Massachusetts police force did not cause the death of George Floyd. Unfortunately, they have been lumped into this anger and are being treated like they are racists just because they wear a blue uniform. That’s wrong.
While every agency is far from perfect and can use reform from time to time, the Police Reform bill goes way too far. By removing qualified immunity, the state would be penalizing good officers. The ultimate result will be massive retirements as we have seen in New York. Recruitment of new officers will be non-existent. Our public safety will be jeopardized if this bill becomes law.
As a mother of two boys and as a daughter who cares for an elderly mother, I want someone to be there when I call 911. I hope that you will veto the bill and support public safety for the Commonwealth.
Thank you for your attention to this matter.
Sincerely,
Ingrid Centurion

"Inmates correctly predicted Democrats would have their backs
Bristol County jail incident has Democrats salivating, launching multiple investigations
May 6, 2020
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT:
Evan Lips, communications director
617-523-5005 ext. 245
WOBURN -- Massachusetts Republican Party Chairman Jim Lyons weighed in Wednesday on a Bristol County jailhouse riot allegedly sparked by illegal alien inmates refusing COVID-19 testing, after Bristol County Sheriff Thomas Hodgson quickly became the target in several announced investigations.
“On one hand, you have our Democrat Attorney General Maura Healey, who cannot resist an opportunity to use her office to go after anyone and anything remotely connected to President Donald Trump,” said Lyons. “And on the other hand, you have the Democrat-dominated Massachusetts state Senate Post Audit and Oversight Committee, also announcing an investigation.”
“It’s clear to me that both investigations are driven by Democrats with a political agenda, who are salivating over the opportunity to go after someone like Sheriff Hodgson for enforcing the very laws enacted by Congress.”
Lyons pointed out that Healey’s office has previously called for Massachusetts U.S. District Attorney Andrew Lelling for daring to prosecute a Newton District Court judge for helping an illegal alien facing drug charges evade immigration officials.
Healey submitted a brief on behalf of the state last September claiming the charges “represent an extraordinary and unwarranted attack on the independence and integrity of our courts.”
Meanwhile, a chorus of federal lawmakers, led in part by Massachusetts U.S. representatives Ayanna Pressley and Joseph Kennedy III, have also demanded investigations.
“What all of these demands for investigations have in common is that they have been made by Democrats who obviously have it in for Sheriff Hodgson,” Lyons said. “It’s all too telling that when a group of inmates runs amok and causes $25,000 worth of damages, while putting everyone in that situation in danger, the radical Democrats’ reflexive impulse is to go after Sheriff Hodgson.
“It’s also telling that when a Salem District Court judge actively put people’s lives in danger by releasing a parade of dangerous felons, one of whom went on to murder a cop in Maine, the same Senate Post Audit and Oversight Committee was nowhere to be seen.”
Added Lyons:
“These actions were committed by illegal immigrants inside a prison who refused to cooperate during a public health emergency, deciding instead to destroy the place and try to trigger a riot, and the knee-jerk reaction from the Democrats is to investigate Sheriff Hodgson.”

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Evan Lips, communications director
617-523-5005 ext. 245
WOBURN -- From Gloucester to Cape Cod, from North Andover to West Springfield, Massachusetts Republicans honored one of the most solemn anniversaries in America’s storied history with scores of standouts to remember, honor, and cheer the first responder community.
State Committeewoman Amanda Kesterson led Friday morning’s standout in her hometown of Gloucester and said the rallies gave people the opportunity to ""honor the memory of all the first responders who bravely entered those burning towers in New York City on 9/11, the hundreds upon hundreds of first responders who gave their lives to protect other Americans.""
""In addition, at a time our country is under siege by the radical Left, it is another opportunity to show our gratitude and recognize the sacrifices that our police officers make on a daily basis,"" Kesterson said. ""We wanted to express their gratitude towards police officers at a time when men and women serving in law enforcement are under political attack.
“That’s what today is about.”
Kesterson added that about 40 similar rallies took place in various cities and towns across the commonwealth, all kicking off at various intervals shortly after 8:30 a.m., 19 years to the minute after hijacked airplanes struck both towers at New York City’s World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and the ground in western Pennsylvania.
In Andover, Republican Evelyn Curley said the response was ""incredible,"" and noted that GOP U.S. Senate nominee Kevin O'Connor participated in the rally. (see photo above)
""I never heard so many beeps in my life, and I'm a veteran sign-holder,"" she said. ""At times, the sound was deafening.""
Cape Cod Republican Adam Lange helped lead a standout at the rotary outside Barnstable Municipal Airport in Hyannis.
“The response from people driving past was overwhelmingly positive,” Lange said. “We had four written remarks about five minutes each, about the particular hijackings, and tragic crash of Flight 93 in Pennsylvania.
“We timed the readings to coincide with the anniversary of each hijacking, rang a bell, and made sure to mention any ties to Massachusetts, whether it was a fighter jet scrambled out of Mashpee or the loss of a loved one.”
In North Andover, retired police officer Dave Rand sat in a folding chair and held a sign of support while nearby, North Andover Republican Town Committee member C.J. Gangi stood on the Town Common with about 50 others.
Gangi said the honks of support showed there is more support for law enforcement than media reports convey.
“People have been overwhelmingly supportive, but it’s this kind of quiet but steady support that doesn’t exactly show up on the nightly national newscasts,” Gangi noted.
Kesterson said to expect more standouts statewide over the weekend.
“The message we keep hearing is to defund the police, to take away their protections, and we’re here to offer a counter-message -- we support those who are willing to risk their lives each day to protect us, and we’re proud to show it,” Kesterson said.

"Democrats intent on ""disarming police,"" stand in solidarity with same movement that spawned ambush cop shooting in California
Sept. 17, 2020
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT:
Evan Lips, communications director
617-523-5005 ext. 245
WOBURN -- Massachusetts Republican Party Chairman Jim Lyons said Wednesday that a photo showing Democrat Jake Oliveira, currently competing with Republican James “Chip” Harrington for the 7th Hampden District (Belchertown, Chicopee, Ludlow, Springfield) House seat, taking a knee and raising a fist during an anti-police demonstration “shows exactly where the Democratic Party is headed.”
“This individual is absolutely what the Democratic Party has become,” Lyons added about Oliveira. “Their top priority involves pandering to and taking their cues from the same far-left mobs that are rioting, looting, and trying to burn down American cities.”
Meanwhile, earlier this week, Massachusetts Democratic U.S. Sen. Ed Markey issued a formal call to “disarm every police department in America.”
Lyons said it is important for 7th Hampden District voters to know exactly where candidates stand regarding law enforcement.
“We discovered this photo of Chip’s opponent, Democrat Jake Oliveira, pledging his support for the far-left mob just days after the country saw the horrific video of the attempted assasination of two Los Angeles County Sheriff’s deputies,” Lyons said. “Democrats like Mr. Oliveira will never speak out against the violence that has gripped their so-called movement to defund our police departments, but they’ll happily take a knee and raise a fist in solidarity.”
Lyons added that Oliveira’s campaign has yet to respond Harrington’s request last week to hold a series of debates.
“The public deserves an answer as to why Oliveira believes this movement to defund police departments is good for our communities,” said Lyons. “The entire MassGOP ticket stands with law enforcement, and voters should be aware of that fact when they head to the polls in November.""

"Helen Brady to challenge Rep. Bill Keating
MassDems fail in scheme to keep Republican Helen Brady off of election ballot
July 13, 2020
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT:
Evan Lips, communications director
617-523-5005 ext. 245
WOBURN -- Republican Helen Brady has prevailed in her fight against a Massachusetts Democratic Party scheme to prevent a strong conservative female voice from challenging entrenched U.S. Rep. Bill Keating this fall.
“Here you had the vice chairman of the Massachusetts Democratic Party lodging a formal complaint during a health pandemic to try and keep a woman off of an election ballot,” Brady said, referencing Leon Brathwaite, who filed the original objection. “The Democrats had a problem with a woman utilizing technology to collect electronic signatures, and most of all they had a problem with a woman daring to challenge a member of their old boy’s club and one of their Washington insiders.
Keating was first elected to the state Legislature in 1976, before being elected to Congress in 2010.
Massachusetts Republican Party Chairman Jim Lyons also called the state Supreme Judicial Court’s ruling striking down the state Ballot Law Commission’s decision knocking Brady off the general election ballot “a win for anyone who has ever challenged Massachusetts’ one-party political rule.”
“The SBLC’s commissioners, almost all of them activist Democrats masquerading as objective arbiters, have been exposed,” Lyons said. “At the very least, these commissioners should be middle-of-the-road.
“Helen Brady is a strong conservative woman who played by the rules to qualify for the general election ballot, so naturally the radical Democrats tried to pull off as many partisan schemes as possible to keep her from challenging the status quo. But they underestimated Helen’s determination.”
A glance at the history of political donations made by the majority of current SBLC commissioners reveals an alarming pattern of bias.
Within the last decade, state campaign finance records show Commissioner Sarah Herlihy has donated more than $2,000 exclusively to Democratic candidates. Commissioner Peggy Ho has a similar record, having donated to the campaigns of Democrats including current Suffolk County District Attorney Rachael Rollins and Boston City Councilor Michelle Wu, not to mention $1,000 to U.S. Rep. Katherine Clark and more than $500 to Democrat Hillary Clinton’s failed presidential campaign.
Commissioner Jennifer Chunias donated $1,000 to Rollins in 2018 in addition to other Democrats.
Lyons also noted that Commissioner Brian Merrick, a retired Orleans District Court judge who now serves as the chairman of the SBLC, has published op-eds and written amicus briefs opposing the federal charges lodged against Newton District Court Judge Shelley Joseph for coaching an illegal immigrant facing drug charges on how to evade federal authorities assigned to detain him.
Additionally, the state in 2012 reprimanded Merrick “for repeatedly engaging in conduct while sitting in Orleans District Court that failed to follow well-established procedural requirements” related to adjudicating motor vehicle law infractions.
“There’s a one-party system dominating this state that is growing more rotten with each passing day,” Lyons said. “We need more strong Republican women like Helen who will stand up and say they’re not going to take it anymore.”
Said Brady:
“This is not only a victory for my candidacy, but for every registered voter in Massachusetts who signed my nomination papers.
“The fact that the Massachusetts Democratic Party and Rep. Keating would stoop so low as to challenge my signatures is indicative of how threatened they feel of my candidacy. This was a blatantly partisan scheme that only further exposes the danger of having one-party rule.”

"AG Healey, where are you?
Rep. Robertson blames COVID-19, his treasurer, and the MassGOP for failing to follow to campaign spending reporting laws
Oct. 19, 2020
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT: Evan Lips, communications director
617-523-5005 ext. 245
WOBURN -- Massachusetts Republican Party Chairman Jim Lyons responded Monday to state Rep. David Robertson’s excuses after the MassGOP caught on to the Tewksbury lawmaker’s failure to report a single campaign expenditure other than recurring $3 bank fees since last April.
Robertson issued a statement over the weekend blaming the episode on a “forced Republican narrative regarding so-called ‘transparency’” while also blaming his campaign treasurer and the COVID-19 virus, despite the passage last year of a law establishing a new campaign depository system that requires more frequent spending disclosures.
Robertson voted in favor of the bill, which was later signed into law by Gov. Charlie Baker and championed by Democrats as “reflect(ing) the state's commitment to innovation and transparency in our elections,” less than a year ago.
“Rep Robertson has spent plenty of money on ads promoting himself yet you won’t find that anywhere in filings submitted to the state Office of Campaign and Political Finance,” said Lyons. “So instead of taking any responsibility, he not only blames his treasurer, but also the COVID-19 pandemic and us for getting caught.”
“This is a symptom of the Democrats’ one-party grip on Beacon Hill, where they act as if their own rules don’t apply to them.”
Robertson’s challenger, Republican Alec DiFruscia, has managed to maintain detailed expenditure reports throughout the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Lyons also questioned whether the state’s top law enforcement official, Attorney General Maura Healey, is even aware of Robertson’s malfeasance.
“Maybe if our AG wasn’t so busy using her own office as an extension of the Democratic National Committee, she’d be able to catch fraud like Robertson’s here in Massachusetts,” Lyons said. “Maura Healey, where are you? Oh, right, you’re filing another lawsuit against President Trump.”

"Of course they can
91 Massachusetts economists can't all be wrong, can they? If it's about your money, of course they can.
May 29, 2020
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT:
Evan Lips, communications director
617-523-5005 ext. 245
WOBURN -- Massachusetts Republican Party Chairman Jim Lyons on Friday slammed a letter signed by “91 Massachusetts economists” calling for new taxes to cover the anticipated state budget shortfall created by the mass-shutdown of commonwealth businesses in response to the COVID-19 virus.
“The answer from these economists, every one of them ensconced in the luxury of tenured positions in academia, who work at the beck and call of Beacon Hill Democrats, is never to trim away any wasteful government fat,” said Lyons. “Their answer is somehow always, ‘here’s a crisis that can be taken advantage of, here’s an opportunity where we can justify the Democrats’ appetite for spending more of the taxpayer’s hard-earned dollars.’
“Incredibly, these economists are calling for an income tax increase at the absolute worst possible time, when mandated business shutdowns have people struggling to make any income at all.”
Lyons also offered the 91 economists a reminder regarding their claim that the proposed tax hikes “could be phased back as the economy returns to its pre-recession level.”
“When Massachusetts voters chose to roll back the state income tax to 5 percent in 2000, it took nearly 20 years for the Democrats controlling Beacon Hill to comply,” Lyons said. “Their appetite for other people’s money is insatiable.”

"Say no to TCI
March 10, 2020
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT:
Evan Lips, communications director
617-523-5005 ext. 245
WOBURN -- Whacking commuters’ wallets at the gas pump, this time as part of the so-called Transportation and Climate Initiative, will be opposed at every turn by the Massachusetts Republican Party, Chairman Jim Lyons announced Tuesday.
“As a legislator, I opposed all efforts to increase taxes, and as a party, it is time for Republicans to stand up and loudly say ‘no’ to these regressive proposals,” Lyons said. “All schemes to hit up hardworking Massachusetts taxpayers for more money will be met with opposition from the MassGOP.”
Lyons issued his comments days after Beacon Hill House Democrats, under the direction of Speaker Robert DeLeo, voted to increase the gas tax by five cents (20 percent) and the diesel tax by nine cents (38 percent).
On Tuesday, a new study revealed that the TCI proposal will likely raise the gas tax by 26 cents, while other elements of the proposal’s carbon reduction plan could cost the state 9,600 private sector jobs in the first year alone, while burdening the average Massachusetts household with an added $738 annual expense.
“We’ve seen time and time again under President Donald Trump the economic benefits of reducing regulations and cutting taxes,” Lyons said, pointing out that last month’s employment report saw more than 273,000 new jobs created nationally. “We’ve also seen time and time again the amount of bad government spending in Massachusetts, where tax dollars are wasted on paying for more and more bureaucracy and less results.
“It’s time to say no to TCI.”

"Massachusetts Republican Party calls on Gov. Baker to resist Democrats' demands to close the state
May 27, 2020
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT:
Evan Lips, communications director
617-523-5005 ext. 245
WOBURN -- The Massachusetts Republican State Committee, along with hundreds of members of the Massachusetts Republican Party, is urging Gov. Charlie Baker to unequivocally resist calls from the Democrats to reverse course and put the commonwealth’s economy back on lockdown.
In a letter submitted to the governor, co-signed by hundreds of Massachusetts Republicans, MassGOP Chairman Jim Lyons wrote that the commonwealth’s business owners “realize the importance of maintaining a hygienic environment -- if the public does not trust them and their products, no amount of government intervention will keep them afloat.”
Lyons said Wednesday he’s encouraged by the positive feedback his letter has received.
“Republicans are working to fight the virus and open the state at the same time,” Lyons said. “We know it can be done safely, and at the same time we know arguably the biggest reason why the Democrats want to keep us locked down.
“The prolonged stifling of independence and personal responsibility creates a dream scenario for the Democrats -- a world dependent upon the state and an endless expansion of government bureaucracy.”
Added Lyons:
“The solution is never more government. Americans, especially here in Massachusetts, have been busy fighting the spread of this deadly virus, and are more than capable of continuing to do so while at the same time reopening our economy.”
Link to Press Release/Signatures
May 26, 2020
Dear Governor Baker,
You’ve no doubt noticed how prominent Massachusetts Democrats have been quick to criticize any and all efforts to allow the reopening of the Commonwealth’s businesses.
U.S. Rep. Ayanna Pressley recently took to social media to claim that “policy decisions that offer a false choice between public health (and) economic recovery will hurt our communities,” while still other Democrats on Beacon Hill have criticized your administration directly, accusing you of “deciding how to balance death and the economy.”
By now, it should be clear: the shutdown of private businesses, large and small, has given the Democratic Party -- the party of government overreach -- a political boost. This disastrous pandemic has led to unconstitutional decrees being set in stone almost overnight, creating what is unquestionably a dream scenario for the Democrats -- stifle independence, entrepreneurship, and personal responsibility, and you create a world dependent upon the state.
We write to you today to urge you to push back, publicly, on the Democrats’ demands to keep Massachusetts shuttered.
We write to you today to remind you that the most regulated businesses in the Commonwealth, our nursing homes, also happen to account for more than 61 percent of all COVID-19-related deaths.
We write to you today to convey the frustrations of small business owners, who have had to padlock their doors while their big-box competitors across the street are allowed to remain open.
We write to you today to remind you that the Massachusetts business community lives and breathes on the ambitions, creativity, and dreams of its residents, but will die a painful death if it succumbs to the whims of an unelected bureaucracy. These business owners realize the importance of maintaining a hygienic environment -- if the public does not trust them and their products, no amount of government intervention will keep them afloat.
While many Republicans may disagree on the speed of reopening, one area of common ground we can all agree on is the need to reopen Massachusetts. Moreover, Senate President Karen Spilka has acknowledged in conversations with local officials that the Commonwealth faces an $8 billion budget deficit if our economy remains locked down.
“Do not use the governor's January number when he came out with his budget; it's simply not relevant anymore,” Spilka told local officials in her district Tuesday night.
This precipitous drop in revenue can only be halted by the reopening of our businesses. Meanwhile, out-of-work business owners must still somehow find a way to pay rent, the Commonwealth’s workforce must eventually have to pay an income and property tax, as well as take care of their families. Democrats like to talk about fatalities associated with this virus, but still unknown yet just as tragic are the deaths that will occur due to alcoholism, drug use, and suicide, all of which will be on the increase as long as residents are forced to lock themselves away.
Ten weeks of lockdowns have been enough. We’ve flattened the curve, prevented our hospitals from being overwhelmed, and sacrificed our liberties. We’ve watched as a hyper-partisan media has misfired on their forecasts of doom.
To rebuild our economy, the solution is not more regulations but less bureaucratic interference. Americans, especially here in Massachusetts, continue to battle this deadly pandemic and are more than capable of continuing to open the economy safely.
We support your efforts to continue to aggressively fight the virus and to continue to reopen Massachusetts.
Sincerely,
View Signatures

"Democratic state Rep. Josh Cutler claims he supports law enforcement, voting record proves otherwise
Sept. 18, 2020
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT:
Evan Lips, communications director
617-523-5005 ext. 245
WOBURN -- A mailer from the campaign to reelect Democratic state Rep. Josh Cutler professes the Duxbury lawmaker supports law enforcement, a claim completely at odds with Cutler’s voting record and a boast that Massachusetts Republican Party Chairman Jim Lyons pointed out is ""flat-out lie.""
In July, Cutler voted ‘yes’ to a knee-jerk “police reform bill” that seeks to bury officers beneath layers-upon-layers of political bureaucracy, threatening them with decertification decided by a panel of political appointees each lacking a single shred of law enforcement experience.
“The fact of the matter is that Rep. Cutler voted yes on a piece of legislation that attacks our police,” said Massachusetts Republican Party Chairman Jim Lyons. “When will the Democrats admit that their goal is to radically change America?”
Cutler, meanwhile, has endorsed and campaigned for incumbent Democratic U.S. Sen. Ed Markey, who earlier this week called to “disarm police” and claimed non-lethal forms of riot control equipment deployed in mob-ravaged cities such as Portland and Minneapolis constitute “weapons of war.”
Cutler’s opponent is Republican Tatyana Semyrog, who has made it clear she stands with law enforcement and has adopted the slogan, “defend, not defund, police.”
“There is a war, but it's being waged nightly across the country in Democrat-run cities against our police officers, and the Democrats' answer to the rioting is to disarm police and demean them,” said Lyons. “Through their silence and their voting, Democrats like Rep. Cutler have encouraged these attacks on law enforcement, in addition to the burning and looting of American cities.
“When their party’s standard-bearer, Attorney General Maura Healey, reflects on America burning, shrugs, and says ‘but that’s how forests grow,’ and not a single Democrat speaks out, then they are all complicit in this madness.”
MassAG Healey: &quot;Yes, America is burning, but that's how forests grow&quot;

"""This is nothing more than a cash-grab designed to increase both Planned Parenthood’s bottom line and their influence.""
Why do Beacon Hill Dems want Planned Parenthood to teach your children about sex?
Jan. 15, 2020
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT:
Evan Lips, communications director
617-523-5005 ext. 245
WOBURN -- The Democrat-led Massachusetts state Senate on Thursday is expected to pass legislation that would foist a Planned Parenthood-crafted sex education curriculum mandate upon the commonwealth’s local school districts.
“The so-called 'Act Relative to Healthy Youth' is nothing more than a cash-grab designed to increase both Planned Parenthood’s bottom line and their influence,” Massachusetts Republican Party Chairman Jim Lyons said. “Their number-one source of revenue comes from abortions, and with those numbers dropping, this maneuver achieves two things:
“It allows Planned Parenthood to syphon more taxpayer dollars, and at the same time promotes a reckless curriculum encouraging children to participate in dangerous sexual activity, all under the mask of progressivism.”
Former Planned Parenthood sex educator Monica Cline has even called Planned Parenthood’s sex-ed curriculum as “the perfect business plan for the lifelong customer.”
On Monday, Democratic lawmakers introduced several amendments. State Sen. Becca Rausch, a Democrat from Needham, introduced an amendment striking a requirement to teach “benefits of abstinence and delaying sexual activity” in favor of a requirement to teach “the potential physical and emotional health outcomes of sexual activity.”
The curriculum targets students as young as 12 years old, yet the age-of-consent law among minors in Massachusetts is 16.
“Why would our schools be teaching children something that is clearly a violation of our own existing laws?” Lyons said.
Examples of the Planned Parenthood “Get Real” curriculum being promoted by Democrats include teaching seventh grade students to protect against sexually transmitted infections by using “non-microwaveable Saran Wrap or a condom cut in half” as a prophylactic for oral sex, and promoting the book It’s Perfectly Normal, which features pornographic cartoon images that Planned Parenthood claims are appropriate for children as young as 10.
“Maybe it’s time that the parents of school-age children let the Legislature know how outrageous this proposal is,” Lyons said. “The only winners in this legislation are Planned Parenthood and the Democrats they shower with campaign donations.”

"MassGOP celebrates Hispanic Heritage Month

617-523-5005 ext. 245
WOBURN -- With Hispanic Heritage Month drawing to a close Thursday, Massachusetts Republican Party Chairman Jim Lyons stressed the importance of taking a break from the fall campaigning season to reflect on and celebrate the contributions made by Hispanic Americans throughout the course of history.
""The roots of this month date back to 1968, but the contributions from Hispanic Americans date back hundreds of years,"" Lyons said. ""From the founding of St. Augustine, Fla., America's oldest city established 25 years prior to the settlement of Jamestown, and to the great Hispanic community today, there would be no America if not for our Hispanic pioneers.""
Lyons highlighted contributions from Hispanic-American Republicans, including U.S. senators Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, former U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, current Republican National Hispanic Assembly Chairwoman Betty Cardenas, and U.S. representatives Mario Díaz-Balart (Florida), Jaime Herrera Beutler (Washington), and Mike Garcia (California), among others.
""The Republican Party would not be where it is today without the public service from these great Hispanic-Americans,"" Lyons said. ""We are incredibly thankful for the contributions Hispanic-Americans have made throughout history, and are especially proud to have honored them this month.""

"Massachusetts is Trump Country
Massachusetts polls show President Trump surging to a whopping 75-plus point blowout, cementing Republican popularity
March 3, 2020
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT:
Evan Lips, communications director
617-523-5005 ext. 245
WOBURN -- Massachusetts Republican primary voters have spoken, and now the Massachusetts Republican Party -- with Super Tuesday in its rear view mirror -- is going all-in on keeping America great in 2020.
“President Trump's projected margin of victory in the Massachusetts Republican primary is a statement,” said Massachusetts Republican Party Chairman Jim Lyons. “Massachusetts is the one state where his opponent is known to virtually every Republican voter.”
“The President's opponent was once the most popular and formidable political figure in the commonwealth, but tonight, Massachusetts Republicans embraced Donald Trump, and those who would splinter and divide the Republican Party have fallen flat once again.”
Lyons said the projected margin of victory shows voters are justifiably proud of the work President Trump has done restoring America's greatness.
“President Trump has delivered on every single promise he made in 2016,” Lyons said. “From securing our borders to presiding over an economy that has connected the most Americans with jobs in history, President Trump has done a phenomenal job.
“And here in Massachusetts, it is President Trump who is leading the charge against the ulta-leftist agenda being promoted by the Radical Democrats on Beacon Hill.”
A partial list of the Democrats’ agenda includes rewarding those who entered the country illegally with driver’s licenses, transforming Massachusetts into a “sanctuary state” for illegal immigrants, denying medical care to infants born alive following failed abortions, and enacting a graduated tax system that will only serve to further burden Massachusetts taxpayers and drive more businesses out of the state.
“The Radical Left’s agenda, which President Trump has fought against since his first day in office, stands against everything the Massachusetts Republican Party represents,” Lyons said. “President Trump has fought for Americans, and the Massachusetts Republican Party will continue to fight for President Trump.”
Added Lyons:
“The results are indisputable, Massachusetts Republicans are with President Trump all the way. Donald Trump's tremendous victory - a landslide victory in the home state of his opponent - sends a resounding message that Massachusetts is Trump country.”
Massachusetts stats since President Trump took office:
* Jobs created: 116,400
* Unemployment rate decreased from 3.7% to 2.8%
* Average tax cut of $1,367
* 30,761 Bay State residents have come off food stamps

"""Trust, but verify""
MassGOP launches ballot fraud email ""hotline""
Oct. 13, 2020
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT: Evan Lips, communications director
617-523-5005 ext. 245
WOBURN -- Incorrect deadlines, wrong ballots, unattended boxes of ballots, unlawful ballot name positioning, and zero signature requirements to safeguard against fraud appear to be on the menu for November’s critical general election.
The recent developments have prompted the Massachusetts Republican Party to launch a “hotline” email address where voters can submit evidence of potential fraud -- [[URL REDACTED]]
“The decision by Beacon Hill’s Democratic leadership to ram through legislation that massively expands mail-in voting is already proving itself to be a serious mistake in judgment,” Massachusetts Republican Party Chairman Jim Lyons said Tuesday.
On Monday, Republican state Rep. Shawn Dooley posted a photo on social media of boxes containing ballots sitting unattended outside Norfolk Town Hall.
“The Secretary of State's office has cases of ballots dropped off at random town halls, outside, on a holiday, with a picture of the ballot attached to the box to make sure that anyone who drove by could see exactly what was in these boxes,” Dooley wrote. “How about delivering them on a workday with a signature required?”
Over the weekend, Wayland town officials confirmed that absentee voters received ballots marked with the wrong precinct numbers. Meanwhile, state officials confirmed that “hundreds or perhaps even thousands” of voters received mail-in ballots for the November election featuring instructions that falsely inform recipients that their votes are due on Sept. 1, the date of the since-passed primary election.
Additionally, voters in Fitchburg’s 3rd Worcester House District have begun to receive ballots where the order of candidates for state representatives unlawfully flip-flopped to benefit the Democrats. According to state election laws, candidates running for an open House seat must be listed by alphabetical order. Fitchburg voters, however, are on track to receive ballots featuring a Democrat at the top, even though Republican candidate Glenn Fossa’s name alphabetically comes before his opponent Michael Kushmarek’s.
Last month, multiple town clerks described the new mail-in voting system as being “ripe for fraud,” citing the Democrat-run state Legislature’s decision last spring to overturn state laws requiring voters seeking mail-in ballots to submit signatures.
“I was horrified to learn yesterday that the new mail-in ballot application system that was authorized by Chapter 115 of the Acts of 2020 and made ‘live’ Wednesday of this week through the Secretary’s office will allow ANYONE to request a ballot without a signature,” Hanover Town Clerk Catherine Harder-Bernier wrote in a Sept. 25 email.
Lyons said all voters, regardless of party affiliation, are encouraged to submit evidence or reports of any suspected fraud to MassGOP’s [[URL REDACTED]] email address.
“Recent alarming developments have prompted us to provide voters with a vehicle with which they can report potential instances of fraud as an alternative to having to navigate the commonwealth’s unending layers of bureaucracy,” Lyons said. “We hope and expect that the 2020 elections are carried out lawfully, with no malfeasance, but to quote the great President Ronald Reagan, it's on us to ‘trust, but verify.’”

"President Trump is not wrong
Massachusetts Town Clerks: New mail-in voting format ""ripe"" for fraud
Sept. 25, 2020
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT:
Evan Lips, communications director
617-523-5005 ext. 245
WOBURN -- The state's new mail-in ballot authorization system launched Wednesday through Secretary of State William Galvin's office grants anyone the ability to request a ballot without having to submit a signature, a process local town clerks identified as being ""ripe"" for fraud.
The discovery falls in line with President Donald Trump's recent criticisms of Massachusetts' mail-in voting plan, which will determine the outcome of November's general elections.
""I was horrified to learn yesterday that the new mail-in ballot application system that was authorized by Chapter 115 of the Acts of 2020 and made 'live' Wednesday of this week through the Secretary's office will allow ANYONE to request a ballot without a signature,"" Hanover Town Clerk Catherine Harder-Bernier wrote in an email Friday.
﻿
Harder-Bernier continued:
""For the seven years that I have served as Hanover's Town Clerk, we have been consistently rejecting ballot applications without signatures. That has simply been the law and we are following it. We are not trained in signature matching, but if there was ever a case where there was a dispute about a fraudulent ballot request, we had a paper trail that we could go back to. The key here is that no ballots were sent following a casual request.
""Now we are being asked to mail ballots to ANY request received in the new portal - and none of those requests will have been signed by a voter. Think of how ripe that process is for fraud!""
Harder-Bernier's concerns echoed those of Sandwich Town Clerk Taylor White, who wrote in a Facebook post Friday that he ""used to be able to reasonably defend the vote-by-mail system"" but now has ""absolutely zero confidence.""
""No Social Security or license number verification, no signatures, and the ability to change the voter's mailing address. I am utterly baffled as to how legislators would allow this system to be implemented without reasonable safeguards.""
White referenced the legislation introduced by Democratic leadership on Beacon Hill:
Massachusetts Republican Party Chairman Jim Lyons praised the town clerks for having the courage to act as whistleblowers and said the alarming development validates President Trump's concerns.
""For Democratic leadership to try and pull this scheme off, knowing that the commonwealth's dedicated town clerks must dutifully follow the letter of the law, is absolutely shameful,"" Lyons said. ""And now the Democrats have the audacity to go after President Trump and try and dismiss his concerns about potential voter fraud, even when they themselves are responsible for putting an entire system in place that is ripe for voter fraud.
""These town clerks are to be commended for calling attention to this impending disaster, the Democrats should be held accountable, and it is incumbent upon our media to ask them some serious questions.""

"Why did Democrat leaders on Beacon Hill fail to address signature requirements in elections bill?
March 25, 2020
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

WOBURN -- Entrenched Democrat leaders on Beacon Hill appear to have ignored an electioneering factor they somehow never saw coming during the state’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic -- the crucial person-to-person gathering of ballot signatures.
“From my own perspective I’m doing most of it (signature collecting) by mail,” House Speaker Robert DeLeo told reporters Monday, after he and Senate President Karen Spilka finished touting an elections bill fast-tracked to Gov. Charlie Baker’s desk.
Massachusetts Republican Chairman Jim Lyons pointed out that most candidates -- especially challengers -- don’t have the luxury of DeLeo’s $780,000-plus campaign war chest.
“The so-called ‘robust mail-in balloting’ program promoted by Speaker DeLeo and President Spilka only addresses the upcoming special elections and not upstart campaigns preparing for November,” Lyons said. “We even saw the Massachusetts Teenage Republicans and the Massachusetts High School Democrats -- two opposing groups made up of young people typically on the front lines of signature-gathering efforts -- join together to urge the Legislature to act on this problem, only to see Democratic leadership ignore it.
“Their inaction guarantees well-heeled incumbents will receive a free pass.”
Republican U.S. Senate candidate Kevin O’Connor, whose 86-year-old father has been hospitalized as a result of the virus, must gather 10,000 signatures by the Massachusetts Secretary of State’s May 5 deadline to ensure his place on the ballot.
“We want the Legislature to bring the law into alignment with the social distancing requirement,” O’Connor said in a recent interview.
Meanwhile, candidates for state office only have until April 28 to collect the required number of signatures. New York state has already acted to lower the threshold for signatures in its elections.
“The signature-gathering process involves thousands of social interactions between candidates and voters, yet Democratic leadership clearly ignored this during the bill-making process,” Lyons said. “Grassroots candidates who lack Speaker DeLeo’s unlimited deep pockets will be unable to get on the ballot, and perhaps that’s exactly why Democrat power-brokers ignored this in their bill.
“I call on them to do the right thing.”

"Gas tax TCI scheme advancing on Beacon Hill
Beacon Hill Democrats on verge of ramming through new gas tax disguised as a climate initiative
July 30, 2020
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT:
Evan Lips, communications director
617-523-5005 ext. 245
WOBURN -- Beacon Hill Democrats are on the cusp of handing taxation authority to unelected government bureaucrats after advancing the so-called Transportation Climate Initiative out of the Joint Committee on Ways and Means, meaning a House vote is imminent and full passage is all but assured.
The vote to advance TCI, essentially a new tax on gasoline and diesel consumption, comes as Massachusetts is faced with record 17 percent unemployment. The new tax is disguised under a term lawmakers call a ""market-based compliance mechanism."" More specifically, the legislation references ""a system of charges or exactions imposed to reduce statewide greenhouse has emissions in whole or in part.""
A recent study performed by the Beacon Hill Institute determined that TCI's ""market-based compliance mechanism,"" which would be dictated by bureaucrats and not elected officials, will result in a 26-cent per gallon increase in the price of gasoline and hit the average Massachusetts household with an extra $738 in annual expenses.
The legislation identifies the Department of Environmental Protection as responsible for setting and enforcing the surcharges.
""The Democrats are advocating for an unelected government bureaucracy to set these new taxes, meaning that once they kick in, the taxes will be with us forever,"" said Massachusetts Republican Party Chairman Jim Lyons. ""This is taxation without representation, and once again the Democrats have gone too far.""

"Worcester DA broke law, Ethics Commission finds
AG Healey: Rule of law doesn't matter if you're a fellow Democrat
June 25, 2020
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT:
Evan Lips, communications director
617-523-5005 ext. 245
WOBURN -- A multi-year state Ethics Commission investigation has reached a conclusion that was blatantly obvious from the start, Massachusetts Republican Chairman Jim Lyons said Thursday, referring to the commission’s announcement that Worcester County District Attorney Joseph Early Jr., a Democrat, broke the law when he ordered the altering of an arrest report in an apparent effort to protect a colleague.
Lyons’s attention is now focused on Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, a fellow Democrat, who determined in 2018 that Early should not face criminal charges.
“According to Massachusetts general law, 'tampering with record, document, or other object for use in an official proceeding' is a violation of the law,” Lyons said. “It’s a disturbing pattern with Attorney General Healey -- there’s one set of laws for the public and a different set of laws for elected Democrats like herself and DA Early.”
“Our state’s top law enforcement official has sued President Donald Trump more times than any other state AG, but refuses to lift a finger to root out corruption here in Massachusetts,” Lyons said. “This one was teed up right in front of her.”
Lyons pointed to Healey’s previous defense of Newton District Court Judge Shelley Joseph, currently facing federal charges for helping an illegal immigrant facing drug charges evade federal immigration agents, and Salem Superior Court Judge Timothy Feeley, who in 2018 made headlines for granting probation to a convicted longtime heroin dealer facing deportation. Healey called the federal charges filed against Joseph a “radical and politically-motivated attack on our state,” and defended Feeley’s decision as “apolitical.”
“Sadly, Attorney General Healey treats her office as the legal arm of the Democratic Party at the expense of Massachusetts residents,” Lyons said. “This is the latest instance where Attorney General Healey is clearly making a statement that when it comes to her fellow Democrats, the rule of law doesn’t matter.
“Meanwhile, Attorney General Healey's statement earlier this month regarding the looting, destruction, and violence of American cities was very telling. Our commonwealth's chief law enforcement officer took a look at the leftist mobs torching businesses and private property, shrugged, and told us “that's how forests grow.”

"""Men and women in law enforcement have been at the mercy of pandering career politicians for far too long""
Sept. 2, 2020
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT:
Evan Lips, communications director
617-523-5005 ext. 245
WOBURN -- The Massachusetts Republican Party announced on Wednesday the launch of the MassGOP Law Enforcement and Family Coalition, an effort aimed at not only backing men and women serving in law enforcement, but also a project that can provide a grassroots network of support for those considering a run for public office.
The face of the coalition is Joe Abasciano, a law enforcement professional who has proudly worn the badge for 14 years. Abasciano, who helped organize Wilmington's successful ""Back the Blue"" rally last month, said the coalition's launch is long overdue.
""Men and women in law enforcement have been at the mercy of pandering career politicians for far too long, and current efforts on Beacon Hill to dismantle laws that protect police officers should concern us all,"" Abasciano said. ""We're saying enough is enough.
""We're launching the MassGOP Law Enforcement and Family Coalition to help keep Massachusetts from drifting further away from law and order, and further putting not just the lives of the commonwealth's brave police officers, but the law-abiding public, at risk.""
SIGN UP HERE!
The launch comes days after police in Boston were met by a hostile crowd and a thrown glass bottle while making an arrest in connection with an illegal firearm. Abasciano said incidents like these are on the rise and are being fueled by partisan demands to ""defund police,"" in addition to the growing trend of lawmakers demonizing police.
""Legislators are now actively working to strip away laws that protect police in order to score political points and satisfy a vocal minority that continues to demonize men and women serving in law enforcement,"" Abasciano said. ""The Law Enforcement and Family Coalition was formed in response to these trends, and to provide police officers and their loved ones with a voice and a network of support.""
SIGN UP HERE!
Abasciano added that the MassGOP Law Enforcement and Family Coalition is already working to organize community standouts across Massachusetts on Friday, Sept. 11, to honor those who made the ultimate sacrifice 19 years ago on 9/11. The standouts will usher in a weekend of ""Back the Blue"" activism. Those who register online with the new coalition can expect to receive additional updates on these events and many more.
The launch of the MassGOP Law Enforcement and Family Coalition follows the formation of the MassGOP Veterans Coalition, spearheaded by Republican activist and Operation Desert Storm veteran John MacDonald. Like MacDonald, Abasciano also served in Iraq.
Massachusetts Republican Party Chairman Jim Lyons praised the coalition's launch and said he expects the organization to play a critical role in the party's advocacy and candidate recruitment efforts.
""As the proud son of a police officer, I know what it feels like to have a family member serving in law enforcement and wondering whether or not they will come home safely at the end of a shift,"" Lyons said. ""I cannot imagine the level of anxiety these brave men and women in blue and their families are experiencing as leftist lawmakers on Beacon Hill not only continue to demonize them but also work to chip away at laws protecting them.
""The MassGOP Law Enforcement and Family Coalition will give these courageous police officers and their families a voice and the support needed to preserve law-and-order in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.""

"Even Facebook has caught on to Robertson
How can the public trust Rep. Robertson with their tax dollars when they can’t even trust him to report his own spending?
Oct. 21, 2020
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT: Evan Lips, communications director
617-523-5005 ext. 245
WOBURN -- Facebook has apparently caught on to Democratic Rep. David Robertson’s shoddy campaign spending reporting and has put a block on ads promoting the Tewksbury Democrat, a review of Robertson’s online activity shows.
“Now it appears Facebook is also having to do OCPF’s (state Office of Campaign and Political Finance) job for them as well,” Massachusetts Republican Party Chairman Jim Lyons said. “The law means nothing to Democrats like Rep. Robertson.”
The above screenshot, taken from the Robertson campaign’s Facebook account, shows that the Tewksbury Democrat has been paying for ads without disclaimers, meaning his campaign spending has been unaccounted for. Facebook has built-in mechanisms for preventing candidates from being able to post and boost advertisements without first disclosing the funding source.
In Robertson’s case, Facebook, unlike OCPF, apparently caught on to the lawmaker’s failure to disclose expenditures.
Meanwhile, Robertson’s campaign recently filed a new “external activity report” with OCPF that references the $15,399.05 he has spent during the 2020 cycle as “out-of-pocket candidate expense(s) (as loan(s).”
“If we hadn’t caught on to his scheming, Rep. Robertson would have kept on illegally spending campaign funds without reporting the expenditures to the state,” Lyons said. “This individual’s shady accounting practices begs the question -- how can the public trust Rep. Robertson with their tax dollars when they can’t even trust him to report his own spending?”

"As Beacon Hill's Democratic leadership fiddles, MassGOP acts, works with Secretary of State Galvin to get results
April 9, 2020
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT:
Evan Lips, communications director
617-523-5005 ext. 245
WOBURN -- While candidates from both parties remain in limbo as a result of Beacon Hill’s apparent unwillingness to address signature-collection thresholds amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Massachusetts Republican Party Chairman Jim Lyons has been busy trying to find simpler solutions that don’t require legislative approval.
On Thursday, Lyons announced that after reaching out to Secretary of State William Galvin, the office has agreed to allow individuals to print from home printer-friendly 8.5-inch by 11-inch copies of nomination forms.
To satisfy state law, individuals must print the forms double-sided, however.
State law stipulates that forms cannot ""be larger than eight and one-half inches by fourteen inches,"" but allows for all smaller sizes.
The law specifies that individuals cannot ""be prohibited from making exact copies of such blanks provided by the secretary of state for the purpose of collecting signatures for such nominations, nor shall any such copies be rejected for certification or submittal to the secretary of state.""
“It’s a simple move that helps those candidates without insider connections and the financial advantages that come with being a longtime incumbent like a Speaker (Robert) DeLeo,” Lyons said. “I’m grateful that Secretary Galvin agreed to work with us on this.
“At the same time however I'm confused as to why Democratic leadership still refuses to act,"" Lyons added.
Lyons then identified several past situations that prompted swift action from DeLeo:
""When Speaker Deleo wanted to change the rules to extend his ability to be speaker, and broke his promise to the public to lengthen his term, he did so in a single day. When Speaker DeLeo wanted legislative pay raises, he ordered a vote without a public hearing, and got what he wanted just two days after he filed his bill. When the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 9-0 against a law passed by the Massachusetts Legislature that violated First Amendment protections to pro-life activists on public property, it only took DeLeo three days to announce Democrat leadership was working on crafting a new version of the unconstitutional law.”
Legislation that would reduce the state’s signature threshold by two-thirds, filed March 25, still languishes in the House. The April 28 deadline for state candidates and the May 5 deadline for federal candidates still remain in effect.
“Incumbents like DeLeo already have established lists of voters who have signed nomination papers for them in the past, not to mention existing campaign accounts that can easily pay for mailings and whatnot,” Lyons said. “Challengers don’t have that luxury, and in a Legislature dominated by one party, it’s pretty easy to see why the Democrats are refusing to address this potentially dangerous situation.”

"Statement from MassGOP Chairman Jim Lyons regarding Secretary of State William F. Galvin's misinterpretation of his own election manual
Dec. 12, 2019
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT:
Evan Lips, communications director
617-523-5005 ext. 245
BOSTON -- Massachusetts Republican Party Chairman Jim Lyons issued the following statement Thursday in response to Secretary of State William F. Galvin's decree to add former Gov. William F. Weld to the Massachusetts Republican presidential primary ballot:
""According to his own election manual \-- of which Secretary Galvin should be aware of, since he's been serving in this capacity since 1994 -- candidates must file as Republicans at least a year in advance of seeking entry on the Republican presidential primary ballot.""
Per the Massachusetts Secretary of State's official manual:
Candidates who wish to run in a political party primary must have been enrolled in that party throughout the ninety days preceding the deadline for filing nomination papers with the Secretary of the Commonwealth. Additionally, party candidates may not have been enrolled in any other political party for one year prior to the last day for filing nomination papers with the Secretary of the Commonwealth.
According to a CommonWealth Magazine report, Weld, a 2016 libertarian vice presidential candidate, did not switch parties to become a Republican until Jan. 17, 2019.
""This same person, Bill Galvin, vested with the responsibility of ensuring the sanctity of the commonwealth's collective voting booth, somehow can't be bothered to consult his own election manual,"" Lyons said. ""I can't believe the Massachusetts Republican Party has had to resort to doing Bill Galvin's job for him -- actually, check that, I can.
""Bill Galvin's performance today fits nicely with his history of partisan performances as the Massachusetts Democratic Party Kingpin:
""The same Secretary Galvin who once told Lawrence Mayor Dan Rivera ‘I made you mayor’.
""The same Secretary Galvin who knowingly used state resources to prop up his own reelection campaign.
""The same Secretary Galvin who got caught habitually interfering with the rights of volunteers serving in the armed forces overseas to participate in elections back home.
""The same Secretary Galvin who conveniently scheduled his own state primary election date in 2018 on the day after Labor Day.
“The same Secretary Galvin whose office staff got caught for working for his campaign on the taxpayer's dime.”
Added Lyons:
""Bill Galvin has decided to throw aside any pretense of acting as an impartial secretary of state. Clearly, Bill Galvin is a partisan activist.""

"""What is it about Republican women that drive the Democrats so crazy?""
Amid attacks on Republican women, Democrats' silence is deafening
July 23, 2020
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT:
Evan Lips, communications director
617-523-5005 ext. 245
WOBURN -- Massachusetts Republican Party Chairman Jim Lyons said Wednesday that no amount of intimidation or outright threats lodged by Democrats will prevent Republican women from running for public office in the commonwealth.
“The abuse that’s been directed at several of our female candidates is nothing short of shameful, and the Massachusetts Democratic Party’s stubborn silence on the matter should alarm everyone, regardless of political persuasions,” Lyons said.
Over the past weekend, a video emerged in which a campaign organizer for Democratic U.S. Rep. Ayanna Pressley unloaded off a half-hour’s worth of unprintable racist and sex-based attacks directed at Pressley’s African-American Republican challenger, Randolph resident Rayla Campbell. The video features Pressley campaign organizer Monica Cannon-Grant, known for her high-profile endorsements of prominent Massachusetts Democrats, including Attorney General Maura Healey, U.S. Rep. Joseph Kennedy III, U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, and dozens of others.
Campbell told the Boston Herald that the number of threats she’s received has forced her family to move out of their Randolph home.
“Racism is racism, no matter where it comes from,” Campbell told the newspaper. “I was horrified and absolutely terrified. I had to uproot my family and just stay elsewhere.”
Lyons noted that the Boston Globe, which has promoted Cannon-Grant in the past with fawning coverage and coveted front-page op-ed space, has chosen to ignore the episode altogether.
Meanwhile, Duxbury Republican candidate Tatyana Semyrog, walking door-to-door earlier this week in Hanson as part of her campaign for state representative, recalled being chased away and screamed at by several angry residents “all because of my political beliefs.”
Semyrog said she won’t be intimidated.
“I’m more energized now than ever,” said Semyrog. “I’ve received an incredible outpouring of support from the community since that happened, the encouragement has been heartwarming.”
The spate of ugly incidents comes on the heels of a state Supreme Judicial Court ruling granting Republican Congressional candidate Helen Brady a position on the 2020 ballot, despite the Democrats’ best efforts to use the current health emergency in an effort to silence her campaign.
“Republican women in Massachusetts are refusing to be silenced by this kind of ugly stuff,” Lyons said. “Voters should take note of this type of behavior, and call on the Massachusetts Democratic Party to stop enabling it.
“What is it about strong Republican women that drive the Democrats to resort to this type of behavior?”

"Will Massachusetts Democrats cave to radical ""defund the police"" demands?
June 8, 2020
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT:
Evan Lips, communications director
617-523-5005 ext. 245
WOBURN -- The movement on the left to ""defund the police"" will have the opposite effect when it comes to halting violence in our cities, Massachusetts Republican Party Chairman Jim Lyons said Monday.
Lyons said he watched video over the weekend showing Minneapolis Democrat Mayor Jacob Frey's attempt to reason with protesters, only to be shouted down and subsequently shunned. The Minneapolis City Council later pledged to ""dismantle"" the city's police department.
The question now is whether Massachusetts Democrats will cave to the same radical demands.
""The number-one reason why we haven't seen a repeat of the violence that happened here last Sunday night in Boston is because of an increased presence of law-and-order,"" Massachusetts Republican Party Chairman Jim Lyons said.
""Radical leftists have no interest in working with police to enact reforms,"" said Lyons. ""Their goal is to abolish police departments wholesale, as we've found out in Minneapolis.
""Criticize or question any absurd demand, and they will instantly try to smear you as a racist. That's how these left-wing groups operate.""
Added Lyons:
""The Massachusetts Republican Party supports the right to peacefully assemble, and at the same time recognizes Massachusetts police departments are crucial to maintaining peace and order.""

"Is denying lifesaving medical care to infants born alive... humane?
The Democrats' ROE Act misinformation campaign: Is denying lifesaving medical care to infants born alive... humane?
Sept. 24, 2020
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT:
Evan Lips, communications director
617-523-5005 ext. 245
WOBURN -- Democrats are wildly claiming abortion would be outlawed in Massachusetts should a constitutionalist fill a vacant U.S. Supreme Court seat and are now redoubling efforts to advance legislation that would in part repeal a section of state law mandating the presence of lifesaving medical equipment in rooms where abortions are performed.
Massachusetts Republican Party Chairman Jim Lyons spoke out on the issue on the same day that Republican President Donald J. Trump announced a planned executive order protecting babies that survive abortion attempts, describing it as ""our sacrosanct moral duty,"" and declared increases in federal funding for neonatal research ""to ensure that every child has the very best chance to thrive and to grow.""
Lyons said the more appropriate name for the ROE Act ""should be the Infanticide Act"" and pointed out that the central focus of the legislation does not involve preserving the reproductive rights already written into state law -- ""the legislation instead seeks to radically expand the practice of abortion beyond the moment of birth, effectively legalizing infanticide.""
""The 'sky-is-falling' charade being put on display by Democrats and their surrogates in the Massachusetts media is pure deception. Their radical legislation isn't about protecting the state laws that are already in place, it's about dismantling the state laws put in place to protect the most vulnerable among us,"" Lyons said. ""Denying medical treatment to someone born alive during an 11th hour abortion is nothing short of evil.""
Lyons noted that at the heart of the ROE Act is a provision that would permanently repeal the state statute which reads, ""the physician performing the abortion shall take all reasonable steps, both during and subsequent to the abortion, in keeping with good medical practice, consistent with the procedure being used, to preserve the life and health of the aborted child.
""Such steps shall include the presence of life-supporting equipment, as defined by the department of public health, in the room where the abortion is to be performed.""
Said Lyons:
""It will be astonishing to watch the radical Democrats claim that President Trump's decision is anything but the humane and right thing to do, knowing that Massachusetts state law already includes the same protections his executive order calls for.""

WOBURN -- Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, standard-bearer for the Massachusetts Democratic Party, on Tuesday appeared to cheer on the destruction of American cities at the hands of leftist mobs, commenting that the ""burning"" devastation is ""how forests grow.""
""Sadly, but predictably, this is the message our state's top law enforcement official is sending,"" said Massachusetts Republican Party Chairman Jim Lyons. ""This is the message the Massachusetts Democratic Party is sending to business owners forced to shutdown for months only to watch left-wing mobs torch their life's work.
""Out of all the messages her office could have sent to struggling residents and business owners left powerless as their neighborhoods burned, this is the message Attorney General Healey and the rest of the Radical Democrats have decided to promote.""
Added Lyons:
""By choosing to highlight this insane analogy, it should be clear to Massachusetts residents that no matter what else Democrats like Attorney General Healey say, they will always condone mob tactics. The Radical Democrats, led by the likes of Attorney General Healey, sat back and watched as cities went up in flames over the weekend, and are now admitting that this is all part of their plan to fundamentally change America by any means possible.

"Massachusetts Senator playing dodgeball in Maryland mansion
Markey refuses to debate GOP's Kevin O'Connor, despite begging for seven during Dem primary
Oct. 8, 2020
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT:
Evan Lips, communications director
617-523-5005 ext. 245
WOBURN -- Massachusetts Republican Chairman Jim Lyons on Thursday ripped U.S. Sen. Ed Markey over the career lawmaker’s refusal to engage in more than one debate with Republican challenger Kevin O’Connor, calling it a disservice to voters unfamiliar with Markey's socialist-friendly agenda.
“Sen. Markey begged and pleaded for at least a half-dozen debates when he was being challenged in the primary by a Kennedy, and now he’s afraid of extending the same courtesy to Kevin (O’Connor),” Lyons said. “He’s hiding in the basement of his Chevy Chase mansion playing dodgeball, just like Joe Biden, hoping he doesn’t have to answer questions about his socialist fantasies.”
Markey notably co-authored his “Green New Deal” with avowed socialist U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and wants to grant statehood status to Washington, D.C. as part of a progressive power grab. Markey has even declined to participate in a debate with O'Connor where the senator's signature legislation would be the sole topic of discussion.
Meanwhile, just hours before their debate on Monday, Markey demanded debate host network GBH place himself and O’Connor in different studios, citing COVID-19 precautions, despite the fact that he had already signed off on debating O’Connor in person. During the debate itself, O’Connor dutifully worked to expose Markey’s ultra-leftist record and cited Markey’s 43-plus years of Washington, D.C., entrenchment.
“Sen. Markey has spent almost a lifetime inside the DC beltway with nothing to show for it, so he decided to hitch his wagon to an out-of-control socialist in Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,” Lyons said. “Meanwhile, here in the real world, Kevin O’Connor presents voters with a fresh perspective, optimism, and zero DC baggage.
“It’s clear to me that Ed Markey would rather hunker down and duck questions because his radical policies are indefensible. Now we’re in the general election and the last thing Ed Markey wants to do is have to talk about the radical socialist promises he made to the leftist mobs over the summer.
“Kevin O’Connor isn’t getting seven debates, he’s not even getting two out of Ed Markey, and the reason is that the last thing Ed Markey wants to talk about are his own policies.”

"""We’ve already seen a conga line of Democratic House speakers indicted""
Pattern of Beacon Hill Dem indictments yet another reason for voters to dump commonwealth's one-party rule
Feb. 18, 2020
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Evan Lips, communications director

WOBURN -- The federal indictment of a longtime Beacon Hill Democrat for alleged financial fraud marks yet another example of how Massachusetts is suffering under one-party rule, Massachusetts Republican Party Chairman Jim Lyons announced Tuesday.
“Having a Democrat-dominated state Legislature has been a stain on accountability,” Lyons said. “We’ve already seen a conga line of Democratic House speakers indicted, not to mention the disaster that happened under our former Democratic Senate president.
Added Lyons: “Somehow we remain the state whose lawmakers are not held accountable to public records laws and open meeting laws. Bringing balance, accountability, and transparency to the state Legislature is something that is well overdue, and restoring that public trust is exactly what the Massachusetts Republican Party is working to accomplish.”
Three Democratic House speakers in a row -- Charles Flaherty, Tom Finneran, and Sal DiMasi -- have been successfully prosecuted, while a fourth, current House Speaker Robert A. DeLeo, narrowly avoided federal charges in 2014 after a former Massachusetts Probation Department chief was indicted for, among other actions, bribing DeLeo at least 10 times, “in part to help him as he began his successful campaign to become speaker in 2009,” according to news reports.
In 2017, then-state Sen. Brian Joyce, a Democrat, was charged with raking in more than $1 million in bribes and kickbacks “laundered through his law firm,” according to a Boston Globe report.
In May 2018, then-Senate President Stan Rosenberg resigned after an ethics report tied to his then-husband Bryon Hefner’s pattern of sexual assault involving Beacon Hill influencers showed the Amherst Democrat offered the now-convicted sexual predator Hefner “an unreasonable level of access to his office and to the inner workings of the Senate.”
“There has to be a balance in the state Legislature, and if not, you can bet this serial pattern of abuse and misconduct will keep happening again and again,” Lyons said. “The Democrats in the Legislature are the stewards of public money, and when they cannot be trusted, it’s up to us to give the voters a choice -- and for the voters to hold them accountable.”

"""Democrats united against fairness""
Beacon Hill Senate Democrats act quickly to help Sen. Markey qualify for ballot, but tough luck if you're trying to run for one of their seats
April 16, 2020
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT:
Evan Lips, communications director
617-523-5005 ext. 245
WOBURN -- An amendment filed by Webster Republican Sen. Ryan Fattman that would have lowered the signature threshold for both federal and state candidates predictably died in the state Senate Thursday, with Senate Democrats instead voting in lockstep to advance an election bill that would immediately benefit one of their most powerful incumbents.
“This is exactly the kind of game the Democrats intended to play, as soon as they heard Sen. Ed Markey was 3,000 signatures short,” said Massachusetts Republican Party Chairman Jim Lyons. “The Democrats panicked and wanted to change the rules to help their guy, and were in quite a hurry to do so -- but too bad if you’re trying to qualify to run against one of them.
“When it came to the issue of fairness, and spreading it across the board, Democrats stood united against it, and this is the type of one-party rule that has to stop.”
The legislation slices in half signature collection requirements for candidates running for U.S. Senate, U.S. House, and various county seats. Last Tuesday, Markey’s campaign announced it was more than 3,000 signatures short of qualifying. Days later, after weeks of inaction, Democrats on Good Friday filed their legislation.
Fattman’s amendment called for also applying the policy to state legislative races, but failed Thursday on a party-line vote 5-4, with Republican Sens. Patrick O’Connor (Weymouth), Bruce Tarr (Gloucester), and Dean Tran (Fitchburg) joining Fattman in support, and Democrat Sens. Nick Collins (South Boston), Barry Finegold (Andover), Cindy Friedman (Arlington), Michael Rodrigues (Westport), and Walter Timilty (Milton) successfully opposing.
Said Fattman during Thursday’s Senate session:
“Our policy today is that we don't believe in picking winners and losers, we believe in fairness and equal protection for all, and if we're going to change the signature requirement law, isn't the most fair way to do it - to do it for everybody?”
The Senate’s bill now heads to the House, where it faces an unpredictable future.
“Senate Democrats have the network and the finances to easily qualify for their own races for reelection, and now it looks like they're also setting out to prove that they have the means and power to limit anyone else's chances of challenging them,"" Lyons said.

"Vote no on 2
Ranked-choice is the wrong choice
Vote no on 2
Oct. 9, 2020
Dear Friend,
An out-of-state money blitz courtesy of rich and power-hungry donors is currently hard at work trying to cajole Massachusetts voters into supporting efforts to implement “ranked-choice voting,” a confusing and destructive system completely at odds with our democracy.
It’s time we fought back.
Ranked-choice voting, an electoral system in which voters rank candidates according to preference, is on the ballot in November. If the measure succeeds, a candidate in Massachusetts who fails to secure enough votes to declare a fair-and-square win can still emerge victorious. Even Democrats like former California Gov. Jerry Brown have voiced concerns, pointing out that the practice “deprives voters of genuinely informed choice.”
You can help defeat this disastrous proposal. You can be part of an awareness campaign. We are about to begin distributing “No on 2” yard signs statewide, and by submitting your information, we can ensure that you receive a sign.
Click here to request a yard sign
After you sign up, you’ll be able to receive important notices such as yard sign distribution location information and updates about our campaign.
Ranked-choice means no choice. The proposal seeks to permanently end our tried-and-true system of “one person, one vote.” The proposal seeks to turn losers into winners, and unnecessarily complicate our electoral process.
Join me in making sure voters know the truth about this disastrous proposal.
Yours,
Jim Lyons

"""Never let a crisis go to waste""
House Speaker DeLeo's emergency rules package power grab: ""Never let a crisis go to waste""
April 29, 2020
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT:
Evan Lips, communications director
617-523-5005 ext. 245
WOBURN -- House Speaker Robert DeLeo is looking to use the current COVID-19 crisis to change legislative rules in order to consolidate more power, Massachusetts Republican Chairman Jim Lyons said Wednesday.
""Speaker DeLeo sought to use the crisis to implement a rule change package that would consolidate his power to limit and control debate but House Republicans thankfully caught him in the act and put a stop to it,"" said Massachusetts Republican Chairman Jim Lyons. ""Congratulations to Republican Minority Leader Brad Jones for standing up and shutting down this scheme, and not allowing this power grab to go one step forward.""
According to Republican Billerica state Rep. Marc Lombardo, who was present inside the House chamber for Wednesday's attempted power grab, Speaker DeLeo's new rules package would have stripped members of existing rights and ""would make the unprecedented requirement for members to pre-register to speak before any session starts and before any debate even happens.
""Members would be required to declare in advance their support or opposition, after which they would be placed on a list that Speaker DeLeo would use to determine whether they could speak,"" Lombardo said. ""Members would be restricted to speaking only once on an issue, and be limited to 10 minutes, while the Democratic chair would be granted unlimited time and opportunities to speak.
""There is absolutely no reason for these new rules as the House could continue virtual operation with the existing rules in place.""
Lombardo continued:
""Let me be crystal clear: the Republican caucus is in no way trying to interfere with legislation regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, to the contrary, we support Gov. Baker's proposals and the representation by the Speaker that somehow Republicans were trying to interfere with helping the residents of the commonwealth during this pandemic is deeply disturbing.""
In addition, the new rules do not coincide with the expiration date of the current state of emergency. DeLeo instead set the new rules package to expire in January 2021.
""House Democrats under DeLeo even rejected an amendment adding a 'sunset clause' to the news rules,"" Lyons pointed out. ""That should tell you that they aren't seeing this power grab as temporary -- they want it to be permanent.""
""Speaker DeLeo's claim that Republican opposition to his list of power-grabbing 'emergency procedures' is dangerous is a flat-out lie,"" Lyons said. ""The truth is, he sees this as a chance to stifle debate, just like he saw the current pandemic as a chance to stifle any threats to Democratic control before he was overruled by the Supreme Judicial Court.
Added Rep. Lombardo:
""I ask my Democratic colleagues to join the Republican Caucus in calling on Speaker DeLeo to abandon this attempt to strip members of their rights and to further consolidate his own power.""

"Major police reform legislation has Senate Democrats prioritizing politics over public input
July 10, 2020
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT:
Evan Lips, communications director
617-523-5005 ext. 245
WOBURN -- For the second straight day, it took a Republican to step up to the Democrat-dominated Massachusetts Senate to remind them that the drafting of laws affecting the public should not be happening behind closed doors.
Senate Democrats’ sweeping police reform bill was slapped together in private, and once again, the Democrats tried to ram through legislation without hearing from the public, according to Sutton Republican state Sen. Ryan Fattman.
Sen. Fattman has said the legislation was “rushed and done hastily” and noted that “the egregious sins of other law enforcement in other parts of our country should not be their burden to bear.”
“Massachusetts residents should feel grateful that Sen. Fattman decided enough was enough and stood up for them,” Massachusetts Republican Party Chairman Jim Lyons said Friday. “This overreaching legislation was crafted in private with zero public input.
“The Democrats put together a politically-driven 74-page bill attacking police to satisfy the radical left’s mob of anti-police agitators, and did so out of the public eye.”

"Housing providers have already sacrificed enough from COVID-19 restrictions
Democrats demand a 12-month moratorium on paying rent, but housing providers have already sacrificed enough.
July 6, 2020
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT:
Evan Lips, communications director
617-523-5005 ext. 245
WOBURN -- Reacting to legislation filed by Beacon Hill Democrats that would extend a mandatory stoppage on evictions for a full year even after the COVID-19 state of emergency order has been lifted, Massachusetts Republican Party Chairman Jim Lyons issued the following statement:
“Those who provide housing, undoubtedly an essential service, happen to be Massachusetts residents tasked with shouldering some of the biggest burdens in the commonwealth since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Forcing housing providers to suspend collecting monthly rent for a full year even after the emergency order ends, which the Democrats are trying to do, is a massive overreach.
“Massachusetts landlords never once received a bailout, they must still pay mortgages and property taxes, and an irresponsible demand like the 12-month moratorium on rent payments proposed by the Democrats will throw them into a free-fall from which everyone involved -- including tenants -- will suffer.”
The original state moratorium on evictions approved in April expires on Aug. 18.
Formal legislative sessions are still scheduled to end for the year on July 31.

"""A disgrace to democracy""
Beacon Hill's Democratic leadership continues to stonewall efforts to address signature gathering for state legislative races
April 14, 2020
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT:
Evan Lips, communications director
617-523-5005 ext. 245
WOBURN -- A day after House Democratic leadership reportedly confirmed -- on condition of anonymity -- that coronavirus-related legislation addressing candidate signature deadlines and thresholds “would almost certainly not clear the House,” Massachusetts Republican Chairman Jim Lyons fired back, calling the decree a “disgrace to democracy.”
“Self-protection and one-party rule appears to be the number-one priority for House Speaker Bob DeLeo,” Lyons said. “These publicly elected officials don’t even have the guts to agree to be quoted on the record, because they know they’ll never be held accountable.”
Lyons was referencing Monday’s State House News Service Report, which stated in part:
""I think there were perfect conditions to gather all the signatures early and if you didn't take advantage of the caucuses or the good weather on Super Tuesday with a high turnout, what were you waiting for?"" said one House chairman, who spoke only on the condition that they remain anonymous.
The report later quoted unnamed sources close to DeLeo, who declined to comment, claiming that the House speaker was ""caught off guard last week"" after Gov. Charlie Baker went on the record in support of lowering candidate requirements due to the current pandemic.
""Speaker DeLeo must have a selective memory,"" Lyons said. ""He was asked publicly three weeks about this exact issue and said he was considering proposals to lower signature thresholds.
""For three weeks, Speaker DeLeo has ducked the issue entirely. Beacon Hill must have a wonderful witness protection program for Democratic leadership members.""
The SHNS report also quoted Sen. Rules Committee Chairman Joan Lovely (D-Salem), who claimed that lowering the signature threshold for state-level races would somehow amount to ""an incumbent protection bill.""
""The mental gymnastics needed to equate lowering the signature threshold with protecting incumbents like Sen. Lovely are breathtaking,"" Lyons said. ""Entrenched incumbents like Sen. Lovely already have the lists and campaign cash necessary to safely collect the required amount of signatures.
""Challengers do not.""
Lyons concluded:
""I know how quickly things can get done, having served in the legislature for eight years. When Speaker DeLeo wanted to extend his term as speaker, and change the rules to get that done, he did it in a day. He did that to protect his speakership. It seems to me that to protect democracy, we ought to do the same thing.""

"Free and fair elections win in the end
Supreme Judicial Court to Speaker DeLeo et al. -- Ensuring free and elections is among the most basic constitutional principles, so why did we have to do your job for you?
April 17, 2020
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT:
Evan Lips, communications director
617-523-5005 ext. 245
WOBURN -- It took a first-time Republican U.S. Senate candidate, Kevin O'Connor, to point out how out-of-touch the Democrat-dominated Massachusetts Legislature is regarding constitutional law.
On Friday, the Supreme Judicial Court sent a message to Beacon Hill’s Democratic leadership team, especially House Speaker Robert DeLeo, when it acted swiftly to address candidate ballot signature deadlines and thresholds during the time of social-distancing.
“If the Legislature had enacted a law on March 23 imposing harsh new requirements that made it substantially more difficult for candidates to obtain the required signatures to get on the September 1 primary ballot, we no doubt would declare the law unconstitutional,” Chief Justice Ralph Gants wrote in the court's decision. “The Legislature, of course, did not do this, but it is fair to say that the pandemic did.
“But where fundamental constitutional rights are violated, and where the Legislature fails to remedy the constitutional deficiencies after having had the opportunity to do so, and where an aggrieved litigant files suit seeking remedial relief for the constitutional violation, the judiciary must provide such a remedy.”
It was O’Connor who first called on the Legislature in early March to adapt state signature gathering laws to accommodate social distancing measures. The silence he received in return prompted him to turn to the SJC for constitutional relief.
Per Chief Justice Gants:
""No fair-minded person can dispute that the fundamental right to run for elective office has been unconstitutionally burdened or interfered with by the need to obtain the required 'wet' signatures in the midst of this pandemic.""
Massachusetts Republican Party Chairman Jim Lyons said Friday he was not surprised that the SJC had to do the Legislature’s job for them.
“It’s telling to me when Beacon Hill's Democrat leadership team turns a blind eye to constitutional rights and political challengers are forced to petition the state’s highest court to do the job they're supposed to be doing,"" said Lyons. ""When Speaker DeLeo wanted to extend his term as speaker, and change the rules to get that done, he did it in a day.
""If he cared as much about protecting democracy, he would've addressed this problem in one day as well.""
The SJC’s ruling cuts in half signature thresholds for all candidates and extends the signature-collection deadline for state and county candidates from April 28 until May 5, coinciding with the federal deadline. The ruling also allows for appropriate usage of electronic signatures.

"Do you remember the 2018 primary?
Fellow Republican,
Kevin O’Connor is YOUR candidate for United States Senate. The proof is in his latest video, in which Geoff Diehl, Beth Lindstrom, and John Kingston lay out why each of them is supporting Kevin.
Kevin faces a primary challenge from perennial candidate Shiva Ayyardurai, best known for his volatile behavior. As you may recall, in 2018, Shiva ran as an Independent spoiler. For this run, he's attempting to use the Republican ticket.
You can help Kevin win the primary. Share this video with other voters via email or social media. You know the folks who can most appreciate Kevin's securing endorsements from all three candidates from 2018.
We need a serious, qualified candidate to take on Ed Markey or Joe Kennedy III in November. Your vote on September 1 for Kevin O’Connor, and a donation to his campaign, are an investment in conservative representation in Massachusetts.
Thank you for all you do for our shared values.

Friend,
We have an opportunity to finally retire radical leftist Ed Markey on November 3rd, and I need your help to get it done.
Have you been watching the confirmation hearing for Justice Amy Coney Barrett? She is a wonder to watch, but the Democrats can’t stop with the personal attacks!
They’ve attacked her for being a mother and even for wearing a dress, because they have nothing real to attack her with.
ACB is the smartest person in the room, and they can’t stand it. When asked if she was reading off of her notes, she held up a blank sheet of paper! She just really knows her stuff.
Because the liberals don’t have any actual critiques, they’re just going to threaten to pack the Supreme Court with leftist justices who will have no problem legislating from the bench. Senator Markey even admitted as much on camera!
Are you convinced yet that we need a change?
That’s why we HAVE to elect Constitutional conservative Kevin O’Connor for the U.S. Senate in Massachusetts. Will you chip in now to help him defeat Ed Markey? 50% of all proceeds from this call to action will go straight to his campaign!

"That's why we still need your help getting Republicans on the ballot!
Dear Friend,
Did you catch the latest?
Beacon Hill Democratic leadership finally came out and admitted it -- of course, under the gutless condition of anonymity:
""...another House source familiar with the thinking of many members said a signature reduction bill would almost certainly not clear the House at this time...""
So many of you have already done so much to help Republican candidates safely collect signatures, but if it wasn't blatantly obvious before, it's now 99.9 percent confirmed -- the Legislature under the control of the Democrats are content with hanging democracy out to dry.
Don't let them get away with it.
For those of you who have done so already, you know the drill. For those who haven't, but want to help -- click the link below and fill out the on-line form with your address. We'll work with the candidates in your area to get nomination papers to you for your signature.

"These four outstanding Republicans are counting on our help! Read more >>
Friend,
Did you see the news?
House and Senate leaders now plan to POSTPONE the special elections scheduled for March 31st, to ensure voter safety as our Commonwealth and our nation deals with the coronavirus outbreak.
This presents us with an immediate new challenge. Our four outstanding Republican candidates running for these legislative seats now must sustain their campaigns for at least several more weeks until May 19th.
At the same time, we’ve had to cancel a number of fundraising meetings and scale back our operations on the ground.
We MUST ramp up our digital efforts to reach and engage with voters... and now more than ever before, we’re depending on our online supporters.
Will you chip in today, to help us rush support to our special election candidates?
Even $5 or $10 will be a HUGE help. But if you’re not able to help during this difficult time, we completely understand. Please only donate if you can afford to do so.

"When it comes to COVID-19 “rules,” it’s all about the money. Read more >>
Friend,
Over the last four years, the attacks on President Trump have been relentless. The president has worked diligently during this pandemic to keep us from harm’s way, yet the Democrats have used this global crisis to push their agenda.
We can’t let this continue!
It’s hard to pretend there is no agenda when looking at things like church and football. In our Commonwealth, if you want to attend Mass, you must stand six feet apart. You must wear a mask. And when Mass is over, you may only exit the church through designated doors.
Then there is the NFL, which is a contact sport, yet players are not required to wear masks on the field. The teams travel from city to city to play games. The new NFL COVID rulebook even states that players should NOT take a test on game days, because a false positive could significantly affect the competitiveness of a game.
Politicians are literally making COVID rules based around how it might affect game play in the NFL, but we’re supposed to believe this isn’t about money.
Big government is controlling our lives, and we need to take action to take our autonomy back. President Trump believes in Americans to take care of themselves and their families, and make smart decisions.
That’s why we are asking everyone who is able to help President Trump win reelection by donating $45 now. We want to do everything we can to keep the 45th president in the White House for another term!
DONATE $45 FOR THE 45TH PRESIDENT!
We can’t even imagine how power-hungry the Democrats will be if Biden is elected this November. If you like your freedom and liberty, please chip in now to keep Joe Biden out of the Oval Office.
We can still Keep America Great, but only if we fight back against the Democrats and the government control they love so much.
For our future,
MassGOP

"Leftists like Chuck Schumer aren’t even trying to hide their radical agenda anymore. Read more >>
Friend,
We’re down to the wire! There are only ten days left until one of the most important elections in decades.
There is so much on the line in 2020 — we need to make sure the GOP wins BIG at every level.
Radical leftists like Chuck Schumer are threatening to fundamentally change America. He recently talked about making Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico states, a move that would likely add four Democratic Senators to our government.
The Democrats also want to add more seats to the Supreme Court, and pack it with more far-left extremists who won’t hesitate to legislate from the bench.
Our only hope of stopping them is YOU. We need to get every single registered Republican to the polls by November 3rd, and we need your help to get them there.
Will you please chip in $10 for 10 days to go until the election?
We need the funds to place targeted online ads, make phone calls, send last-minute mailers, and take care of our dedicated team of grassroots volunteers.
We are all working harder than ever in these final days, and your gift might be what puts us over the top for VICTORY!

Friend,
It’s more important than ever for the GOP to show up STRONG in Massachusetts.
I want to give an update to our chairman Jim Lyons tonight to show him that Bay Staters are rallying together to support President Trump and his America First agenda.
We’re working hard to raise enough money to reach half a million voters in 2020 to defeat Ayanna Pressley and her fellow Beacon Hill radical Democrats.
Will you chip in $10 right now to show President Trump we have his back?
2020 is going to be a BIG year for Republicans. We already saw Mike Garcia take over disgraced Katie Hill’s old seat in Los Angeles county. Now we’re making way for a red wave in Massachusetts!
We’re well on the way. Americans are sick of the politics-as-usual agenda. But your support now will help us defeat Pressley and reach key voters in 2020.
Help me out and let me give Jim an amazing report tonight, will you?
Donate what you can NOW to ensure a Republican majority in Congress.
With your help, we’re going to win this thing.

I hope you and your family are well and remaining positive during this truly difficult time.
I wanted to follow up on the message Jim and our team sent you recently.
We’re living in a new reality when it comes to political campaigning... and I want you to know that we’re working hard to adapt and overcome.
The four upcoming legislative special elections – now moved to May 19th (for two State Senate seats) and June 2nd (for two State House seats) will be all about turnout. Now more than ever, our Republican candidates need all the help we can provide.
As we practice social distancing, we’ve had to stop door-knocking and other on-the-ground activities for the foreseeable future.
Instead, we’re doubling down on our phone, mail and digital efforts!
That’s why your support now is so important. We need to immediately raise additional funds to sustain these efforts during the critical weeks ahead.
Please don't feel pressured. We know this is difficult time.
If you can help, please make a $5, $10, or $25 contribution, or more if you can.
Every dollar we raise will help us reach voters as we work to SWEEP these elections!

"Kevin O’Connor needs our support to defeat Ed Markey. Read more >>
Friend,
As if it wasn’t already abundantly clear that politics in Massachusetts have gone so far to the left that it’s practically a dystopian nightmare, this should confirm it.
Sitting Senator Ed Markey, one of the most radical leftists in Washington, recently called to disarm the police in Portland, and “every other police department in America.”
How many innocent people will be hurt by violent criminals if police officers don’t have the means necessary to protect them?
I’m forwarding you an email from Kevin O’Connor below, and I hope you take just a moment to read it. Kevin is a principled conservative, and he’s the Republican nominee running to defeat Ed Markey.
Markey is already on thin ice. Between his narrow primary victory over Joe Kennedy, and his extremist views on everything from climate change to disarming the police … Massachusetts voters are sick of it and ready for a change.
Please chip in what you can now to help Kevin win big this November, and bring a red wave to our great state!

Subject: Disarming police?
I've always said that defunding the police is a bad idea.
Brave members of our law enforcement community put their lives at risk every day to ensure our neighborhoods and communities are safe, but liberal Ed Markey is taking his hostility towards police officers to a whole new level.
Just yesterday, Markey tweeted that we must disarm officers in every police department in America - which would risk the lives of thousands of cops across the
country.
Massachusetts and the rest of America would be made less safe if Ed Markey gets his wish to disarm every cop in America. It’s time we sent someone to the Senate who truly represents us.
I’m leading the fight to make sure radical ideas like this never make it into law, but I need your help in this campaign. Could you rush a $50 donation today to help me win?
We only have 49 days left to make the case to voters, and I need your support to win this race. Please donate today so we can expose Ed Markey’s radical ideas.

"Help Republicans get on the ballot
Dear Friend,
You were asked, so many of you delivered.
Last week’s emergency request for signatures helped put the ball in motion. Now it’s time to push it over the goal line.
As now, there is still no word as to whether the Legislature will act to address the crucial task of signature gathering related to November’s general election. Deadlines for state and federal candidates are rapidly approaching, and there is simply no time to sit back and wait for the Legislature to act.
You should know that the Massachusetts Republican Party is doubling down on efforts to connect voters with their corresponding Republican candidates for public office, with the goal that these hard working candidates satisfy the state’s requirements for certified signatures.
Typically, this work would be completed on the ground, by way of face-to-face voter interaction.
That tried-and-true, person-to-person connection, the lifeblood of past successful campaigns, is no longer safe nor feasible. The job must be done digitally, and then by way of direct mail.
MassGOP staffers have been working to bridge this gap between candidates and voters, but they cannot do it alone.
Today I ask you once again to share our signature page with friends, neighbors, family members, and anyone else you think who might like to see a change to the Radical Left’s status quo on Beacon Hill:
[[URL REDACTED]]
It takes less than 60 seconds to fill out the above form, but it will make all the difference for that Republican candidate who is just a few signatures shy of reaching the state’s threshold.
Your help is crucial to our success.
To Victory,

Friend,
Have you had enough of the radical left yet? They want to defund the police and legalize abortion through nine months and beyond.
Now they’re going to do everything they can to keep President Trump from filling an open seat on the Supreme Court.
It’s funny how they were singing a different tune back in 2016 when Justice Antonin Scalia died. At the time, Joe Biden said, “The American people deserve a fully-staffed court of nine,” and Hillary Clinton said, “The president nominates and then the Senate advises and consents, or not, but they go forward with the process.”
We need to fill this seat. Mitch McConnel has already stated that the Senate will vote on the president’s nominee. And it’s never been clearer the importance of keeping our Senate majority.
We need principled leaders in Washington, and we have a Senate race right here in the Bay State that we can flip RED. Kevin O’Connor is the conservative we need, and we need your support to defeat Ed Markey.
Will you please chip in what you can right now to help us win BIG?

We need every patriot to donate what they can before our end-of-quarter FEC deadline. September 30th is our last reporting period for fundraising before the election this November, and we need to show up strong!
The Dems think they have this in the bag, but I’m on the ground every day in our great state talking to real people, who are sick of politics as usual. Even the fact that Ed Markey narrowly won his primary for Senate speaks volumes!
We can win big for Republicans this fall. But we need every conservative to stand up and help us fight the good fight.

Friend,
Joe Biden is compromised, and SHAME on the U.S. mainstream media for its silence.
I hope you caught Tucker Carlson’s interview with Tony Bobulinski this week, exposing the extreme corruption of the entire Biden family.
The leftist media in America isn’t reporting on it, but they even know in Europe! It’s frontpage news at The Daily Mail, as it should be here on CNN, MSNBC, NYT, WaPo, and many others.
Can you imagine if this story was reversed, and the solid evidence leaked about collusion with Communist China and the Ukraine were about President Trump? The media would be having a field day!
That’s why we need every single Massachusetts conservative to chip in $5 right now to expose this story. If the mainstream media won’t do it, then we have to work EXTRA hard to get the word out, and get the vote out for President Trump!
There are just FIVE DAYS left to win big for Trump, and keep the corrupt Bidens far, far away from the Oval Office.
CHIP IN $5 TO EXPOSE JOE BIDEN!
This should be a slam-dunk win for President Trump, but with the media refusing to report the truth, it’s up to us to bring it home for the President.

Friend,
I want to give a big thank you to every Massachusetts Republican who has chipped in this month so far to right the ship on Beacon Hill. We’ve had a great response, and we’ve almost hit our goal!
Earlier this month, I reached out to you with a goal of getting 500 online donors to chip in before midnight on July 31st. We’re just hours away from our deadline right now, but there’s good news.
We only need 18 more people to chip in to reach our goal! If everyone reading this chips in a few bucks, we will absolutely crush it.
Will you donate $5, $10, $20.20, or even more right now to help us right the ship in the Bay State?
It’s about time we disrupt the Democratic super majority on Beacon Hill. I recently got the opportunity to speak with former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, who was the architect behind the Contract with America in 1994.
Because of Newt, Republicans gained a majority in the U.S. House of Representatives for the first time in four decades!
Newt thinks we can do the same thing in Massachusetts. Residents are getting sick of the far-left agenda pushed by radical liberals like Elizabeth Warren and Ayanna Pressley. We’re ready for real change, and we have a plan to bring it.
Please take a moment and make a secure, online donation. The future of our beautiful state may depend on it.

The Massachusetts primary is around the corner on September 1st. I am working overtime to amass an army of Republican candidates running in the fall to challenge the Democratic stronghold.
However, none of this is possible unless we catch up to Democrats in fundraising. I must have stronger numbers to immediately support nominees after the primary on September 1st.
Our GOP candidates across the state are being outraised and outspent by their liberal opponents.

Will you donate and make a pledge of $5, $10, $25, $50, $100, $250, or what you can now? Your pledge will not be charged until August 31st.
If everyone chips in, we will raise $30,000 or MORE in vital support to candidates who need it the most. With your help, we can show the liberals that we have the resources to fund dozens of Republicans running in state elections.

2020 is here, and we’ve been ramping up aggressively in recent months.

The fact is, here in the Bay State we know what Warren’s about better than anyone.

"President Trump made a promise to America, and he KEPT it. Read more >>
Friend,
Promises made, and promises kept.
President Trump promised in 2016 that if he was elected as President of the United States, he would nominate Constitutional conservatives to serve on the Supreme Court, should he get the chance.
In less than four years, the President has nominated three such candidates, and the Senate has confirmed all three. Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh came first, and the most recent, Amy Coney Barrett, was just this week.
Did you see her swearing-in ceremony? It was fantastic, and such a reminder of the promise kept by President Trump!
My husband Jim has been hard at work to support commonsense conservatives, and that includes reelecting President Trump.
He asked me to write to you and ask you to please donate what you can in these final days of the election to support the President, and commonsense conservatives across Massachusetts.
Will you please chip in now for a 50-50 split with Massachusetts Republicans and President Trump?
CHIP IN $200 NOW >>
CHIP IN $100 NOW >>
CHIP IN $50 NOW >>
CHIP IN $10 NOW >>
Every dollar counts in the fight to bring a red wave to the Bay State, and KEEP AMERICA GREAT. Jim is doing what he can, but he can’t do it without you.
Please, dig deep and give today. The future of our state and nation depends on it.
Thanks,

"Kevin O’Connor is a Constitutional conservative who can beat Ed Markey! Read more >>
Friend,
Holding onto our Senate majority has never been more important. President Trump has promised to nominate a replacement for Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the Supreme Court, and liberal heads are exploding.
Our own far-left Democratic Senator Ed Markey said his party “must abolish the filibuster and expand the Supreme Court” if they regain power.
Putting aside the rest of Markey’s radical agenda, this comment alone is enough to motivate us to kick him out of the Senate! That’s why we’re supporting Kevin O’Connor in the 2020 U.S. Senate race in Massachusetts.
Kevin is a lawyer who understands that the Senate has a Constitutional responsibility to consider a candidate if the president nominates one.
Let’s defeat radical Democrat Ed Markey and support Kevin O’Connor.
Will you please chip in now to help Kevin win in Massachusetts this November?
Tomorrow is our last end-of-quarter deadline before the election, and we need to send a strong message that we’re sick of the Democrats’ radical agenda.
SUPPORT KEVIN O'CONNOR FOR SENATE!
We can bring a red wave to the Bay State, but only if everyone steps up to support candidates like Kevin. I hope I can count on you!
Thanks,
Jim Lyons

"I Need Your Help!
> Dear Friend:
> I hope you and your loved ones are doing as well as possible during these difficult times. As you know, our campaign has been working hard to secure the signatures necessary to get on the ballot.
> Last week, I won an historic case in front of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial court allowing electronic signatures. Democrats in the legislature opposed our reforms. We took them on and beat them!
> The Court ruled that the signature law the Democrats wanted to keep in place violated both our U.S, and Massachusetts Constitutions. Acting in the interests of public health and democracy, the Court reduced the signature requirements and allowed electronic signatures for this primary season.
> Everyone told us we couldn't successfully take on the Democrat power brokers. Well, ”everyone” underestimated us.
> This is how I will conduct myself as your next Senator: Stand up for what is right, offer common-sense solutions, and work tirelessly for victory.
> A huge WIN but we aren't done yet... and I need your help.

Dear Friend,
Vote Tomorrow!
Did you see Matt and Kevin in the Herald?
I wanted to make sure you saw this article about my husband Kevin. It ran this weekend with the cute picture of him and our son Matt voting:
Also, the Boston Herald endorsed Kevin O'Connor for US Senate, with some pretty strong language:
""Massachusetts needs a voice of common sense in the Senate, someone who will fight for the men and women who work hard, pay their taxes and deserve safe communities and a better future. For the Massachusetts Republican primary for U.S. Senate, the Boston Herald endorses Kevin O'Connor.""
View Article
I love my husband, and you can be sure he's the right candidate. Remember to vote O'Connor tomorrow!
﻿
Thanks,
Janet
P.S.--Your donation to the campaign goes a long way toward victory! With you on the team, we can get the message out, in the mail, on the radio and tv, and every other way we can--Kevin O'Connor is the right choice for US Senate!

"Democrats in America are joining the Trump team every single day. Read more >>
Friend,
The Democrats are in panic mode.
Since Joe Biden was name the Democratic nominee for POTUS, top liberals have been encouraging the most bizarre behavior.
Hillary Clinton advised Biden to “not concede under any circumstance.” Nancy Pelosi said, “I don't think that there should be any [presidential] debates.” Democrats across the liberal news media have been warning that Trump is going to try to steal the election.
Let’s be honest — it isn’t Republicans who try to steal elections.
Even with top liberals like Hillary Clinton and Nancy Pelosi making so much anti-Trump noise, the hard-working Democrats in Massachusetts and America are waking up. They are pledging their votes to Donald Trump every single day, because they can see that today’s Democratic party is not the same party as it was with JFK.
Nancy Pelosi and her ilk have pushed the Democratic party so far to the radical left that average Americans are fleeing.
We’re curious to know what our top supporters think about Democrats jumping off the Joe Biden ship. Will you please take a short survey to share your thoughts? It should take less than one minute to complete, and will help us out a lot!
TAKE THE SURVEY! >>
Thank you so much for your time. We’re encouraged by the numbers we’re seeing of people signing on to support President Trump regardless of their political party, but there is still a lot of work to be done.
Together though, we can spread our conservative message and bring a red wave to our great state.

"It's time to send them a message
It should surprise no one by now.
Massachusetts Democrats want to keep the state’s businesses -- and you -- locked down, and dependent upon an unelected government bureaucracy.
Tired of the never-ending unconstitutional edicts? Do you believe that Massachusetts residents and business owners are more than capable of reopening safely, without unnecessary government interference? Do you think that unelected bureaucrats should be more focused on figuring out what went wrong at our state-regulated nursing homes and less focused on dictating which of our businesses must remain closed?
If so, please add your name to this petition, and if possible, please share with as many family members and friends as possible.

Friend,
Did you catch the VP debate this week?
Mike Pence and Kamala Harris went head-to-head, and it’s never been clearer that we need to elect conservative leaders!
Vice President Pence asked Senator Harris point blank if she and Joe Biden will try to pack the Supreme Court if he is elected, and she refused to answer him.
Our own ultra-progressive Senator Markey has gone on record saying that Democrats should pack the court.
This is madness!

Friend,
I hope you saw my email yesterday about how important it is that we support Kevin O’Connor for U.S. Senate in Massachusetts.
Not only do we absolutely need to get rid of far-left socialist Ed Markey, we need to get a real conservative in this seat!
Ed and his buddy Chuck Schumer are going to pull out all the tricks to derail Amy Coney Barrett’s confirmation. President Trump couldn’t have chosen a better candidate to fill the current vacancy, and it’s the Senate’s DUTY to confirm her.
It’s just another example of why we need to take down these radical Democrats from power. They are more interested in playing partisan games than actually helping the American people.
Will you please join me in supporting Kevin O’Connor to defeat Ed Markey this November?

"Pelosi announces House will draft articles of impeachment
Dear Friend,
The Democrats’ impeachment sham is moving full-steam ahead. On Thursday morning, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the Democrats' plan to file articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump.
What should alarm Democrats is the fact that despite their televised impeachment show, polls show that the majority of Americans remain unmoved.
DONATE TODAY
What should also alarm them is the support President Trump has been getting from donors like you.
Let’s keep the momentum going! Donate today to remind the Democrats that every step towards impeachment will be met with GOP fundraising the likes of which they have never seen.
Impeachment backlash prompted record fundraising in October, and all signs point another record-breaking November. With December upon us, let’s keep going.

"O'Connor has my vote for US Senate
Dear Friend,
You and I have battled together for better government on many fronts, and Tuesday, I want you to join me in voting for Kevin O'Connor for US Senate.
Kevin's team put together a video endorsement, and I've linked to it below the signature line. But I wanted to add a personal note. Kevin is a great candidate. He's smart, experienced, and committed. And he's got a tough row on primary day.
Perennial candidate Shiva Ayyadurai is on the Republican ballot, too. You may remember from 2018, Ayyadurai is known for outlandish claims while running against me in the general election for US Senate. Your vote is especially important, because turnout will be low, and Ayyadurai is spending big in his effort to fool reasonable Republicans to vote for him.
Take a look at the video. If you can, make a contribution to O'Connor for US Senate campaign. And by all means, get out and vote for Kevin O'Connor on Tuesday, September 1st!
Thank you,
Geoff Diehl

Friend,
We know things are tough right now with the coronavirus, but we’re still committed to moving full-speed ahead on our operations for elections. Now more than ever — we cannot afford to have these leaders anymore.
We need to do everything in our power to elect more Republicans at the local and federal level in 2020.
Our average donation is just $43 — will you match that today, friend?
Just look at what the liberal elitists like Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer have been doing in Congress. Small businesses across the country are in dire need of financial relief, and the Paycheck Protection Program ran out of money before even a fraction of those in need received aid.
Republicans tried to pass an additional relief bill to provide an additional $250 million to the small businesses that have been hit the hardest, and the Democrats blocked it.
We want to show our state-wide support and get 149 more donors to contribute to our 2020 Victory Fund before the end of the month.
Americans are in dire need, and we need to elect conservatives to office who will put their constituents first. The Democrats have shown time and time again that they’re more interested in political games than in serving their country.

Republicans are in dire straits heading into the 2020 election season in Massachusetts.
The Democrats are out-spending us big time, and we’re in danger of losing to the Beacon Hill radicals.
I am counting on your immediate support to raise $71,428. Your support will help us reach 500,000 voters in 2020 to defeat Ayanna Pressley’s socialist agenda and re-elect President Trump!
Pressley is so far left.
She has been criticizing Governor Charlie Baker’s extremely cautious plan to reopen the economy after enduring the coronavirus shutdown. If she had her way, every single Bay Stater would be on the government dole.
We’re facing an uphill battle to elect principled conservatives across the state, and we need emergency funds to reach voters and get them to the polls in 2020.
Will you donate $5, $25, $50, $100, $250, or any amount you can generously afford?
2020 is set to be a critical election year. Massachusetts is going to play a key role.
People want strong leaders in Congress who will go to bat for them, not mealy-mouthed politicians who are practically dragging our country towards socialism.

"It’s only been one day of SCOTUS hearings, but it’s clear where the left is going. Read more >>
Friend,
What a day!
Amy Coney Barrett held her own during the first day of her confirmation hearings for the United States Supreme Court, and she was fantastic.
The left was in full attack mode against her, and using their usual tactics.
According to Chuck Schumer and his liberal buddies in the Senate, Amy Coney Barrett will bring in the apocalypse — there will be abortions in the street, and immigrant children will die of starvation without Obamacare.
I wish I was exaggerating, but sadly, this is what we’re up against.
They can’t stand that a strong, female, conservative, CATHOLIC was appointed by the President of the United States of America for the highest court in the land. They’re going to do everything they can to stop it, including baseless character assassinations.

Our own Massachusetts Senator Ed Markey has openly threatened to pack the court with liberal justices if Joe Biden manages to win the White House this November.

I’m on the ground every day talking to the good citizens of our great state, and it’s clear they are sick of politics as usual in Massachusetts.
We're ready to confront the Democrats' brand of socialism at every turn, and we're ready to fight back against the Beacon Hill radical Democrats -- in addition to the likes of Ayanna Pressley, who has used to her position in Congress to demand ""unrest in the streets"" as rioters in Portland and in Kenosha do exactly that.
Our team has identified principled conservatives running for state office across Massachusetts, and they are counting on critical funding we can provide them in the next two months before the general election.
Will you help us support our candidates, and shake things up on Beacon Hill this election season?
Thanks for your support,

"This is our first major test of 2020... help us pick up a seat in the House!
Friend,
March 31st is coming up fast... and there’s no time to waste as we ramp up to win.
With four seats on the ballot for special elections, this is our first major test of 2020. It’s vital that we stand our ground, and we have an excellent opportunity to “flip” the 37th Middlesex House District seat currently held by the Democrats!
Today, we’re kicking off an urgent fundraising drive to rush resources into these districts.
Our team has put together a budget for our advertising and ground game efforts. We need to raise $27,709 by March 3rd so we are prepared for the elections.
** Tap or click HERE to rush a $5, $10, $25, $50, $100, or $200 “Victory Fund” contribution, or more if you can!
We’re working hard to make 2020 the year we take back our Commonwealth, and this is our first major test.
Friend, Beacon Hill Democrats believe they’re invincible... we see that in their unhinged agenda, from a massive gas tax hike to making Massachusetts a sanctuary state to forcing a Planned Parenthood-crafted sex education curriculum on our kids.
Their latest scheme?
They want to follow California’s lead on extreme and authoritarian “climate” legislation, a move that would grow bureaucracy and pick the pockets of every Massachusetts family!
Stand with John Cain, who’s running to keep the 2nd Hampden Hampshire State Senate District “RED” on March 31st. Stand with Kelly Dooner, who’s running to represent the 3rd Bristol House District. Let's make sure we’re fully prepared to support the candidate who wins the March 3rd Republican primary for the 1st Plymouth and Barnstable State Senate seat.
And let’s stand united to DEFEAT the Democrats in the 37th Middlesex House District, to “flip” this seat and amplify our Republican voice on Beacon Hill!
We can make 2020 a year of historic wins for our Party. But we can’t do it without you.
Please make your most generous contribution today to help us reach our goal!
We can’t let up in the fight for limited government, free enterprise, and respect for hard-working taxpayers... and we’re grateful to have you on board.

"Democrats stoking Marxist class warfare
July 9, 2020
Dear friend,
In case you missed it, the Democrats on Beacon Hill are scheming again. This time, they’re pushing radical legislation that would extend the current moratorium on evictions for non-payment of rent by at least a year.
Incredibly, this new moratorium would kick in after the commonwealth’s current pandemic-related emergency order is lifted.
This scheme is yet another shameless example of the Democrats’ efforts to further punish Massachusetts taxpayers, property owners, commercial real estate managers, and landlords. This proposal will also wreck an already-reeling commercial real estate industry and make recovery near-impossible.
Housing providers, meanwhile, who have managed to weather the pandemic are still bearing their expenses while providing an essential service - a place for residents to shelter.
The Democrats’ answer is this blanket legislation that ignores the economic realities small, family-owned and women-owned businesses face. This proposal essentially calls for providing free rent to people who remain employed and those on fixed incomes. It will cause banks to stop lending and create a liquidity crisis.
Beacon Hill Democrats are manipulating the current emergency to pave the way for state-sanctioned rent control.
Will you sign our petition opposing their misguided proposal?
Housing providers have already sacrificed enough over the last several months. Nobody is paying their mortgages for them. This is a bill to cancel rent collections for the next twelve months, even for those tenants who can pay.
Please sign our petition today.
Tell the Democrats that this madness must stop.

Fellow Conservative,
Our need to back the blue has never been more apparent than in 2020.
I just walked off stage at tonight's debate, and I wanted to send you a quick update.
Did you have a chance to watch? If you missed the debate, I encourage you to find it online tomorrow.
I think it is clear that Markey was outmatched tonight, and we expect a HUGE bump in interest in this race. We need to be prepared.
Will you chip in $5, $10, $25, $50 or $100 tonight to help the campaign?
We have just 29 days to go until Election Day on November 3rd. There is no time to waste.
Tonight was a great opportunity to reach additional voters and highlight the clear contrast between Ed Markey's radical platform and my commonsense ideas for Massachusetts.
From defunding and disarming the police to packing the Supreme Court, it's clear that after decades in politics, Ed Markey has lost his way.
It's time to stand and fight to win this race in the final weeks. Please give today if you can.
Thanks for your support,
Kevin O’Connor

Friend
I’m writing to make sure you saw our recent message. You can read it below.
Your involvement is CRUCIAL as we ramp up for a big year ahead!
I just met with the team, and they gave me an update on our crucial end-of-month fundraising drive. The response has been strong... but we still have $8,593 to go to reach our goal, and our deadline is at midnight.
If you haven’t donated yet, I’d like to personally ask you to take a moment right now to support our efforts.
Tap or click here to chip in $10, $25, $50, or $100... or more if you can!
As you may know, we have four legislative special elections heating up – with the opportunity to pick up a Democrat-held seat in House. We’re also working hard to expose liberal extremist Elizabeth Warren’s true colors to the nation, and gear up to compete and win key races across our Commonwealth this November.
It’s critical that we have EVERY Republican on board to build the grassroots ground game it will take to gain ground and advance our Party’s principles. Rush your support TODAY!

Jim,
2020 is here, and we’ve been ramping up aggressively in recent months.
We must keep up the pressure on our far-left liberal congressional delegation to END this impeachment witch hunt once and for all... and we have a special role to play in defeating Elizabeth Warren!
The fact is, here in the Bay State we know what Warren’s about better than anyone.
Her extremist true colors MUST be exposed – she belongs nowhere near our nation’s highest office!
With so much on the line in 2020, we must have the resources we need to make an impact on the national level and gain ground across Massachusetts.
We’re behind this month, and still need to raise $23,690 before midnight this Friday.
** Please tap or click here to make a $10, $25, $50, $100, or $250 contribution!
Enough is enough of far-left extremists like Elizabeth Warren dividing our nation. It’s disgraceful that she “represents” our Commonwealth on the national stage.
We must take the fight to Warren and her allies, and continue building the massive grassroots outreach campaign we need to take on the entrenched liberals and DEFEAT them at the ballot box.
Every bit of support is a HUGE help. Please respond today!

Friend,
These are truly unprecedented times we are going through as a nation. This outbreak has impacted our country in more ways than anyone could have predicted, including our scheduled elections.
The Legislature has acted, and new election dates have been set.
Our State Senate special elections will now take place on May 19th, and the House special elections will follow two weeks later on June 2nd!
This presents us both an opportunity and a major challenge.
We have several additional weeks now to reach and win over voters... but we must have the resources to do so, and we need to focus our efforts almost entirely online!
Please, only if you can afford to do so, make a $5 or $10 contribution today. It’s vital that we sweep these four special elections, to set the stage for this November.
You can select which race or races you’d like to chip in toward. Simply follow these links:

This presents us with an immediate new challenge. Our four outstanding Republican candidates running for these legislative seats now must sustain their campaigns for at least several more weeks until May 19th.
At the same time, we’ve had to cancel a number of fundraising meetings and scale back our operations on the ground.
We MUST ramp up our digital efforts to reach and engage with voters... and now more than ever before, we’re depending on our online supporters.

I am overwhelmed by the support we’ve received over the last week. Thank you to all those who’ve stepped up to help during this difficult time.
We’re now locked in prolonged special election campaigns in four key legislative districts!
All four were previously scheduled for tomorrow. Now, they’ll take place in May and June.

Friend,
We hope you got a chance to participate in our recent presidential survey!
It seems like Democrats have been jumping ship when it comes to Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, because they see that they are not their parents’ and grandparents’ Democratic party.
Today’s Democrats have gone so far to the left that Americans are fleeing!
We asked our followers a few questions about their thoughts on the Democratic party.
Without further ado, here are the results:
1) Do you know any democrats who are voting for Trump? 39% yes, 31% no, 30% unsure
2) Do you believe the media has been lying about President Trump since the day he announced he was running for President in 2015? 93% yes, 3% no, 4% unsure
3) Do you believe Joe Biden will not concede if Trump wins this election? 50% yes, 21% no, 29% unsure
4) Do you believe the riots in Democrat cities are purposefully being allowed to happen by Democrat mayors to help elect Biden? 95% yes, 2% no, 3% unsure
5) Do you believe President Trump will win on November 3rd? 81% yes, 5% no, 14% unsure
We hope this has been as eye-opening for you as it has been for us! And if you get one thing out of this, remember to have hope. America is a center-right country, and Americans aren’t going to let the radical left transform our great country.

Subject: Democrats for Trump?
Fellow Conservative,
The Democrats are in panic mode.
Since Joe Biden was named the Democratic nominee for POTUS, top liberals have been encouraging the most bizarre behavior.
Hillary Clinton advised Biden to “not concede under any circumstance.” Nancy Pelosi said, “I don't think that there should be any [presidential] debates.” Democrats across the liberal news media have been warning that Trump is going to try to steal the election.
Let’s be honest — it isn’t Republicans who try to steal elections.
Even with top liberals like Hillary Clinton and Nancy Pelosi making so much anti-Trump noise, the hard-working Democrats in Massachusetts and America are waking up. They are pledging their votes to Donald Trump every single day, because they can see that today’s Democratic party is not the same party as it was with JFK.
Nancy Pelosi and her ilk have pushed the Democratic party so far to the radical left that average Americans are fleeing.
We’re curious to know what our top supporters think about Democrats jumping off the Joe Biden ship. Will you please take a short survey to share your thoughts? It should take less than one minute to complete, and will help us out a lot!
TAKE THE SURVEY! >>
Thank you so much for your time. We’re encouraged by the numbers we’re seeing of people signing on to support President Trump regardless of their political party, but there is still a lot of work to be done.
Together though, we can spread our conservative message and bring a red wave to our great state.

Friend,

Massachusetts Democrats know that voters are getting sick of politics as usual on Beacon Hill. Why else would they be pouring so much money into races that used to be solidly blue?
It’s only July, and they’ve already raised $33 MILLION for far-left candidates like Ayanna Pressley!
It’s time for a sea change.
I had the honor of speaking with Newt Gingrich recently, and he asked me how he can help Republicans in our great state.
I told him about our plan to raise money for principled conservatives across the state to rebuild our party — just like he did in 1994 in Congress.
He was so impressed by our plan, that he recorded a special message just for Massachusetts Republicans.
Click or tap to watch Newt’s message about bringing a red wave to the Commonwealth.
This is a man whose efforts resulted in the first Republican majority in Congress in over 40 years. He knows how to win what seems to be an unwinnable battle, and he believes we can do it here in Massachusetts.
The liberal machine is obviously afraid, or they wouldn’t be going out of their way to pour so much money into their candidates!

Friend,
Have you heard about our Minuteman Program?
We officially launched this new effort in early fall of last year, as a special way to recognize outstanding GOP candidates and offer them a strategic plan designed for success.
The candidates who are selected are enrolled in a campaign “boot camp” set up by our staff, where goals are set, progress is tracked, and donors are introduced.
It’s all about winning... and we know you agree we need to do ALL we can to win big in 2020, to increase our Republican representation on Beacon Hill!
This month, our featured Minuteman is Alec DiFruscia, who is running to become the State Representative for the 19th Middlesex District (Tewksbury and Wilmington).
Take a moment to read more about Alec below.
Alec DiFruscia is a young man who is passionate about bringing balance and accountability to Beacon Hill, and fighting with all he has for our Republican principles.
Alec is not a career politician, he’s worked in the private sector his entire adult life... and knows the value of hard work and perseverance.
He’s also made a firm pledge to NEVER vote for a sanctuary state or a tax increase!
Alec is working incredibly hard in this race – knocking on doors, making phone calls, and attending and speaking at local events.
He’s doing the hard work it will take to win... and that’s what makes him our February Minuteman of the month!
Stay tuned for future updates on our Minuteman Program.

Friend,
It’s hard to believe, but we are just 40 days out from the election. And with the passing of Ruth Bader Ginsberg, there is more on the line than ever.
Mitch McConnell just confirmed that the Senate will vote on Trump’s nominee, and by the left’s own words, we need to move quickly to fill this vacancy.
After Antonin Scalia died in 2016, Joe Biden said, “The American people deserve a fully-staffed court of nine.”
Hillary Clinton said, “The president nominates and then the Senate advises and consents, or not, but they go forward with the process.”
Nancy Pelosi also added, “What we’re seeing here, and I hope this is temporary, is a disrespect for the Constitution. … The American people expect the president’s nominee to be given a fair hearing and a timely vote in the Senate.”
Of course, we know that they won’t hold true to their own words, because they only do that when it benefits them. Which is why we HAVE to hold onto the Senate. We’re supporting Kevin O’Connor to defeat Ed Markey, and we need your help.

They viewed a post celebrating the pinnacle of achievement for five incredible women from all walks of life as a “political and partisan statement”?
It gets worse though. They’ve delved into partisan politics before, but somehow didn’t have a problem leaving the tweet up when it was about Hillary Clinton:
Talk about hypocrisy! Are you sick of the radical left’s cancel mode? Have you had enough yet?
If you have, please donate now so that we can support conservative candidates across Massachusetts who won’t try to “cancel” a phenomenal woman because they don’t agree with her personal politics.

The only way we defeat the radical left is to vote them out, and replace them with principled candidates. Please send your best gift now to help us get every single GOP voter to the polls this Tuesday.
We can win, but we can’t do it without you!

"Joe Biden lied more times than we could count during the debate. Read more >>
Friend,
Did you see the final debate between President Trump and Joe Biden?
Joe Biden lied so many times we lost count!
He sidestepped the leaked laptop story about his son Hunter by calling it a “Russian plant” even though Hunter’s former business associate, Tony Bobulinski, called their denial a “blatant lie”!
He said he has never opposed fracking. He said that raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour won’t cause any businesses to let anyone go. He said no one lost their health insurance under Obamacare.
The only thing he said that was true is that he wants to end the entire U.S. oil industry!
We are only 6 days from the election. 6 days to support President Trump’s reelection, and keep Lyin’ Biden OUT of the White House.
What else is Joe lying about? What else WILL he lie about?
Please help us keep him out of the Oval Office, and away from leading America down a socialist path!
We need a leader like President Trump, whose first priority is protecting Americans, not political gain for himself.
Please chip in $5, $10, $25, $50, $100, $200, or whatever you can right now to defeat Lyin’ Joe Biden.
If we don’t all come together, America as we know it may cease to exist.

Friend,
The 2020 presidential election is heating up fast.
It was stunning to see Elizabeth Warren come in THIRD here in Massachusetts on Super Tuesday... that’s gotta hurt!
As we look ahead to November, we’ve set a critical goal. We’re writing because we need your help.
We want to deliver at least 1.5 MILLION votes to President Trump!
>> Please sign our pledge to Vote for Trump & Keep America Great <<
Then, after you do, please share this email with at least five family members or friends, and urge them to sign the pledge too!
In 2016, 1,090,893 Bay Staters voted for the President. We KNOW that reaching 1.5 million votes is achievable... but we need every Republican on board, and we need to win over swing voters.
It’s time to rally our Party like never before, and remind reasonable independent voters across Massachusetts about what’s at stake.
President Trump has delivered OUTSTANDING results to build a stronger, safer, and more prosperous America... while the Democrats have veered so hard to the radical left that they’ve plummeted right off the cliff!
Sign the pledge to vote HERE, and forward this email to your family and friends.
\- MassGOP Team
P.S. Can you share this email with five friends or family to help grow our coalition?

"Emergency call for signatures to get Republicans on the ballot!
Dear Friend,
Did you see the latest news about Beacon Hill Democrat leadership’s stubborn insistence to ignore addressing the state’s signature-gathering thresholds?
Now the Democrats’ surrogates at the Boston Globe are beginning to sound the alarm. Why?
Even U.S. Sen. Ed Markey, a congressional mainstay dating back to the Ford administration, is struggling to collect enough certified signatures to satisfy the threshold. If a 44-year Democrat incumbent is having trouble qualifying for reelection, maybe that will be enough for House Speaker Robert DeLeo and others to act (hey, remember how fast they acted to raise their own pay?).
But we can’t afford to keep waiting. To get our candidates on the ballot in November, we must redouble our signature collection efforts.
The pandemic may have complicated the job, but those of you who have signed up and helped others register are making a difference.
We still need more of you, however.
Click the link below and fill out the on-line form with your address. We'll work with the candidates in your area to get nomination papers to you for your signature.

The deadline for state and federal candidate signature submissions is rapidly approaching. We need your help .... now.
Completing the on-line form takes less than 60 seconds. Share with your friends, family members and neighbors.

"Dear Friend,
I'm writing to remind you to vote today. And when you do, vote for Kevin O'Connor for US Senate.
If you want to read more about why Kevin is the right choice, read this editorial from The Boston Herald. The editorial board not only gives Kevin a stamp of approval for this week, it lays the groundwork for an O'Connor victory in November.
You might note that the Herald didn't so much as mention Kevin's primary opponent, Shiva Ayyadurai. Perennial candidate Ayyadurai isn't credible to them for a whole bunch of reasons, but we have to take his challenge seriously.
Your vote for Kevin is crucial to ensuring we have a credible, Senate-ready candidate in this very important year.
Thanks so much. Get out and vote!

"Did you catch what Joe Biden DIDN’T say at the debate? Read more >>
Friend,
Our need to back the blue has never been more apparent than in 2020.
In Democrat-run cities across America, violent mobs are out of control. Liberals are trying to defund the police. Businesses are literally burning to the ground, and people are being murdered.
If there was ever a time to call for law and order in recent history, this is it.
Joe Biden refused to call on the mayors of Seattle, Portland, Minneapolis, and others like them to ask them back the blue! Is this the man we want in the White House — one who won’t condemn chaos and destruction in America?
We need to reelect President Trump and make sure the Democrats don’t get any more power. They are destroying America, and in times like these, we need a real leader like Donald Trump heading the country.
Please chip in $5, $10, $25, $50, $100, $250, or what you can right now to help reelect the president.
With your help, we can Keep America Great and support our police officers. They deserve our thanks, not our contempt.

We know that Massachusetts Republicans are stepping up in a big way because they are sick of politics as usual in our great state.

Friend,
I just saw Jim’s earlier email about how critical the elections are in 2020.
As Massachusetts Republican State Committeewoman 1st Essex Middlesex District, I want to do what I can to get the word out about the importance of electing principled conservatives in Massachusetts this year.
I told Jim I would reach out to you. I am trying to raise $2,600 in the next 48 hours.
Everyone sees the madness and radical extremism this year. We need to Keep America Great, and that starts with getting people in office who will respect law and order.
Jim has a plan to elect 54 Republicans in the Bay State.
Will you help out by donating $5, $25, $54, or any amount you can generously afford right now? Click here to donate.
Our Republican candidates give me a lot of hope for the 2020 elections. They are good men and women who are committed to standing up against the Beacon Hill radical Democrats, and having President Trump’s back.
We’re in the middle of some very trying times. We need effective leaders who won’t turn a blind eye to the violent protests and they know how to revive our economy.
Many of our candidates come from a small business background and I know they will be able to fight for our local businesses. Our economy will depend on how we jumpstart businesses after the COVID shutdown.

Friend,
Are you sick and tired of the Beacon Hill Democrats’ tax-and-spend, open borders, socialist-driven agenda? Are you ready to DO something about it?
If you answered “YES!”, then we need your help.
We’re ramping up aggressively to DEFEAT vulnerable Democrats in 2020... and our first big test is coming up fast on March 31st!
Four seats will be on the ballot for special elections – including the 37th Middlesex House District, where we have a great opportunity to pick up a seat currently held by the Democrats. It’s vital that we fire up Republicans, connect with independent voters, and get out the vote for our candidates.
Our finance team just ran the numbers. We still need to raise $23,913 before deadline on March 3rd.

Last fall, we commissioned a poll of Bay State voters in 25 battleground districts. The results should have been a wake-up call to Beacon Hill Democrats... but they haven’t let up one bit in their push to drag Massachusetts to the left.
More than 50% of voters DISAPPROVE of the direction these radicals are taking our state, including 58% of independents!
Yet they continue to push an unhinged far-left agenda, from tax hikes to making Massachusetts a ""sanctuary state” for illegal immigrants to extreme pro-abortion policies that would allow children’s lives to be taken right up to and BEYOND the moment of birth.
It’s no wonder that only 65% of DEMOCRAT voters polled believe Beacon Hill Democrats are taking our state in the right direction!
Let’s make 2020 the year that we turn the tide in Massachusetts. It’s long overdue.
Help us WIN BIG on March 31st. We must stand our ground in the three Republicans seats on the ballot, and seize this opportunity to pick up a seat in the House!

Friend,
It’s time to step up.
Massachusetts Democrats know that Bay Staters are getting sick of politics as usual on Beacon Hill. Why else would they be pouring so much money into races that used to be solidly blue?
It’s only July, and they’ve already raised $33 MILLION for far-left candidates like Ayanna Pressley!
It’s time for a sea change.
I had the honor of speaking with Newt Gingrich recently, and he asked me how he can help Republicans in our great state.
I told him about our plan to raise money for principled conservatives across the state to rebuild our party — just like he did in 1994 in Congress.
He was so impressed by our plan, that he recorded a special message just for Massachusetts Republicans.
Click or tap to watch Newt’s message about bringing a red wave to the Bay State.
This is a man whose efforts resulted in the first Republican majority in Congress in over 40 years. He knows how to win what seems to be an unwinnable battle, and he believes we can do it here in Massachusetts.
The liberal machine is obviously afraid, or they wouldn’t be going out of their way to pour so much money into their candidates!

"Friend,
Get a load of this.
After spending so much energy on drafting two phony articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump, the Democrats are refusing to pass them along to the Senate.
Led by left-wing radicals like our own U.S. Rep. Jim McGovern, chairman of the House Rules Committee, the Democratic Party is now withholding the same impeachment articles they claimed they so urgently needed to pass.
Under President Donald Trump, the American economy is soaring to new heights, with an unemployment rate that hasn't been this low in decades.
With your donation, you can help us find and run no-nonsense Republican candidates who can compete and win against the likes of radical leftists like Rep. McGovern.
Did you know that Rep. McGovern has never held a full-time job in the private sector?
With your help, we can give Washington insiders like Rep. McGovern the opportunity to also reap the benefits of Trump's booming private sector economy. Even he will be able to find a job!

Give the gift of Trump's economy!

"Dear Friend:
Hope you are continuing to stay safe during this time. As you know, we have been working to ensure Kevin has the signatures he needs to get on the ballot in the most difficult signature collection environment we have seen. WITH OUR DEADLINE THIS TUESDAY, MAY 5TH, THIS IS THE FINAL PUSH.
Just a few weeks ago, Kevin won a historic case in front of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial court allowing electronic signatures. Power brokers on Beacon Hill opposed our reforms in the interest of incumbent protection.
Kevin took them on, and beat them!
The Court ruled that the signature law the legislature wanted to keep in place violated both our U.S, and Massachusetts Constitutions. Acting in the interests of public health and democracy, the Court reduced the signature requirements and allowed electronic signatures for this primary season.
Everyone told us we couldn't successfully take on the Beacon Hill establishment. Well, ”everyone” underestimated us.
This is how Kevin will lead as our next Senator: Stand up for what is right; offer common-sense solutions, and work tirelessly for victory.
But we aren't done yet.. and candidates need your help.
There are many candidates running for Congress in 2020. Due to the restrictions on signature collection, it has been very difficult to get the required number. Let’s help get them on the ballot by e-signing their nomination forms below. Don’t forget to share this with your Facebook friends around the Commonwealth! This is not a declaration of support on your behalf, but merely allows the democratic process to move forward despite the challenges of COVID-19.

"It’s our last chance to raise emergency funding for John Cain! Find out more >>
Friend,
It’s our last chance to send emergency support to John Cain to win his special election for the Massachusetts State Senate!
He urgently needs help to edge out Democrat John Velis and achieve a GOP upset in the 2nd Hampden and Hampshire District.
Republicans in the Bay State are sick of the liberal ruling class, and it’s imperative, especially during times like these, to show the Beacon Hill elitists that we’re not going to take it anymore.
2020 is already turning into a big year for conservatives. Last week we saw two major victories for the GOP — Mike Garcia in California, and Tom Tiffany in Wisconsin. Let’s keep that momentum going and help John Cain win big in Massachusetts!
Will you chip in $5, $25, $50, $100, $250, or what you can for last-minute, emergency support? Click here to contribute online.
Every dollar raised can help us reach voters by phone and online and get them to the polls to cast their votes.
Time is running out, and we need to make a strong showing that we’re pushing back against the Democrats. Will you please help?

We are living through some trying times right now.

"Markey's stubborn refusal to even consider this accomplished woman is simply wrong.
Dear Activist,
Join me tomorrow at 10 a.m. in front of North Station to rally support for Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett.
My opponent, incumbent Senator Ed Markey, never gave Barrett a chance. He's said he won't even meet with her to discuss her nomination. And he is pushing to pack the court, should Biden win the election.
Join me on the Causeway Street side of North Station, by the escalators. Let's show Ed Markey that Massachusetts supports Barrett! We're stronger when we act together!
Thanks,

"We need your help to elect 54 Republicans. We have a plan and your support will help execute it.
Friend,
I just got out of a meeting with Jim and wanted to send you a quick note and ask a favor.
We’re doing an end-of-quarter push to support 54 Republicans for state office, and Jim is worried that we are falling behind.
At our current rate, we’re not going to hit our goal by July 1st, but it’s not too late!
Will you chip in $5, $10, $25, $50, $100, $250, or what you can now to help us out?
We need every conservative to step up and make this a reality. If we raise $3,419 in the next 48 hours, it will put us back on track.
It’s never been more obvious that we need conservative leadership in Massachusetts. As our very own Attorney General flippantly said, ""America is burning, but that's how forests grow."" We need to stop the burning now and restore order and prosperity.
The elections are critical in 2020, and we need your help to get principled men and women into office.

"We need solid leadership more than ever on Beacon Hill. Will you join the fight? Read more >>
Friend,
America is burning, yet as our own Democrat Attorney General Maura Healey happily pointed out, ""but that's how forests grow.""
Democrats like AG Healey are encouraging radical extremism as we head into the 2020 elections.
The news is everywhere and impossible to ignore. This is what we are up against.
I have a plan to get 54 Republicans elected on Beacon Hill. Will you help me raise $50,000 this month to support them?
This is the antidote to the chaos in the streets: electing law-and-order Republicans.
Will you pitch in $5, $10, $25, $50, $100, $250, or any amount you can generously contribute?
I want to highlight two candidates in particular we’re supporting right now.
The first is Matt Kelly, a proud father, entrepreneur, and patriot, running for State Senate. He’s served as a member of the Franklin Town Council since 2009, and is honored to serve the community that offers so much to its citizens.
The second is Steve Hall. Steve is also a proud father and entrepreneur, and also an inventor. As a former machinist and toolmaker, he knows the value of an honest day’s labor, and has learned that effective leadership starts with listening, caring, and a commitment to service.
These are the leaders we need on Beacon Hill. Leaders who will stand up to people like Attorney General Maura Healey and her far left policies. Leaders who will support President Trump and his America First agenda.

Friend,
There are only 50 days left until the election on November 3rd, and we’re going to have to work harder than ever if we want to prevent the left from destroying everything President Trump has worked so hard to build since 2016.
The liberals are already making plans to:
• Raise taxes
• Defund the police
• Open our borders
• Put Americans LAST
We can stop them and preserve freedom and liberty in America, but only if we work together now, before it’s too late!

"Have you signed the pledge? Please review & respond now!
Friend,
Did you see the email we sent the other day?
We’ve kicked off a VITAL effort to grow our Party and turn the tide in Massachusetts...
We’re working to deliver at least 1.5 million votes for President Trump on November 3rd!
With everyone practicing social distancing due to coronavirus, this is a way you can help grow our party online.
Here’s what we’re asking you to do:
1) Sign our pledge to Vote for Trump & Keep America Great
2) Ask at least FIVE people you know to do the same!
As you know, we’re working hard to share our message across the Commonwealth and win over voters.
I can report that we’re making great progress... but the fact is, we need to make this a grassroots effort involving EVERY Republican if we’re going to take back Massachusetts!
Please be part of this critical effort. We appreciate ALL your support, Friend!
Please stay safe.
Sincerely,
John Milligan
Political Director, MassGOP

Subject: Pledge now to KEEP AMERICA GREAT!
Date: March 11th, 2020 4:17 PM
Friend,
The 2020 presidential election is heating up fast.
It was stunning to see Elizabeth Warren come in THIRD here in Massachusetts on Super Tuesday... that’s gotta hurt!
As we look ahead to November, we’ve set a critical goal. We’re writing because we need your help.
We want to deliver at least 1.5 MILLION votes to President Trump!
>> Please sign our pledge to Vote for Trump & Keep America Great <<
Then, after you do, please share this email with at least five family members or friends, and urge them to sign the pledge too!
In 2016, 1,090,893 Bay Staters voted for the President. We KNOW that reaching 1.5 million votes is achievable... but we need every Republican on board, and we need to win over swing voters.
It’s time to rally our Party like never before, and remind reasonable independent voters across Massachusetts about what’s at stake.
President Trump has delivered OUTSTANDING results to build a stronger, safer, and more prosperous America... while the Democrats have veered so hard to the radical left that they’ve plummeted right off the cliff!
Sign the pledge to vote HERE, and forward this email to your family and friends.
\- MassGOP Team

Friend,
We only have 4 days until the primary, and only 3 days left to submit your pledge to help elect Massachusetts Republicans across the state.
We can’t stand idly by while the radical Left tightens its control by outraising and outspending the principled leaders working for REAL change on Beacon Hill.

"Markey's people don't want you to see this!
Dear Republican Friend,
Kevin O'Connor won last night's US Senate debate, hands down.
If you missed seeing it live, watch here, and help me spread the link to the debate video!
You can help Kevin win. Send the link to the debate video to five friends. Or 25! The more people we convince to watch, the more votes Kevin will pick up.
This is the ONLY DEBATE Markey agreed to. He knows that if voters see both him and Kevin in action, voters will choose Kevin. Markey's politics are looney left--he's in favor of disarming and defunding the police, he supports allowing abortion up to and including the moment of birth, and he co-sponsored the Green New Deal, a pseudo-environmentalist package that even Joe Biden can't support.
Together, you and I can build a grassroots effort to make sure Massachusetts voters make the right choice--Kevin O'Connor for US Senate.
Thanks,
Wendy Wakeman
KOC for Senate Campaign
P.S.-- I can't let this email fly without asking you to contribute to Kevin's campaign. Click here to donate $25, $50, $100, or whatever amount you can afford. We must get out the message--O'Connor for US Senate!

"Had enough liberal lunacy yet? Read more >>
Friend,
You have likely heard the news of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's passing this weekend.
Within hours of her passing, the radical left came out swinging claiming President Trump should NOT fill her seat.
Let's be clear on what needs to be done.
President Trump should nominate and the Senate should vote on the President's Supreme Court nominee BEFORE the election.
Elizabeth Warren came out against filling the seat: ""Mitch McConnell and his henchmen believe that they can ram through a Supreme Court justice only 45 days from Election Day.""
But apparently she doesn't think you know what she said on this subject back in 2016: “…do pretty much everything they can to avoid acknowledging the legitimacy of our democratically-elected president … I say to you, do your job, vote for a Supreme Court nominee. … If you want to stop extremism in your party, you can start by showing the American people that you respect the President of the United States and the Constitution.”
Massachusetts residents are sick of radical leftists saying one thing one election and another the next. They want to fundamentally transform America and they don’t want the people of Massachusetts to know it!
But we can beat them and bring a red wave to Massachusetts. Republicans in our great state are sick of the games, and are ready to preserve commonsense conservatism for generations to come. Part of plan is to ensure Kevin O’Connor defeats Ed Markey this November, but we need every Republican on board.
Will you help us make sure President Trump and the Senate fill this seat by sending your best gift right now?

Friend,
Today is the day — it’s time to get out there and VOTE!
The polls are open all over Massachusetts today, and I am urging every single Republican to cast their ballot if they haven’t already.
I’ve been on the ground all over our state, talking to the hardworking men and women who call our great state home. It’s obvious that Massachusetts residents are sick of politics as usual, and ready for a sea change.
But it’s not going to happen unless every single conservative votes!
🚨 Find your polling location 🚨
So please, if you haven’t cast your ballot yet GO VOTE ASAP, and don’t go alone.
Bring family members, friends, neighbors, and anyone you know who hasn’t voted yet. We need to score a decisive victory for President Trump, Kevin O’Connor for Senate, and local candidates across the state.
Let’s finish this race firing on all cylinders and celebrate a big win tonight!

"The Impeachment to Nowhere
Friends,
They’re really going to do this.
Our all-Democrat Massachusetts Congressional delegation is going to vote to impeach the president.
After reviewing the inspector general’s investigation into the origins of the phony “Russian collusion” smear, it’s clear to us that the FBI has ruined itself.
Tomorrow, House Democrats will ruin themselves as well.
Now that Rep. Stephen Lynch has finally buckled, every elected member of Congress from Massachusetts has fallen in line.
Won’t you donate today by clicking here to help us find and elect common sense candidates who will actually fight for us in Massachusetts and not the elite Democratic Party power brokers in Washington?
In January 2017, it was clear to us that the Democrats’ worst nightmare was that a Trump presidency would enable Americans to succeed on their own, and much to their horror, that’s exactly what happened.
Chip in today, click here to help us send this cabal of out-of-touch Democrats packing and elect true Massachusetts representatives to Congress!
Then, remind your representative to give up the charade and DO YOUR JOB!

There will be DOZENS of legislative seats in play on Election Day 2020... we have a huge opportunity to increase our numbers and FIGHT BACK against the Democrats’ dangerous and destructive radical-left policies! You can read more about their agenda below.

John,
Are you sick and tired of the Beacon Hill Democrats’ tax-and-spend, open borders, pro-abortion agenda? Are you ready to DO something about it?
If you answered “YES!”, then we need your help.
We’re ramping up aggressively to DEFEAT vulnerable Democrats in 2020... and our first big test is coming up fast on March 31st!
Four seats will be on the ballot for special elections – including the 37th Middlesex House District, where we have a great opportunity to pick up a seat currently held by the Democrats. It’s vital that we fire up Republicans, connect with independent voters, and get out the vote for our candidates.
Our finance team just ran the numbers. We still need to raise $23,913 before deadline on March 3rd.
Rush a special “Victory Fund” contribution TODAY to help!

Last fall, we commissioned a poll of Bay State voters in 25 battleground districts. The results should have been a wake-up call to Beacon Hill Democrats... but they haven’t let up one bit in their push to drag Massachusetts to the left.
More than 50% of voters DISAPPROVE of the direction these radicals are taking our state, including 58% of independents!
Yet they continue to push an unhinged far-left agenda, from tax hikes to making Massachusetts a ""sanctuary state” for illegal immigrants to extreme pro-abortion policies that would allow children’s lives to be taken right up to and BEYOND the moment of birth.
It’s no wonder that only 65% of DEMOCRAT voters polled believe Beacon Hill Democrats are taking our state in the right direction!
Let’s make 2020 the year that we turn the tide in Massachusetts. It’s long overdue.
Help us WIN BIG on March 31st. We must stand our ground in the three Republicans seats on the ballot, and seize this opportunity to pick up a seat in the House!

Friend,
How are you doing with the shutdown? I hope that you are staying safe and well during this coronavirus pandemic.
To say things have changed drastically over the last month or two would be an understatement. People are naturally worried about being affected by COVID-19, and most citizens are practicing social-distancing measures to help flatten the curve.
We’re doing our part to stay at home too, friend, which is why we need your help online more than ever.
Will you donate now to keep our momentum going online?
I’m trying to get 43 new seats filled with Republican candidates, and this is an urgent fundraising blitz to help get them started.
During this time of national crisis, we’ve had to cancel all in-person fundraising events, but our elections are still moving forward. Every dollar counts to get out the vote and get principled conservatives into office.
Our average donation is $43.05. Can you match that and give today, friend?
Online support is vital during this trying time, but we want you to take care of yourself and your loved ones first and foremost. Please only give if you are able.
If you can, please donate now to keep us going and ensure a solid victory for Republicans this November. Your help matters more than ever.

"Help Republicans get on the ballot
Dear Friend,
This week I directed my communications team to issue a press release questioning why Beacon Hill Democratic leadership, in drafting emergency legislation addressing the electoral process during this worldwide pandemic, neglected to address the crucial task of signature gathering.
As you know, the state Legislature is dominated by the Radical Left, and for these entrenched incumbents, ensuring a fair fight at the ballot box ranks low on their list of priorities.
It would be irresponsible of us to wait for them to act.
That the Democrats blatantly ignored this aspect of the electioneering process is shameful.
Rolling out a backup plan must be our priority, and we must act now.
Therefore, to make sure that Republican candidates can get on 2020 state election ballots in November, the Massachusetts Republican Party is launching a mail-driven signature campaign.
We will be mailing out individual nomination papers, but we desperately need your help. I urge you to take a moment to fill out your home address info on the following landing page:
[[URL REDACTED]]
From here, MassGOP staff will match your information with your local Republican candidate(s.) These candidates will then reach out to you during their own signature-collecting drives, with the mail-in option ensuring safety and well-being for all.
﻿Additionally, those who may have questions or would like to make a direct request for nomination forms can reach us at 617-523-5005.
Your help is crucial to ensure that our slate of Republicans will be able to earn positions on ballots in November.
To Victory,﻿

"President Trump thinks Antifa should be declared a terrorist organization. We want to know what you think. Read more >>
Friend,
It’s hard to ignore the protests that have been happening across the country in the wake of the brutal killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer.
Thankfully, many of the protests have been peaceful … but sadly, many have turned into riots, complete with looting and violence, and in some cases, even death of innocents.
What’s the difference? According to Attorney General Barr, “We have evidence that Antifa and other similar extremist groups have been involved in instigating and participating in the violent activity.”
It seems that when Antifa shows up to a protest, they show up to destroy property and instigate violence and chaos. They even come waving their communist flags!
They are an extremist leftwing group that pushes a radical agenda.
But are they terrorists?
President Trump thinks so.
He recently tweeted, “The United States of America will be designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization.” He later said at a press conference, “Those who threaten innocent life and property will be arrested, detained, and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. This includes Antifa and others who are leading instigators of this violence.”
We want to know if you agree with the president that Antifa should be declared a terrorist organization.
Will you please spare a quick minute by CLICKING HERE to take our survey?
Your opinion matters to us on these important issues.
﻿We know tensions are high right now, but violence is never the answer. All Antifa seems to be doing is stoking racial strife and insurgency. That’s the last thing we need.
Let us know what you think.
Thanks for your support,
MassGOP

"Oct. 1, 2020
Dear Friend,
By now, you may have heard -- our persistence and hard work has finally paid off. We have managed to secure a formal confirmation from my opponent, U.S. Rep. Katherine Clark, to participate in a debate.
I could not have done this without the pressure you helped generate after Rep. Clark repeatedly dodged our scheduling attempts even after she agreed on record during an interview with the Boston Globe.
She will now be forced to explain why she has prioritized her own ambitions to serve as number two to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ahead of serving the people from our great Fifth Massachusetts District.
Click here to donate to Caroline’s Campaign!
You have been instrumental in helping me to build this powerful movement for accountability, but we cannot afford to take our foot off of the gas pedal.
It’s going to take everything we’ve got to defeat Rep. Clark and her army Congressional insiders.
Can you please consider chipping in whatever amount you can to help us compete?
Be sure to stay tuned as we work to schedule an official date for debate!

"We have to keep corrupt Joe Biden OUT of the White House! Read more >>
Friend,
Joe Biden has been in politics for 47 years, and in that time, he’s only created ONE job — for his corrupt son Hunter Biden.
The story recently broke that Hunter profited off the Biden name when his dad was the Vice President, and allegedly made millions with a sweet consulting gig with several Russian and Ukranian oligarchs.
Joe claimed that he had “never spoken” to Hunter “about his overseas business dealings,” but this photo speaks for itself:
We need to put an end to this corruption right NOW, and support President Trump for a second term!

"Twitter and Facebook aren’t even pretending anymore. Read more >>
Friend,
We always knew the media and their tech giant buddies were liberal, and now we have all the proof we need that they CENSOR conservatives.
The New York Post published some very damaging information about Hunter Biden this week, and Republicans took to social media to share it. We’ve known there was something fishy about Joe Biden’s son for a long time, and this is the evidence that America has been waiting for.
Twitter started blocking every prominent conservative Republican who tried to share it!
The Trump campaign’s account was blocked.
White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany has been “permanently banned” from her personal account unless she deletes a tweet sharing the story.
Even I’ve been censored for trying to share this information with my followers online! Look what happened when I tried to share a link:
“Potentially harmful”? Is this America or Communist China?
Hiden Biden is obviously getting help from big tech and the liberal media. And if you vote Democrat, THIS is what you’re voting for.
Will you help us push back against this radical and unbelievable censorship by chipping in what you can right now?
We are only 18 DAYS away from the election and we need your help to elect principled conservatives who won’t censor people just because they disagree with them!
CHIP IN TO FIGHT CENSORSHIP NOW!
We can bring a red wave to Massachusetts and support President Trump and his America First agenda. We can fight back against the tech giants, and even the crazy liberal media. But we’re going to have to do it together.
Are you in?

"John Cain needs our help to defeat John Velis on Tuesday! Find out more >>
Friend,
Have you heard? Republicans had major upsets this week in two key special elections!
Mike Garcia in California and Tom Tiffany in Wisconsin were both elected to the House of Representatives on Tuesday, and are leading the way for a new conservative majority in 2020.
There’s another special election coming up in Massachusetts in just a few days, and my friend John Cain needs our emergency help to win.
Will you rush $10 or what you can to help John win this close race?
He is running against Democrat John Velis in the 2nd Hampden and Hampshire District for the Massachusetts State Senate on May 19th. We only have a few days left to reach as many voters as possible and get them to the polls.
John Cain isn’t a career politician, and he won’t put party over politics.
﻿
Conservatives in Massachusetts are sick of the liberal ruling class, and electing John Cain is a surefire way to send a message that we’re not going to take it anymore.

"Our Founding Fathers deserve to be honored more than ever. Read more >>
Friend,
Our great nation was founded on the principles of liberty, limited government, and free markets.
Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence with the phrase “all men are created equal,” and George Washington led the fight for freedom against oppression from the British.
George Washington also set the two term limits for Presidents. A standard that is a major part of the American political tradition and one that curbs the power of politicians.
These men deserve to be honored and respected for the ideas they fought for and enshrined in the Declaration and in our Constitution.
Yet across the nation, mobs are defacing and destroying statues of them.
It’s never been more apparent that we need to work hard to fight for our American principles of equality under law, liberty, and limited government.
Will you help us continue to fight the socialist elites and mobs who want to rewrite our history?
Chip in $17.76 NOW! >>
Your support will go directly to MassGOP’s efforts to win elections and support Trump in 2020.
Never before had there been a government run by the people and for the people. It was a controversial and novel concept in 1776, and it hasn’t always been smooth running.
We can’t ignore that we’re going through a difficult time again as a country. But we’re going to get through it, so long as we come together to elect principled conservatives who respect the Constitution.

"Only YOU can get Republicans on the ballot
Dear Friend,
I cannot express enough thanks and gratitude to those of you who have taken the time to submit mailing information in our push to help Massachusetts Republican candidates qualify for the general election.
The response to our call for help during this difficult time for democracy has been nothing short of amazing, but we are still far short of our goal.
These candidates need more of you to sign up, and for those who have already done so, these candidates need you to share our call for action digitally with your family members, friends and neighbors.
Will you help us by forwarding this email to at least three fellow Massachusetts voters?
Our landing page, where it takes less than 60 seconds for visitors to enter their crucial voter address information, will remain live up until the as-of-now unchanged April 28 deadline:
MassGOP Nomination Signature Collection – Click Here
As I am sure you are aware, the deadline for state and federal candidate signature submissions is rapidly approaching, yet our candidates have been sidelined from the gathering practice due to necessary social-distancing safety precautions related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
There is still no indication that Democratic leadership on Beacon Hill will act to address this problem.
According to today’s report from the Cape Cod Times, Democratic leadership claims they are “assessing the issue,” but according to Secretary of State William Galvin’s office, “there have been no specific proposals yet.”
With your help, Massachusetts Republican candidates can overcome this obstacle.
With your help, we can show Democratic leadership on Beacon Hill that despite their inaction, Republicans will not be silenced.
To Victory,

"Instead of trying to unite our country, radicals like Ayanna Pressley are using this as an opportunity to pass extremist legislation.
Friend,
Our country is more divided now than ever.
Instead of trying to unite our country, radicals like Ayanna Pressley are using this as an opportunity to pass extremist legislation.
Here’s what her BREATHE Act would do:
Defund ICE and the DEA.
End life sentences.
Close all federal prisons and immigration detention centers.
End cooperation with immigration authorities.
Reduce the defense budget.
Repeal all laws that make it illegal to enter the country.
Abolishing gang databases.
Repealing all existing State juvenile offenses.
Reparations for people held in prison for certain crimes.
And the list goes on!
We need a sea-change in the Bay State. We must defeat Ayana Pressley. We have to turn Massachusetts around, and elect commonsense leaders.
Our grassroots momentum to reach Republican voters depends entirely on your donations. It takes dollars to reach voters and get them to the polls, and every dollar counts.
Can you please dig deep and give what you can right now?

President Trump is depending on the GOP to show up strong and win big this election season. We can’t take another term with radical leftists like Ayanna Pressley and her socialist squad in power.
This is still the greatest country the world has ever known, but it’s falling apart before our very eyes. We can stop the dismantling of America, but only if we win big for the GOP this November.
No one can sit on the sidelines this time — we have to work together to defeat this rampant socialism and send the message that we’re not going to stand for their blatant power grabs.
I hope I can count on you to pitch in to help us Keep America Great!
Thanks for your support,
Jim Lyons Chairman, MassGOP

"Massachusetts' own Richie Neal -- still not quite a leader, but in with the jackals
Friends,
We watched this morning's grandstanding so you didn't have to, and right there front-and-center was our own Massachusetts U.S. Rep. Richard Neal standing beside House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
Make no mistake, this partisan impeachment stunt is aimed at one thing and one thing only: to nullify your vote in November.
And there was Rep. Neal again, standing idly by as Impeachment Circus Ringleader Adam Schiff gave up the Democrats' whole game.
Had enough of this circus? So have we.
Your donation today can help send Richie Neal packing. A stronger Massachusetts Republican Party will mean better representation up and down the ballot.
Chip in and help us restore some sanity and common sense to Congress!

"I couldn’t be prouder to represent Massachusetts in the United States Senate.
View this email in your browser
Hi Friend,
Representing Massachusetts in the United States Senate is the greatest honor of my life -- and I’m so grateful for Democrats like you who fight for our values in down-ballot races across this state.
I’ll get right to it: Democrats need to win big this year\--but not just here in Massachusetts: in every corner of our country. Donald Trump and his billionaire donors have set our country down a destructive path that we’ll only be able to reverse with big, structural change.
Massachusetts Democrats don’t sit on the sidelines when there’s work to do. That’s why I’m proud to announce the first two battleground state candidates MassDems are mobilizing for this fall: Candace Valenzuela of TX-24 and Desiree Tims of OH-10.
If you’re in a place to make a contribution, can you split a donation between the MassDems and one of these inspiring candidates today? It’s absolutely critical that Democrats win elections like these to pass the bold reforms we need right now.
After experiencing homelessness throughout her childhood, Candace overcame the odds and found her home in the classroom. Education opened doors for her and paved the way for her to become the first African-American and Latina elected to her local school board. Now, she’s running for Congress to keep lifting up all hardworking families.
Desiree’s grandfather had to leave school at 6 to support his family as a sharecropper in the Deep South. His sacrifices led her to become the first in her family to earn a four-year college degree and landed her in the Obama White House. Desiree will fight for health care for all and a great public school education for every student.
We need these women in Congress. A donation from you today would help get us a step closer to passing the transformative legislation we’ll need to make this nation a place that works for everyone--not just the wealthy and well-connected.
Thanks for being a part of this,
Elizabeth Warren

I'M VOTING BY MAIL→

* October 17: Early voting in person starts.

"Now we know why MassFiscal is embarrassed by its backers. View this email in your browser
Our goal with the Wednesday Wire is to give you the tools to boost Democrats and take on Trump and his Republican allies here in Massachusetts. Use these talking points on social media, as the basis for a letter to the editor of your local paper, in emails to your personal network, or in conversations with your friends and neighbors.

Black Lives Matter. Take Action Now.
Koch Money in Massachusetts
Massachusetts Democrats Sweep in Special Elections
Trump’s Trying to Take Maine
Black Lives Matter. Take Action Now.
The murder of George Floyd was not an isolated incident, and the just protests unfurling across the country show the pain, anger, and grief resulting from hundreds of years of systemic racism and police violence against Black Americans. As activists, organizers, and allies, we know that direct and immediate action is the best way to make real change.
* Sign a petition. Black Lives Matter has an extensive list of petitions that take only a few minutes to sign, including one calling for the firing of the officers who killed Breonna Taylor in her own home.
* Support local and national activists. In addition to splitting a donation between these national and statewide groups, support other local groups calling for justice, sign on to Color of Change's platform of structural demands or the NAACP's 'We Are Done Dying’ Campaign' to support reforms to criminal justice, economic, health, and voting policy.
* Support Black-owned businesses. The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately affected communities of color. If you live in the Boston area, check out this list of Black-owned businesses to support.
* Take time for self care. The images and videos we’re seeing online and on the news can be traumatic, especially for Black folks who’ve experienced police violence. Here’s a list of things you can do to care for yourself. Mental health and self care are essential to organizing for change. View the Healing Justice and Action Toolkits from Black Lives Matter here.
* If you're an ally, educate yourself. Many organizations have compiled anti-racist resources like this one from Ibram X. Kendi. Add some anti-racist literature to your reading list this summer.
Koch Money in Massachusetts
You might remember the Massachusetts Fiscal Alliance, the right-wing organization that pretends to promote government transparency while hiding it’s own donors and pushing to overturn campaign finance laws. Well, we learned a little more about where their support comes from, and we’d be embarrassed and ashamed if our backers were affiliated with the Koch brothers, like MassFiscal.
* You already know MassFiscal--last year they were inducted into the “Hypocrites Hall of Fame” for advocating greater transparency and accountability while going to extreme--potentially illegal--lengths to conceal the funders of its right-wing, anti-Massachusetts agenda.
* Koch money has long supported MassFiscal. In its lawsuits seeking to overturn state laws restricting corporate campaign contributions and requiring campaigns and PACs to disclose their donors, MassFiscal was heavily supported by groups with significant Koch funding.
* This just proves what we already know--MassFiscal never had any intention of being the nonpartisan advocacy organization they claim to be on their website. They’re a front for the national radical-right, trying to inject their extremist agenda into Massachusetts.
Massachusetts Democrats Sweep in Special Elections
ICYMI: Democrats flipped another seat in the Massachusetts legislature--winning all four special elections decided this spring. Voters made their voices heard loud and clear: they’re done with the divisive rhetoric of Donald Trump, the MassGOP, and the radical right.
* Three seats in the legislature flipped from red to blue because voters know that Democrats are the ones who are going to get the job done for working families while Republicans follow the lead of the most corrupt, damaging and incompetent President our country has ever seen.
* All four Democrats running in this spring’s special elections ran positive, forward-thinking campaigns dedicated to lifting people up that resonated with voters across the state--especially during such an unprecedented time.
* MassDems invested in these races early, hiring new staff to focus on priority areas, and innovating new ways to campaign during a pandemic--because success this spring sets us up to win this fall.
* We’re ready to bring the same energy to the general election with our MobilizeMA campaign--a coordinated effort to in-state and battleground state support effort to kick Donald Trump out of office and elect Democrats at every level. CLICK HERE to join MobilizeMA.
Trump’s Trying to Take Maine
Donald Trump knows he’s in trouble in November--and so are Republicans down the ballot. Last Friday, he stopped in Maine to try to salvage his and Susan Collins’s reelection campaigns. He knows Maine is on track to turn bright blue, so he’s pulling out all the stops to help Collins keep her seat.
* Last week, Trump made a special trip to Maine to use essential workers as a backdrop to claim victory over coronavirus--even while the pandemic rages on unchecked.
* We already know Trump cares about his polling numbers and not American lives, so it’s not surprising that he visited a facility that makes swabs for COVID-19 testing without a mask--and they had to throw out all the swabs manufactured during his visit.
* Trump’s visit came at the end of a week where he tweeted that protestors should be shot, threatened to use the American military against the American people, and tear gassed peaceful protestors for a photo-op.
* He disguised this campaign stop as an official visit, but his goal was clear: prop-up Susan Collins--the last Republican in the New England delegation--and save her reelection bid.
* That’s why the Maine Democrats have doubled down on their efforts to defeat Collins and take on Trump in Maine and this week, they’re hosting a Call from Home Week of Action.
* One on one conversations with voters is the best way to make sure Democrats protect the House, flip the Senate, and beat Donald Trump--CLICK HERE to start talking to voters now.

Together again.
Two days ago, Donald Trump was on trial in the Senate following his impeachment by the House of Representatives.
Yesterday, Charlie Baker cowardly refused to state whether he believed Trump should have been removed from office.
Today, Baker is in Washington, D.C., sharing a meal with Donald Trump's Number 2, Mike Pence. Not even the aftermath of a historic impeachment trial could keep Baker from palling around with the Trump administration.
Help us send Baker's friends in the Trump administration packing by donating $5 right now.

Or, donate another amount
Times have been tough for the Trump administration, and during tough times you find out who your friends are. It looks like Donald Trump and Mike Pence can count Charlie Baker as a true friend.
Give whatever you can today to make sure the next time Charlie Baker meets Mike Pence for lunch, we'll have a Democrat in the White House.

"Every day from now until November is Election Day.
View this email in your browser
Friend,
We’re 11 days out from Election Day, and over a million voters in Massachusetts have already cast their ballots. Between mail-in voting and early in-person voting, every day from now until November is Election Day.
The best way to really make a difference in our Commonwealth and our country is a landslide victory for Democrats down the ballot. This close to the election, I’m asking for you to pitch in to help us ramp up efforts to get out the vote.
Will you chip in $10 to help us mobilize more voters to vote early in this election? Donald Trump and his allies are spreading misinformation about voting options and we need you to fight back.
We saw record breaking turnout in September’s primary election because Democrats fought for more than one way to cast a ballot. This year, we’ve expanded early voting options, have no excuse vote by mail, and you can even apply for and track your ballot online.
Massachusetts Democrats have doubled our get out the efforts in places like Springfield, Lowell, and in my hometown, Worcester. While Massachusetts Republicans spin lies to keep voters from the ballot box, the MassDems have launched a voter protection program to make sure every voice is heard.
With your help, we can reach even more voters and break turnout records this November. Will you chip in however much you can to help us expand our GOTV operation and elect Democrats down the ballot this November?

"This is Trump and McConnell’s last ditch effort to steal power from voters
View this email in your browser
Friend,
Last night, Mitch McConnell and Senate Republicans completed the last step in the nomination process that’s been illegitimate from the start: they confirmed Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court.
Senate Republicans jammed through this nomination to take health care away from millions during a pandemic, threaten reproductive freedom, marriage equality, and free and fair elections. They’re breaking their own rules because they know they’re losing ground in this election. McConnell said as much on the Senate floor.
Will you donate $20.20 before midnight tonight so we can ramp up our GOTV efforts in battleground states? This close to Election Day, a contribution from you could mean the difference between winning or losing on November 3rd.
We cannot allow the corrupt partisanship of Donald Trump and Senate Republicans to take precedence over justice and liberty in our country.
The only recourse now is for Democrats to end the filibuster and expand the court. There can be no justice without that. We have to flip the Senate--and we have 7 days left to do it.
Help us end Trump and McConnell’s reign by making a $20.20 contribution right now. With your support, we can reach more voters, take back the White House, and flip the Senate on November 3rd.

How You Can Help
Massachusetts Democrats Are Leading the Way
“A president unfit for a pandemic”
We needed a complete, compassionate, and coordinated federal response to this crisis--and the Trump administration has failed at every turn. Trump’s slow and chaotic response left Americans unprepared, is putting our first responders at risk and will result in the loss of American lives that could have been spared. These are the consequences of Trump’s inaction--consequences he refuses to take responsibility for. “The President has blood on his hands.” That’s a line from Monday’s The Boston Globe editorial, and we agree--”come November, there must be a reckoning for the lives lost, and for the vast, avoidable suffering about to ensue under the president’s watch.”
* Under Trump the number of COVID-19 cases in the United States has surpassed that of any other nation--while we remain far behind other countries, like South Korea, in testing per capita.
* As the first cases of the virus in the US were announced, Trump downplayed the threat. He undermined worldwide health experts, and refused to confront the looming crisis in order to “keep national case numbers (artificially) low,” and bolster his reelection campaign.
* As healthcare workers struggle to get the supplies they need to keep themselves and their patients safe, Trump insists his administration has everything under control. His inaction has accelerated the nationwide shortage of masks and ventilators.
* We needed a proactive, consistent, and informed leader during this crisis. Instead, Trump dangles “unverified cures and possible quarantines in front of the public like reality TV cliffhangers.”
* If Trump isn’t willing to hold himself accountable for worsening this crisis, voters must in November.

Democrats Online
As Democrats, we know how critical it is to keep democracy going during this pandemic--in new ways that align with the recommendations from health experts. This crisis has shown all of us just how important it is to have effective, informed, and compassionate leaders at every level of government, and how crucial it is to elect Democrats up and down the ballot. Democrats are finding ways to connect with voters and engage with their communities
* Democratic candidates running in the upcoming special elections for state legislative seats know how serious this situation is, and they’re committed to doing their part to limit the impact of this virus. Each campaign has made adjustments to focus on things like phone banking and virtual town halls. Get involved in one of the four races happening this spring:
* John Velis for State Senate
* Susan Moran for State Senate
* Dan Sena for State Representative
* Carol Doherty for State Representative
* We’re taking our trainings online. Over the past week, we’ve hosted 6 online trainings to help folks get acquainted with remote conferencing tools. We’re also hosting our weekly Votebuilder training on [[URL REDACTED]], sign up here.
Sign up for one training or phone banking shift and share how you’re keeping democracy going online using #mapoli and tagging us @massdems.
How You Can Help
We must all do our part to flatten the curve, and keep our friends, family, and everyone around us safe and healthy over the next few weeks. Here are a few of the ways you can help others during this uncertain time.
* Donate blood: The need for donations has grown, and with some collection locations closed due to COVID-19, it’s become more difficult to satisfy the needs of Massachusetts hospitals. Set up an appointment with the Red Cross to donate blood at a site near you.
* Donate supplies: If you have things like masks, rubber gloves, or goggles, consider donating them to medical professionals on the front lines of this pandemic. You can view a detailed list of items and the donation form here.
* Volunteer: Contact your local officials to see how you can help combat this virus in your community. Led by Mayor Marty Walsh, the City of Boston and over one thousand volunteers coordinated a city-wide lit drop to get vital information out to residents--in 7 different languages! If you’re a Boston resident, sign up to volunteer here.
Help out however you can and share these resources with your networks. We all need to do our part to keep our friends, family, and neighbors safe.
Massachusetts Democrats Are Leading the Way
Massachusetts Democrats in Congress and the Senate are leading the fight against the coronavirus pandemic in Washington. They’re taking this threat seriously, and have been fighting to make sure that people have the funds, care, and resources they need during this public health crisis.
Show them some love on your own social media platforms.
Thank our elected officials for their efforts by sharing these tweets with your networks with #mapoli and tagging us @massdems.

"Our country is facing a moral crisis--and we still don't know where Charlie Baker stands.  View this email in your browser
Dear Activist,
Our goal with the Wednesday Wire is to give each of you the tools to take on the Republican Party and help boost Democrats in Massachusetts - so we encourage you to use these talking points on social media, as the basis for a letter to the editor of your local paper, in emails to your personal network, or in conversation with your friends and neighbors.
If you have any questions about this program or would like to see more about a specific issue area, please don't hesitate to reach out to our Communications Manager, Allison Mitchell.
Please share the articles below with your networks and please also be sure to use the hashtag #Mapoli or #BakerFail when sharing this information on social media.
What has Charlie Baker had to say about the State of the Union?
Nothing at all.
Last night, Donald Trump delivered his final State of the Union address--a speech more fit for one of his MAGA rallies than the House Chamber. His Republican lackeys cheered as he spent nearly 80 minutes boasting about cutting funding for public services, leaving millions of Americans without healthcare, and bringing our country to the brink of war. What have Governor Charlie Baker or Lieutenant Governor Karyn Polito had to say about all this? Absolutely nothing.
* Trump has spent the past three years putting children in cages, attacking civil rights, siding with the NRA, and denying climate change--but Baker says he doesn’t want to get involved.
* From immigration to food security, Massachusetts residents are feeling the impacts of Trump’s policies here in the Bay State, but Baker refuses to take a stance on some of Trump's most heinous and divisive actions.
* For the rest of us, there’s no choice but to get involved. When our security, safety, and human rights are bargaining pieces for Trump’s personal and political gain, we don’t have the luxury of sitting on the sidelines.
* Baker’s silence means one of two things: either he’s too scared to break rank with his radical Republican colleagues or he’s willingly on their side.
* Either way, Baker’s silence enables Trump’s agenda.
Charlie Baker and the Senate Cover-Up: Be a Leader or Be a Coward.
Today, faced with a choice between partisan politics and the American people, Senate Republicans will complete the cover-up of Donald Trump’s crimes. After refusing to call witnesses or subpoena documents, they’ll vote to acquit Donald Trump on both articles of impeachment. The American people want, and deserve, to hear the facts, but Republicans in the Senate are happy to bury the truth to protect their own political interests. Our nation is facing a moral crisis--and we don’t know where Governor Charlie Baker stands.
* It’s clear there’s more evidence to be heard in the case against Donald Trump, but Senate Republicans denied witnesses in an impeachment trial for the first time in history.
* Weeks ago, when Baker was asked if he supported the House’s decision to impeach, he avoided taking a stand and only said that he hoped to see a fair trial in the Senate.
* A trial without documents and witnesses is not a fair trial, and today, the Senate will vote to complete the cover-up.
* Despite everything that has unfolded, from the evidence we have heard to the fact that Senate Republicans are hiding facts, we have no idea what Charlie Baker thinks about Trump’s impeachment or the Senate trial.
* Baker throws around words like “fair” and “bipartisan,” calling on us to “rise above” the divisive rhetoric. But when it comes time for him to stand up to members of his own party in defense of fairness, Baker is nowhere to be found.
* Baker and Polito owe it to their constituents to let them know where they stand; this is not campaign rhetoric, this is the future of our country.

"Tonight, Kamala Harris will join a handful of women to stand on the Vice Presidential debate stage.
View this email in your browser
Friend,
Tonight, Kamala Harris will join a very short list of women to stand on that Vice Presidential debate stage. In November, she’ll become the first woman elected Vice President of the United States.
On the brink of this historic moment for women, the Trump-Pence administration is pushing through a lifetime appointment of a right-wing nominee to overturn Roe v. Wade.
Reproductive freedom is on the ballot in November. We need you in this fight to elect Democrats who’ll protect the right to choose here at home and in critical battleground states.
Will you chip in $5, $10, $25 or $50, or how ever much you can, to defeat the Trump-Pence ticket and anti-choice Republicans down the ballot? Your contribution will go towards electing Democrats here in Massachusetts and in swing states across the country.
We need to send Trump and Pence a message: abortion is healthcare and healthcare is a human right. Senator Harris is no stranger to grilling anti-choice zealots handpicked by Donald Trump, so she’s ready to take on Mike Pence tonight. But right now, I’m asking you to stay in this fight by making a contribution.
A donation from you before Senator Harris takes the stage tonight would show Trump, Pence, and Republicans in Massachusetts that the right to choose is non-negotiable. Can you pitch in however much you’re able to elect Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and Democrats down the ticket?
DONATE NOW →
I won’t stop fighting until everyone has access to reproductive care, and I know you won’t either.
Sincerely,
Katherine Clark
US Representative

"We’re in the middle of a pandemic--and Donald Trump still wants to take away healthcare from millions. View this email in your browser
Friend,
We’re in the middle of a pandemic that’s taken more than 70,000 American lives--and Donald Trump still wants to take away healthcare from millions.
The White House and Republicans are pushing the Supreme Court to overturn the Affordable Care Act in a case set for review later this year--today is the last day to file briefs in that lawsuit.
We must protect the ACA. Add your name right now to show Trump and Republicans around the country that we won’t let them take away our care when we need it the most.
Without the Affordable Care Act, coronavirus would be a preexisting condition that would take away healthcare for millions of Americans, not to mention nearly double the amount of uninsured people in Massachusetts alone.
Add your name before midnight tonight so we can show Donald Trump that Democrats won’t back down in the fight for affordable healthcare.

"Baker hired the Holyoke Soldiers’ Home superintendent, he’s responsible for the tragedy, and must be held accountable. View this email in your browser

Welcome to the new MassDems Wire. As we approach election day, we’re moving on from our biweekly, Wednesday schedule. Instead the MDP Wire will hit your inbox whenever there’s breaking news about Charlie Baker’s management missteps or the latest stunt by Trump’s cheerleaders at the MassGOP.

Baker's Failure at the Holyoke Soldiers' Home
We Pay the Price for Charlie Baker's Silence
Baker’s Failure at the Holyoke Soldiers’ Home
After Charlie Baker swore in the new Holyoke Soldiers’ Home superintendent in 2016, reports of management problems started trickling up through the administration chain of command. Charlie Baker’s trying to “more than social distance” himself from the tragedy that took the lives of almost 80 veterans, but it matters who hired the superintendent, and looked the other way when things went south.
* In 2016, Baker’s administration hired a man with no experience in health care or long term care for the superintendent’s job at the home--Charlie Baker interviewed and swore him in himself.
* When officials in Baker’s administration started receiving reports of the new superintendent’s deficiencies and staffing shortages at the home, Charlie Baker swept them under the rug and kept him on the job.
* A Baker-commissioned report found that the deaths of almost 80 veterans at the home were directly related to the superintendent decisions--and Baker’s inaction.
* Charlie Baker wants to “put more than social distance between himself” and the superintendent. Baker hired the superintendent, he’s responsible for the tragedy at the Holyoke Soldiers’ Home, and he must be held accountable.
We Pay the Price for Baker’s Silence
Governor Charlie Baker has said he doesn’t want to get involved in presidential politics. Now, 5 months into a pandemic his party’s president made worse, and at the cross section of crises inflamed by Trump and his Republican cronies, we’re suffering unimaginable consequences.
* Baker has been content to sit on the sidelines through Trump’s entire presidency, watching while he commits criminal abuses of power, attacks basic human rights, and now is responsible for so many unnecessary COVID-19 associated deaths.
* In the past month alone, Trump’s deployed his own secret police, fueled hatred and violence, advocated for voter suppression, and floated delaying the election all while COVID-cases are hitting record highs. Baker’s never offered more than lukewarm criticism of the most corrupt and incompetent president our country has ever seen--a president Baker’s own party enables and empowers.
* 2016 had dire consequences, and the stakes are even higher in 2020. Democrats, and now even some Republicans, are working overtime to keep Trump from destroying our democracy even further. Charlie Baker’s had every opportunity to stand up to Donald Trump, or make a difference in this election, but he hasn’t.
* We are paying the price of Charlie Baker’s silence. His cowardice makes him complicit in Trump’s agenda.
We encourage you to share these talking points with your networks online and offline. Questions about the information outlined above and about the MassDems Wire program may be directed at our Communications Manager, Allison Mitchell.

"Trump’s rally was a complete failure. View this email in your browser

BREAKING: Statement from Massachusetts Democratic Party Chair Gus Bickford on Baker Administration Failings Outlined in Horrific Report on Holyoke Soldiers' Home Tragedy.
""Today's report reveals that there is plenty of blame to go around within the Baker administration for the tragedy that took place at the Holyoke Soldiers' Home. This administration installed and left in place as Superintendent an individual that was not qualified and was looked upon with caution by one top Baker official. Over the four years the Superintendent was in place, multiple red flags were raised as to his suitability, yet the Baker administration did nothing. Who knows how many veterans would still be alive if the Baker administration demonstrated basic leadership and management skills.""

Trump: “Slow the testing down”
“Arbitrary and Capricious”
Black Lives Matter. Take Action Now.
Trump: “Slow the testing down”
This weekend, in the middle of a pandemic, Trump held another one of his infamous campaign rallies in Tulsa, Oklahoma. From embarrassingly low attendance, to his racist and xenophobic comments, to admitting to undermining his own coronavirus response, the event was a complete disaster on every level.
* Trump openly admitted to--even bragged about--ordering officials to “slow the testing down” to keep the number of COVID-19 cases down and cover up his failed attempt to contain the virus.
* The White House scrambled to clean up his statement, and said Trump was “kidding” about a pandemic that has killed 120,000 Americans and left millions without jobs. Only to be contradicted by the President himself, who said, “I don’t kid.”
* Testing is what helps control the spread of the virus--but since day one, Trump’s only ever been concerned protecting his poll numbers. We should be ramping up testing, not slowing it down.
* Trump’s rally has been condemned by local health officials for putting the community at risk. At least 8 campaign staffers and Secret Service agents have tested positive so far, and with almost no one wearing masks at the rally, who knows how many more people are infected.
* The differences between the candidates couldn’t be more stark, Joe Biden has a plan to reopen the country--and speeding up testing is a critical component. When lives are on the line, we need to do everything we can to make sure Joe Biden wins in November.
“Arbitrary and Capricious”
Last week, the Supreme Court struck down Trump’s decision to end DACA, seeing through Trump’s lies and scare tactics. Dreamers deserve safety, security, and as a former Dreamer from Brazil, newly elected State Representative Dan Sena knows what it means to achieve the American dream against great odds and difficult struggles.
* Last week’s Supreme Court ruling declaring Trump’s decision to end DACA “arbitrary and capricious” was a victory for DACA recipients and allies across the country. Dreamers’ home is here--and they deserve safety and security.
* It’s fitting that just a few weeks ago, former Dreamer Dan Sena made history on Beacon Hill as the first Brazilian-American elected to the state legislature. In this article from Commonwealth, you can follow Sena’s story that led to his June 2nd landslide victory in the 37th Middlesex.
* Dan’s optimism, vision and hope for our future stand in stark contrast to Donald Trump and the Massachusetts Republican Party, which seeks only to sow hate and to divide.
* The Supreme Court affirmed what voters have been telling us across the country: Donald Trump’s hateful immigration agenda is completely out of step with American values.
Black Lives Matter. Take Action Now.
The murder of George Floyd was not an isolated incident, and the just protests unfurling across the country show the pain, anger, and grief resulting from hundreds of years of systemic racism and police violence against Black Americans. As activists, organizers, and allies, we know that direct and immediate action is the best way to make real change.
* Sign a petition. Black Lives Matter has an extensive list of petitions that take only a few minutes to sign.
* Support local and national activists. In addition to splitting a donation between these national and statewide groups, support other local groups calling for justice, sign on to Color of Change's platform of structural demands or the NAACP's 'We Are Done Dying’ Campaign' to support reforms to criminal justice, economic, health, and voting policy.
* Support Black-owned businesses. The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately affected communities of color. If you live in the Boston area, check out this list of Black-owned businesses to support.
* Take time for self care. The images and videos we’re seeing online and on the news can be traumatic, especially for Black folks who’ve experienced police violence. Here’s a list of things you can do to care for yourself. Mental health and self care is essential to organizing for change. View the Healing Justice and Action Toolkits from Black Lives Matter here.
* If you’re an ally, educate yourself. Many organizations have compiled anti-racist resources like this one from Ibram X. Kendi. Add some anti-racist literature to your reading list this summer.

"They’re using this crisis to distract from corruption in their ranks. View this email in your browser
Friend,
While radical right wing Republicans, like MassGOP Chair Jim Lyons, work tirelessly to downplay the seriousness of the COVID-19 pandemic, they’re also using this crisis to distract from corruption in their ranks.
Let’s take the case of State Senator Dean Tran. In March, just after all of our lives were upended by the coronavirus, news broke that Tran was found to have used his publicly-funded staff for campaign work, including fundraising for his own re-election effort. His conduct was deemed so egregious that he was directed not to interact with HIS OWN staff - except by email. His personal office was even moved. Reports indicate he may be under investigation by a number of state agencies for using his staff for personal benefit.
Can you chip in $5, $10, or whatever you can, to boot extreme and corrupt Republicans like Dean Tran from the State House? Help MassDems build its bench and invest in its future today.
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Give $5
Give $10
Give $25
Or, donate another amount
By the way, if his conduct on Beacon Hill isn’t enough, a report from April indicated that Tran was the subject of an ongoing criminal investigation involving weapons.
Dean Tran is jumping for joy because he thinks we missed the reports of his misdeeds. We didn’t. Let’s show him. Give what you can now.

"South Carolina needs our help to elect Jaime Harrison and finally have a Senator they can be proud of View this email in your browser
Friend,
I’ll be brief, because I don’t think you need a lot of convincing on this one.
It’s time for Lindsey Graham to go.
Jaime Harrison, our incredible Democratic candidate in South Carolina, is poised to make this term his very last.
But Jaime and South Carolina Democrats need our help and they need it now, so please donate what you can today.
This is going to be Lindsey Graham’s biggest challenge yet, and it’s our best chance at electing a real leader who understands that his role is to be a voice for all people, and who stands for Democratic values.
If you want to be able to look back and say that you helped remove Trump’s favorite lapdog from the U.S. Senate, then give whatever you can right now.
Thanks for being part of this,

Charlie Baker: “I Don’t Want to Get Into Presidential Politics”
Karyn Polito’s Patronage Pipeline
2020 MassDems Convention Caucus Season Begins
Charlie Baker: “I Don’t Want to Get Into in Presidential Politics”
Trump has spent the past three years putting children in cages, attacking civil rights, siding with the NRA, and denying climate change--but that doesn’t matter to Charlie Baker, who says he doesn’t “want to get into presidential politics.” While Baker is content to sit out the most important election of our lives, other governors from his own Republican party are saying enough is enough--Vermont’s Republican Governor Phil Scott endorsed Baker’s mentor, former Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld in the Republican primary.
Charlie Baker has a complicated, inconsistent history with Presidential elections:
* In 2016, Baker endorsed Governor Chris Christie for President, saying at the time, “I don’t ever want to be in a position where people say you didn’t have a position on something of significance and importance.”
* Then, months later, Baker made public that he didn’t even vote in the Presidential election.
* Fast forward four years and Baker’s “mentor” and former boss Bill Weld is challenging Donald Trump for the Republican nomination. But where is Baker? He is refusing to help Weld, unlike others in his Party, including Vermont Governor Phil Scott.
* We don’t expect Charlie Baker to see the light and support the Democratic nominee, but supporting Bill Weld would seem to be an easy decision for him.
* Massachusetts voters deserve to know where their Governor stands. We deserve to know whether Baker plans to fall in line with Trump and the radical right-wing of his party.
* Either Baker plans to cast his vote for Donald Trump, or he’s too scared of his cronies to speak out against him--regardless, Baker’s silence makes him complicit in Trump’s agenda.
* His silence breaks his own rule: “I don’t ever want to be in a position where people say you didn’t have a position on something of significance and importance.""
Call on @CharlieBakerMA to tell us where he stands by sharing this story on Twitter and Facebook with #StandUpCharlie and #mapoli.
The Polito Patronage Pipeline
This Valentine’s Day, Lieutenant Governor Karyn Polito knew exactly how to show her campaign donors how much she loves them--by handing another one of her donors a lifetime, high paying court appointment. The Polito patronage pipeline isn’t new. Since 2010, a string of Polito’s family, friends, and campaign donors have ended up with jobs in state offices or the court system, and Governor Charlie Baker is helping to make it happen.
* The patronage pipeline started back in 2010 when Karyn earned the nickname “Plates Polito.” When Polito was a state representative, 68 of 100 low-number vanity Red Sox license plates went to Polito, her friends, family and campaign donors.
* In 2017, the son of two Polito donors, who left his job as a court officer after being arrested for an OUI and leaving the scene of an accident, ended up in the office of the Secretary of Energy and Environmental Affairs.
* The pattern continued into last year: Polito’s son’s football coach and her old college roommate ended up with two top clerk jobs in the court system.
* She just did it again\--one of Polito’s campaign donors was handed a clerk magistrate position--while other qualified candidates couldn’t even get interviews.
* Opportunity in our state shouldn’t be defined by how much you give to Karyn Polito’s reelection campaign.

2020 MassDems Convention Caucus Season Begins
The 2020 MassDems Convention is where delegates from across the Commonwealth will come together to unify, organize, and get ready to elect Democrats up and down the ballot this November. This past Saturday kicked-off our caucus season, and over the next few weeks Massachusetts Democrats will hold caucuses in their towns and wards to talk about the issues and candidates that matter most to them.
* Last Saturday, long-time party activists and first-time caucus-goers came together in over thirty towns, wards, and cities to elect delegates to the 2020 MassDems Convention.
* We’re thrilled to see that caucus attendance was up across the Commonwealth! We’ve worked hard to ensure that this is our most inclusive caucus process yet, and we were excited to finally implement changes that better reflect our values.
* At the 2020 MassDems Convention we’ll unify around our Democratic values and prepare for work that lies ahead--electing Democrats from the State House to the White House this November.
Post about your local caucus online using #MassDemsCaucus and #mapoli.

View this email in your browser
Friend,
In 2018, we built a grassroots, people powered campaign for everyone, ousted ultra-conservative, 4-term incumbent Jim Lyons, and flipped the 18th Essex District from red to blue. Since then, I’ve been an agent of change on Beacon Hill, demonstrating everyday that I am a pragmatic leader who listens to constituents, builds consensus with my fellow legislators in order to pass legislation, and leads with compassion during a time of crisis, like this current pandemic.
Jim Lyons is now the chair of the MassGOP, and he is determined to re-take the 18th Essex District seat with an anti-choice, anti-immigrant, anti-LGBTQ Republican just like him. We need to protect this seat and keep it blue now and secure it for the future well being of everyone in the District.
Can you chip in $5, $10, $25, $50, or whatever makes sense for you, to help me win on Election Day? With only weeks until Election Day, a contribution from you helps us make sure this seat stays blue.
When I was 5, my family fled Vietnam as political refugees, and the support from folks in the Merrimack Valley made all the difference for us. I’m passionate about giving back to this community, and ensuring that every family has the opportunity to thrive like mine has.
When I was elected in 2018, I pledged to bring a new generation of leadership to the State House. We are all facing a global health crisis, an economic crisis, a crisis of racial justice, and a climate crisis all at the same time. Our district needs someone who prioritizes equity, opportunity, and justice in this seat. I am that person and ask for your support.
Pitch in however much you can to help me win on Election Day. A donation to my campaign helps me continue my work on Beacon Hill, and keeps another radical, right-wing Republican from taking this seat.

Sincerely,
Tram T. Nguyen
State Representative
18th Essex District

View this email in your browser
Friend,
Lies. Anger. Ignorance. Hate. Chaos.
If you didn’t watch the last two days of the Republican National Convention (lucky you), that’s what you missed.
Of course they can’t recognize the 180,000 lives lost to COVID-19 because Trump’s handling of the crisis took these lives.
They think the Black Lives Matter movement is a domestic terror group, so the Republicans can’t address police violence at the Convention. Instead, they gave a prime time speaking spot to the St. Louis couple that pointed guns at BLM activists.
There’s too much insanity from the last two days of the Chaos Convention, let alone Trump’s Chaos Presidency.
If you’ve seen enough, we need you to join MobilizeMA today. MobilizeMA is the vehicle through which you can put your energy to work to elect Democrats to key seats across the country.
It isn’t enough to elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. We need to flip the Senate and keep the House too.
MobilizeMA is how you can be a part of all of that. Join thousands of other Democrats from Massachusetts and get involved today.

Everything’s at stake in 2020--from health care, to climate, to gun control and more--it’s all on the line. This is the most consequential election of our lifetimes, and it starts today.
It’s the big day for the Iowa Democrats--and that means the Massachusetts presidential primary is only a month away.

"Susan Collins voted to complete the cover-up in the Senate View this email in your browser
Susan Collins voted to complete the cover-up in the Senate and acquit the most corrupt President in our history.
Collins is the only Senator from a New England state to have sided with Trump and against the American people.
We can’t trust Senate Republicans to defend our democracy. We need to take back the Senate in 2020, and that starts with voting out Susan Collins in Maine.
Maine Democrats have been knocking on doors and talking to voters, but we’re all going to need to pitch in to help Democrats take back the Senate. Can you chip in $20.20, or whatever you can, to make sure Collins is voted out in November? Your donation will be split between the MassDems and the Maine Democratic Party.
DONATE: $20.20
DONATE: $10
DONATE: $5
Trump and McConnell have been helping Collins build her war chest, which now totals $7.2 million. If we are going to have a shot at kicking Collins out of the Senate, we need to start helping Maine Democrats now.
Make a contribution of $20.20 right now to help us do our part to take back the Senate in 2020.

"Ohio is one of the most important battleground states and the road to the White House runs right through this district!
View this email in your browser
Friend,
The same week Desiree Tims moved back home to Dayton, Ohio, the Ku Klux Klan marched through the city. Tornadoes ripped through the area, and a few months after that, a mass shooting took nine lives. These events aren’t isolated.
They’re happening across the country because Republicans in Congress aren’t working for us, they’re working for corporations and billionaire donors. They’re working to enable white supremacists and deny climate change. Desiree is running for Congress to fight back, and I’m happy to support her. This is a battleground district in a battleground state, and a donation from you right now will help us flip this seat.
Can you pitch in $5, $10, $25, or however much you can, to flip OH-10 and elect Democrats down the ballot in Massachusetts too? Your donation will be split between Desiree Tims and the Massachusetts Democratic Party.
Desiree grew up in Dayton, her grandfather was a sharecropper that came to Ohio to work in the steel mills. She was the first in her family to graduate from a four year college. After working in Washington for 10 years, including in the Obama White House, she saw the people doing the legislating weren’t working for families like hers.
Desiree’s story is one of her greatest strengths, because it feels so familiar to all of us. Her opponent is one of Trump’s favorite Congressmen, and he’s got Republicans like Jim Jordan and billionaire donors showering him with tons of cash. That’s why I’m asking for your help today.
A contribution from you this close to Election Day could make all the difference. Will you chip in whatever makes sense for you right now to move another one of Trump’s cronies out of office? Your contribution will go towards electing Democrats in Massachusetts and toss-up races like Desiree's.

"ight now, the race between me and Dean Tran is close
View this email in your browser
Friend,
In the Army, the soldiers I led in Afghanistan showed me how to accomplish tough missions. It takes integrity, humility, and accountability. Qualities that I promise to bring to the State Senate if I’m elected in November.
Right now, the race between me and Trump Republican Dean Tran is close, and Democrats have a real shot at flipping this seat. This close to Election Day, a contribution from you right now could go a long way towards advocating for bold progressive action.
Will you chip in $5, $10, $25, $50, or how ever much you can, to help me win in November, and make sure Worcester and Middlesex has a State Senator who works for them on Beacon Hill?
I come from a family of dedicated public servants, and as a former Infantry Officer in the U.S. Army, I’ve spent my career serving this country too. Unprecedented challenges like the ones we face today will take strong leadership, teamwork, and commitment to the community, values instilled in me by my experiences, both here at home and overseas.
That’s the kind of representation we deserve in the State Senate, but right now, that’s not what we have. That’s why I got into this race, because we need someone who’s going to put Massachusetts over their own interests. But I can’t do this alone, that’s why I’m asking:
With less than 40 days until Election Day, can you make a contribution to my campaign to flip this seat, and elect a Democrat to the State Senate? It’s time the Worcester and Middlesex district had an advocate for them on Beacon Hill.

"McConnell knows that his job might depend on protecting Susan Collins. That’s why he and his corporate allies are flooding her campaign with cash. View this email in your browser
Hi there,
You don’t have to live in Kentucky to get rid of Mitch McConnell.
Senator McConnell, the self-proclaimed “Grim Reaper of the Senate,” has been blocking all meaningful Democratic legislation from coming up for a vote. If the Republicans keep their majority in 2020, that means no movement on health care, gun reform, or the climate crisis.
That means we need to flip the Senate. And that means we need to help our neighbors in Maine defeat Susan Collins.
Will you join me and donate $20.20 to help us #DefeatCollins and send McConnell packing? Your donation will be split evenly between the MassDems and the Maine Democratic Party.
The Maine Democratic Party is putting in the work to defeat Collins. Volunteers are knocking on doors, making phone calls, and talking to voters about Collins’ disastrous record of nearly unbroken support of Trump and McConnell. And they’re counting on us to help fund this crucial work.
You can be sure that McConnell knows that his job might depend on protecting Susan Collins. That’s why he and his corporate allies are flooding her campaign with cash.
Chip in $20.20 now to help the Maine Dems build a grassroots movement that can take on the special interests and defeat Collins and McConnell in 2020.

"There’s a lot at stake in November. Our health, our economy, our climate, our lives.
View this email in your browser
Friend,
There’s a lot at stake in November. Our health, our economy, our climate, our livelihoods. As Democrats, one thing connects us all: our commitment to working people and to a just, equitable, and livable future. But we won’t make any progress on the issues we care about if we do not defeat Donald Trump in November.
The MassDems and I have a plan to elect Democrats up and down the ballot in Massachusetts and in battleground states, and a donation from you right now would go a long way.
With only 8 weeks left until Election Day, will you chip in $20.20 right now defend our seats here at home, protect the US House, flip the Senate, and take back the White House?
We must elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris this November and remove Donald Trump from the White House. We must take the gavel back from Republican control in the Senate, and win in swing states like New Hampshire and Maine. Maine is doubly important--Susan Collins is on the verge of losing her seat in the Senate, and with it could go Mitch McConnell's leadership.
And in the U.S. House of Representatives, it’s not enough to just hold our majority--we must expand it. That’s why the MassDems have adopted three Democrats fighting in battleground congressional districts in Ohio, Kansas, and Texas.
Of course we have work to do here at home. We have to protect all Democrats on the ballot, and we can flip a few more seats in the State House while we’re at it.
This year, everything changes. The bold, transformative progress we are fighting for begins with electing Democrats at every level of government, everywhere. That’s why I’m asking one more time:
Will you donate $20.20 right now so we can launch our coordinated campaign to defeat Donald Trump, flip the Senate, expand our majority in the House, and elect Democrats down the ballot?

Dear Activist,
Our goal with the Wednesday Wire is to give each of you the tools to take on the Republican Party and help boost Democrats in Massachusetts - so we encourage you to use these talking points on social media, as the basis for a letter to the editor of your local paper, in emails to your personal network, or in conversation with your friends and neighbors.
If you have any questions about this program or would like to see more about a specific issue area, please don't hesitate to reach out to our Communications Manager, Patrick Coyne.
Please share the articles below with your networks and please also be sure to use the hashtag #Mapoli or #BakerFail when sharing this information on social media.
Charlie Baker and the Failing MBTA
After a summer of delays, derailments, and daily traffic congestion, commuters are nervously considering what a snowy winter may mean for them. Will they be unable to pick up their kids again because the T is delayed? Will traffic steal valuable time with family? Will their employer be less sympathetic if the Red line derails again? Baker has no idea what a real commute on the T is like and he’s even said he has no interest in experiencing one. Check out and share this recent column in the Boston Globe which calls Baker out for failing to do his homework and actually ride the MBTA.
* Baker says he’s not a “virtue signaler” but he has no problem breaking ground or cutting ribbons. It’s only when Baker would have to sacrifice a few of his luxuries that he has a problem with so-called “publicity stunts.”
* While the Governor spends his commute sitting in a comfortable motorcade, commuters across the state are stuck on disabled trains or standing out in the cold waiting 30 minutes or more for a train.
* It isn’t virtue signaling to understand what many of your constituents deal with every day, it’s doing your job. Baker can’t fix a system he refuses to take the time to understand.
House Dems Publish Impeachment Report
On Tuesday, the House Intelligence Committee published their impeachment report, which marks the conclusion of their investigation. The report found that Trump attempted to “use the powers of his office to solicit foreign interference on his behalf in the 2020 election.” Today the Judiciary Committee began its own hearings into Trump’s conduct.
* The Intelligence Committee’s report summed up what we already know: Trump schemed to extort Ukraine for his own political gain by withholding crucial foreign aid. Even those in Trump’s inner circle have admitted that there was a quid pro quo and that Trump himself ordered it.
* On top of testimony and other evidence, we have a transcript of Trump clearly threatening the President of Ukraine. You can’t get stronger evidence of a quid pro quo.
* Republicans know that Trump is guilty of attempting to enlist Ukraine’s help in his re-election, but they refuse to stand up to him and instead turn to Kremlin-approved talking points.
* In dangerously trying to extort Ukraine, Trump put our national security at risk and violated his oath of office in order to protect his political interests. Republicans are now doing the exact same thing in their defense of Trump.
Top Baker Administration Officials Knew of Serious Safety Issues at RMV
A new transcript released this week shows that prior to the deadly crash in New Hampshire, employees at the RMV had repeatedly warned leadership about the lack of resources and mismanagement of the Registry. One official even said that the intense focus on reducing wait times meant that “public safety was never a high priority.” She and others placed the blame directly on leadership within the Governor’s Office.
* The deputy chief of staff for customer service in Governor Baker’s office left key offices understaffed and threatened to fire employees who raised concerns about abandoning their core duties to accomplish the goal of reducing customer wait times.
* We can trace this failure of leadership that lead to serious safety lapses at the RMV directly to the Governor’s Office.
* Governor Baker paints himself as a businessman who’s an effective manager. But we’ve seen over and over again that this is false. Baker has demonstrated he is incapable of managing the most critical functions of our government, including the State Police, the RMV, and the MBTA.

"Public service is a part of who she is.
View this email in your browser
Friend,
My wife and partner, Teresa English, grew up in a military family, and joined the AirForce as an intelligence analyst, and later, became a public school teacher. Public service is a big part of who she is.
As a teacher, mom, and volunteer in Billerica, she sees firsthand how working families struggle to make ends meet during this pandemic. Those families aren’t being served by our representative in the State House.
That’s why she is running for State Representative. In this purple district, we’ve got a shot at flipping this Republican seat blue. A donation from you in the final weeks of this election would make a big difference.
Can you pitch in $5, $10, $25 to help her flip this district, and make sure all of Massachusetts is being served in the State House? Teresa and I know what it means to serve, and right now, her opponent isn’t serving us on Beacon Hill.
Serving our country and our community taught her that courage and compassion are what gets the job done. Qualities that the Republican opponent in this race hasn’t shown us in a while.
That’s why she jumped in this race in the first place. We need someone willing to do the hard work for us on Beacon Hill, and she promises to do that--not just for Billerica--but for the entire Commonwealth. But with just 25 days left until Election Day, we need your help to flip this seat from red to blue.
Will you make a donation right now to elect a Democrat from Billerica to the State House? There’s not much time left in this race, and your donation could be what helps her flip this seat in November.

Ken English

Friend,
FIRST, this election is close.
With the Trump campaign struggling in the midwest, they have gone all in trying to win crucial battleground states like Arizona. Without winning Arizona, Trump has virtually no path to reelection.
That is why today, we are teaming up with the Arizona Democratic Party to help our friends in the Copper State during the final stretch.
Our goal is to raise $5,000 by tomorrow to help defeat Trump in crucial battleground states. Will you split a $20.20 donation between MassDems and the Arizona Democratic Party?
DONATE NOW →
Trump and Republican super PACs are shelling out millions trying to rescue his failing campaign. Trump is desperate to win Arizona and is flooding the airwaves with negative ads.
We have to do everything we can to stop Trump in these battleground states. Together, we can defeat Trump and end this nightmare of a presidency.
People have already started voting in Arizona. We don’t have any time to waste. So please will you spilt a $20.20 donation between MassDems and the Arizona Democratic Party to help us reach our goal?

Friend,
I’ve been waiting four years to vote Donald Trump out of office, and that day is finally here. Today is the last day to cast your ballot for Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and Democrats down the ballot.
GET INVOLVED NOW >>
If you haven’t voted yet: VOTE. Polls are open now until 8 pm, and there’s still time to drop off your mail-in ballot if you haven’t already. Click here to find your polling location or a drop box near you.
If you have any difficulties voting, visit [[URL REDACTED]] to report voter protection concerns.
And if you’ve already voted, VOLUNTEER. We’re making calls for tight races across the country and here in MA, click here to sign up.
And tonight, spend the final few hours before polls close with Senators Elizabeth Warren and Ed Markey, as Biden for MA comes together one last time today.
MAKE CALLS WITH ELIZABETH WARREN AND ED MARKEY >>
Over 2.3 million voters had already voted before polls opened today at 7 am, and over 95 million people had already voted nationwide. Those votes must be counted, their voices matter.
We must get this right, and it will take time to count every single vote. But that’s a sign that the American people are powerful, that we are resilient.
Our democracy has persisted through pandemics and economic crises before, and in 2020, it will be the voters who decide the outcome of this election once again.

"Trump’s cheerleaders in the MassGOP suffered embarrassing losses last night. View this email in your browser
Friend,
First, let me say thank you. It’s because of the support of folks like you that Massachusetts Democrats flipped two seats in the State Senate last night--that’s right, TWO.
On a historic night in an unprecedented election cycle, voters rejected candidates handpicked by Trump’s cheerleaders in the MassGOP. But we’re not done yet. There are two seats in the Massachusetts House up for grabs on June 2nd.
Will you help keep the blue wave moving by making a $10 contribution right now to elect two more Democrats on June 2nd?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Express Donate: $5
Express Donate: $25
Express Donate: $50
Or, donate another amount
Democrats won because voters are done with Republicans whose first priority is serving their corrupt President instead of working families. Now, with just under two weeks until the next election, it’s time to ramp up our efforts to keep radical Republicans running in Taunton & Easton and Middlesex & Worcester Counties out of the State House.
We only have 13 days to finish strong in the special elections, flip one more seat and protect the Democratic hold on the other. Will you rush a $10 gift right now to make sure Democrats win on June 2nd?

Friend,
Michelle De La Isla knows what it means to fight with grit. She’s been homeless, survived domestic violence, she’s a single mother, and has struggled to make ends meet.
Her story is familiar to so many people--in Kansas, where she’s the Mayor of the capital city, and here in Massachusetts. She’s running for Congress in KS-02 because too often, these stories aren’t represented around tables in Washington.
With just 4 days left until Election Day, will you contribute $5, $10, $25, or $50 to elect Democrats like Michelle down the ballot, across the country? Your contribution will be split between Michelle De La Isla and the MassDems.
This year’s coordinated campaign has been all about maximizing your efforts where you’ll have the most impact, both in down-ballot races in Massachusetts and in priority swing states and districts across the country.
To take back the White House, flip the Senate, and expand our majority in the House, we need to turn out voters in purple districts like Michelle’s. Over 700 Massachusetts volunteers have hit the phones for Democrats in battleground states through our program. I’m asking you to pitch-in with a contribution in the final stretch.
Will you chip in whatever makes sense for you right now to elect Democrats from the State House to the White House this November? Your contribution will be split between Michelle De La Isla and the Massachusetts Democratic Party.

Friend--
Three weeks ago, voters in Wisconsin were forced to make a choice: risk their health and vote at one of the few but very crowded polling places, or stay safe at home and skip voting in an important election.
Republicans in Wisconsin, and conservatives on the U.S. Supreme Court, forced this choice on voters. And now, dozens of individuals who rolled the dice on their health in order to make their voice heard are battling Covid-19.
While their disgraceful tactics ended up backfiring and voters chose to replace a Trump-backed conservative with a progressive on the state’s Supreme Court, we can’t let this kind of thing happen again. Ever.
Democrats from Town Hall to the United States Congress are working to make it easier, and safer, for all of us to vote in elections
But with Republicans hell-bent on obstructing democracy, we need all hands-on-deck too.
Will you give $20.20 today to help us protect democracy?
The coronavirus pandemic makes voting by mail an urgent need, but it has long been a part of the MassDems platform.
With elections scheduled to take place across the country in the coming months, please do your part to protect voters, to support vote by mail, and to defend our democracy by giving what you can today.
Democratically yours,
Gus Bickford

Falling Behind on Data
MassDems Lead the Way on Vote-by-Mail
The General Election Starts Now
Falling Behind on Data
Massachusetts is being hit hard by COVID-19, and as we reach a surge in cases across the state, we must all take the necessary steps to keep ourselves and our families safe. More importantly, we need reliable and granular data to guide our decisions and spotlight inequities.
* As many states, including Massachusetts, surge in the number of cases reported daily, Trump continues to deny that there’s a shortage of coronavirus tests and has no plan to do widespread testing.
* Experts agree that this kind of widespread testing is the key to controlling the spread, and that gathering information about who contracts the virus and how is essential to organizing a complete and equitable response.
* Last week, Senator Elizabeth Warren and Rep. Ayanna Pressley called for race and ethnicity data in COVID-19 case reporting. Having complete and reliable data is essential to holding our federal government accountable and ensuring that tests and care are being administered without bias.
* People need to know the severity of the threat facing their community so they can make decisions for the health and safety of their families. If we’re going to reach the other side of this crisis anytime soon, we need accurate, reliable, and consistent data.
Support Senator Warren and Rep. Pressley by sharing this story with #mapoli.
MassDems Lead the Way on Vote-by-Mail
We’re in the middle of the most important election of our lives--and in the middle of an unprecedented health crisis. The general election has begun, and Democrats are calling for a complete overhaul of our elections infrastructure. The MassDems are implementing vote-by-mail in their own party processes\--electing district delegates to the Democratic National Convention completely by mail.
* Our election process must be changed to ensure a fair--and safe--election this November. Republicans are doing everything they can to make voting less accessible in order to drive voter turnout to record lows.  They tried that in Wisconsin, refusing to extend vote by mail, requiring hundreds of thousands of people to show up to crowded polling locations in the middle of this pandemic.  Thankfully, voters saw through this tactic and ousted a conservative judge from the state’s highest court.
* That’s why 51 state party chairs, including our own MassDems Chair Gus Bickford, are calling for our federal lawmakers to allocate at least $2 billion to implement a universal vote-by-mail system, extended early voting periods, and same day registration.
* The MassDems aren’t just calling for vote-by-mail, we’re leading on it. In a major step to keeping democracy moving forward, the Massachusetts Democratic State Committee voted overwhelmingly to conduct elections for District Delegate to the Democratic National Convention by mail.
* No one should have to choose between risking their health and having their voice heard--and the MassDems are leading the way when it comes to making voting easier, not harder, during this crisis.
We’ll need your help letting Massachusetts Democrats know about the changes to this process. Share this information on social media with #MDP2MKE and #mapoli, and CLICK HERE to request your ballot.
The General Election Starts Now
Now that we have our presumptive Democratic Presidential nominee, Vice President Joe Biden, the MassDems are ramping up our coordinated campaign to elect Democrats to the State House all the way up to the White House this November. We’re sending Massachusetts Democrats from the Bay State to near-by purple states and supporting Dems in down ballot races here at home.
* For the past half a century, Joe Biden has worked to lift up the very people Trump has made it his mission to knock down--working and middle class families.
* Democrats coming together and unifying behind one candidate is Donald Trump’s worst nightmare. The American people know that it’s Joe Biden and the Democrats who’ll get things done and do the necessary work to save our nation.
* Every single Democratic candidate brought something valuable to the discussion we've had over the last year. As a result, we saw unprecedented voter engagement from coast to coast, including here in Massachusetts. Now, we’re throwing that same energy behind our presumptive nominee, because when more people get involved, Democrats win.
* We're creating a list of Democrats ready to get involved in swing states, CLICK HERE to add your name. This is the most important election of our lifetimes, and it’s just getting started.
Help us get ready for the most important election of our lives. Tell us why you’re ready to get Democrats elected here at home--and in nearby swing states--online with #mapoli.

"Republicans want to downplay the threat of climate change, but science isn’t something we can ignore.
View this email in your browser
Friend,
Climate change is an existential threat. Republicans want to downplay it, but science isn’t something we can ignore. We see it happening with the fires on the west coast, hurricanes hitting the Gulf states, and right here in Massachusetts with the flooding in Plum Island.
I’m running to flip a Republican-held seat in the legislature because my district deserves a Representative who supports transformative change. With just 21 days until Election Day, a donation from you could go a long way.
Will you chip in $5, $10, $25 or $50 to help me take on a Republican incumbent and turn this seat blue? Your contribution could help us talk to more voters, expand our GOTV efforts, and win big on Election Day.
We need someone in office who’s ready to take action. When I learned that the Merrimack River was being contaminated I joined the Merrimack River Watershed Council and, as interim director, started a water-quality monitoring program.
The Merrimack is an important resource in our state. People rely on it for drinking water, or to make a living that puts food on their table. Climate change and pollution are issues of justice, and every community deserves a representative who’ll fight for justice on Beacon Hill.
I won’t just fight for the Merrimack watershed, I’ll be an advocate for climate action across the Commonwealth. I’ll ask one more time: will you chip in however much you can to help me flip this seat?

"I’m facing a Republican challenger desperate to roll back all the progress we’ve made...
View this email in your browser
Hi Friend,
In 2016, I ran for State Representative to bring a new voice for the people of Leominster to the State House, one that’s dedicated to all it’s residents, especially those who too often go unheard.
I’ve fought for legislation to protect survivors of abuse, support our students, and defend the fundamental rights of our most vulnerable. Now, I’m facing a Republican challenger eager to roll back all the progress we’ve made--but with a donation from you today, I can continue our fight on Beacon Hill.
Will you chip in $5, $10, $25, $50, or however much you can, to help me take on my Republican challenger, win in November, and continue fighting for progressive values on Beacon Hill?
As a Leominster native, I’m honored to serve the community I’ve known and loved my entire life. And as the youngest person to ever fill this seat, I know what it’s like to face the compounding crises of today--all while paying off crippling student loan debt that so many of us are held back by.
I’m ready to face issues like student debt, social and economic inequality, climate change, and more head on. That’s what I’ve been doing in the State House for four years, and I’ve delivered not just for the people of my district, but people across our Commonwealth.
That’s why I’m asking, can you make a contribution to my campaign today? It’s critical that we have Democrats in office at every level, and a small donation makes a big difference in down ballot races like mine.

Thank you,
Natalie Higgins

A little while ago, on the floor of the Senate, Susan Collins announced what we all knew was coming: she will vote to acquit Donald Trump.
Her announcement is a slap in the face to the rule of law.
Let’s show Collins that her terrible decision won’t go unnoticed. Let’s flood Maine with contributions so that the Democratic nominee who will take her on has the resources they need to defeat Collins.

Friend,
Last night, Kamala Harris made us all proud. Mike Pence thought he could interrupt, mansplain, and lie his way through the debate--boy, was he wrong.
Yesterday, I hope you thought about making a contribution to our campaign to elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. After Kamala’s stellar debate, I’m asking one more time:
Will you chip in even $5 or $10 to elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and Democrats down the ballot? Massachusetts Democrats are already making a difference in states like New Hampshire and Maine, I’m asking you to join us by making a contribution.

To: <[[EMAIL_REDACTED]]>
Friend,
Tonight, Kamala Harris will join a very short list of women to stand on that Vice Presidential debate stage. In November, she’ll become the first woman elected Vice President of the United States.
On the brink of this historic moment for women, the Trump-Pence administration is pushing through a lifetime appointment of a right-wing nominee to overturn Roe v. Wade.
Reproductive freedom is on the ballot in November. We need you in this fight to elect Democrats who’ll protect the right to choose here at home and in critical battleground states.
Will you chip in $5, $10, $25 or $50, or how ever much you can, to defeat the Trump-Pence ticket and anti-choice Republicans down the ballot? Your contribution will go towards electing Democrats here in Massachusetts and in swing states across the country.
We need to send Trump and Pence a message: abortion is healthcare and healthcare is a human right. Senator Harris is no stranger to grilling anti-choice zealots handpicked by Donald Trump, so she’s ready to take on Mike Pence tonight. But right now, I’m asking you to stay in this fight by making a contribution.
A donation from you before Senator Harris takes the stage tonight would show Trump, Pence, and Republicans in Massachusetts that the right to choose is non-negotiable. Can you pitch in however much you’re able to elect Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and Democrats down the ticket?
DONATE NOW →
I won’t stop fighting until everyone has access to reproductive care, and I know you won’t either.
Sincerely,
Katherine Clark
US Representative

"That’s right. Governor Charlie Baker just endorsed Maine’s Republican Senator Susan Collins for reelection.
View this email in your browser
Hi Friend,
That’s right. Governor Charlie Baker just endorsed Maine’s Republican Senator Susan Collins for reelection.
Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell know that Democrats have a real shot at flipping this seat, so they’re pouring money into Susan Collins’ reelection bid. And now Charlie Baker is helping them.
There are only 46 days left until the election, so we need all hands on deck to win in November. Can you chip in $20.20 right now to help us expand our efforts? Your donation will be split between the MassDems and the Maine Democratic Party.
Susan Collins has spent the past four years propping up the Trump agenda. From confirming Brett Kavanaugh in 2018, to letting Trump off the hook during the impeachment trials back in February, Collins votes with Trump and McConnell when it counts.
Massachusetts Democrats know it is important to flip the Senate and stop the Trump-McConnell agenda. Hundreds of Massachusetts volunteers have already made calls into Maine and the race is close. That’s why I’m asking:
Will you chip in $20.20, or whatever makes sense for you, to help us expand our voter contact efforts? Your donation will go towards election Democrats down the ballot in Maine and Massachusetts.

"Longtime friends Mike Pence and Charlie Baker will spend time on Nantucket this weekend. View this email in your browser
Friend,
I'm not sure what you're up to today, but Charlie Baker is on Nantucket hanging out with Trump’s second in command: Mike Pence.
Pence is supposed to be busy as head of the coronavirus task force, but he’s hosting a big-money fundraiser for Trump’s election campaign instead. Governor Baker seems to think it’s time for a little R&R on the island too. While they enjoy their time together on Nantucket, a donation from you can help us defeat Trump, Pence, and all of their allies in Massachusetts.
Will you chip in $20.20, or whatever makes sense for you, to help us send Trump and Pence packing in November? Charlie says he doesn’t “want to get involved” in presidential politics--but it doesn’t look like he’s staying out of it.
Pence and Baker are old friends after all, and this is the second year they’ve met up on the island. Here they are being serious:
And here’s them having fun!
For four years, Governor Charlie Baker has said he doesn’t want to get involved in presidential politics, but buddies up with Pence when he thinks we’re not paying attention. Now, 5 months into a pandemic response disaster that his party’s president created, we’re suffering unimaginable consequences.
Cases are surging across the country because Trump and Pence put poll numbers before the American people. Testing is backed up in our state because cases are hitting record highs nationwide.
If you're as disgusted as we are, then take action today by giving $20.20. Democrats are working overtime to make Mike Pence a one term VP, win elections down the ballot, and take on Charlie Baker in 2022.
DONATE $20.20 NOW

Record Turnout in the MA Primary
Trump Puts Bay Staters at Risk, and Charlie Baker Stays Silent
Record Turnout in the MA Primary
Massachusetts Democrats know how much is at stake in this election, and they’re ready to take back the White House in November. We turned out in record numbers to support Democrats in yesterday’s Presidential primary, showing that voters are energized and mobilizing to defeat Donald Trump.
* Across the Commonwealth, voters turned out in record numbers to support Democrats in the Presidential primary.
* With over 1.6 million votes cast in total, over 1.3 million people voted for Democrats yesterday, while only 260,000 turned out to support either Republican candidate.
* Democratic turnout has already surpassed that of 2008, another historic election year.
* For the first time, Massachusetts allowed people to vote early in a Presidential primary.
* Over 109,000 Massachusetts Democrats cast their votes in the week before Super Tuesday.
* In addition to those who took advantage of the early vote opportunity, 70,000 Bay Staters sent in absentee ballots.
* When turnout is high, Democrats win, and it’s clear from yesterday’s numbers that voters are determined to vote Trump out this November.
* As our Party Chair Gus Bickford said, yesterday marked the beginning of the reckoning for Donald Trump.
Have a great Election Day story? Share it online with #MAPrimary and #SuperTuesday.
Trump Puts Bay Staters at Risk, and Charlie Baker Stays Silent
Trump has spent the past three years putting children in cages, attacking civil rights, siding with the NRA, and denying climate change--now he’s turning the coronavirus threat into his personal political tool. Still, Charlie Baker is happy to stay uninvolved and still won’t say who he is voting for.
* The Trump administration has put us all at risk with their late, haphazard, and politicized response to this global health crisis.
* From censuring experts in his own administration, to calling criticisms of his botched response a “hoax,” Trump is downplaying the threat posed by the coronavirus to protect his reelection campaign.
* We're now feeling the effects after years of cuts to critical health programs. Two years ago, Trump ousted the entire pandemic response team and did not replace it.
* It doesn’t end with the coronavirus. On Monday we found out that a climate-denier promoted in Trump’s Department of the Interior has been spreading misinformation in official reports.
* Massachusetts is already feeling the effects of climate change, just ask anyone down the Cape or on the South Shore. This misinformation could justify policies that have detrimental effects to our climate and our future, and Charlie Baker is content to sit on the sidelines.
* No matter what steps we take to prepare for things like the coronavirus or a climate disaster, we need a competent, committed, and compassionate federal government that can deliver a well-coordinated response.
* Charlie Baker might not have voted for Donald Trump in yesterday’s primary, but when he stays silent on the issues that matter, he enables Trump’s agenda.

View this email in your browser
Friend,
Straight out lies. That’s what we heard from Donald Trump during last night’s debate. So, I’ll tell you the truth that Donald Trump doesn’t want you to know.
Under Trump, more than 200,000 Americans have lost their lives due to COVID-19, nearly 30,000,000 are on some form of unemployment, the integrity of the Supreme Court--and our fundamental rights--are at risk. Donald Trump was given another chance to condemn white supremacy, and he refused.
Trump will say and do anything to win this election--and it’s terrifying. We need to double down on our efforts to elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.
Will you chip in $20.20 right now so Democrats in Massachusetts can expand our efforts to defeat Trump? After Trump’s disgusting performance, your support is needed now more than ever.
The truth is, Donald Trump is the most corrupt President our country has seen. He doesn’t respect the law, and he doesn’t respect the Constitution. That’s why I’ve taken him to court more times than I can count.
Can you make a $20.20 contribution right now so we can ramp up our efforts in this final stretch? With your help, we can make sure Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and Democrats down the ballot win in November.
We need Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to move our country forward with integrity. Let’s make it happen.

Newsflash: Don’t Inject Disinfectants
State Special Elections
MassDems Caucus by Mail
Newsflash: Don’t Inject Disinfectants
We wish we were kidding, but we’re not. During last Thursday’s daily COVID-19 briefing, Donald Trump suggested that injecting disinfectants may be an effective way to combat the coronavirus. The idea led doctors, lawmakers, and even the manufacturers of some of these products, to issue warnings against ingesting disinfectants, which most people seem to already know are highly toxic.
Of course, though, Trump refuses to take responsibility for the harm his comment may cause. As states have seen an increase in calls to poison control from desperate people asking if ingesting disinfectant is a legitimate treatment, Trump falsely claims he was being sarcastic.
Even though we have countless other reasons, isn’t this enough to justify throwing Donald Trump out of the White House?
If you’re ready to vote Trump out of office, become a part of our coordinated swing state effort by adding your name here.
State Special Elections
While the President continues to peddle misinformation on national television, Democrats at every level of government are getting people the care, resources, and guidance they need to to survive this pandemic. During times like these, it’s important to have competent leaders in office that care about their communities. That’s why right now we are working to elect four Democrats to the state legislature this spring.
* We’re all doing what we can to help others during these uncertain times. We can check in on friends and family, grab take out to help a local restaurant, or donate to a relief fund--and we can also take political action.
* During crises like this one, Democrats are the ones willing to do the work to get resources in the hands of working people, resources that help folks keep roofs over their heads, put food on their tables, and get the life-saving care they need.
* Taking action by supporting Democrats running at every level isn’t just about asking for votes, it's about showing compassion, providing comfort, and bringing people together. It’s about ensuring that people are represented by leaders who care about them.
* There are four Democrats running against Trump allies in purple districts across the state in special elections. Each campaign has made adjustments to focus on things like phone banking and virtual town halls, but they’ll need your help to cross the finish line this spring.
* Click here to learn more about John Velis for State Senate
* Click here to learn more about Susan Moran for State Senate
* Click here to learn more about Dan Sena for State Rep.
* Click here to learn more about Carol Doherty for State Rep.
Can you sign up for 1 phone banking shift this week to help elect Democrats in Taunton and Easton, the Cape, the South Shore, western Mass, and Middlesex County? We’ll need your help to flip three seats this spring.
MassDems Caucus by Mail
At the cross section of the most important election of our lives and an unprecedented global health crisis, Democrats are finding new, safe ways to keep Democracy going. Here at the MassDems, we’ve re-worked our own processes, including--for the first time--electing delegates to the Democratic National Convention.
* Last month, in a major step to keeping democracy moving forward, the Massachusetts Democratic State Committee voted overwhelmingly to conduct elections for District Delegate to the Democratic National Convention by mail.
* Since then, the MassDems have received and processed over 7,500 ballot requests and sent ballots to every corner of the Commonwealth. Now, Massachusetts Democrats will vote on who will represent them at the National Convention, where we’ll launch Joe Biden to victory in November.
* We saw unprecedented involvement in this process because we’re making it easier--not harder--to engage with our party during this crisis. We know that when more people get involved at this stage, the better our chances of winning down the ticket this fall.

Hi there--
As 2019 comes to a close, I wanted to thank you for your support. With your help, we were able to provide trainings in local communities, help Democrats win across the Commonwealth last November, and start building the grassroots networks we’ll need to win from the State House to the White House in 2020.
But there’s not much time left and this election is the most consequential election of our lives. That’s why I’m asking:
Can you chip $5, $10, $25, or as much as you can, to help fund our organizing efforts? We need your help to finish our work before 2020.
DONATE: $5
DONATE: $10
DONATE: $25
DONATE: $50

TONIGHT: First Presidential Debate
The President’s Taxes
Charlie Baker Continues to Hide Key COVID-19 Data
TONIGHT: First Presidential Debate
Tonight at 9:00 PM, millions will tune into the first presidential debate between Vice President Joe Biden and Donald Trump. Biden is ready to talk about the tough issues folks discuss at their kitchen tables. Trump's ready to do one thing: lie.
* During the debate, Joe Biden will speak directly to the American people about his plan to contain COVID-19, to give working families a fair shot, and to make the super-wealthy pay their fair share.
* It’s time for Donald Trump to answer for his failures. 200,000 lives have been lost, almost 30 million people are receiving unemployment assistance, and millions are on the brink of losing healthcare because of Trump.
* Tonight, Joe Biden will hold Trump accountable and show that he and Kamala Harris will bring us together and restore the soul of this nation.
* We already know what to expect from Trump: lies. It’s clear that Trump thinks he can pull the wool over the eyes of the American people, and it's up to us to keep him honest. Follow @DNCWarRoom and @truth on Twitter to fact check the President during tonight’s debate.
The President’s Taxes
Sunday’s bombshell report from the New York Times revealed that Trump paid $0 in federal income taxes for 10 years between 2000-2015, and he only paid $750 in the year he was elected president and his first year in office.
* While hardworking Americans played by the rules and paid federal income taxes, Donald Trump paid no federal income taxes for years and only $750 in 2016 and 2017--far less than the average teacher, firefighter, or nurse.
* Trump sold himself as America’s most successful businessman, but he’s been stealing from American families to subsidize his lavish lifestyle.
* Trump’s not paying his fair share, and as president, he’s making it easier for his billionaire friends to avoid paying their share too. 83% of the benefits from Trump’s tax scam will ultimately go to the wealthiest 1%, and 100 of the most profitable corporations paid $0 after his tax bill.
* Now, Trump’s proposing yet another tax cut for super wealthy investors, while Republicans drag their feet getting pandemic relief to working families.
* Joe Biden knows what it means to work hard, and what folks go through to make ends meet. He’s running for president to help all Americans, not to pad his own pockets.
Charlie Baker Continues to Hide Key COVID-19 Data
This week, a report from the Boston Globe found that Governor Charlie Baker and his staff are continuing to withhold important information about coronavirus cases in nursing homes and senior living facilities. It’s a pattern that goes back to the start of the pandemic, and that’s had tragic consequences.
* With over a million deaths worldwide, Republicans continue to downplay the risk of the coronavirus. In Massachusetts, Governor Charlie Baker is keeping the public in the dark about COVID-19 cases and deaths in our hardest hit facilities: nursing homes and other senior living centers.
* After nearly 80 veterans at the Holyoke Soldiers’ home lost their lives due to Baker’s negligence, Baker should be taking extra steps to protect our most vulnerable. That should start with reporting complete and accurate data.
* This isn’t the first time Baker’s administration has withheld critical pandemic details. They initially blocked access to information about cases by municipality to keep us from seeing that COVID-19 hotspots were overwhelmingly concentrated in communities of color.
* Comprehensive and correct information about COVID-19 is how we control the spread of this virus. By refusing to provide important details about cases in critical areas, Baker is putting us all at greater risk for another outbreak.
We encourage you to share these talking points with your networks online and offline. Questions about the information outlined above and about the MassDems Wire program may be directed at our Communications Manager, Allison Mitchell.

Yesterday was the tenth anniversary of the Affordable Care Act, and in the midst of a pandemic, it’s been a critical tool for combatting this virus:
* More than 20 million Americans gained comprehensive health coverage through the ACA--meaning that coronavirus treatment is covered by their plans.
* The ACA established the CDC Prevention and Public Health Fund, which helps states prepare for disease outbreaks.
* Because of the ACA, more than 17 million Americans now have coverage through Medicaid expansion\--which funds to increase in response to a public health emergency like coronavirus.
Democrats have spent the last decade fighting to protect the law, expand coverage and lower costs, all while Republicans have pushed to repeal, sabotage, and overturn the ACA. Even as Trump relies on key provisions of law to limit the spread of coronavirus, he still supports a lawsuit that would strip 21 million Americans of their insurance.
Will you add your name to show our Democrats in Congress that you stand with them in their fight to defend the Affordable Care Act? Healthcare is on the ballot in 2020, and Democrats are the ones working to protect it.

"The grassroots support of campaigns like ours could turn all of Texas blue.
View this email in your browser
Hi Friend,
Believe it or not, Texas is a battleground state in 2020. I’m running for Congress in Texas’ 24th district, where just three points kept Democrats from flipping this seat in 2018. This year, the race is close, and grassroots support of our campaign is what will make the difference and turn this district blue.
I know that Massachusetts Democrats don’t sit on the sidelines when the stakes are this high. With less than 50 days left, a donation from you would go a long way.
Can you chip in $5, $10, $25, or $50 today to elect Democrats in Massachusetts and in critical toss-up districts like mine? Your contribution will be split between my campaign and the Massachusetts Democratic Party.
My story is so familiar to so many people. I was born into a military family that struggled with money. I experienced homelessness as a child, I worked my way through high school and college, and when I became a mom, I knew we had to do better for our children.
During this campaign, we’ve built a coalition of folks with stories like mine from all over the country, but my Trump-endorsed opponent has the GOP war chest on her side. We can take her on, and defeat Donald Trump in Texas too, but we need your help right now.
I’ll ask once more: will you split a donation between my campaign and the Massachusetts Democratic Party today? Your contribution will go toward electing Democrats down the ballot across the country.

"Earlier this afternoon, Donald Trump landed in Maine... View this email in your browser
Friend,
Earlier this afternoon, Donald Trump landed in Maine\--after a week where he tweeted that protestors should be shot, announced that he was instructing the US military to overtake American cities, and ordered the tear-gassing of peaceful protestors in Washington for a photo-op. Now, he wants to use Maine’s essential frontline workers as a backdrop for a “victory” celebration even while the pandemic rages, unchecked.
Trump chose Maine because that’s the home of Susan Collins--the last Republican in the New England delegation. He thinks that by visiting there, he can put his finger on the scale and maintain control over the Senate.
Well we have news for Trump: it won’t work. And we’re partnering with the Maine Dems to make sure of it.
Will you make a donation of $20.20 or whatever you can afford right now to help defeat Trump, Collins, and flip the Senate? All donations made through this form will be split between the Mass Dems and the Maine Dems.
DONATE $20.20 NOW

"Just a few months ago, Baker declared that the T is “heading in the right direction.” Now, we've learned that “safety is not the priority at the T.” View this email in your browser
Let’s be clear, Charlie Baker has been lying to us.
After a bombshell report was released by a panel chosen by the Baker administration, we have learned that “safety is not the priority at the T.” But, just a few months ago, Baker declared that the MBTA is “heading in the right direction.”
That’s one lie.
Here’s another one:
Charlie Baker has maintained for years that the MBTA doesn’t need additional revenue to operate in a reliable way. The Panel’s report clearly disagrees, as does just about everyone who used the T even occasionally.
Charlie Baker’s failure at the MBTA is putting the people of our Commonwealth in danger. Can you rush a $10 donation so that we can keep the pressure on Baker to fix the T?
DONATE: $10
DONATE: $20
DONATE: $50
This report isn’t about delayed trains or infrequent service, it's about SAFETY.
If we are to believe that Charlie Baker is the excellent manager he claims to be, then there is only one explanation for the completely dysfunctional state of our public transportation system: he doesn’t care about those of us who use it.
We can’t waste any time when the stakes are this high. Make a $10 contribution right now to show Charlie Baker that safety needs to be the priority at the MBTA.

Trump's coming to New Hampshire.
Susan Collins must go.
Trump’s coming to New Hampshire.
After his disastrous rally in Tulsa that left his own staffers infected with coronavirus, Trump’s holding yet another one of his super-spreader events, this time in New Hampshire, just minutes from our border.
* With over 3 million cases and 130,000 lives lost to COVID-19, Donald Trump’s poll numbers are slipping, and he’s decided it’s time to resume his infamous campaign rallies.
* Trump’s Tulsa rally was a public health disaster. No masks, no social distancing, and no less than 6 staffers to the President tested positive before Trump even took the stage. Now, he’s at it again right next door in New Hampshire.
* Here in Massachusetts, we’re just starting to contain this virus, but COVID-19 doesn’t stop at state lines. The progress we’ve made will be jeopardized by Trump and his followers ignoring the proven precautions experts have outlined.
* Trump has always put poll numbers and and profits before the American people, and we’re suffering dire consequences. We can’t afford another four years of Donald Trump--that's why the MassDems started MobilizeMA, a coordinated battleground state effort to help Democrats win across New England.
Susan Collins must go.
Maine is the key to flipping the Senate. If we want to keep Mitch McConnell from further destroying our democracy, this has to be Susan Collins’ last term. That’s why we’re all doing our part to #DefeatCollins in November.
* Susan Collins has spent the past 4 years propping up the Trump agenda. She first made national headlines when she cast a decisive vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
* She won’t say if she’s supporting Donald Trump this November, but he’s 100% behind her. She votes with him when the stakes are high: Kavanaugh, impeachment, and countless other decisions that don’t make national news.
* Recent polls say that Collins is in trouble, but Mitch McConnell knows that holding on to Collins’ seat is the only way he keeps his majority in the Senate. She’s got the entire Trump/McConnell war chest on her side.
* For the first time in 3 decades, Maine Democrats have the largest registered voting bloc in the state, and high turnout in their 7/14 primary would show Trump, McConnell, and Collins that Democrats are energized and ready to defeat Collins in November.
* That’s why MassDems are helping the Maine Democrats make sure voters are ready to turn out next Tuesday. Join our Week of Action right now.

Trump and Coronavirus
Trump's Corrupting the DOJ
The Radical Right in Massachusetts
Trump and Coronavirus
After months of ignoring warnings and downplaying the risk, Trump’s chaotic response to the coronavirus has cost over 81,000 Americans their lives. Still, he’s declaring it a victory and is pushing states where cases are still on the rise to abandon their precautions. Trump’s telling us that he’s got the virus under control and he’s willing to sacrifice tens of thousands of lives to keep up the charade.
* This pandemic is far from over, but Trump’s too eager to call it a win and move on. He’s downplayed this crisis from the beginning, and still denies that there’s a shortage of tests so that he can force open the economy and attempt to salvage his reelection campaign.
* Trump knows science isn’t on his side either. That’s why he blocked top infectious disease expert Dr. Fauci from testifying before the House.
* He’s limiting other task-force members’ hearing appearances too, calling the House’s attempt to fulfill their oversight duties a “set-up” and accusing leaders of being “Trump-haters.”
* Trump insists that “we have met the moment and we have prevailed,” yet three members of his own coronavirus task force just began quarantining for two weeks after coming into contact with White House staffers who tested positive.
* No matter how many times he lies about defeating the virus, Trump knows his chaotic failure of a response has cost over 81,000 lives.
* Instead of working to provide tests and PPE, he’d rather downplay the risk, dismiss the advice of his own advisors, and deceive the American people for his political gain.
Trump’s Corrupting the DOJ
We’re in the midst of a public health crisis, and Trump is trying to use it to his advantage. On Thursday, top Trump crony William Barr and his politicized Justice Department dropped the case against Michael Flynn, Trump’s former national security advisor--and he’s hoping we’ll let it slide. Americans are losing their lives and their livelihoods under his watch, and Trump’s using it to distract us from the corruption rampant in his administration.
* With the entire country focused on coronavirus, Trump’s hoping we won’t notice the corruption taking place in his administration. Last Thursday, his Justice Department dropped the case against former national security advisor, Michael Flynn.
* `The case was nearly over--Flynn had TWICE pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his Russian contacts after Special Counsel Robert Mueller brought the case against him.
* This is just the latest attempt by Trump to use the DOJ to do his bidding, and thousands of career DOJ employees are speaking out against his actions.
* Barr’s not concerned with the rule of law, only protecting Trump and his henchmen from being held accountable. This is exactly why we need to kick Trump out of office in November--to make sure the Justice Department is once again focused on justice.
The Radical Right in Massachusetts
Here in Massachusetts, the Trump administration and his campaign are being supported by cheerleaders in the MassGOP, led by Trump’s biggest fan, Jim Lyons. Lyons and the state Republican Party gleefully promote the propaganda coming out of the White House, and support every despicable, hateful, racist, and illegal move Trump makes.
* Lyons and the MassGOP are supporting and encouraging people to ignore state and local rules designed to protect the most vulnerable from the coronavirus.
* They were quick to celebrate the deterioration of justice, commending Attorney General Barr for corrupting the DOJ and letting one of Trump’s cronies walk free--despite pleading guilty to his crimes twice.
* Facts be damned, the MassGOP proudly promotes wild conspiracy theories and alleges unknown crimes committed by President Obama to harm Trump.
* The radical right even gleefully brags of their Party’s “Death Star,” a name the Trump campaign strangely uses to describe itself.
* Jim Lyons and the MassGOP aren’t embarrassed by Donald Trump’s illegal and disgusting actions, they are emboldened by them. We need to do our part to make sure they don’t gain influence in the State House by supporting these Democrats up for election right now:
* John Velis for State Senate
* Susan Moran for State Senate
* Dan Sena for State Representative
* Carol Doherty for State Representative

TONIGHT: Vice Presidential Debate
Trump Abandons Coronavirus Relief Talks
Charlie Baker Fails to Provide COVID-19 Data
TONIGHT: Vice Presidential Debate
The Vice Presidential debate will be held tonight at 9 PM. This debate will feature our Vice Presidential nominee holding the Trump-Pence Administration accountable for their devastating failures, while offering a vision for our future with Joe Biden as our President. Follow and retweet @DNCWarRoom to hold Pence accountable during the debate.
* In February, Donald Trump tapped Mike Pence to lead the White House Coronavirus task force. Since then, 210,000 Americans have died from COVID-19, more than 7.5 million have been infected, and tens of millions of Americans have lost their jobs.
* From the start, Trump and Pence lied to the American people about the threat of COVID-19, contradicted experts, and refused to follow basic health and safety guidelines.
* COVID-19 cases are surging across the country--again--and there’s an outbreak in the White House. Pence and the administration don’t have a plan to protect themselves from infection, nevermind the entire country.
* Together with Joe Biden, Kamala Harris is focused on building our country back better and giving working families their fair shot. Tonight, she’ll talk about how a Biden-Harris administration will work for all Americans, not just the wealthy and well connected.
Trump Abandons Coronavirus Relief Talks
Democrats are ready to provide much needed aid with a comprehensive package, but Trump and the Republicans are focused on pushing their Supreme Court nominee through the Senate first.
* Yesterday, Trump abandoned stimulus talks that would have helped small businesses, schools, struggling families, and unemployed workers.
* Instead, he’s rushing a Supreme Court confirmation because he wants the Court to take away your health care as quickly as possible. 74% of Americans believe Congress should take action on COVID relief before a SCOTUS appointment.
* Trump never really tried to get a deal for struggling Americans. He never attended negotiations or brought Republicans and Democrats together. Nearly 5 months after the House passed the Heroes Act, he hasn’t stepped up to lead.
* Yesterday, Joe Biden spoke about the need to bring people together to unite our country and to get things done for the American people. That’s what he did when he secured the votes for relief after the last recession, which pulled our nation back from the brink in 2009 and kicked off the longest uninterrupted streak of job growth in our history.
Charlie Baker Fails to Provide COVID-19 Data
This week, reporting showed that Governor Charlie Baker and his administration are failing to collect required data on race, ethnicity, language, occupation, and disability status of people who test positive for coronavirus. This isn’t the first time Baker’s been caught obscuring the inequities of his administration's response--it’s a pattern that goes back to the start of the pandemic.
* With over a million deaths worldwide, Republicans continue to downplay the risk of the coronavirus. In Massachusetts, Governor Charlie Baker is continuing to keep the public in the dark about COVID-19 cases and deaths.
* Baker’s administration is falling to collect crucial information about the race, ethnicity, language, occupation, or disability status of people who test positive for the virus, despite being required to do so.
* Since July 1, over 84% of tests are missing occupational information and over 91% are missing information about primary language.
* The missing data helps health experts identify trends and disparities among groups more vulnerable to the virus. It’s how we make sure our response is complete and equitable.
* This isn’t new. Baker’s administration initially blocked access to information about cases by municipalities to keep us seeing that COVID-19 hotspots were overwhelmingly concentrated in communities of color.
* On top of that, a recent report showed that the Baker and his administration hasn’t released the $20 million in federal funds allocated to address racial disparities in health highlighted by the pandemic.
* Comprehensive and correct information about COVID-19 is how we control the spread of this virus. Baker’s not just putting us at greater risk for another outbreak, he’s worsening the already deep inequities in our state.
We encourage you to share these talking points with your networks online and offline. Questions about the information outlined above and about the MassDems Wire program may be directed at our Communications Manager, Allison Mitchell.

"From the crisis at the MBTA to the scandal at the State Police, the past 12 months have proven that Big Business Baker can’t manage Massachusetts.  View this email in your browser
Week after week, Charlie Baker’s laissez-faire leadership has put the people of our Commonwealth in danger. From the crisis at the MBTA to the scandal at the State Police, the past 12 months have proven that Big Business Baker just can’t manage Massachusetts.
In 2020, we’re redoubling our efforts to hold Baker accountable for his failures. Will you chip in $10 to support our work?
With only a few days left in the year, we thought we’d take a look back at Charlie Baker’s top 5 failures of 2019.
## #1. Crisis on Charlie’s MBTA
This month's bombshell report on the MBTA told us that “safety is not the priority” at Baker’s MBTA. After months of derailments and track fires, the report doesn’t come as a shock to the people who depend on the T. But Charlie Baker, who sits comfortably in his motorcade, continues to call experiencing the crisis that his constituents face daily, “virtue signaling.”
## #2. Baker’s “Do Nothing” Transportation Plan
Baker told voters that he’d bring a businessman’s perspective to Beacon Hill, but since he took office in 2015, our infrastructure and transportation have become growing disasters. In his 5 years as Governor, our Commonwealth has the worst traffic in the country and nearly 500 “structurally defunct” bridges.
##
## #3. State Police Scandal on Baker’s Watch
Baker’s hands-off approach to governing is wasting thousands of tax dollars. Investigations revealed that on Baker’s watch, State Troopers were lying about their hours to get paid extra overtime salaries--and that they were “regularly ordered” to do so by their supervisors.
## #4. Chaos at Charlie’s RMV
Baker’s let safety lapse at the RMV as well. In a misguided attempt to reduce wait times, officials in Charlie Baker’s own office left essential roles unfilled and threatened to fire those who raised concerns about abandoning their core duties.
## #5. Baker’s Corporate Buddies and the Weymouth Compressor
Baker’s disregard for safety doesn’t stop with the MBTA and RMV. This year, Baker withheld crucial air quality data to spare his corporate buddies building the controversial Weymouth compressor. Eleven previously undetected toxins were found after additional testing, but Baker chose to put our health at risk to protect corporations.
Let’s be clear: Charlie Baker doesn’t care about the health and safety of his constituents. That’s why it’s crucial to take action right now.
Rush a $10 contribution to help us ramp up our efforts to hold Baker accountable for his failures in 2020. Charlie Baker can’t manage Massachusetts, and now, it’s putting the people of our Commonwealth in danger.

"He’ll do anything he can to keep Massachusetts from moving forward
View this email in your browser
Hi Friend,
Ryan Fattman needs to go. He’ll do anything he can to keep Massachusetts from moving forward.
That’s why I officially launched my campaign for State Senate. Fattman’s spent years trying to advance his right wing, anti-choice, anti-immigrant, anti-worker and hate agenda. That’s not what my district is about, and that’s not what our Commonwealth is about either.
Can you chip in $5, $10, $25, $50, or whatever makes sense for you, right now to make this Ryan Fattman’s last term in the State Senate? Fattman’s expecting an easy win in November--but with a donation from you today, we’ve got a real shot of flipping this seat.
It’s going to be a challenge, but it is winnable. Voters are unhappy with the direction the GOP wants to take this country and our state. Voters in districts like mine saw the true colors of the MassGOP this spring, and they didn’t like what they were seeing.
That's why just a few months ago, Democrats flipped two Republican-held seats in the State Senate. Voters want leaders ready to take on the issues of today--but our wins put the MassGOP on guard. They’ve only got a handful of seats left in the Senate and they’ll give it all to protect the ultra-convervative poster-child of their party.
This is going to be a tough fight, and I need you on my team. Will you make a donation today to help me defeat Ryan Fattman? Your donation will help me build the on-the-ground operation I’ll need to win in November.

We Pay the Price for Baker’s Silence
Governor Charlie Baker has said he doesn’t want to get involved in presidential politics. Now, 5 months into a pandemic his party’s president created, we’re suffering unimaginable consequences.
* Baker has been content to sit on the sidelines through Trump’s entire presidency, watching while he commits criminal abuses of power, attacks basic human rights, and now is responsible for so many unnecessary COVID-19 associated deaths .
* Trump’s been lying about this virus from the start, and it’s put us first in the world with 3.8 million cases and well over 140,000 deaths.
* According to this story from the Boston Globe, labs are being flooded with tests from states setting record highs in new cases five months into this pandemic. Massachusetts residents are waiting a week or more for test results, delays which just put all of us at greater risk.
* Massachusetts is paying the price of Charlie Baker’s silence. He’s had countless chances to stand up to Trump when it matters, and his cowardice makes him complicit in Trump’s agenda.
Baker’s Management Failure at the Holyoke Soldiers’ Home
Long before this pandemic hit, Charlie Baker knew that there were problems at the Holyoke Soldiers' home--and nearly 80 veterans lost their lives as a result of failed leadership.
* When Baker took office in 2015, his administration came in with a “campaign of austerity” and veterans at the Holyoke Soldiers’ Home paid the ultimate price.
* In 2016, Baker’s administration hired a man with no experience in health care or long term care for the superintendent’s job at the home--Baker swore him in himself.
* Within months, officials in Baker’s administration started receiving reports of the new superintendent’s deficiencies and staffing shortages at the home--but Baker left him in the job.
* A Baker-commissioned report following the deaths over almost 80 veterans at the home found that the superintendent decisions--and Baker’s inaction-- ended with staff “walking (the veterans) to their death,” as one nurse put it.
* The tragedy at the Holyoke Soldiers’ home happened on Charlie Baker’s watch. Yet again, Baker’s management failures have had dire consequences.
Vote by Mail
At the cross section of a public health crisis and the most important election of our lives, no one should have to risk their health to cast their ballot. Now, Bay Staters won’t have to.
* While our President and his allies see COVID-19 as their opportunity to keep people from the ballot box in November, Democrats have worked to protect one of our most fundamental rights.
* Now, Bay Stater’s will be able to vote early, mail in their ballots, or head to the polls on Election Day knowing that they can do so safely.
* The MassDems are committed to making participating in our democracy easier, not harder, during this crisis. We’ve introduced a mail-in caucus process, helped take Democratic meetings online, and created new ways to campaign from home.
* That’s why this week, we’re launching a series of vote-by-mail trainings to make sure everyone has their vote counted in 2020. Join our first training, on Fri. July 24, 2020 at 6:30p by clicking here.
We encourage you to share these talking points with your networks online and offline. Questions about the information outlined above and about the Wednesday Wire program may be directed at our Communications Manager, Allison Mitchell.

"Democrats have been calling on Mitch McConnell to ensure a fair trial, but McConnell is doing everything he can to cover up Donald Trump’s corruption. View this email in your browser
Last night, Charlie Baker delivered his annual State of the Commonwealth speech. If you missed it, you didn’t miss much.
In his remarks that were just over 30 minutes, Baker was quiet on the many critical issues we face here in Massachusetts. He barely scratched the surface on our public transportation crisis and our record levels of traffic that impact millions of people every day.
You wouldn’t have heard him speak about the total dysfunction at his RMV, or the many State Police officers implicated in a wide-ranging corruption scandal under his watch.
Perhaps most shocking of all--he never mentioned the impeached leader of his own Republican Party, Donald Trump.
We’re doing the work on the ground to show everyone what Charlie Baker is trying to hide: he and Karyn Polito are not capable of leading Massachusetts. Can you chip in $5 right now so we can continue holding Baker accountable for his failures?

Lieutenant Governor Karyn Polito has no problem showing her campaign donors a little love this Valentine’s Day--she just handed another one of her donors a lifetime, high paying court appointment.
I wouldn’t be asking if it wasn’t important--can you chip in $3 right now to help the MassDems take on Polito and her patronage pipeline? With over $1 million in her war chest, Polito’s rigged system is helping her raise money hand over fist for her re-election campaign.

It’s a disturbing pattern. Just last year, Polito’s son’s youth football coach and her college roommate both landed top clerk positions. In 2017, a man who left his job as a court officer after being arrested for an OUI and leaving the scene of an accident ended up in the office of the Secretary of Energy and Environmental Affairs, no surprise--he’s the son of two Polito donors.
And who could forget Plates Polito? She was at the center of a scandal in which 68 of the first 100 low-number charity Red Sox license plates went to people with ties to the LG.
Opportunities in our state shouldn’t be based on how much you donate to Karyn Polito’s campaign. Help the MassDems build the grassroots networks they’ll need to take on Polito, Governor Baker, and their patronage pipeline.

We’re nearing the end of the first week of the impeachment trial, and this much is clear: Donald Trump committed impeachable offenses--and Republicans in the Senate are letting him get away with it.
House impeachment managers have laid out the facts, but Mitch McConnell and the GOP are blatantly stacking the deck for Trump, and against the rule of law.

Over 1.2 Million Votes Already Cast
TONIGHT: Presidential Debate
Over 1 Million Votes Already Cast
With 12 days left until Election Day, 1 million votes have already been cast. On Friday, Senator Ed Markey, Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley, and Kentucky state Rep. and former candidate for Senate Charles Booker for the Plan Your Vote Rally at 7 PM.
Help us get the word out with our promotional toolkit. This toolkit is a public document, and these resources are meant for you to use!
* 12 days before Election Day, over 1.2 million voters in Massachusetts have cast their ballots by mail or early in person. With thousands more voting every day, it’s Election Day from now until November 3.
* A record number of 1.4 million voters turned out to vote for Democrats in September’s primary because there was more than one way to cast a ballot--and we’re on track to see historic turnout again this November.
* Massachusetts Democrats have doubled get out vote efforts in historically underrepresented communities, are supporting critical battleground states, and have launched a voter protection team through the MobilizeMA coordinated campaign.
* Your vote is your voice, and the message is loud and clear: voter’s are ready for a brighter, better future. Donald Trump and his Republican allies in Massachusetts will try everything they can to keep us from the ballot box, so we must deliver a decisive victory for Democrats down the ballot.
TONIGHT: Presidential Debate
Tonight at 9 PM, Joe Biden will participate in the final presidential debate in Nashville. Tune in on any major news network to watch or stream the debate on Youtube here.
* During the debate, Joe Biden will speak directly to the American people about his plan to contain COVID-19 and to build our country back better.
* Trump will talk about everything but the job he’s done as president over the past four years.
* Whatever Trump says tonight, it won’t explain away four years of failed leadership — from botching the COVID response to plunging the country into a recession.
* Voters live in a world defined by Trump’s failures to protect the nation.
* More than 8 million Americans have been infected by COVID-19.
* 12 million Americans are unemployed.
* 1 in 5 small businesses have closed their doors.
* Voters know Joe Biden — they know his character, his empathy, and his leadership.
* Biden understands the issues facing working families, and will fight for them.
* Voters know that Trump isn’t fighting for them. He’s putting the super-wealthy and corporations first, and failing to address the crises impacting our country.

"Senate Republicans are rushing through Trump’s far-right nominee to fill Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s seat.
View this email in your browser
Friend,
Instead of getting urgently-needed COVID relief to struggling families, Mitch McConnell and Senate Republicans are rushing through Trump’s far-right nominee to fill Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s seat on the Supreme Court.
There’s just 18 days left until Election Day. If we want to flip the Senate, we need your support right now to expand our efforts in critical battleground states.
Will you chip in $20.20 right now to our Flip the Senate Fund? A contribution from you today could help Democrats take back the Senate and end Mitch McConnell’s reign as Majority Leader.
On Tuesday, our Vice Presidential nominee Kamala Harris said: “Let us not pretend that we don't know what consequences rushing into this confirmation will have the American people.”
If Amy Coney Barett is confirmed, we know she’ll overturn the Affordable Care Act and Roe v. Wade. We know she thinks the existence of climate change is up for debate and doesn’t believe voting discrimination still persists today. People are afraid--for their health, for the climate, for their human rights.
Our voices deserve to be heard in this election, and whoever wins should fill this seat. We can hold McConnell and Senate Republicans accountable in November, but we need your help today.
That’s why I’m asking: will you make a contribution right now to help Democrats flip the Senate? Your contribution would help us expand voter outreach and make sure that Democrats win in every state on Election Day

"House Republicans couldn’t bring themselves to put country before partisan politics--and Republicans all over the country are following their lead. View this email in your browser
“History is testing us.”
That’s what Congressman Jim McGovern said yesterday as the House Rules Committee met to set the terms for today’s historic debate--a debate that ended with the impeachment of Donald Trump.
Congressman McGovern asked his Republican colleagues to search their consciences, to uphold their oaths to defend the Constitution. Still, House Republicans couldn’t bring themselves to put country before partisan politics\--and Republicans all over the country are following their lead. That’s why I’m asking:
Will you donate $5 right now to help us take on Trump’s allies here in Massachusetts?
DONATE: $5
DONATE: $10
DONATE: $25
DONATE: $50
This issue of impeachment is simple: it’s the difference between right and wrong. We need leaders that aren’t going to blindly defend Trump’s actions, or won’t be complicit through their silence.
Congressman McGovern and the entire Massachusetts Delegation defended our democracy today on the House floor. But they need us to keep putting in the work on the ground here in Massachusetts.
Make a $5 contribution to help us defeat Republicans here in Massachusetts. We’ve been working hard to lay the groundwork for 2020, but we’re going to need you on our team.

Dear Activist,
Our goal with the Wednesday Wire is to give each of you the tools to take on the Republican Party and help boost Democrats in Massachusetts - so we encourage you to use these talking points on social media, as the basis for a letter to the editor of your local paper, in emails to your personal network, or in conversation with your friends and neighbors.
If you have any questions about this program or would like to see more about a specific issue area, please don't hesitate to reach out to our Communications Manager, Patrick Coyne.
Please share the articles below with your networks and please also be sure to use the hashtag #Mapoli or #BakerFail when sharing this information on social media.
Last night, Governor Baker delivered his State of the Commonwealth speech, and as expected, he failed to address the many crises created by the Baker/ Polito administration's complete inability or unwillingness to manage our state government.
The MassDems took to Twitter to call out Baker on his misleading statements and to bring attention to the things Baker avoided talking about:
* Baker’s actions continue to speak volumes. He’d put the health and safety of his constituents at risk for corporations--Baker cares about keeping his rich friends happy, and not the people of Massachusetts.
* In December 2019, a bombshell report on the MBTA was released, that clearly demonstrated that safety is not a priority and fear of retribution prevents employees from raising serious safety concerns.
* This MBTA Safety report proved what we all already knew— Charlie Baker doesn’t care about the MBTA or those of us who rely on it.
* From derailments to track fires, 2019 was a near-constant stream of serious mechanical failures and hazards on the MBTA. In 2020, there is no sign of these problems subsiding, and public transportation users, as well as those on our roads, continue to suffer.
* It’s easy for Baker to be lenient on safety and not prioritize fixing the T because he travels by motorcade. But the one million commuters who rely on the subway system, buses, and commuter rail to get to and from work each day do not have that luxury.
* Since taking office, Governor Baker has failed to give these dangerous bridge issues and others the attention and investment they require, and Massachusetts residents are feeling the backlash from this failure of leadership.
* This year, Baker and his administration withheld crucial air quality data on the controversial Weymouth compressor during legal proceedings. The hearing officer was outraged after discovering that Baker and his team hid the fact that eleven previously undetected toxins were found after additional testing.
* Andrea Honore has sat in his office for more than 200 days in an effort to speak to the Governor about the compressor. While the Governor seems to have corporations on speed dial, he refuses to meet with or acknowledge her as he passes her in his lobby.
Statement from Massachusetts Democratic Party Chair Gus Bickford Reacting to State of the Commonwealth
“When was the last time you had a conversation about politics for 30 minutes, and never spoke of Donald Trump? That’s what Charlie Baker just did in his major annual speech tonight. Charlie Baker and Karyn Polito continue to nibble around the edges and refuse to really take on the critical issues we face. This “victory lap” tonight felt like it was in slow motion. When people ask themselves if things have gotten easier or harder over the last five years, I don’t think Baker and Polito are going to enjoy the answer.”

Hey Friend,
Our country won’t survive another four years of Donald Trump. That has become even clearer over the past week.
But victory in 2020 means more than taking back the White House, it means electing Democrats up and down the ballot--here at home and in swing states across the country.
That’s why we’re launching MobilizeMA--a coordinated effort to expand our Democratic base in Massachusetts while maximizing our impact in purple states like New Hampshire and Maine.
JOIN MOBILIZE MA
Through MobilizeMA we will connect you with campaigns where your energy and efforts will have the greatest impact, even from a distance. From electing Joe Biden President of the United States, to defeating Susan Collins in Maine and flipping the Senate, to electing new Democrats to the State Senate, we have plenty of work ahead of us. None of us can afford to sit this election cycle out.
The MobilizeMA Report will give you weekly information about upcoming events, volunteer opportunities, and ways you can make the most out of the next 5 months.
Before we officially kick-off our campaign, I want to offer you an inside look into MobilizeMA. Sign up today to be a part of the team that will kick Donald Trump out of the White House.
Sincerely,

You could count on one thing from the Baker-Polito administration in 2019: consistency in demonstrating a complete inability - or uninterest - in running state government. Baker’s State of the State address is under two weeks away, and unless he plans to talk about the many scandals and crises that plague his administration, expect the speech to be extremely short. Here are some things we don’t think you’ll hear Baker talk about.
Baker the Lame Duck?
As 2019 ended, reports from [[URL REDACTED]] & WBZ show that Baker has less than $1 million in his war chest, while Karyn Polito has a campaign account holding over $700,000 more than Baker. Looks to us like this is Charlie Baker’s last term driving our government into the ground with his failed management. Unfortunately, “Governor Karyn Polito” may even be more damaging to our state than Baker has been.
* Remember when Polito was the key figure in a scandal in which 68 of the first 100 low-number specialty Red Sox license plates were awarded to people with ties to Polito? Refresh your memory about Plates Polito.
* More recently, multiple outlets including the Boston Herald and The Boston Globe reported on Polito’s patronage pipeline, which has resulted in many within Polito’s orbit landing high-paying state jobs, including to the court system.
* It’s pretty clear Polito and Baker are rigging every system they can to reward their friends and major donors, and we cannot have this corruption for another four years.
Baker’s Achilles Heel: the MBTA Safety Report
In December, a bombshell report on the MBTA was released, highlighting in concerning detail the leadership failures that have created a poisonous culture at the MBTA. As the report clearly states, safety is not a priority and fear of blame or retribution prevents employees from raising serious safety concerns.
* This report proves what we all already knew— Charlie Baker doesn’t care about the MBTA and he doesn’t care about those of us who rely on it.
* It’s easy for Baker to be lenient on safety and not prioritize fixing the T because he travels by motorcade. But the one million commuters who rely on the subway system, buses, and commuter rail to get to and from work each day do not have that luxury.
* From derailments to track fires, 2019 has seen a near-constant stream of serious mechanical failures and hazards on the MBTA. There is no sign of these problems subsiding, and public transportation users, as well as those on our roads, will continue to suffer.
Baker’s Failed Transportation Plan: Say Nothing, Do Nothing
In 2019, voters felt the effects of our failing transportation system and our crumbling infrastructure. Their frustration was warranted, given the release of a report finding nearly 500 bridges in Massachusetts are “structurally deficient” and growing concern over the deteriorating Alewife parking garage.
* Baker told voters that he would bring a businessman’s perspective and skills to Beacon Hill. But he has been the Governor since 2014--our infrastructure and transportation have become growing disasters.
* He has failed to give this issue and others the attention and investment they require, and Massachusetts residents are feeling the backlash from this failure of leadership.
Another Baker Blunder: The State Police Scandal
Investigations this year revealed not only that State Troopers were lying about their hours to get paid extra overtime salaries, but they were also “regularly ordered” to do so by their supervisors.
* Every new revelation about the corruption and scandal at the State Police makes it more and more impossible to believe that the Governor was not aware.
* Baker’s lazy and laissez-faire leadership undermined our criminal justice system and wasted thousands of tax-payer dollars.
Baker’s RMV: Chaos and Calamity
All too similar to the State Police scandal, in 2019 we saw the horrible effects of mismanagement of the RMV. Leadership had been warned repeatedly that their aggressive efforts to reduce wait times sacrificed safety, but they refused to listen or change their approach.
* Under Baker’s watch, officials in his administration left essential roles unfilled and threatened to fire employees who raised concerns about abandoning their core duties - putting public safety at risk for months.
* Baker’s managerial incompetence has led to serious safety lapses. He touts his past as a businessman but it’s abundantly clear that Baker is unable to effectively lead our government in 2020 and beyond.

"For four nights, Republicans have stumbled and lied their way through their Convention. View this email in your browser
Friend,
For four nights, Republicans have stumbled and lied their way through their Convention. And now Donald Trump is bringing his traveling circus just over our border to New Hampshire.
Massachusetts Democrats are working double time to help our friends to the north re-elect Senator Jeanne Shaheen who is facing a serious challenge from the right-wing, but a Trump visit puts everything at risk. A donation from you right now would help us expand our efforts and combat all the money and resources Republicans are pouring into this state.
We're doing everything we can to elect Democrats in Massachusetts, but we know we 'll need to help in other states as well to elect Joe Biden. Can you chip in $5, $10, $25, $50, or whatever you can, to fund our voter contact and voter protection program in the Granite State?
Still without a plan to address the worst public health crisis our nation has ever seen and with 180,000 lives lost due to his refusal to believe science, Trump’s headed to New England to hold another one of his super-spreading MAGA rallies. Trump and the Republicans aren’t just ignoring this crisis, they’re actively making it worse.
Massachusetts Democrats are fighting back. Here at the Party, we’re doing everything we can to elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, and down ballot Democrats at home and in battleground states like New Hampshire and Maine. With a contribution from you today, we can make sure we take back the White House, flip the Senate and protect the House this fall.
I’ll ask one more time: will you make a $5, $10, $25, $50 donation, or whatever makes sense for you, to fund our coordinated in-state and battleground state effort to win big here at home and flip competitive seats across the country?
Thank you for your support,

Trump Tweets and Tees Off, Biden Leads by Example

Trump Tweets and Tees Off, Biden Leads by Example
This weekend, as our nation approached a somber milestone of 100,000 coronavirus deaths, Donald Trump was playing a round of golf and retweeting alt-right conspiracy theories. In other words, it was just another weekend for President Trump. Meanwhile, Vice President Joe Biden showed that he’s exactly the leader we need during times like this: one who listens to the facts, leads by example, and puts the American people first.
* This weekend, the country marked 100,000 lives lost to the coronavirus, a number that Trump said would never come, but health experts projected after Trump refused to take early action and prevent this tragedy.
* As a result of Trump’s delayed, chaotic response and denial of basic facts, more American lives in the past few months than in the Vietnam and Korean Wars combined.
* Instead of mourning the loss of 100,000 American lives, working to get critical resources to frontline workers and small business owners, or even following basic precautions to limit more sickness and death, Trump spent the weekend on the golf-course and on Twitter, hurling insults at anyone who opposes him.
* In contrast, Vice President Joe Biden has been closely following the recommendations of health experts and leading by example by wearing a mask as he laid a wreath at a veterans park over the Memorial Day weekend.
* President’s should lead by example, and that’s what Joe Biden does. Wearing a mask protects the people around you. It shows that, unlike Donald Trump, Joe Biden's first priority isn’t his poll numbers or his bank account, it’s the health and safety of the American people.
Voters Reject Trump Allies in Massachusetts
Democrats John Velis and Susan Moran were up against two Trump loyalists in Republican held districts in last week’s special election for the Massachusetts Senate. On a historic day in an unprecedented election cycle, they both flipped their districts, and the MassGOP lost two critical seats in their 6 person caucus. The reason was clear: voters know the difference between candidates who are going to work for them on Beacon Hill, and candidates whose priority is bringing Trump’s agenda to our State House.
* We’re in the middle of a public health and economic crisis of Trump's own making, corruption runs deep in his administration, and still, the MassGOP isn’t embarrassed by their President--they’re emboldened by him.
* Just look at the Republican candidates running in this spring’s special elections. From immigration to civil rights, they’re Trump cronies through and through.
* But last week, when voters on the Cape & South Shore and in western Massachusetts elected their new State Senators, Democrats John Velis and Susan Moran flipped two (formerly) Republican held seats.
* Voters made their voices heard loud and clear: they’re sick and tired of candidates that are more concerned with propping up their corrupt, self-serving president than getting things done for working families in their own district.
* The MassGOP isn’t learning from their mistakes either. Just a few days after losing two of their six seats in the State Senate, they were back to plastering “Keep America Great” all over social media, and even held a virtual fundraiser with Trump’s daughter-in-law, Lara Trump.
* There are two more special election races being decided NEXT WEEK. Let’s show the MassGOP that we won’t stand for Trumpian politics here in Massachusetts--help us elect two more Democrats to the legislature on June 2nd.

"We’re in the middle of the most important election of our lives--and in the middle of an unprecedented health crisis. View this email in your browser
Friend--
We’re in the middle of the most important election of our lives--and in the middle of an unprecedented health crisis.
The general election has begun, and Democrats are calling for a complete overhaul of our elections infrastructure. I’ll be blunt: our elections system will require a seismic shift to ensure a fair election this November.
And Republican’s want to keep it that way. They know that when more people vote, Democrats win, and they’re working hard to quash vote-by-mail efforts. Trump said it himself: vote-by-mail “doesn’t work out well for Republicans.”
This isn’t about who wins or who loses--it’s about defending our Constitutional rights. That’s why I, along with 50 other state party chairs, am calling on our federal legislators to allocate at least $2 billion to implement a universal vote-by-mail system, extended early voting periods, and same day registration.
We’re not just calling for these reforms, we’re implementing them in our own Party. MassDems are holding our caucuses to elect district delegates to the Democratic National Convention completely by mail. We’re asking Massachusetts Democrats to request their ballot to vote for who’s representing them in Milwaukee this August by April 22nd.
REQUEST YOUR DNC DELEGATE BALLOT
I can’t tell you enough how important it is for us to keep democracy going during this pandemic--that’s why we’re leading by example. No one should have to choose between their health and having their voice heard. Request your ballot for district delegate to the Democratic National Convention today.
Democratically yours,

Dear Activist,
Our goal with the Wednesday Wire is to give each of you the tools to take on the Republican Party and help boost Democrats in Massachusetts - so we encourage you to use these talking points on social media, as the basis for a letter to the editor of your local paper, in emails to your personal network, or in conversation with your friends and neighbors.
If you have any questions about this program or would like to see more about a specific issue area, please don't hesitate to reach out to our Communications Manager, Patrick Coyne.
Please share the articles below with your networks and please also be sure to use the hashtag #Mapoli or #BakerFail when sharing this information on social media.
As 2019 draws to a close and we look back on the year, one thing that’s been consistent every single week is the managerial failures of Governor Baker. He pitched himself to voters as the businessman Massachusetts needed. But 5 years into his Governorship, we can see that’s far from reality.
There are too many to list all of them here, but to mark the end of his 5th year in office and his 5th year of failing the Commonwealth, we’re highlighting the top 5 facts about Baker and his administration in 2019.
Baker’s Achilles Heel: the MBTA Safety Report
Last week, a bombshell report on the MBTA was released, highlighting in concerning detail the leadership failures that have created a poisonous culture at the MBTA. As the report clearly states, safety is not a priority and fear of blame or retribution prevents employees from raising serious safety concerns.
* This report proves what we all already knew— Charlie Baker doesn’t care about the MBTA and he doesn’t care about those of us who rely on it.
* It’s easy for Baker to be lenient on safety and not prioritize fixing the T because he travels by motorcade. But the hundreds of thousands of commuters who rely on the subway system, buses, and commuter rail to get to and from work each day do not have that luxury.
* From derailments to track fires, 2019 has seen a near-constant stream of serious mechanical failures and hazards on the MBTA. While the Governor spends his commute sitting in a comfortable motorcade, commuters across the state are stuck on disabled trains or standing out in the cold waiting 30 minutes or more for a train.
* It isn’t “virtue signaling” to understand what many of your constituents deal with every day, it’s doing your job. Baker can’t fix a system he refuses to take the time to understand.
Baker’s Failed Transportation Plan: Say Nothing, Do Nothing
In 2019, voters felt the effects of our failing transportation system and our crumbling infrastructure. Their frustration was warranted, given the release of a report finding nearly 500 bridges in Massachusetts are “structurally deficient” and growing concern over the deteriorating Alewife parking garage.
* Baker told voters that he would bring a businessman’s perspective and skills to Beacon Hill. But he has been the Governor since 2014--our infrastructure and transportation have become growing disasters.
* He has failed to give this issue and others the attention and investment they require, and Massachusetts residents are feeling the backlash from this failure of leadership.
Another Baker Blunder: The State Police Scandal
Investigations this year revealed not only that State Troopers were lying about their hours to get paid extra overtime salaries, but they were also “regularly ordered” to do so by their supervisors.
* Every new revelation about the corruption and scandal at the State Police makes it more and more impossible to believe that the Governor was not aware.
* Baker’s lazy and laissez-faire leadership undermined our criminal justice system and wasted thousands of tax-payer dollars.
Baker’s RMV: Chaos and Calamity
All too similar to the State Police scandal, in 2019 we saw the horrible effects of mismanagement of the RMV. Leadership had been warned repeatedly that their aggressive efforts to reduce wait times sacrificed safety, but they refused to listen or change their approach.
* Under Baker’s watch, officials in his own office left essential roles unfilled and threatened to fire employees who raised concerns about abandoning their core duties - putting public safety at risk for months
* Baker’s managerial incompetence has led to serious safety lapses. He touts his past as a businessman but it’s abundantly clear that Baker is unable to effectively lead our government.
Baker’s Weymouth Compressor Plan: Protect Corporations
This year, Baker and his administration withheld crucial air quality data on the controversial Weymouth compressor during legal proceedings. The hearing officer was outraged after discovering that Baker and his team hid the fact that eleven previously undetected toxins were found after additional testing.
* Baker has close ties to the company attempting to build the compressor and his actions have made it clear that he’s more than happy to potentially violate state rules and conceal critical public health information if it helps his corporate buddies.
* One woman has sat in his office for more than 200 days in an effort to speak to the Governor about the compressor. But while the Governor seems to have corporations on speed dial, he refuses to meet with her and or even acknowledge her as he passes her in his lobby.
* Baker’s actions speak volumes. He’d put the health and safety of his constituents at risk for corporations, but won’t even give concerned voters the time of day.

March 31st Special Elections - Pitch in FROM HOME
If there’s anything we’ve learned over the last few weeks, it’s how important it is to have competent leaders in office at every level of government. We can’t afford not to support the incredible Democrats running in this month’s special elections in Taunton and Easton, the Cape, the South Shore, western Mass, and Middlesex County. The MassGOP and Trump’s allies in Mass are giving it everything they’ve got, and we need to step up our efforts. We need your help to turn these purple districts blue, and there are plenty of things you can still do, safely FROM HOME, to make sure Democrats win on 3/31.

MassDems COVID-19 Mitigation Efforts
During these uncertain times, it’s critical that we all do our part to flatten the curve, and keep our friends, family, and everyone around us safe and healthy over the next few weeks. Here are just a few of the ways the MassDems are limiting the spread of COVID-19:
* We’ve temporarily suspended all scheduled convention caucuses. We hope to reschedule the remaining caucuses for late April.
* Should this suspension continue for an extended period of time, we will put into place a process that will ensure remaining delegate seats are filled in those communities that have not yet held caucuses.
* Our Senate District Conferences to elect Caucus members to our State Committee will be held virtually over the next few weeks.
* We’re compiling a list of tools Democratic Town and Ward Committee Chairs can use to take their meetings online.
* Starting this week, we’ve made the decision to close MassDems HQ. Our staff will be working remotely, and can still be reached at (617) 939-0800 or at [[URL REDACTED]]
Make sure you’re doing your part to limit the spread of COVID-19 by practicing social distancing and good hygiene.
Massachusetts Democrats Are Leading the Way
No surprise here, but our Massachusetts Democrats in Congress and the Senate are leading the fight against the coronavirus pandemic in Washington. They’re taking this threat seriously, and have been fighting to make sure that people have the funds, care, and resources they need during this public health crisis.
Show them some love on your own social media platforms.

Friend,
We want you to know that at the MassDems, the well-being of voters and our staff comes first. At a time when everything seems so uncertain, it’s crucial that we all take responsibility for keeping our friends and family safe during this public health crisis.
I personally wanted to reach out to every person that has ever contributed, volunteered, or attended our events to share how we’re doing our part to limit the spread of COVID-19:
* We’ve temporarily suspended all scheduled convention caucuses. We hope to reschedule the remaining caucuses for late April.
* Should this suspension continue for an extended period of time, we’re working around the clock to develop an alternative to ensure all delegates are elected to this year’s convention.
* Our Senate District Conferences to elect Caucus members to our State Committee will be held virtually over the next few weeks.
* We’re compiling a list of tools Democratic Town and Ward Committee Chairs can use to take their meetings online.
* Starting this week, we’ve made the decision to close MassDems HQ. Our staff will be working remotely, and can still be reached at (617) 939-0800 or at [[URL REDACTED]]
Understand that we’ll be monitoring this evolving situation closely, and taking recommendations from our state health officials seriously. We’re sure that during this troubling time you’ll be doing the same, and we urge you to limit your in-person interactions and practice good hygiene. Thank you for your support and understanding as we work together to protect the health and well-being of those around us.

Hi there,
As only the second Democratic State Senator in a district represented by Republicans (including Scott Brown) for the previous 14 years, I’ve been so grateful to be able to count on your support. Now, as I face a Republican challenger in November, I’m going to need your help more than ever.
In 2018, I defeated a four-term incumbent Republican because I ran a strong grassroots campaign, fueled by Democrats like you, based on an agenda to advance social justice, fairness, and equity for all. I’ve been delivering on that positive vision ever since, but my work isn’t done yet, and my reelection to the Senate in November is not by any means guaranteed. That’s why I’m asking for your help:
Will you please chip in $5, $10, $25, $50 or whatever you can to make sure I can continue to fight for our shared values on Beacon Hill?
Now more than ever, we need Democrats serving at every level of government. Democrats believe in science. We believe in people over profits. Democrats believe Black Lives Matter. Two years ago, my district chose brave and unapologetic progressive representation--help us keep building a brighter future for Massachusetts.
If you’re able, even a small donation can make a big difference in down-ballot races like mine, and I’d greatly appreciate your support.
Thank you,
Becca Rausch

"On Thursday, Donald Trump’s Justice Department dropped the case against Trump’s former national security advisor, Michael Flynn. View this email in your browser
Friend,
On Thursday, Donald Trump’s Justice Department dropped the case against Trump’s former national security advisor, Michael Flynn.
You remember, it’s the case brought by Special Counsel Robert Mueller which resulted in Flynn pleading guilty to lying about his contact with Russian officials—TWICE.
This is another move by Attorney General William Barr to undermine the findings of the Muller investigation. It reminds me just how important it is to kick Trump and his cronies out of the White House.
That’s why I’m asking--can you give a $5 gift right now to fund on-the-ground organizing to keep Trump out of office in November?
Trump is hoping the COVID-19 pandemic will distract us from the ongoing corruption taking place in his administration. We need to show him that we are paying attention.
He’s willing to do anything to protect himself and his henchmen. Can you make a $5 contribution right now to help us take on Trump and his allies this November?
DONATE NOW

"That’s how long we have to flip 3 seats in the legislature and protect the Democratic hold in the 37th Middlesex. View this email in your browser
Hi there--
25 days. That’s how long we have to flip 3 seats in the legislature and protect the Democratic hold in the 37th Middlesex. These are some of Massachusetts’ most purple districts, and MassGOP Chair Jim Lyons and his radical right-wing cronies have been clear: they’re giving these races everything they’ve got.
We can’t waste any time. Can you rush a $5 donation to help us hit the ground running in Taunton, Easton, the Cape, the South Shore, western Mass, and Middlesex County?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Express Donate: $5
Express Donate: $10
Express Donate: $25
Or, donate another amount
We’ve got strong Democratic candidates in each of these districts. They know how important issues like climate, education, and transportation are, and they’ve got what it takes to work for them on Beacon Hill.
I’ve been working closely with the campaigns, and just since Tuesday we’ve:
1. Organized volunteers on the ground in each district, ready to talk directly to voters face to face.
2. Set ambitious goals for voter contact, scheduling countless canvasses and phone banks throughout the month.
3. Reached out to community leaders to find out what matters most to them, and how we can work together to elect a Democrat on 3/31.
But our work is far from over. Will you make a donation to elect four new Democrats to the legislature? Your gift will help fund critical voter contact efforts in Taunton, Easton, the Cape, the South Shore, western Mass, and Middlesex County.
DONATE NOW

I’m sure I don’t need to tell you how important it is to vote in this election--1.3 million ballots cast in Massachusetts already says enough.
Tonight, we’re rallying with Senator Ed Markey, Rep. Ayanna Pressley, and KY state Rep. Charles Booker to get out the vote before Election Day---I’m asking you to join us.
Record breaking turnout means victory for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, and it means victory for Massachusetts Democrats running in state-level races.
Every vote counts, and with Donald Trump and the MassGOP working overtime to keep people from the ballot box, it’s absolutely critical to make your plan to vote now, before November 3rd. That’s why I’m asking:
Will you join Massachusetts Democrats tonight to make your plan and hear how you can have the biggest impact during our final push to Election Day? There’s still time left to RSVP before it all kicks off at 7:00 PM.

Would you like to see a Libertarian revolution in Massachusetts? Libertarian candidates for local, district and statewide offices on every ballot?
Would you like it if you never had to hear again that a vote for a Libertarian is a wasted vote, or worse yet, a virtual vote for the opponent of someone else's candidate?
The opportunity to end the duopoly's hammerlock on our government is rapidly approaching, but we have to act fast. Ranked Choice Voting will be on the ballot in Massachusetts for the general election in November. But we MUST educate voters. Voters who understand what RCV is prefer it by a large margin. And we have much less time than you would think. Vote by mail ballots are scheduled to arrive late September to early October. Potentially, we have less than a month to reach every voter in the state.
Join us on Sunday August 30th at 2 pm on Zoom for the YES ON 2 grassroots voter education kickoff. We know that when Massachusetts voters hear about Ranked Choice Voting, they support the issue. At the event, we will lay out our voter education strategy and how YOU can help secure victory! You'll also get a chance to meet some of the inspiring activists and leaders behind this campaign.
The Yes on 2 campaign offers Libertarians an excellent opportunity to experience the nuts and bolts of effective canvassing. The field campaign for RCV is being managed by none other than Alex Arsenault, the dynamic head of the organization that we have contracted to collect signatures for our last two successful statewide ballot drives.
Please consider volunteering for this crucial campaign. Sign up HERE for the Sunday kickoff today.
If you would like to volunteer for this campaign, you can fill out a volunteer form HERE. And let me know too by replying to this email! I am helping to coordinate the Libertarians involved in this effort.
Thanks so much!
