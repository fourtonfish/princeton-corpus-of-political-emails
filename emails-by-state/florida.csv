"## Message from Chairman Joe Gruters
President Trump is on fire for America and Florida is on fire for President Trump! The President wrapped up an 18-hour, five-state day of rallies Sunday with a rally at the Opa-Locka Airport in Miami-Dade last night that lasted into this morning. Thousands of Floridians stayed until 1:30 a.m. today to hear the President — who just will not stop working for America!
The momentum — from the President to the voters — is palpable. We are seeing record Republican voter turnout, vastly overperforming previous elections in Miami-Dade and elsewhere in the state. We are seeing a huge leap in support from Hispanic and black voters.
Counties around the state are reporting a surge in Republican voting in Vote By Mail and in Early Voting. Some counties were already nearing 70 percent Republican turnout by Sunday, which is astonishing. This election is going to turn on getting out our voters and we are doing it!
But we cannot take our foot off the gas for even a moment because the Democrats are desperate to win Florida. Remember that Vote By Mail ballots can still be handed in at your local Supervisor of Elections Office.
President Trump gave Florida Lieutenant Governor Jeanette Nunez a big shout-out for her highly successful efforts as National Co-Chair of Latinos for Trump. She has driven the President’s message of making America great again, improving the livelihood of Hispanics and fighting back against socialism, leading to an outpouring of Hispanic support for the President.
This is seen dramatically in Miami-Dade, where Hispanics are flat out rejecting the Biden-Harris socialist agenda and throwing their support to President Trump. According to a Miami Herald survey, the President is actually beating Biden in Miami-Dade among Hispanics, by 47 percent to 46 percent, which is a large jump from 2016.
Here’s Lieutenant Governor Nunez on Fox and Friends explaining the surging support for President Trump among Hispanics.
President Trump is the only candidate ready and willing to defend religious liberties from the onslaught from the left. Fort Myers-Naples GOP congressional candidate Byron Donalds cut a video for the RPOF on the importance of voting our religious conscience on Believers and Ballots Day Sunday.
Over the past few months, I’ve been in dozens of Florida communities, door-knocking, campaigning with local GOP candidates and helping with local County Get Out The Vote rallies. And it has become abundantly clear to me that our ground game of hard-working volunteers is what is winning this campaign.
We’re going to bring home Florida for President Trump and we’re going to maintain our majority of Congressional seats and state House and Senate seats. And it all would be impossible without the thousands of grassroots Republicans who get out and work the phones, knock on doors and do all that is necessary to make this a successful year.
The finish line is in sight. We all need one final sprint and lean towards the line. Together, we’re going to keep Florida red!
Make sure to wear your Trump gear every chance you get. It demonstrates the level of support the President has here and encourages others.
Everyone must vote NO on Amendment 3 to maintain the integrity of the Republican Party in Florida. The Amendment destroys Republicans’ ability to choose our candidate for office and could leave only two Democrat options on a ballot in the General Election. Share widely the importance of this NO vote on Amendment 3.
## Governor Ron DeSantis Update
Governor DeSantis spoke ahead of President Trump at the President’s Tampa rally Thursday, encouraging voters to storm the polls to deliver Florida again into the Republican column and provide the President with four more years of a strong economy, strong military, constitutional judges, secure borders and law and order in our nation.
And he took aim directly at the increasingly hostile media.
“If we go out and do what we need to do and deliver a big victory, you will be sending a message to the media about their fake news and everything they’ve done over the last four years,” Governor DeSantis said to cheers.
The Governor pointed out that just in October, the President has hosted five Florida rallies in Sanford, Ocala, The Villages, Pensacola and Tampa. “I am half his age. I can’t keep up with the guy,” DeSantis said.
## President Donald Trump Update
Even as the election frenzy is peaking, and President Trump is doing four to five rallies daily, he is still conducting the nation’s business. The President ordered a rescue operation of an American citizen in Nigeria Saturday, approving a plan to send in SEAL Team Six.
The man was abducted from his farm in neighboring Niger several days ago. Officials told ABC that all but one of seven captors were killed during the raid.
""Last night, at my direction, the United States military conducted a successful operation to rescue an American hostage in Nigeria, kidnapped just 96 hours earlier. United States Special Forces executed a daring nighttime operation to rescue their fellow American with exceptional skill, precision, and bravery. Today’s operation should serve as a stark warning to terrorists and criminal thugs who mistakenly believe they can kidnap Americans with impunity.""

America’s incarceration rate has dropped to its lowest level since 1995, led by a sharp decline in the percentage of blacks and Hispanics sent to jail during the Trump administration, according to a new Justice Department tally.
For minorities, the focus of President Trump’s First Step Act prison and criminal reform plan, the rate is the lowest in decades. For blacks, the incarceration rate in state and federal prisons is the lowest in 31 years, and for Hispanics, it is down 24 percent.
“Across the decade from 2009 to 2019, the imprisonment rate fell 29% among black residents, 24% among Hispanic residents and 12% among white residents. In 2019, the imprisonment rate of black residents was the lowest it has been in 30 years, since 1989,” said the report.

Important talking points to remember about Absentee Ballots, aka Vote by Mail:
* Florida’s Absentee Balloting (also known as Vote by Mail) is safe and secure and has been used in Florida for many years, as President Trump has said.
* It is important to note that Florida’s system requires a registered voter to initiate and follow a process requesting the ballots, and there have been no significant issues with this system in Florida.
* But Florida does not have or support all-mail voting, or universal mail-ins, being discussed in other states, which President Trump and the RPOF staunchly oppose.

###  Governor Ron DeSantis and First Lady Casey DeSantis will be joining President Donald Trump on his campaign stops in Pensacola and the Villages today!
Join Us: Pensacola | The Villages
With less than two weeks to go, the polling gap has closed rapidly in Florida. Multiple polls are now showing that Florida is within the margin of error for either candidate, which gives President Trump the momentum. But it’s a dead heat, making every Republican vote all the more critical to ensuring that Florida remains red.
The Florida GOP’s ground game successes are now well-established in the Florida media. Democrats, recognizing the urgency of their deficit, are struggling to catch up, having only begun tentative door-knocking two weeks ago.
Peter Schorsch of Florida Politics tweeted: “If @RealDonaldTrump wins Florida again, a lot of credit has to go to @JoeGruters and the ground game he has put together. Great story about that blocking and tackling from @MitchPerry18.”

Republicans continue to win Florida on the ground. On Saturday, RPOF Chairman Joe Gruters and Vice Chairman Christian Ziegler will be part of an Early Voting Rally in Sarasota County. The RPOF is urging all counties to hold these events to crank up early voting.
After that, they will continue the ground attack by walking and door-knocking in counties around the state, as Republicans have been doing for many months now. Part of the message will be encouraging Republicans to vote early.
NO on A3: More media around the state have come out in favor of Amendment 3 to abolish party primaries, making it all the more important for every Republican to vote No on Amendment 3 and to let everyone else know that if it passes it will ultimately limit their choices in a General Election and make Florida look more like California.
Amendment 3 is a gateway for more big PACs and backroom powerbrokers to squeeze out grassroots Republicans. Remember, it is the system California uses — a one-party state rapidly becoming a shell of its former self. No on Amendment 3.
## Governor Ron DeSantis Update
Governor DeSantis and Education Commissioner Richard Corcoran said during an appearance at Jacksonville Classical Academy this week that schools should not shut down again. DeSantis said the “physical, mental and social well-being of our kids required us to provide them with the option of in-person learning.”
School unions challenged the July reopening order, but an appeals court ruled in favor of Governor DeSantis, whose administration argued that families should be given the option of having their children learn in person or online.
“Going forward, whatever the future may hold, school closures should be off the table,” Governor DeSantis said. ""They don't do anything to mitigate COVID. But they do cause catastrophic damage to the physical, mental, and social well-being of our youth. Let's not repeat any mistakes of the past.""

The Florida Department of Children and Families (DCF) received a nearly $5 million emergency grant to implement a Crisis Counseling Program to help Floridians respond to the behavioral health impacts resulting from the pandemic.
The grant, awarded by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), will provide crisis counseling services through Florida’s network of 2-1-1 crisis helplines, helping people in need of mental or behavioral health counseling and referrals.
“Governor DeSantis and I are grateful for the opportunity to increase access to critical behavioral health services,” First Lady Casey DeSantis said. “Through this program, one-on-one counseling will be readily available to those in crisis, ensuring they have the resources and support they need to address their own specific needs, recover fully, and begin to move forward with purpose.”

President Trump has been keeping his promise to secure our borders and fix America’s broken immigration system, creating a more orderly process and helping American workers.
So far, more than 370 miles of new border wall is complete. At the same time, President Trump’s administration is arresting, prosecuting and deporting violent criminals, stopping the flow of illegal drugs, and closing loopholes that help smugglers and hurt our citizens. Apprehensions for illegal immigration dropped 70% between last May and this August. And during the past fiscal year alone, U.S. law enforcement seized more than 100,000 pounds of cocaine, 83,000 pounds of meth, 2,700 pounds of fentanyl, and more.
“The refugee system — set up to provide refuge for victims of war and persecution who had nowhere else to go, often on an explicitly temporary basis — had long since become a racket,” National Border Patrol Council President Brandon Judd writes. “It provided prestigious jobs in Washington for ‘resettlement experts’ and taxpayer money for glorified slumlords, while generating massive fallout for unsuspecting American communities. Today the system has finally been returned to its proper role.”

A record economic recovery is under way and picking up steam. Brian Wesbury, chief economist at First Trust Advisors, wrote in Real Clear Politics:
“There is nothing normal about the 2020 recession. Massive nationwide shutdowns of ‘non-essential’ businesses caused real GDP to drop at a 31.4% annual rate in the second quarter, the biggest drop since the 1930s. However, as we expected, a V-shaped recovery is being traced out. On October 29th, in ten days, we expect a report that says third quarter real GDP rebounded at a 33.4% annual rate.
“We may make some minor adjustments to this forecast when new reports on business investment, inventories, and international trade are released, but the third quarter will still be one of the largest jumps in output the US has ever experienced.
“That said, the sharp rebound in Q3 is a testament to the underlying strength of the US economy before the shutdowns happened, combined with the seemingly unlimited ingenuity of American people. Twenty years ago, without the technology we have today, there is no way the US could have rebounded as quickly as it did in the third quarter. Moreover, the US entered this government-mandated recession with the highest incomes and lowest poverty rate we have ever recorded.”

Let’s put a fine point on it: President Trump and Governor DeSantis were right all along to resist shutdowns to deal with COVID. And for Governor DeSantis, it was for many of the common sense reasons that public health experts are now acknowledging, along with a better understanding of the spread and lethality of the virus.
None other than the World Health Organization (WHO) has changed its position on government lockdowns as the primary way to combat the coronavirus. The WHO now says that lockdowns have unintended but heavy consequences on the poor, the isolated and others, and should be avoided.
The Wall Street Journal reports that as there is another wave of infections in Europe and some places in the U.S., there is now a consensus among experts beyond the WHO: “[[URL REDACTED]] time — unlike in the spring — public-health experts broadly and increasingly agree, with some worried that the general public won’t cooperate with another monthslong, generalized lockdown against a disease whose transmission is now much better understood.”
""We in the World Health Organization do not advocate lockdowns as the primary means of control of this virus,” Dr. David Nabarro, the WHO's Special Envoy on Covid-19 told The Spectator.
Dr. Nabarro referred to the harmful impacts of prolonged lockdowns that President Trump have Governor DeSantis warned about for months. “Lockdowns just have one consequence that you must never ever belittle, and that is making poor people an awful lot poorer.”

The Sarasota Herald-Tribune published Chairman Joe Gruters’ column on Amendment 3 on Wednesday and other Florida newspapers owned by New Media may pick it up. It’s a good primer on the destructive nature of A3.
“The “All Voters Vote” Amendment 3 on the Florida ballot this November is cleverly named and perhaps well-intended, but it is destructive of a system that has served Floridians for a century, and could result in fewer actual options for voters.
“Amendment 3 rewrites our Constitution to completely change how we choose Florida’s governor, Cabinet, and Legislature. It will undoubtedly insert confusion and chaos into elections and undo a system that has worked fairly for years, while benefiting consultants and special interests and reducing options to all voters, whether Republican, Democrat or other. This is a back door for the powerful and influential to choose candidates, elbowing aside the grass roots in both major parties.”

## Governor Ron DeSantis Update
Governor DeSantis appeared on The Mark Levin Show this week discussing the state’s success with lowering taxes and regulation to become an economic powerhouse, among many other topics. In response to a Levin question on the upcoming election, Governor DeSantis said:
“When Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton, there were about 350,000 more registered Democrats than Republicans in the state of Florida. Now it’s less than 180,000 [[URL REDACTED]] will be the closest Republicans have ever been to Democrats in Florida in the history of the state. I think that’s a testament to folks looking to Florida as a place they can find greener pastures. We see people who are fed up with high taxes in Illinois or the Northeast and they come down. And I do think that many of them are registering as Republicans.
I think they understand we’ve had laboratories of democracy in this country, with the states doing different approaches, and approaches like Florida have been more successful. So I think the President is facing an electorate that is more inclined to vote for him in 2020 than the one he successfully convinced to vote for him in 2016.”
## President Donald Trump Update
President Trump’s nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court, Amy Coney Barrett, is simply wrecking Senate Democrats' attempts to vilify her and derail her nomination.
As expected, Judge Barrett is proving masterful of the U.S. Constitution, the laws, and the importance of separation of powers, just embarrassing Senate Democrats along the way. At one point when asked after hours of answering questions what notes she had relied upon, she held up a blank notepad the Senate provided. She had answered and expounded on every point of law that Senators raised — from memory. What an amazing choice by President Trump!
According to a Morning Consult poll, fewer than one-third of Americans want the Senate to reject Barrett’s nomination. So Democrats have made their strategy clear: distraction. Rather than question Judge Barrett’s credentials — which are virtually unparalleled and have won bipartisan praise in the past — they are trying to disrupt the process with yet another fight about Obamacare.
“Courts are not designed to solve every problem or right every wrong in our public life,” she said. “The policy decisions and value judgements of government must be made by the political branches, elected by and accountable to the people.”

U.S. small business confidence rose last month to its highest point since the onset of the pandemic earlier this year, with more firms experiencing an uptick in foot traffic and sales, according to a monthly survey released this week.
The National Federation of Independent Business Optimism Index rose 3.8 points to 104 in September, the highest level since February, when the economy was booming. After crashing to a seven-year low in April, the index has rebounded sharply as restrictions imposed on businesses and consumers to contain the spread of COVID have continued easing.
Nine of the index’s 10 components showed improvement, led by a 13-point improvement in business owners’ assessment of earnings trends. A larger net percentage of firms expect the economy to improve as well, and a growing percentage expect to increase employment in the next three months.

President Trump has lowered medical costs and increased Medicare options by pursuing market competition, according to Seema Verda, Administrator of the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, writing in the Houston Chronicle.
“For almost four years, President Donald Trump has promoted reforms to Medicare that favor market competition over Washington meddling. The results are in: America’s seniors today enjoy a stronger program that offers more and better benefits at lower costs…Combined, beneficiaries have saved approximately $3.4 billion in Medicare Advantage and Part D premium costs since 2017.”

"###  Governor Ron DeSantis, Florida GOP Help Power President Trump to Victory in the Sunshine State
GOP also retains control of both houses of the Florida Legislature
Tonight, following the closing of polls across all 67 counties, Governor Ron DeSantis announced that President Donald J. Trump has secured enough votes to win the state of Florida and that Republicans will retain control of both chambers of the Florida Legislature.
These efforts are the culmination of more than a yearlong effort by Governor Ron DeSantis to drive historic Republican voter registration and spearhead fundraising efforts to position President Trump and down ballot candidates for victory.
“I am proud to announce that Florida has once again delivered for President Donald J. Trump and that Florida Republicans will retain control of both chambers of the Florida Legislature,” said Governor Ron DeSantis. “Tonight’s results are the culmination of our efforts to drive historic Republican voter registration, mobilize a grassroots get out the vote initiative, and raise more than $20 million to support President Trump’s campaign, as well as congressional, legislative and down ballot races. To all Republican voters who showed up and voted in record numbers: Thank you for performing your civic duty and doing your part to help President Trump secure four more years in the White House.”
Florida Senate President-Designate Wilton Simpson said, “Floridians cast their ballots in record numbers, making their voices heard up and down the ballot across the state. Tonight we celebrate these tremendous victories and tomorrow we get back to work on behalf of the hardworking people of Florida. We are incredibly grateful to Governor DeSantis for his steadfast support.”
Florida House Speaker-Designate Chris Sprowls said, “Republican governance received overwhelming support tonight all across Florida. From the policies that we have enacted to date, to the pledge of no new taxes, a continued business-friendly state, standing up to lawlessness, and making sure that crucial decisions are made by Florida families, the Republican team, led by our great Governor, Ron DeSantis, and our policies continue to be embraced by Floridians because they work.”
No other governor across the nation has done more to help pave the way for Republican victories in their state like Governor Ron DeSantis:
More than $20 Million Raised for GOP Victories
* Governor DeSantis has raised more than $12 million for President Trump’s reelection efforts in Florida.
* In addition to his efforts on behalf of the President, Governor DeSantis has raised more than $8 million for congressional, legislative and down ballot races.
* The Governor has accomplished these fundraising milestones at the expense of his own fundraising efforts.
* The Republican Party of Florida (RPOF), through Governor DeSantis’ efforts, has been able to provide administrative resources and personnel to assist Trump’s reelection. The RPOF hired over 190 field staffers that increased our boots-on-the-ground presence. Funds raised by Governor DeSantis have also been used for ad placements, historic voter registration efforts and get out the vote efforts.
Historic Voter Registration
$1 Million Invested, 1 Million Calls
* Governor DeSantis invested more than $1 million to launch a grassroots voter registration effort across the entire state, including over 1 million calls, as well as surveys and door knocking outreach.
* Governor DeSantis and the RPOF provided critical data to enhance President Trump’s reelection efforts and volunteer voter registration program. As a result, Florida Republicans have narrowed the gap to 134,000 which is the smallest difference between the two parties in Florida history.
Historic Efforts to Protect Voter Integrity
* Governor DeSantis has focused on protecting the security and integrity of Florida’s elections, including the announcement that the state would join the Registration Information Center (ERIC). By joining ERIC, Florida will be able to crosscheck voter registration data with 29 other member states in order to identify duplicate registrations and outdated records from voters who have moved or passed away, leading to cleaner and more accurate voter registration rolls.
* Since taking office, Governor DeSantis has invested significant resources into cybersecurity and in June 2020 signed an executive order allowing Supervisors of Elections increased flexibility to canvass ballots in anticipation of a higher volume of ballots.
* Governor DeSantis signed an executive order suspending Palm Beach County Supervisor of Elections Susan Bucher and accepted the resignation of Brenda Snipes, the former supervisor of elections for Broward County, following issues that occurred in the 2018 election.

President Trump roused a crowd of thousands in a Tampa rally Thursday afternoon outside Raymond James Stadium, matching the enthusiasm of Floridians — some of whom had been gathering since before sunrise — with his own unparalleled enthusiasm for America and Americans. The case for another four years has never been stronger. The giant rally swamped the embarrassingly small, subdued “drive-in” gathering that Joe Biden held later in Tampa.
The timing of Thursday’s rally was perfect as the President pointed out the Third Quarter GDP numbers that were released just hours earlier exceeded even sky-high expectations at 33.1 percent growth. That translates into millions of jobs returning and hope for families and businesses across the country. The amazing part of this V-shaped economic rebound is that it is being done with the large economic engines of California and New York still mostly shutdown.
President Trump was introduced by First Lady Melania Trump and joined by Governor Ron DeSantis, First Lady Casey DeSantis, Lieutenant Governor Jeanette Nunez and RPOF Chairman Joe Gruters.
It was a great Monday night as the Republican Senate approved President Trump’s third Supreme Court Justice appointment, and Amy Coney Barrett was sworn in two hours later by Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. This is what Republican leadership looks like. Efficiently, without loud histrionics, getting the work of the nation done and making sure the Supreme Court will rule on the law and Constitution as it is supposed to — not on the personal policy preferences of unelected Justices.
In brief remarks after her swearing in, Barrett reiterated the importance of judicial impartiality while serving on the court. “It is the job of a judge to resist her policy preference…(it would be a) dereliction of duty to give in to them,” she said. “This separation of duty is what makes the judiciary distinct among the three branches of government.”
ACB is the real deal, in the mold of Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas and other great Constitutionalists. She will do the nation proud.
The full court press continues with Gruters and Vice Chairman Ziegler criss-crossing the state, walking and door-knocking with energetic and committed Republican volunteers and candidates sprinting to the Nov. 3 finish line. They will be in West Palm Beach today, Sarasota on Saturday and Miami on Sunday. Republicans in Florida refuse to cede any ground to Democrats anywhere. We’re fighting for every vote because we’re fighting for our nation’s future.
Earlier this week, the RPOF leaders traveled to Escambia, Santa Rosa, Okaloosa, Walton, Lake and Clay counties, seeing real momentum among the hundreds of enthusiastic Republicans they worked with. They also were with Donald Trump, Jr. at an event in Duval County.
Gruters spoke before Ivanka Trump’s speech in Sarasota Tuesday to a huge crowd gathered at Nathan Benderson Park’s world-class rowing facility. Congressmen Greg Steube and Vern Buchanan also spoke at the event.
## Governor Ron DeSantis Update
Governor DeSantis and First Lady Casey DeSantis announced that the state of Florida has been awarded $5 million in funding to create a new pilot program, Support to Communities: Fostering Opioid Recovery through Workforce Development.
The pilot program will address the health and economic impacts of widespread substance and opioid misuse, addiction and overdose. Funding will provide a full array of wrap-around services including recovery and supportive services, career training and employment services to participants directly impacted by the opioid epidemic.
“The opioid crisis continues to be a public health concern in Florida,” Governor DeSantis said. “We are grateful to U.S. Secretary of Labor Eugene Scalia for partnering with Florida to implement this pilot program.”

Governor DeSantis announced the appointment of John Davis as Secretary of the Florida Lottery.
“John has extensive experience in the public and private sectors and is involved in his community, donating his time and talents to help kids and vulnerable Floridians succeed,” Governor DeSantis said. “His business focus and passion for student-success will serve him well as he takes over this important department.”
Davis, of Orlando, is Executive Vice President of the Orlando Regional Chamber of Commerce. Previously, was President of the African American Chamber of Commerce of Central Florida. John also serves on the Florida A&M University Law School Dean's Advisory Council. A native of Pahokee, he earned his bachelor’s degree in political science from Florida State University where he was a standout safety of the Seminole football team.

During a meeting of the Children and Youth Cabinet, First Lady Casey DeSantis announced a statewide partnership with T-Mobile to provide over 600,000 Florida families 100GB of internet per year over the next five years.
This partnership seeks to ensure Florida families have internet access to supplement the hard work in the classroom and coincides with T-Mobile’s Project 10Million. Project 10Million is a national campaign to increase internet connectivity to millions of student households at no cost to them by offering free wireless hotspots and free high-speed data with the goal of making it available to Florida K-12 students who participate in the national school lunch program for low-income families.

## President Donald Trump Update
After her swearing in as the newest U.S. Supreme Court Justice, Amy Coney Barrett gave a short speech reaffirming her belief in judges setting aside their personal preferences when ruling on cases.
“The confirmation process has made ever clearer to me one of the fundamental differences between the federal judiciary and the United States Senate. And perhaps the most acute is the role of policy preferences. It is the job of a senator to pursue her policy preferences. In fact, it would be a dereliction of duty for her to put policy goals aside. By contrast, it is the job of a judge to resist her policy preferences. It would be a dereliction of duty for her to give in to them.
“Federal judges don’t stand for election, thus they have no basis for claiming that their preferences reflect those of the people. This separation of duty from political preference is what makes the judiciary distinct among the three branches of government…A judge declares independence, not only from Congress and the president, but also from the private beliefs that might otherwise move her. The judicial oath captures the essence of the judicial duty — the rule of law must always control.”
“She is one of our nation’s most brilliant legal scholars,” Trump said.

Over the past three years, construction crews have installed 90 miles of border wall and almost 40 miles more of a parallel, back-up wall in the Yuma border patrol region, one of the busiest areas for illegal border crossings. And it’s had a real impact in slowing the crossings.
Agents suspect that when the coronavirus pandemic passes and they are no longer able to immediately return illegal immigrants south of the border, as they have been able to, more will attempt to sneak into the U.S. With so many miles of new wall in place, Border Patrol’s head of the Yuma region, Anthony Porvaznik, thinks his agents now actually stand a chance at holding the line.
“We're much better positioned right now to deal with that traffic when they do come than we have been in the past,” Anthony Porvaznik said.

It’s worth remembering that American leaders from both parties stood down to China for 40 years. The Chinese Communist Party broke the rules on global trade, allowed Chinese firms to steal technology from American companies, and in turn destroyed entire sectors of the American economy.
The corporate class and its chosen “experts,” turned a blind eye to China’s human rights abuses and crackdowns on speech. Washington politicians fell in line: Just open America’s markets to China, they said, and the CCP will change its ways and become a responsible global citizen as it grows richer and stronger.
They were wrong. Under President Trump, America is fighting back.

CHECK OUT: @FloridaGOP and retweet and share. We need to share the Republican message around the state and you are an integral part of making that happen.
Important talking points to remember about Absentee Ballots, aka Vote by Mail:
* Florida’s Absentee Balloting (also known as Vote by Mail) is safe and secure and has been used in Florida for many years, as President Trump has said.
* It is important to note that Florida’s system requires a registered voter to initiate and follow a process requesting the ballots, and there have been no significant issues with this system in Florida.
* But Florida does not have or support all-mail voting, or universal mail-ins, being discussed in other states, which President Trump and the RPOF staunchly oppose.

"The attacks from the media, Hollywood, universities, social media, well-organized protesters and the rest of the Democratic Party have been relentless against our President. And yet even getting COVID could not slow down President Trump for more than a few days before he was back on track fighting for the American people.
He’s leading by example, setting a hard, tenacious work ethic regardless of the lies and smears. Working for a better America despite the hate and the attacks. Doing the right thing for all Americans. And that leadership on behalf of a better America is translating on the ground as enthusiasm after President Trump’s rapid recovery is now higher than ever.
With just 22 days until the election, we are giving it everything we have to ensure Florida votes red for President Trump and all Republicans. And we are not alone. This week I hit eight counties to walk and door-knock with local Republicans, many with Vice Chairman Christian Zeigler, with dozens and dozens of volunteers.
It’s so heartening to see so many hard-working volunteers going door to door and street to street in Martin, Pasco, Citrus, Putnam, Bradford, Baker, St. John’s and Flagler counties. In St John’s, we broke a record for the number of doors knocked in a county in one day. It’s a great sign for our chances to win in November — if we keep it up. The Democrats are nowhere to be found, but they are spending a lot of money on TV ads. I believe our personal touch wins over voters more effectively.
The confirmation hearings of Judge Amy Coney Barrett begin today and all signs are that she will be savaged by Democrats smearing her and creating a religious test for the Supreme Court. America and Judge Barrett deserve better. The Wall Street Journal makes the point:
“I’ve seen this before, and it’s not pretty. Critics of Judge Amy Coney Barrett are framing their skepticism with a noble-sounding pretext: Judges shouldn’t bring their personal views into the courtroom. But their real worry is far more chilling. To put it bluntly, America’s cultural elites aren’t sure that a faithful Christian can be entrusted with the law,” Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Brian Hagedorn writes in The Wall Street Journal.

I was also in a debate with Florida Democratic Party Chair Terrie Rizzo at a Florida Tiger Bay event where we agreed on one thing: Amendment 3 is bad for Florida. Florida Politics quoted me from the debate:
“I blame a lot of the media who gives the attention to the bomb throwers on each side,” Gruters said. “If you’re in D.C. and you want to be on TV on one of these news channels, you have to go and attack and go for the kill and strike your opponents.”
Gruters, notably, drew a distinction between Tallahassee and Washington. “We have full grown respect for each other,” he said of Florida’s capital. “We have respect for the process. We’ve worked together on numerous bills up there.”

I cannot emphasize enough the importance of voting NO on Amendment 3 to maintain the integrity of the Republican Party in Florida. The Amendment destroys Republicans’ ability to choose our candidate for office and could leave only two Democrat options on a ballot in the General Election. Share widely the importance of this NO vote on Amendment 3.
## Governor Ron DeSantis Update
On the eve of the two-year anniversary of Hurricane Michael’s historic landfall, Governor DeSantis highlighted the state of Florida’s milestones that have been brought to communities still recovering from that devastating hurricane.
“On my first day in office as Governor I committed to the people of Northwest Florida that helping them recover from Hurricane Michael would be a top priority,” Governor DeSantis said. “Today, that commitment remains as strong as ever. We will continue working as hard as we can to help all affected communities rebuild stronger than ever before.”
Dane Eagle, Executive Director of the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity, said: “DEO has been a proactive partner in Northwest Florida helping communities recover from the devastating impacts caused by Hurricane Michael, and I’m proud of the work we’ve accomplished. Floridians are resilient, and through Rebuild Florida, we will ensure communities are better equipped to handle future storms.”

First Lady Casey DeSantis announced that counties in Northwest Florida still rebuilding from Hurricane Michael will be receiving an additional $5.2 million to expand telemental health services, rebuild early education facilities, and ensure Florida’s youngest learners and their families are ready and able to return to school and work.
Throughout the pandemic, Florida Early Learning Coalitions have successfully kept childcare and early learning programs open to serve Florida’s youngest learners with a 98% open rate. Florida’s 3,700 Early Learning Providers have maintained childcare and early learning support for more than 20,000 children of first responders, health care professionals and law enforcement since April. Florida’s early learning efforts have been the strongest in the nation, and these funds will expand on our efforts to support our youngest learners, and their families.
“The Governor and I have not and will not forget the ongoing needs of the good people of Northwest Florida who continue to work hard to rebuild their communities and their lives in the wake of Hurricane Michael,” First Lady DeSantis said.

## President Donald Trump Update
President Trump is roaring back into the campaign by holding a rally tonight at 7 p.m. at Orlando Sanford International Airport. According to WESH-2 TV in Orlando, people began lining up for the event Sunday night.
The President had been scheduled to attend a rally at the airport Oct. 2, but the event was canceled after he contracted COVID. But as soon as he could safely return, he did so.
Monday’s rally will come a little more than three weeks before the Nov. 3 election, with Trump widely viewed as needing to win Florida if he is going to defeat Democrat Joe Biden. Sanford is in Central Florida’s Interstate 4 corridor, which is typically a fiercely contested region of the state.
Vice President Mike Pence made two Central Florida campaign stops on Saturday.

A trio of conservative leaders wrote in The Hill a defense of Amy Coney Barrett’s nomination and confirmation:
“Even before President Trump announced that Judge Amy Coney Barrett would be his latest Supreme Court nominee, the heated attacks started. Many on the left have threatened riots, impeachment, and packing the Supreme Court if the Senate confirmed his choice instead of waiting to hand a potential President Biden the chance to fill the vacant seat next year.
“Our system of democracy is at risk from such attacks.
“Yet all Americans who care about their freedom and the freedom of their children can now applaud the nomination of Barrett. Rather than being a Republican or a Democrat, she is an originalist, as originalist justices are one of the great safeguards of our rights in this country.”

“President Trump recently spoke about his health care accomplishments and invited the American people to share his vision for health care in his second term, which he has coined the American First Health Care Plan,” Nick Stehle, vice president of communications at the Foundation for Government Accountability, wrote at Townhall.
“The president's work on health care so far has helped tremendously to assuage voters' fears about skyrocketing premiums and unexpected medical bills. Key to this has been offering affordable alternatives to rigid, pricey ObamaCare plans. President Trump expanded access to association health plans, which allow small business owners to band together to buy insurance like one big company — at a significantly reduced cost. These plans could lower premiums for more than four million Americans and encourage entrepreneurship during a time when Americans desperately need entrepreneurs to create jobs and bring our economy roaring back to life.
“He also increased the availability of short-term health plans, which cost 50 to 80 percent less than individual market plans. And they're working exceedingly well for people who find themselves between jobs or starting a new business. President Trump expanded health reimbursement arrangements and lowered prescription drug prices, consequently producing the largest annual decrease in prescription drug prices in more than 50 years.”

## Governor Ron DeSantis Update
Florida Surgeon General Dr. Scott A. Rivkees announced last week that the Department of Health will conduct a more thorough review of all COVID fatalities reported to the state, as the fatality data reported to the state consistently causes confusion and requires a more rigorous review.
Of the 95 fatalities reported to the state in one day last week, 16 had more than a two-month separation between the time the individuals tested positive and passed away, and 11 of the deaths occurred more than a month ago.
Dr. Rivkees said: “During a pandemic, the public must be able to rely on accurate public health data to make informed decisions. To ensure the accuracy of COVID-19 related deaths, the Department will be performing additional reviews of all deaths. Timely and accurate data remains a top priority of the Department of Health.”

Governor DeSantis was in Fort Myers Thursday to announce that he has directed the Division of Emergency Management to update Florida’s emergency order on long-term care facility visitation.
The updated order has four main provisions: removes the current prohibition on child visitation, eases restrictions on outdoor visitation, clarifies that there are no social distancing requirements for compassionate caregivers and eliminates the five-person maximum number of general visitors.
“Family connection is very important. We are committed to empowering residents and families to unite and safely connect in person once again,” Gov. DeSantis said.

## President Donald Trump Update
Trump Victory has talked to more voters than any other campaign in history. Last week, Trump Victory made 13.7 million voter contacts nationally, shattering the 10 million total phone calls our volunteers made for President Trump in 2016. Our total voter contacts are now at 158 million — the largest ever.
Our very own Florida Trump Victory continues to set records every day. Just last week volunteers knocked on 3 million doors and made 1 million phone calls to Floridians. This election cycle alone, Florida Trump Victory has made over 21 million voter contacts, held over 55,000 events and continues to activate tens of thousands of volunteers.
The Democrats are falling woefully short on the ground in the face of Trump Victory’s superior ground game and passion. On Thursday evening, over 12,000 supporters rallied around President Trump at 906 debate watch parties held across the country.

President Donald Trump announced Friday that Sudan will start to normalize ties with Israel, making it the third Arab state to do so as part of U.S.-brokered deals.
The announcement came after the North African nation agreed to put $335 million in an escrow account to be used to compensate American victims of terror attacks. The attacks include the 1998 bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania by the al-Qaida network while its leader, Osama bin Laden, was living in Sudan. In exchange, Trump notified Congress on Friday of his intent to remove Sudan from the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism.
It was yet another foreign policy achievement for Trump just 11 days before Election Day. Previously, the Trump administration engineered diplomatic pacts between Israel and the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain — the first such agreements since Jordan recognized Israel in the 1990s and Egypt in the 1970s. Trump said at least five other countries want to come into the deal, which is collectively called the Abraham Accords.

“When we launched Operation Warp Speed (OWS), the unprecedented effort to produce and deliver safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines to Americans in record time, skeptics questioned the viability of such an undertaking,” U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar wrote on Fox News.
“The goals we set were optimistic and unprecedented. But it is now highly credible that OWS will have produced up to 100 million doses of safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine doses, made in America, by the end of 2020—twelve months from the publishing of the viral sequence.
“Advances in science are the foundation for this progress. But the broader set of requirements for ultimate success—unwavering leadership, ingenuity, determination, the commitment of enormous resources, exceptional logistical infrastructure, and public-private collaboration—can be assembled only in America.”

"Message from Chairman Joe Gruters:
As we celebrate America’s Independence today, we memorialize so much more than freedom from the tyranny of a distant king. We hold closely to the soaring words from the Declaration of Independence: “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.” And we remember that the price of such liberty is eternal vigilance, that even such beautiful and lofty ideals require defending every generation. It is our turn. In this time of civic division and attacks on our Founding from within, let us recommit to the towering goals of the Declaration of Independence: Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness are God-given rights for everyone.

We need to flip the most important swing state in the country blue -- and if we can do so now, we’ll take back the White House and ensure Florida is redistricted fairly in 2021. The work we do today will help us elect Democrats across the state for years to come.

Early voting is underway in Florida, a state Donald Trump can’t afford to lose, and we’re already seeing long lines with voters having to wait hours to cast their ballots.
This election is the most important in our lifetimes, so that’s why I’m teaming up with the Florida Democratic Party to provide resources like PPE, folding chairs, umbrellas and other supplies to make sure voters are able to stay in line and make their voices heard.
Will you help us raise $12,000 for the Florida Democrats to make sure voters have what they need to stay in line over the final weekend of early voting?
If we’re not able to increase turnout across the Sunshine State, Trump may be able to win its 29 electoral votes, giving him a path to victory once again.
We know that when everyone votes, Democrats win. It’s that simple. But in order to make sure every voice is heard, we need to be at every early voting location, ensuring that every voter has what they need to wait in long lines.
It’s critical that we raise this final $12,000 now so the Florida Democratic Party can get the supplies and distribute them to every county in Florida. Can I count on you to please donate $20?

Florida is the most important state in play in the 2020 presidential election, and with just 22 days left until Election Day, we need to all step up and do our part to deliver Florida for Biden.
Will you join the three of us on October 19th? Get your tickets here and help support outreach to Florida voters!*

This is Congressman Don Beyer. I am reaching out because I am joining the FL Dems for a virtual event on October 19th and I would love for you to join me!
Who: Me (Rep. Don Beyer) + Terrie Rizzo, Chair of the Florida Democratic Party
What: An event to support the Florida Democrats’ Get Out the Vote program!
When: Monday, Oct. 19, 5:00 PM - 6:15 PM
RSVP
We are less than 4 weeks from Election Day, and the country is counting on us to get out the vote so we can flip Florida blue!
But Trump and the GOP are determined to suppress the vote -- even during the debate, Trump suggested that his supporters harass voters to stop Democrats from “stealing” the election.
This is why I am joining the Florida Democratic Party for a virtual fundraiser to support its GOTV program! We can beat Trump if we beat him in Florida. Will you join me and Terrie Rizzo, Chair of the Florida Democratic Party, on October 19th?
Hope to see you there,
Rep. Don Beyers (VA-08)

Matt Gaetz has proven time and time again that he is not fit to lead in Florida.
From trying to expel a grieving father from a hearing on gun violence to throwing his support behind a QAnon conspiracy theorist, Matt Gaetz has shown that he lacks the judgment and empathy to lead.
We say: no more. Help us beat Matt Gaetz by raising $7,500 so we can enroll even more Democrats in his district into vote-by-mail before the deadline on 10/24!

FiveThirtyEight just updated their Florida model a few minutes ago, and they  increased Trump's chance of winning to 33%.
It's simple. If Joe Biden wins Florida, Donald Trump has virtually no chance of winning a second term. But if Trump clinches another victory here, the election is wide open.
Trump wins 30 our of 100 simulations
If you donate $10 or more right now, we'll match your donation 2X. If you donate more than $50, your gift will be matched 3X!
$10 $50
Here are some other facts:
Trump leads in some of the most recent Florida polls, and all fall within the margin of error.
Polling shows a tied race
And while Biden has a big lead nationally, Florida is more conservative than the nation, and the Florida GOP is chipping away at our early vote lead every day.
Florida leans Republican
Donald Trump won Florida by just over 100,000 votes in 2016, and if we don't keep up our early vote lead, he may do it again. If you haven't given yet, now's the time. Donate $5 to BEAT TRUMP!

This is not just a tale of ineptitude, but one that belies Trump’s fundamental disregard for anyone but himself. We all have had to cope with the virus and make changes to keep each other safe -- but Trump clearly thinks the rules don’t apply to him.
A recent Cornell University study found that Trump himself is the #1 source of misinformation about the coronavirus, globally. He does not care about the consequences of his actions so long as he can still play the hero in his own version of reality.
If we can beat Trump here, we can block his path to re-election altogether. Donate $20.20 right now so we can finally put an end to this presidency!

President Trump recently called himself “the No. 1 Environmental President” but we all know that’s not true. This oil-and-gaslighting needs to end if we’re ever going to address the global climate crisis.
Now, Trump relies on Florida, a state facing devastating environmental harm as a result of rising sea levels, extreme weather events, salt water infiltration, reef destruction, temperature extremes and more, to win the White House.
Florida, and our country, can’t afford another 4 years of Trump. That’s why I’m asking you to donate to the Florida Democratic Party’s efforts to flip Florida blue! If we can beat him in the Sunshine State, we can block his re-election entirely.

There is no path to victory for Trump without Florida. And there is no path to tackling the global climate crisis that threatens our coastlines with him in office. We need to act swiftly if we’re going to take meaningful action against climate change.
The West Coast is in a crisis right now, and the connection between these extreme fires and climate change is undeniable. The same is true for the extreme weather events threatening our coasts.
We have to stand up for our planet and for Florida. With less than 8 weeks left until Election Day, will you donate $20.20 to flip Florida blue so we can start fighting the biggest existential threat facing our planet?

It all could come down to Florida.
Joe Biden and Donald Trump are virtually tied in the Sunshine State, and with 29 electoral votes on the line, we can’t take anything for granted -- this race could be decided by just a few thousand votes.
That’s why I’m emailing you -- to ask that you join me in supporting the Florida Democratic Party as they reach out to Democrats across the state to make sure as many voters as possible cast their ballots between now and November 3rd. Will you donate $30 towards these critical programs?
This administration has threatened our democracy for four years now. We simply cannot afford for them to get another term.
And now, with Justice Ginsburg's seat hanging in the balance, Trump could have the chance to alter the course of American jurisprudence for decades, starting with threatening women’s rights and slashing the Affordable Care Act in January.
But we can stop that by delivering Florida’s 29 electoral votes to Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Can you donate any amount to help the Florida Democratic Party put in the work to make that happen?

Voting has already begun in Florida, the state that many experts are calling the most important swing state in the 2020 presidential election.
While the Florida Democratic Party currently has a margin of over 275,055 in returned mail-in ballots, we need to make sure every registered voter knows that there’s still time to enroll in vote-by-mail and many ways to return their mail-in ballot.
Furthermore, the voter registration deadline has passed in Florida -- so enrolling voters into vote-by-mail is the only way we can expand the electorate and ensure every Democrat casts their vote for Joe Biden.
Can you help me support the Florida Dems’ mission to enroll even more voters and increase their returns? Let’s try to raise $5,000 today in support of their vote-by-mail outreach.
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:

Vote-by-mail is also the best way to ensure that Black and Brown communities are heard -- with the COVID-19 pandemic disproportionately affecting those communities and now with fears of violence from Trump supporters at the polls, vote-by-mail can ensure marginalized voices are heard.
Vote-by-mail is not just a matter of convenience, it’s the best way to fight racial voter suppression and encourage voters to Get Out the Vote.
So, can you help me raise $5,000 for the Florida Democratic Party today?

FDP-Logo
Friends,
I’d like to tell you about what President Trump’s recent comments mean for veterans.
It was recently reported that Donald Trump habitually called fallen and captured US service members “losers” and “suckers,” and made other disrespectful comments about fallen and injured veterans.
This is not the behavior of a commander-in-chief, but rather the outbursts of someone who truly does not understand the sacrifices and bravery of our armed services.
Our veterans, the families of those who gave their lives for our freedoms and our active-duty military personnel deserve better. If you agree, donate any amount to the Florida Democratic Party so we can elect a new commander-in-chief.
This is no longer a fluke, but a pattern of behavior. When President Trump mocked Vietnam war hero and Senator John McCain, we saw his true colors.
Now, Trump feels emboldened by his enablers in the GOP and feels like he can say and do whatever he wants with impunity. He believes that he is above reproach for this kind of un-American behavior.
We have a chance to show Trump that there are consequences to his actions. Help the Florida Democratic Party work towards beating Trump in Florida by donating whatever you can today.
In service,
Phil Giorno

I have some amazing data to share with you today.
The excitement around Joe Biden, Kamala Harris and the Democrats running across Florida is leading to historic returns in mail-in ballots, and in particular, returns from the Hispanic community.
The President who launched his original run with xenophobic, racist remarks against the Hispanic community may very well be defeated by the Hispanic vote in Florida. But we need your help to keep this up.
Will you help me raise $5,000 for the Florida Democratic Party today? Donate any amount because if they don’t continue to hit their goals, they’ll have to scale back their Get Out the Vote operation.
Over 164,000 Hispanic Democrats have already cast their mail-in ballot. You can help us reach 200,000 ballots cast by supporting the Democrats’ Get Out the Vote efforts.
Florida is always decided by just a few thousand voters, and we need a MASSIVE turnout if we’re going to beat Trump.
Donate whatever you can right now to help me support the Florida Democratic Party’s mission to make sure every single voice in the Sunshine state is heard. Otherwise, we may face another four years of a Trump presidency.
Yours,
Congressman Darren Soto

Last night, we lost a trailblazing, unrelenting woman whose legacy will live on in the revolutionary spirit she inspired in all of us.
Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the second woman to ever serve on the Supreme Court, devoted her life to the pursuit of justice; she was a warrior fighting for our democracy and the rights of all of those in it. And as we mourn her passing, we also face the fear of what will come of the justice she fought so hard for as Mitch McConnell wasted no time using her death as political opportunism.
Justice Ginsburg would not have wanted us to succumb to grief over her passing. We need to continue to honor her legacy by standing up for the rights she fought so hard for. And after every battle, she got back up and kept fighting for our Democratic ideals.
Justice Ginsburg said, ""My most fervent wish is that I will not be replaced until a new president is installed."" Help us honor that wish by electing Joe Biden so he can nominate a new justice who can continue the Ginsburg legacy.
""Waste no time on anger, regret or resentment. Just get the job done.""

I’m happy for Donald Trump’s speedy recovery.
But his recuperation was only possible because he has access to the finest healthcare in the world that the rest of us couldn’t even dream of.
While Trump gets the best treatment available - including specialized medicine only a few hundred have been lucky to receive - he is actively trying to repeal Obamacare and strip healthcare away from 20,000,000 Americans.
We can simultaneously hope for his full recovery while also fighting against attempts to kill the Affordable Care Act and strip healthcare away from millions.
Donate to protect Obamacare and make sure insurance companies can’t go back to denying coverage for pre-existing conditions.

Republicans are attacking access to healthcare from all three branches of government.
If we don’t keep the House, take back the Senate and defeat Donald Trump, Republicans will succeed in stripping away our healthcare without providing any alternative.
The future of the Affordable Care Act is on the ballot this November 3rd.
Donate to stop Republicans from tearing down the progress we’ve made.

Folks,
If Joe Biden wins Florida, he’s going to win this election. Those are the stakes. So we cannot let up now.
Tens of millions of votes have already been cast in Florida, and on Election Day we expect to see millions more. And making sure we turn out every last Biden voter we can has to be our North Star in these final days.
I know that is the mission of the Florida Democratic Party, and it’s why I am asking:

Florida is no stranger to close presidential elections, and this one is no different. Most of the polls show it very tight, within the margin of the work the Florida Democratic Party will do over the course of the next few days.
But they need your help to get it done.
This is the most important presidential election in modern American history, and I don’t want to leave anything to chance — I don’t want to wake up on November 4th wishing I could have done more. And I am sure you feel the same way. So I am asking:
Please, donate whatever you can afford today so we can protect Americans at the polls and help elect Joe Biden as our next President of the United States.
Every best wish,

FiveThirtyEight just updated their Florida model a few minutes ago, and they  increased Trump's chance of winning to 33%.
It's simple. If Joe Biden wins Florida, Donald Trump has virtually no chance of winning a second term. But if Trump clinches another victory here, the election is wide open.

Here are some other facts:
Trump leads in some of the most recent Florida polls, and all fall within the margin of error.
Polling shows a tied race
And while Biden has a big lead nationally, Florida is more conservative than the nation, and the Florida GOP is chipping away at our early vote lead every day.
Florida leans Republican

Friends,
Florida is not only one of the most important states in the fight for the White House, but it’s home to over 40,000 Puerto Ricans who were forced to relocate after Trump’s failure to lead in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria.
This November, we must vote out this reckless and cruel administration that ignored the plight of millions of American citizens in Puerto Rico, failed to lead during the coronavirus pandemic, and continues to stoke division and racism.
Luckily, we know he can’t win without Florida.
That’s why I’ll be joining the Florida Democratic Party for a virtual fundraiser on October 8th from 5 pm - 6:15 pm to help expand their 731,000 vote-by-mail lead because no Republican presidential candidate has won the White House without Florida in 96 years.

FDP-Logo
Friends,
It is our sacred duty to protect the right to vote for everyone, and in Florida, the efforts of the voters to restore constitutional voting rights to returning citizens, former felons who have paid their due to society, have been stymied by Ron DeSantis and the Florida GOP at every turn.
I have seen the playbook the Republicans are using. As Governor of Virginia, I was proud to restore voting rights to over 170,000 Virginians, more than any governor in our nation’s history. Along the way, Republicans sued me. They even tried to hold me in contempt of court! Republicans were wrong in Virginia then, and they are wrong in Florida now. Despite the fact that the vast majority of Floridians support Amendment 4, DeSantis and the GOP have fought against it at every turn, going so far as to enact what many call a modern-day poll tax -- forcing those who have served their time to pay back their sometimes insurmountable fees before being able to vote.
It’s irresponsible, unamerican and a total abuse of power.
That’s why I’m emailing you today to ask that you help me support the Florida Democratic Party’s efforts to protect the vote through their multi-million dollar voter protection efforts. Can you donate $20 today?
The Florida Democratic Party’s fight to protect every single vote includes a 24-7 voter protection hotline where trained attorneys have been helping Amendment 4 voters register to vote, which has been operational for over a year.
The party has also fought almost unending court battles to push back against the GOP’s unconstitutional poll tax, and while we fight it out in the courtroom, we’ve also spent the past year investing millions into voter education campaigns and down-ballot races -- because if we want to make sure the will of the voters is finally upheld, we need to elect more Democrats across the state.
Will you help me support the mission of the Florida Democratic Party to protect the constitutional right of every single voter? Florida is the MOST important state in the 2020 race, and we need to make sure every voice is counted.
Thank you for your dedication,
Gov. Terry McAuliffe

Matt Gaetz recently wrote a book about navigating D.C. in the Trump era, and his revelations show that the Congressman is modeling himself after the president in every way.
He thrives in the current era of political theatre -- just like the president who created it. Help us vote Gaetz OUT by enrolling more Democrats into vote-by-mail in his district before ballots drop!

Gaetz is a creature of the Trump era, one who governs from the airwaves and puts spectacle before substance. It’s clear from his new book that Gaetz sees politics as entertainment -- just like Trump.
We want to put the era of Trumpism to bed, and that includes voting out legislators like Gaetz who take so naturally to it. If you want to help us beat Gaetz, donate $15 right now before ballots are mailed!

Friends, this is a huge accomplishment.
By investing in vote-by-mail early, the Florida Democratic Party has invested in our democracy. Voters are able to cast their ballots from home right now. Together, we are democratizing voting access in a profound way — but there is more work to do.
There are just 6 days left to expand our lead over the GOP -- can I count on you to donate to this final enrollment drive before the 10/24 deadline?
Onwards,
Chris Van Hollen
P.S. I’m joining my fellow Maryland Senator Ben Cardin, Congressman Don Byer and FDP Chair Terrie Rizzo Tomorrow, Oct. 19th to fundraise to Get Out the Vote. RSVP here to join us!

The Florida Democratic Party just hit an amazing new milestone: Their lead over the GOP in vote-by-mail requests is over 800,000 voters -- and in total, over 2.5 MILLION Democrats have enrolled to vote by mail.
Why is this important? Because mail-in voting is one of the best ways to make sure Democrats vote blue all the way down the ballot, allow voters to vote when and where it’s convenient for them and fight GOP voter suppression and intimidation.
The deadline to enroll voters in vote-by-mail is in just 6 days -- help me and the Florida Dems grow that lead even more by donating any amount today!
This is one of the most important factors in beating Donald Trump in Florida. Historically, when voters have the ability to vote from home, they’re more likely to participate. And we know that when turnout increases, Democrats win.
There are just 6 days left to enroll voters in vote-by-mail, and we need your help to grow this historic lead. Even a donation of just $5 will make a huge impact.
Thank you,
Tom Perez

Friends,
Florida is not only one of the most important states in the fight for the White House, but it’s home to over 40,000 Puerto Ricans who were forced to relocate after Trump’s failure to lead in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria.
This November, we must vote out this reckless and cruel administration that ignored the plight of millions of American citizens in Puerto Rico, failed to lead during the coronavirus pandemic, and continues to stoke division and racism.
Luckily, we know he can’t win without Florida.
That’s why I’ll be joining the Florida Democratic Party for a virtual fundraiser on October 8th from 5 pm - 6:15 pm to help expand their 731,000 vote-by-mail lead because no Republican presidential candidate has won the White House without Florida in 96 years.

Hi there, it's Congressman Ted Lieu from California emailing about something that's critically important.
At the first presidential debate, Donald Trump not only suggested that the Proud Boys, a known violent white supremacist and male chauvinist group, “stand by,” but he called for his supporters to “go into the polls and watch very carefully.”
It was recently revealed that the Trump campaign ran racist targeted ads at millions of Black voters in 2016 to suppress minority voters in key swing states like Florida. Now they’re trying to scare voters from showing up at all.
We can’t let that happen. That’s why we need your donations to help the Florida Democratic Party inform voters about their rights and fight GOP voter suppression.

This is voter intimidation, folks. Chanting Trump supporters have already been seen outside an early voting site in Fairfax County, Virginia.
Trump’s martial language is sounding our alarms for voter suppression. Even Trump Jr. has suggested that “every able-bodied man and woman join Army for Trump’s election security operation.”
We need to be ready with lawyers, facts and volunteers ready to catch and counter this kind of intimidation. But we need your help to do that. Donate today to help us oppose Trump’s newest suppression tactic.

I have a simple question for my Republican colleagues.
They joined in the celebration when my beautiful daughter became the first infant on the Senate floor.
But now, my Republican colleagues are considering rushing through the nomination of a judge who supports those who believe that Maile shouldn’t even exist and would rather doctors that perform IVF procedures be criminalized than allow women like me the chance to start families.
I call on my fellow Senators to take action and reject this extreme nominee. I also call on the American people to reject Trump’s Supreme Court takeover at the ballot box, and there’s no more important state in play than Florida.
We can’t let Trump win another term so he can push through the nomination of Amy Coney Barrett. Will you donate to the Florida Democratic Party today so they can let voters know what’s at stake in this election?

I was once the youngest African American elected official in American history after my successful campaign to South Carolina’s State Legislature in 2006. This was truly an honor of a lifetime. Although I’m no longer in public office, I’ve never stopped advocating for the working-class communities like the one I grew up in.
Right now, our country is at a crossroads. We’re either going to come together and rally behind Joe Biden or allow someone who won’t even condemn white supremacy to remain in the White House for another four years.
That’s why I’m teaming up with the Florida Democratic Party to ensure Trump loses the one state that could give him a path to victory. To do that, we need urgent support to fund critical outreach to Black and Brown communities who hold the power to turn Florida blue.
Will you help me raise $7,000 today so the Florida Democratic Party can buy another week’s worth of ads in newspapers serving communities of color?
Trump and Biden are tied right now in Florida, and if we can’t turn up and turn out to vote in numbers rivaling 2004, we may lose the Sunshine State to Trump once again.
That’s why I’m asking you to help me raise these critical funds for the Florida Democratic Party. If you’ve been waiting to donate, now’s the time. Can I count on you to give $15 today?

1,000 Signatures Needed
Recently, a judge blocked a state order requiring school districts to reopen schools amidst the coronavirus pandemic, saying that state officials “have essentially ignored the requirement of school safety by requiring the statewide opening of brick-and-mortar schools to receive already allocated funding.”
It’s outrageous that Education Commissioner Richard Corcoran has threatened to withhold vital funding for schools.
Add your name if you think local community school districts know how to best educate and keep their students safe - not some Republican politician in Tallahassee.
SIGN THE PETITION
School districts like that of Hillsborough County were threatened with a loss of nearly $200 million if they opened remotely, as reported by the Washington Post.
Now, districts are free to make decisions among educators and administrators that are best for their students and their communities.
Add your name if you support this ruling and believe that it should be up to the school districts, not Gov. DeSantis and Trump, to decide whether they should go remote or not.
Thanks for doing your part,

Team,
The Trump Administration is silencing our nation's #1 disease expert from speaking to the public about how COVID-19 affects children and families.
While more than 500,000 children have been diagnosed with COVID-19, the Trump administration is instructing Governors to stop testing children and informing them that children are not at risk at all, despite limited information about the long term effects of the coronavirus.
This cannot stand. Add your name to our petition if you believe Dr. Fauci should be able to speak freely on the subject that he is the top expert on so that our children can be kept safe.
Sign Here →
It is downright despicable that they are now silencing Dr. Fauci and putting the health of our families and our children in jeopardy. All of this, mind you, right after an explosive report just surfaced that Trump admitted back in FEBRUARY that this pandemic would be potentially deadly, yet he still chose to downplay the risk.
Dr. Fauci is our nation's most trusted and well-informed leader on this subject, and he cannot be silenced. If you agree, sign our petition!

Donald Trump is trying to pass the buck on his horrible family separation policy, but we have to ask...
... if the cages were built before his tenure in the White House, why did he feel he had no responsibility to take them down?
No, Trump's cruelty is what separated those families, and it was his cruelty that left nearly 500 families forever broken.

As Kamala Harris said during the VP Debate, this administration will have lost more jobs under their watch than almost any other administration in American history.
Donald Trump doesn’t know the value of work -- he demonstrated that in his tax scam that gave breaks to major corporations rather than hardworking Americans. That’s why we need to win Florida for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.
The Florida Democratic Party is funding a massive voter outreach campaign to deliver its 29 electoral votes to Biden. Will you chip in $29 so they can keep going all the way through November 3rd?
We’ve recently seen reports that women and Black and Brown workers are leaving the workforce at much higher rates because of the pandemic, and many of them have yet to return.
And if these jobs don’t return, we’ll have a housing crisis like no other as evictions start again across the country.
We can’t let that happen, and the only way we can do that is by blocking Trump’s path to victory by flipping the one state he needs most for Joe Biden. Can you help us do that by donating $25 today?

Fellow Floridians,
Election Day is just 44 days away. But in reality, the election starts much sooner. In Florida, voters have already started casting their votes. That means Joe Biden and Democrats around the country need our help now.
I know Joe. He is a good, decent man and he is prepared to get our economy moving again from day one. Too many people have died, too many have lost their jobs and too many are living on the edge of the uncertainty of whether they'll be able to pay rent each month.
It's becoming quite clear that if we want to get our country back on the right track, we need to elect Joe and Kamala and save our Democracy. But this will take all of us doing as much as we can to ensure that Florida flips blue by supporting the Florida Democratic Party's voter outreach programs to enroll voters into vote-by-mail and show them that Joe Biden is the one to get us through this crisis that President Trump has neglected from the start.
If you will, please help Joe win Florida by donating to the Florida Democratic Party today!

A recent ABC News/The Washington Post poll shows that among likely voters in Florida, Trump is pulling ahead!
That's why we're on a mission to register as many new Democrats as we can in one massive push before the October 5th registration deadline.
So far, we’ve raised $2,769 which is a good start, but at this rate, we’ll run out of funds on Friday. Help us catch up to where we need to be by donating whatever you can right now!
We need to register more Democrats to make sure Trump and the GOP don't get away with another upset win.

This year, Floridians have multiple ways to cast their ballots, including voting early in-person, dropping off your ballot at a drop box location, or going in on Election Day.
If you got a mail-in ballot, it is too late to return it by mail in time for it to arrive at your Supervisor of Elections by Election Day. We recommend dropping them off at a drop box in the county you're registered or dropping off at your early voting site.
Find your early voting location here!
We've already set voting records across the state -- over 661,000 more Florida voters have cast their ballots in 2020 so far than they did in the ENTIRE 2016 election!
Luckily, we’ve put together a resource that will help answer all of your questions.

Early voting is underway in Florida, a state Donald Trump can’t afford to lose, and we’re already seeing long lines with voters having to wait hours to cast their ballots.
This election is the most important in our lifetimes, so that’s why I’m teaming up with the Florida Democratic Party to provide resources like PPE, folding chairs, umbrellas and other supplies to make sure voters are able to stay in line and make their voices heard.
Will you help us raise $12,000 for the Florida Democrats to make sure voters have what they need to stay in line over the final weekend of early voting?
If we’re not able to increase turnout across the Sunshine State, Trump may be able to win its 29 electoral votes, giving him a path to victory once again.
We know that when everyone votes, Democrats win. It’s that simple. But in order to make sure every voice is heard, we need to be at every early voting location, ensuring that every voter has what they need to wait in long lines.
It’s critical that we raise this final $12,000 now so the Florida Democratic Party can get the supplies and distribute them to every county in Florida. Can I count on you to please donate $20?
Thanks for doing your part,
Pete Buttigieg

Friends,
The U.S. has now officially lost over 200,000 lives to the coronavirus pandemic, and now experts are saying that we may be caught off-guard AGAIN as we enter another cold and flu season without appropriate contact tracing and other provisions across the United States.
However, yesterday, President Donald Trump said at an Ohio rally that the coronavirus ""affects virtually nobody... it's an amazing thing.""
What's ""amazing"" is that a president can so callously brush off 200,000 deaths of the people he's meant to lead. It's devastating that our leaders have failed us so badly that 200,000 families are in mourning over deaths that could have been prevented had Trump only had the courage to take swift and decisive action.
The Trump administration's complete lack of leadership during this pandemic is shocking, and there seems to be no floor to how low they will stoop. There need to be consequences for this abject lack of empathy and competence.
On November 3rd, let's show Trump that we will never forgive him for the suffering that his administration's inaction caused and that he continues to belittle.
Now let's win this election,

County Supervisors of Elections start mailing ballots to Florida addresses TOMORROW!
There is still time for us to register more Democrats into vote-by-mail. A generous group of donors has agreed to TRIPLE MATCH all donations over the next 48 hours to help us do just that! This isn’t an opportunity to miss.
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
$5 $15 $25

With Floridians voting as early as the next few days, we don’t have any time to waste preparing every Democrat we possibly can to vote for Joe and Kamala!
We’re hoping we can raise $15,000 with this triple match! Will you donate before voters start casting their ballots in the most important state of the 2020 election?

Do you see a pattern?
❌ In 2018, on the final day to register to vote, the Florida voter registration site crashed.
❌ This year, on National Voter Registration Day, the Florida online voter registration site was also down.
❌ Yesterday, the last day to register to vote in the 2020 election, the Florida voter registration site was -- you guessed it -- down with hours left before the deadline.
Republicans in Florida have a history of building systems to disenfranchise Floridians and yesterday was no different. Donate to our voter protection fund so we can fight GOP voter suppression!
This is unacceptable. Voters should have the ability to register right up until the deadline.

We’ve finally seen reports exposing the fraud and lies in Donald Trump's tax returns, and it’s despicable that he only paid income tax in 10 of the past 15 years. And when he did pay? It was just $750. We deserve an economy that rewards work, not wealth, which is why we MUST elect Joe Biden.
For every student saddled with debt who still pays more in taxes than President Trump.
For every single parent who still pays more in taxes than President Trump.
For every minimum wage worker who still pays more in taxes than President Trump.
And for every single American who pays their fair share -- unlike President Trump.
We need to elect Joe Biden and put in place an economy that values work over wealth. Will you donate $10 right now to help us block Trump’s path to re-election in Florida?

FDP-Logo
The Florida Democratic Party just hit an amazing new milestone: Their lead over the GOP in vote-by-mail requests is over 800,000 voters -- and in total, over 2.5 MILLION Democrats have enrolled to vote by mail.
Why is this important? Because mail-in voting is one of the best ways to make sure Democrats vote blue all the way down the ballot, allow voters to vote when and where it’s convenient for them and fight GOP voter suppression and intimidation.
The deadline to enroll voters in vote-by-mail is in just 6 days -- help me and the Florida Dems grow that lead even more by donating any amount today!
This is one of the most important factors in beating Donald Trump in Florida. Historically, when voters have the ability to vote from home, they’re more likely to participate. And we know that when turnout increases, Democrats win.
There are just 6 days left to enroll voters in vote-by-mail, and we need your help to grow this historic lead. Even a donation of just $5 will make a huge impact.
Thank you,

I have a simple question for my Republican colleagues.
They joined in the celebration when my beautiful daughter became the first infant on the Senate floor.
But now, my Republican colleagues are considering rushing through the nomination of a judge who supports those who believe that Maile shouldn’t even exist and would rather doctors that perform IVF procedures be criminalized than allow women like me the chance to start families.
I call on my fellow Senators to take action and reject this extreme nominee. I also call on the American people to reject Trump’s Supreme Court takeover at the ballot box, and there’s no more important state in play than Florida.
We can’t let Trump win another term so he can push through the nomination of Amy Coney Barrett. Will you donate to the Florida Democratic Party today so they can let voters know what’s at stake in this election?

I'm proud to announce that all of the work we're doing, all the volunteer hours and small-dollar donations are WORKING. As of today, over 1,000,000 Democrats have cast their ballots compared to only 625,000 Republicans.
This is a historic number, to see this level of enthusiasm for Joe Biden, Kamala Harris and all Democrats running in Florida.
But our hard work is far from over. Help us continue to Get Out the Vote across Florida by rushing in $20 today!
In 2016, just over a million Democrats voted by mail in the entire election. Today, with over a million already cast 19 days out from Election Day, we anticipate an unprecedented amount of votes being cast by mail.
Help us continue to chase every ballot and Get Out the Vote for Democrats across Florida. This is the year we not only beat Donald Trump but elect a blue wave of Democrats across state and local offices.
Onward!

With the first mail-in ballots hitting mailboxes in just a few days, new reporting shows that undecided and less frequent voters are leaning towards Trump -- just as they did in 2016.
As the Sun Sentinel writes: “Of the 5% who said they were undecided in the FAU poll, four-fifths said they were leaning toward Trump. When they’re factored in, Biden and Trump would be tied at 50%.”
We need to reach undecided voters and flip them for Biden before the Trump campaign and its dark money donors get to them. Donate whatever you can, today!

This election is going to be the difference between continuing to move forward towards affordable health care and women’s rights or taking our country back decades. If Trump wins, he’ll be able to stack the Supreme Court with ultra-conservative judges.
As the “tipping point” state, it is up to us here in Florida to do all that we can to elect Joe Biden as our president AND Democrats up and down the ballot!
To do that, we first need to register as many new Democrats as possible before October 5th! Donate $20 today to help us register as many Democrats as we can before Monday!

Welcome to the movement! Thanks for signing up to join our grassroots community. We’re thrilled to have you!
First, a little about us: as the state party, we work to get Democrats elected up and down the ballot in every corner of the state. That includes making sure Donald Trump doesn’t win Florida.
Florida has the power to make Trump a one-term president.
Now, we want to know a little about you. Which issues are the most important to you as we enter the 2020 election cycle? What are you discussing with friends and family around your kitchen table?
Our party is ready for real, systemic change in our state and in our nation. We know that starts with making sure we’re electing Democrats at every level of government and making sure our government actually reflects the people they were elected to represent. You’re an important part of this movement and that’s why we need to hear from you.
So, tell us... what’s important to you? How can Democrats better represent your interests?

Thanks for joining the Florida Democratic Party’s grassroots team.
Florida Democrats are committed to standing up to Donald Trump and denying him the electoral votes he needs to win reelection in 2020 — because if Florida goes blue, Trump will be a one-term president. It’s that simple.
Here’s the thing though — we know it won’t be easy — which is why we need you to click here and commit to helping us defeat Trump in 2020 and elect Democrats up-and-down the ballot. Can you give just $1 now to help us build our movement?
We have to work harder than ever before. We need to register hundreds of thousands of new voters in 2019, hire more field staff and show Trump, Gov. DeSantis, Rick Scott, and their network of dark-money donors they can’t win Florida.
When Democrats took back the House in 2018 — and won a larger share of the vote than they have since Watergate — it was because of your unprecedented grassroots power.
Chip in $1 now to show that you’re prepared to deliver that same grassroots power in 2020 to defeat Donald Trump and elect Democrats.

Florida Libertarians and Greens Join To Oppose Amendment 3
ORLANDO – Today, Libertarian Party of Florida Chairman Steven Nekhaila and Green Party of Florida Co-Chairs Robin Davis and LeBeau Kpadenou announce a new initiative to fight the Third-Party crushing Amendment 3.
“We are proud to announce a collaborative effort between the Libertarian Party of Florida and the Green Party of Florida on common ground issues,” said Nekhaila. “Greens and Libertarians have dramatically different visions for what a better America would look like, and we often clash,” said Davis and Kpadenou, “but one place where we always agree is free and fair elections.”
Amendment 3, the “Top-Two Open Primaries for State Offices Initiative,” sounds great on the surface: the two candidates with the most Primary votes moves onto to the General, regardless of party. Given the current political lockout by the Republicans and Democrats, the choices will actually become far narrower. The Greens made it to the California General Election only once since voters approved top-two primaries in 2010. Rather than having three or more parties represented, this proposal might even lead to single-party ballots based on which party has the edge.
The GPF and LPF jointly funded printing and distribution of 10,000 information cards which will be distributed this coming weekend to both party’s local affiliates and chapters. Time will be critical since about 26 percent of Florida voters have cast ballots, either by mail or in early in-person voting.
“Together, the Greens and the Libertarian shall be influencing voters at the polls to vote HELL NO on Amendment 3 and preventing the wool from being pulled over the eyes of the Floridian voter,” said Nekhaila.
Davis and Kpadenou note this collaboration is not the first time Greens and Libertarians joined forces to promote common interests.
“Our two parties combined forces to help pass some of the most important election reforms in recent Florida history, including 2018's Amendment 4 (voting rights for the convicted) and the hugely important Revision 11 from the 1998 election, which vastly expanded the franchise,” Davis and Kpadenou said.

"Let's remind DeSantis we want our state back! View this email in your browser
# Ready to have your life back?
Last week, we announced the Libertarian Party of Florida will join American Revolution 2.0 to demand Gov. Ron DeSantis open the Florida economy - and open it fully! Supporters of liberty will March For Freedom at the Capitol in Tallahassee this Friday, May 1, beginning at 2 p.m.
Yesterday, DeSantis unveiled his Trump-blessed Phase 1 plan to allow Florida restaurants and other retail businesses to re-open. Re-open, but at only 25 percent of their normal business. That means up to 75 percent of those retail and service workers are still out of luck. Seventy-five percent of those business expenses will go unpaid. Some plan.
The LPF calls for DeSantis to open Florida now! Responsible adults can act responsibly both for themselves and on behalf of their loved ones without nanny state mandates to do it. Let's tell DeSantis ""We want our state back"" loud and clear this Friday. Look for your fellow Libertarians on the Capitol lawn.

The Libertarian Party of Florida congratulates Libertarian presidential running team Jo Jorgensen and Spike Cohen in the first-ever national political convention conducted solely online.
Veteran Jo Jorgensen was nominated as the Libertarian presidential nominee following four rounds of elimination voting. Jeremy “Spike” Cohen was chosen as her running mate after three rounds.
Fifty-four LPF Delegates, supported by 16 Alternates joined more than a thousand fellow Libertarians to participate in the two-day Convention this weekend. The gathering ended Sunday and will be reconvened in Orlando for in-person business meetings this July.
“This was a historic event that will go down in history as the combination of forward thinking and ingenuity to elect a Presidential and Vice-Presidential nominee in the age of COVID-19,” said LPF Chair Steven Nekhaila. “I am very proud of our Florida delegation and team for doing our part. I am also pleased with the support of the Libertarian National Committee staff for helping to make this a reality. We are excited to support our nominee's and bring a third real option to constituents in all 50 States including Florida this November!”
Nationwide, 1,026 delegates voted to elect Jorgensen, a senior lecturer in psychology at Clemson University. Jorgensen, 63, was Harry Browne’s running mate in 1996. Florida delegates favored Georgia neighbor John Monds in early rounds, they supported party stalwart Vermin Supreme in the final round.
Floridians favored Cohen throughout the three vice president ballots. Cohen, 37, was initially slated with presidential candidate Vermin Supreme. Supreme fell off the rounds and Cohen went on to the vice-presidential win.
For the most part, the two-day online event went smoothly. Some technical issues and confusion about participation persisted, but failed to prevent the thousands of votes.
“I think overall things went well for a first-time event,” said delegate Chris Jones, vice chair of the LPF Alachua County affiliate. “I think the Florida delegation did a phenomenal job using a separate app for communication and coordination. The Zoom interface definitely left much of the national delegation somewhat out of the process.”
Now, are you ready to make the National Convention in Orlando this July a Sunshine State success?
Simply sign up here and let’s gator done! Be sure to mention in the Comments that you’d like to work at the LP National Convention.

The LPF's own Chairman Steven Nekhaila joins with host Tom Woods this week to discuss the real-life implications of the DeSantis shutdown on the state's business owners and their employees. Nekhaila, of Key West, said the Florida Key's hospitality and tourist-based businesses could be damaged for years both as businesses shut down and employees move away seeking new paychecks.

# March for your Freedom May 1
KEY WEST, Fla. – The Libertarian Party of Florida endorses the American Revolution 2.0 movement and urges all Libertarians to join with them in Tallahassee May 1 to March For Freedom calling for an immediate end to Gov. Ron DeSantis’ “Safer at Home” mandate.
The LPF calls on our fellow Libertarians to join us in Tallahassee. The American Revolution 2.0 Florida Rally will be held May 1 at noon on the steps of the State Capitol. Similar American Revolution 2.0 rallies will be held nationwide that day. For more information, visit their webpage or their Facebook page. Show the state you want your life back while taking responsibility for your health and the health of those around you.
If interested, please reply to LPF Communications. Be sure to check the American Revolution 2.0 page for instructions. This will be a safe-distancing, responsible rally.
The LPF joins growing numbers of groups and state and local officials who are calling for an end to draconian shutdown which threatens more lives than COVID-19. More and more Americans will go hungry soon if they no longer have a job to support themselves. Currency will increasingly worthless as more is printed to provide welfare to more and more Americans.
“This economic destruction needs to end immediately,” says LPF Chairman Steven Nekhaila. “The longer this goes on, the deeper our economy will collapse. Jobs lost, employer’s door shuttered, bank account emptied, none of that is helping. The longer this goes on, the deeper we get. What does work is sensible adults going about their lives. Those sensible adults take responsibility their own health and the health of their loved ones while practicing safeguards from those who are irresponsible.”
Nekhaila said the LPF supports any call for the shutdown to end, but American Revolution 2.0 stood out. “What impressed us about American Revolution 2.0 is their commitment to safe distancing, face masks and other safeguards while raising their voices demanding for the state’s economy to open up.”
“We’re excited to have the Libertarians join us,” said American Revolution 2.0 organizer Josh Ellis. “What we really want people to get out of this is that more and more people are realizing that government is not going to take care of them. They need to stand up and take care of themselves.”
Libertarians believe adults can think for themselves, even in a pandemic. With information from their doctors, adults are free to protect themselves from the contagion, or not. Equally, informed adults know not everyone is as cautious so they know to safeguard themselves against those others as well. Only by having a healthy, thriving economy can Americans protect their health and their livelihood.
Since 1974, the Libertarian Party of Florida stands for peaceful personal freedom. The LPF believes society functions best when individuals make the choices, not governments. The LPF webpage is [[URL REDACTED]]

"Your LPF Needs Your Support
## We all agree getting a check in the mail
is great news
But we also know it is little compensation for loss of a steady paycheck in this government-orchestrated ""crisis."" The Libertarian Party of Florida stands with you in your outrages and concerns. We hope you make it through this period with as few of health and financial challenges as possible.
By now, many of you have received your Economic Impact Payment. Many of us are conflicted about accepting this money. After all, it will come future enforced taxes on the debt created by this ""bailout."" So, let us offer a suggestion to do something good with the check should you decide to cash it - donate a portion to the LPF! Just a small amount from each of you can go a long way towards helping the party grow. It costs an average of $30,000 a year to keep the LPF up and running, an amount that includes running our annual Convention, the costs to host our website and other operational expenses.
All that money comes from you and your fellow LPF Members, nowhere else. If each of you sent in just $25, LPF expenses would be covered for a year and we'd even have enough extra to expand services for LPF candidates and county affiliates. At $50 each, we could conduct active lobbying and promotional campaigns to show Florida voters they do have another choice, the LPF!
Please join your fellow Florida Libertarians to grow the party and donate today!
Let's Do it

# ORLANDO - Brisk winds were no match for the flames of freedom at the Libertarian Party of Florida’s Annual Convention and Business Meeting last weekend.
Nearly 100 LPF Members, including 74 voting delegates attended the two-day event featuring debates among nine LP candidates for President and Libertarian National Committee Chair, along with breakout sessions and LPF Officer Elections. Fifty-four LPF Delegates were chosen to represent Florida at the LP Presidential Nominating Convention in Austin this May.
“I was pleased with the energy and enthusiasm from members, what struck me this particular convention was the lack of intra-party schisms,” said party chairman Steven Nekhaila. “We united as the Underdogs and clearly are set out to shake up the political landscape. Our Party continues to grow more professional from the bottom to the top, and our mission is clear: become the centrifugal force of Liberty in Florida by effecting policy, getting Libertarians elected, and spreading the philosophy. The Libertarian Party's core mission is to reduce the size, influence, and expenditures of all levels of government. Our ability to do so has never been better.”
The two-day event kicked off Friday night with the biting humour of C. Michael Pickens, Rob Wentz and Seminole County’s own Shaun Kunz.
But with no doubt, the highlight of the weekend was Saturday night’s LP Presidential Debate. A packed house had the opportunity to gain insight into nine of our LP presidential candidate’s stances. Coupled with light moments, the live stream has been viewed by more than 4,200 people.
""Winning the ""toy soldier"" ballot afterwards was Jacob Hornberger of Texas collecting more than 25% of the vote. A close second was John Monds of Georgia.
Hornberger, a lawyer from Texas, is founder and president of The Future of Freedom Foundation, a non-profit libertarian educational foundation. An author or co-editor and contributor of 17 books, his newest book is ""My Passion for Liberty.""
Sunday’s morning’s debate among three candidates for LNC Chair: Mike Shipley, Joe Bishop-Henchman, and Joshua Smith. Smith, of California, was the attendees favorite.
The weekend was filled popular breakout sessions and guest speakers, including Saturday’s Liberty in Action presentation by Newberry Mayor Jordan Marlowe, Altamonte Springs Commissioner Jim Turney and Seminole County Commission candidate Andre Klass. Each spoke to the importance of Libertarian messaging whether serving in office or on the campaign trail.
""Libertarian candidates can have a message that resonates with voters so our challenge is to reach the voters with our message,” said Turney. “Canvassing precincts and meeting voters face-to-face is our path to success.""
Wes Benedict, former executive director of the Libertarian National Committee, presented a motivational if not challenging history of LP candidates elected over the years. It demonstrated Libertarians in non-party races get elected. The notes were in line with Nekhaila’s Vision 2020 which seeks to retain at least 10 elected LPF Members in office.
“Our work is cut out for us this year,” said Nekhaila, “we have a lot on our plate to take advantage of the opportunities the Republicans and Democrats keep giving us, with further encroachments on our freedom and more and more disenfranchised voters looking for a political home and a third, principled option, the Libertarians stand proud. We are looking for volunteers to step up and help take us to the gold medal. We are seeking principled candidates to run in winnable elections to move forward Libertarian policy. And we are in need of enthusiastic Party members who can help form or grow a local affiliate to be the local beacon of Liberty in their counties. Please reach out to us if all of this appealing. If you do not have time to participate, your donations allow us to do all of the above and more, a monthly donation is the wind that keeps our sails consistently moving forward. As the only growing political party in the United States, we are the best investment you can make politically.”
Saturday and Sunday, Delegates elected their LPF team of officers for 2020. They are:
Chair: Steven Nekhaila (Current)
Vice-Chair: J Mark Barfield
Secretary: Ed Appler
Treasurer: John Olivadoti
Director At-Large 1: Suzanne Gilmore (Current)

# If not, you'll miss the chance of the lifetime!
In barely more than a month, six of the Libertarian Party's presidential candidates will be on one stage answering and debating your questions! Scheduled to appear are Dan ""Taxation is Theft"" Behrman, Florida's own Sourya Faas, Jacob Hornberger, Adam Kokesh, Vermin Supreme (yes, that guy) and Arvin Vohra.
Behrman is an international speaker, promoting the ideas that Taxation Is Theft, that individual freedom is paramount to the government, and that we are not government property. Behrman says taxes are taken without consent, by threat of imprisonment. ""This is not a civilized way to pay for society,"" he says.
Faas, of Miami, has been active in politics most of her life. In 2016, she ran for president as a write-in Independent in 2016, but lost her lawsuit to get on the ballot in Texas. At the time, she was the youngest person and the first person of Arab descent to run for the office.
Hornberger, a lawyer from Texas, is founder and president of The Future of Freedom Foundation, a non-profit libertarian educational foundation. An author or co-editor and contributor of 17 books, his newest book is ""My Passion for Liberty."" He speaks on libertarian principles world-wide.
Kokesh, of Arizona, declares if elected he will sign one executive order laying out a pathway to dissolving the federal government. Kokesh's activism began after serving in Iraq when he returned to became an ardent anti-war activist.
Supreme, of Maryland, is an American performance artist and activist who has run as a candidate in various local, state, and national elections in the United States. Supreme is known for wearing a boot as a hat and carrying a large toothbrush, and promises a free pony for every American if elected.
Vohra, of Maryland, pledges to reduce or eliminate much of government from public schools to the military if he is elected. After studying Mathematics and Economics at Brown University, Vohra worked as an actuary before starting his own educational business.

# LPF Family Reunion and Rally
Sunday, November 15, 2020 at 9 AM EST – 5 PM EST
Holiday Inn Express & Suites Cocoa
Space Coast Convention Center
301 Tucker Lane, Cocoa, FL 32926-3106
Libertarians, are you excited about 2021! Sure, the 2020 votes haven’t been counted yet but it is time to dig in and begin planning for 2021 – the pathway to a successful 2022 Mid-term.
In just two weeks, the LPF will hold the first of quarterly In Person Meetings, focusing on Chairman Steven Nekhaila’s Vision Deck 2021, our candidate’s 2020 campaign reflections, a mock commission meeting and more.
The Rally and Meetup will feature Larry Lawton. Lawton is a motivational speaker, author, prisoner rights reformist and one-time top jewel thief in America! Lawton hosts a popular YouTube channel, Larry Lawton Jewel Thief, and is president of Lawton's Reality Check Program, a prison awareness resource for at-risk youth. Lawton also provides security seminars for business owners on how to prevent theft.
“Come join us for an LPF Family Reunion,” says Nekhaila. “You’ll hear from world class speakers, candidates and elected libertarians. You’ll hear about the party’s progress and vision for 2021 and beyond, and you’ll be able to socialize with amazing company. This is a rally cry for our future, let’s keep the fire alive and hope to see you there!”
The morning session will open with the monthly Executive Committee Business Meeting which features Chairman Nekhaila’s presentation of Vision Deck 2021, his plan for next year. LPF fundraising guru Marc Golob will also kick off what stands to be our most successful year. Remote participation will be available for EC Members unable to attend.
The Business Meeting will be followed by Lawton. After a Lunch break, the afternoon session will reconvene with speeches by the LPF’s own D.L. Cummings from Duvall and LauraAnn Hartman from Pinellas.
Next, our LPF candidates are invited to offer their thoughts on lessons learned this year. The afternoon will wrap with a moot commission meeting. There, you'll have the opportunity to make a public presentation before a mock panel, who will vote based on your input.
“Come to Cocoa to honor our 2020 candidates!” says Candidate Committee Chair Jim Turney, sitting Altamonte Springs City Commissioner. “We will also have a mock city/county commission meeting to practice local activism. An informal networking lunch and social hour at the end tops off the afternoon fun.""
If you’re planning to attend, please sign up for seats here. There’s no charge to attend!

# LPF Response to DeSantis’
Safer at Home Order
KEY WEST, Fla. – If you live in Florida, you are now in state-mandated lock-down. Gov. Ron DeSantis’ Executive Order Numbers 20-91 and 20-92 although signed on April 1, were certainly no jokes. As of midnight, free movement and free commerce is severely-restricted for the entire state. While he hasn’t called out the National Guard for every street corner, DeSantis referenced passages from the Florida Constitution and Statutes granting him the authority to do so.[i]
The Libertarian Party of Florida condemns this action. Evidence shows enforced lock-downs do not curb the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the COVID-19 illness. Intelligent responses to medical issues do work without shutting down society as DeSantis has done.
Evidence shows rational steps promoted by government can work without creating the record-high unemployment we have now. You’ve already heard those rational steps many times: Keep your distance from others, wear gloves and maybe a mask, wash your hands and if you’re sick, stay home. What we’re seeing is those rational steps are contributing to emerging successes in South Korea and Japan, along with Finland. Certainly, there are cultural and mindset differences, but those countries have largely approached this manufactured “crisis” in a voluntary, supportive way, not authoritarian.[ii]
South Korea offers a good example.[iii] Within the first week after the case of COVID-19 was verified, government officials met with manufacturers to urge them to scale up manufacture of test kits. Within days, government employees were testing on a greater scale than the United States has performed to date. Numerous testing sites were quickly set up to avoid choking hospitals. Results were available within hours, not days.
People who needed it, are getting medical care before it becomes life-threatening. Once a new case is identified, the person is immediately placed under direct medical care. Everyone in contact with those ill people are identified and tested, and re-tested in a few days. In some cases, medical workers urged quarantine for those who were in immediate contact. Mortality rates stayed low.
In addition to those direct measures, the South Korean government played a role in keeping citizens informed and educated. They recommended – not mandated - mask wearing and social distancing. A responsible population agreed and complied.
South Korea did not resort to shutting down their society to the degree DeSantis has mandated for Floridians. Korean stores, restaurants and schools were kept open. That country addressed the issue as medical, not economic.
As peace-loving and educated folks, Libertarians everywhere in the world believe in informed free choice and responsible free will. Virtually all Libertarians do “the right thing” in this outbreak in that they approach it as a medical safety issue. We wash our hands, maybe wear gloves and masks to protect ourselves, our families and our friends, along with our business associates and customers. And yes, we want to make those choices ourselves without draconian government intrusion.
The Libertarian Party of Florida calls on Gov. DeSantis to rescind 20-91 and 20-92 and let Florida function again. DeSantis had the opportunity to lead the nation in responsible steps to stop a medical issue without stopping Florida. He chose the latter.

# It's time to Reopen Florida
### Floridians call for an end to DeSantis' Shutdown
A growing number of responsible Floridians will join together to call for an end to the Gov. Ron DeSantis mandated damage to the Florida economy. The first of these events is in Orlando tomorrow seeking to let Orange County and lawmakers statewide know that the people have had enough and they want to go back to work. We expect more to follow as Americans come to realize the irresponsible “cure” is already worse than the “illness” for most.
In a recent open letter to DeSantis, Re-Open Florida: Orange County organizer Tara Hill wrote “Governor DeSantis, your constituents are emphatically compelling you to honor your oath to uphold The Constitution of the United States of America and re-open Florida so that we may not only preserve the lives of Floridians, but so we may preserve our right to liberty and the pursuit of happiness as well.”
The Libertarian Party of Florida, since it was founded in 1974, supports the free will of every person to make responsible choices for themselves and on behalf of those around them. If being responsible means social distancing and wearing masks and gloves to protect ourselves and others, we encourage it based on medical evidence. But personal security does not mean shutting down our economy. Summarily closing society: businesses, schools, free commerce, will produce damage to our society long after the medical concerns have been addressed. A growing number of businesses are permanently shuttering, their owners and employees joining the millions already left to fend for themselves in this dystopian landscape mandated by President Trump, DeSantis and most governors. Billions of illusionary dollars in “stimulus checks” will do nothing to replenish the damage done.
We encourage each of you to join together with your fellow freedom friends and let Orange County, Florida and the world know enough is enough. Let us be responsible again.
In Orlando, the rally will be in front of the Orange County Administration Building, 201 S Rosalind Ave, from 3:30 pm to 5 pm.

# The Libertarian Party of Florida is busy making the most of 2020's extra Leap Year time as we draw closer to the November elections.
In December, LPF Chair Steven Nekhaila announced his Vision 2020 plan to get more Libertarians presence in community civic organizations and official boards. “It’s at the local levels where we can make the greatest impact on the people we interact with each day,” Nekhaila said.
Nekhaila said much of the effort will be on local levels by targeting 20 Libertarians on local boards and councils, 50 LPF Members on local civic organizations and getting all current elected Libertarians another term in office. Other goals for the year include greater candidate and local affiliate support and enhanced outreach and communications coupled with fundraising to support the programs.
This week, the LPF held its first Ask Me Anything conference, hosted by At-Large Director Davie Parrish. “We wanted to provide LPF Members the opportunity to understand the philosophy and day to day functioning of their party,” said Parrish. “With greater transparency, we have a stronger party.”
Questions ranged from how to increase messaging to the party’s stance on how to respond to people with mental health issues who are unable to make responsible decisions about their safety and the safety of others.
The Vision deck, AMA Questions and Forum recording can be found here.

# Without you, the LPF can't spread the message of Liberty in the Sunshine in 2020.
The LPF is a group of hard-working, dedicated folks who offer a few hours a week to keep the party functioning. Without them, we'd be unable to reach out to the public, grow our numbers and Get Libertarians Elected!
It's a team effort, with each team specializing in areas such as candidate campaign support, growing our membership, and supporting the local affiliates. Here's a rundown of them here.
My Vision 2020 is an optimistic plan to grow our party this year. The only way to make it work is to have at least three dozen people actively working on the teams. If you're creative, you may want to join the Communications team. If you enjoy reviewing legislation and lobbying, our Legislative Action Committee is right up your alley. And if you think we can never have enough LPF Members, then our Membership Committee needs you.
So please take a moment to review the committees and see what fits for you. Then stop by and fill out our Become a Volunteer application. Someone will get back with you soon.
Become a Libertarian activist today. Join us in making 2020 the year we succeed!
In Liberty,

# Freedom Fighter,
These are trying times we find ourselves in. However, one thing is for certain: the cure is worse than the disease. As “civil liberals” and “economic conservatives” in government continue to defy any semblance of principle by enacting quarantines, shutting down businesses and spending trillions of dollars in bailouts, it’s as if the whole nation has gone mad.
As I walk down the once bustling Duval Street here in Key West, our economic center for tourism, quiet streets and sparse footsteps conjure up thoughts of all of the workers who are desperately contemplating how they will pay the rent. Thoughts of business owners who will perform a torrent of math problems just to see if there is a solution to keep their doors from staying permanently shut. We are in the Great Depression 2.0. This is allegedly government compassion in practice.
As a business owner, I consider myself blessed the city has deemed us an “essential business.” I do not have to experience quite the level of heartache necessary to ensure my employee’s stay fed and housed and my businesses do not shutter.
I had a conversation with a good friend of mine the other day. What he said resonated with my libertarian core, “essential businesses are whatever the market deems them to be, if they are non-essential, they wouldn’t exist!”
No truer words have been spoken! Don’t forget that in the rush to “save us all,” the government doesn’t have the authority to decide what is and isn’t essential. The fact that some States are considering cannabis dispensaries as “essential” while keeping non-violent drug offenders in prison is an example of the extreme myopia of our nation’s Old Party elected representatives in the face of this pandemic. Without being bound to principle, populism and pragmatism begin to take hold.
With millions out of work in the State of Florida alone, the Libertarian Party of Florida isn’t idle while social distancing. The push is on to get our partisan Libertarian candidates on the ballot despite government restrictions making signature collection nearly impossible. Certainly, those efforts would be inappropriate due to the potential to spread disease as well. You see, in the State of Florida, a candidate must pay a filing fee equivalent to 4 percent of the annual salary of the position they seek. The LPF waived the 2 percent party assessment fee for all of our candidates.
Candidates who opt to collect signatures have already spent countless hours engaging with the public or paying professional signature gatherers. Now, the ability to collect further signatures to meet the State’s requirements is no longer possible. Nor is it responsible with the current restrictions on movement and the risks involved. We are sending letters to the Governor Ron DeSantis and Secretary of State Laurel M. Lee, and working closely with the Libertarian National Committee in case legal action is necessary to ensure that our candidates get on the ballot this November.
Libertarians are even crafting legislation in their municipalities, such as the motion passed by the Libertarian Mayor of Newberry, Fla., Jordan Marlowe, to disperse the security deposits for municipal utilities back to residents and businesses who have paid their bills on time for a year. This is a libertarian solution to provide millions of dollars in local aid back to the people in a more effective and principled manner than what the Republicans and Democrats in Washington D.C. and Tallahassee could possibly attempt to do without sinking us further into debt, sneaking in further regulations and creating special powers in a deceitful attempt to take advantage of the crisis.
The Libertarian Party of Florida is in full swing to continue growing the movement, getting Libertarians elected and changing public policy in 2020 and planning for the years ahead. We understand that the threat of COVID-19 is very serious, but allowing government to take our freedoms away from us with only a promise to give it back is even more serious. We must build our war chest for battles to come and prepare to combat the intrusions on freedom we see encroaching on an hourly basis.
We are the only political party in Florida that understands freedom is non-negotiable, and any compromise is a battle not won. Our candidates are entrepreneurs, workers, and professionals who understand what it means to survive and thrive in the real world. We are adults who take responsibility for our own actions and provide support and opportunity for our fellow man.
As succinctly stated in our Platform, “Individuals must be free to honestly and peacefully pursue their own interests and pleasures so long as it does not involve coercion, fraud, or violate the equal rights of others. Libertarians welcome the peace, prosperity, and diversity that freedom brings.”
Join us and make a difference. Become a dues-paying member today by donating $15, $25, $50, $100 or whatever you can by clicking the link below and pledging your support. Pledge your time by becoming a volunteer and engaging in one of our committees, the engines of the Party. Join your local affiliate and becoming involved in local politics, which have the most profound impact on your life. Reach out to your Regional Representatives to create a new affiliate and be the spark of liberty in your community.
We encourage everyone to do what it takes to stop the spread of the pandemic, practice social distancing, wash their hands, and support the Libertarian Party of Florida. We will get through this, and we will be there for you no matter how hard the times.

"Dear Friend,
I’m writing to invite you to join me and Commissioner Nikki Fried on Wednesday at 5:30 PM over Zoom.
Commissioner of Agriculture Nikki Fried, who endorsed our campaign earlier this month, will be joining us for a fundraiser and important conversation about how we can work together to secure Florida’s future.
Nikki is a champion in the fight to end gun violence, combat climate change, and hold our government accountable. I’m grateful for her support. Click here to join us on Wednesday.
As the pandemic intensifies and election day nears, this race has only grown more important. If we want to put an end to Governor DeSantis’ failed leadership, we need to win this race and flip this seat.
I’m so thankful for Nikki’s support in this critical election. Please click here to join us on Wednesday.
Thank You,
Javi
