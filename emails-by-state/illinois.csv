Alex,
On behalf of the Republican National Committee, now more than ever we are so grateful for your commitment to advancing Republican ideals and President Trump’s policies here in the Land of Lincoln.
I am reaching out today on behalf of the ILGOP. They just sent me the 2020 ILGOP membership roster, and shared with me that your name is not yet on the list.
The stakes have never been higher for Republicans in Illinois and across America. As President Trump continues to lead our country through the coronavirus crisis, we need to band together to fight back against the liberal mob who are trying to exploit this pandemic and use it as an opportunity to push their extreme political agenda.
Republican leadership is in jeopardy this November and we need grassroots conservatives to step up and defend it.
I’m reaching out to Illinois Republicans today with a special offer. If you sign up for 2020 Membership before midnight tonight, we’ll send you an Illinois Republican Party bumper sticker!
To become a 2020 Member of the ILGOP, please contribute any amount you are able here:
Alternate text
This offer only lasts today, so please be sure to take advantage of the opportunity.
Again, our Party is so grateful for your support. Make your support official with a membership card today!
Sincerely,
Ronna McDaniel

At the Illinois Republican Party, we're fighting tirelessly to end the Democratic culture of corruption in Illinois. It's sickening, it's hurting our families and livelihoods, and it's destroying the future of our state.
But Alex: We simply can't do it without your help.
From suing Governor Pritzker for disregarding our freedoms, to gathering research to aid in the criminal investigations into the Democratic Machine, we need resources to fight for justice.
While these corrupt Democrats have millions in campaign coffers to protect themselves, we're reliant on your help. We need 100 donors to step up and pledge a contribution to get our fight under way today.

A friendly reminder from the ILGOP if you haven't voted yet: Don't forget to vote NO to Mike Madigan tomorrow!
While the Speaker might not appear on your ballot this year, his influence spans some of the most contentious races in the state:
VOTE NO on the Pritzker/Madigan Tax Hike Amendment: We can't trust Springfield politicians with a blank check to our bank accounts.
VOTE NO on Judge Thomas Kilbride: By voting NO on Judge Thomas Kilbride, you have the power to end Madigan’s 4-3 control of the Illinois Supreme Court!
VOTE NO on Judge Judy Cates: By voting NO on Judge Judy Cates, you're sending a message to Mike Madigan that you refuse to let him advance his liberal machine in our judicial system!
Most importantly, VOTE! Here's where you can find your polling location.

Yep, you read that right. We're absolutely fed up with the hypocrisy and illegality of Governor Pritzker's ban on gatherings of 10 or more people.

Alex,
Earlier this month, the Illinois Republican Party launched our 2020 Races to Watch Program.
We’re excited and proud to work with these impressive candidates and incumbents. They are already making a difference in our state, so it’s critically important that we get them elected.
I’ve been keeping in close contact with these campaigns to better understand what they need from the ILGOP.
Alex: we need to help them tonight.

Each one of these campaigns has an opportunity to show their Democratic opposition that they’re stronger than ever. Now that they have the Illinois Republican Party behind them, they’re ready to blow it out of the water.
We’re launching an 8 HOUR PUSH to garner 100 donations for each campaign by midnight tonight!
After midnight tonight, these campaigns only have TWO MONTHS to really make a difference. It’s so important that we help them build up the resources to fight.
On behalf of these campaigns and the Illinois Republican Party: thank you, in advance, for fighting.

"Hi Alex,
Thank you for connecting with the Democratic Party of Illinois. We’re glad you’re here!
It’s a new day in Illinois and under Governor Pritzker, we’re already off to a great start supporting our hard-working families. The minimum wage has been raised to $15 an hour. And we’re focused on passing a Fair Tax that asks our state’s most wealthy residents to pay more. This means the other 97 percent of Illinois residents will receive tax relief, our schools will be funded without placing an added tax burden on most of us and our state will emerge stronger.
We will keep you regularly informed of priority issues affecting our state and ways you can help support them. Also look for events and other ways to get involved – volunteer, donate, spread the word in your community about issues we all support.
In the coming weeks, look for more information on the 2020 Presidential Election, including information on the many outstanding candidates already in the race and the Illinois delegate selection process.
Please encourage others to sign up for our newsletter and be sure to follow us on Twitter and Facebook. Harnessing the power of many diverse voices from all corners of the state will give us the strongest impact and create the change we want to see.
Don’t hesitate to reach out with any questions. Thanks again for being in touch!

Dear Friend,
Today we witnessed history when Democrats presented two articles of impeachment against President Trump. While this is a chaotic time, it is an important we understand why this drastic step is necessary. As Speaker Nancy Pelosi has reminded us, this moment is about upholding the integrity of the Constitution and reinforcing that no one is above the law – not even the president.
We know each day brings a flood of information and the news cycle spins fast. But we want to arm you with talking points on the articles of impeachment – what they are and what they are not.
This historic impeachment will continue to move quickly. The House Judiciary Committee plans to vote on the articles this week, sending it to the full House for a final vote in the next few weeks.
Thank you for taking a minute to recognize the important step that was taken today by Democrats in the House. And thank you for your continued support of Democratic ideals in Illinois and across the nation.
Sincerely,
Mary Morrissey
Executive Director
Democratic Party of Illinois
ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT: ABUSE OF POWER
Trump abused the power of the presidency. He used the official powers of his office to pressure a foreign country to interfere in our election on his behalf, risking our national security in the process. That is a violation of his constitutional oath and an impeachable offense.
The evidence is overwhelming:
* TRUMP PRESSURED UKRAINE: Trump pressured Ukraine to help his reelection campaign by announcing investigations that would help him politically, including into a potential 2020 opponent.
* On the July 25 call with Zelensky, Trump asked Ukraine to “do us a favor” and investigate a conspiracy theory about the 2016 election and his political opponent.
* Ambassador Sondland, who “followed the president’s orders,” told Ukraine the military aid they had been promised would not be released, and they would not get the White House meeting they sought, until they announced the investigations Trump wanted.
* Former Ambassador Bill Taylor told investigators that Trump made the release of military aid contingent upon Ukraine announcing those investigations, and called that demand “counterproductive” and “crazy.”
* TRUMP ENDANGERED OUR NATIONAL SECURITY: Trump put his personal political interests over the U.S. national interest by soliciting foreign interference in the 2020 election and withholding military aid to Ukraine.
* Lieutenant Colonel Vindman testified that “in helping Ukraine, we are helping ourselves” by pushing back on Russian aggression.
* Laura Cooper testified that providing security assistance to Ukraine was “absolutely” in the U.S. national interest.
* Former Ambassador Bill Taylor testified that withholding aid to Ukraine had life-and-death consequences.
* * *
ARTICLE OF IMPEACHMENT: OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE
Trump obstructed justice. He violated his constitutional oath by impeding a congressional investigation and keeping the American people in the dark. Trump directed a concerted and unprecedented defiance of lawful subpoenas, at which point impeachment is the only remedy.
Here’s three ways Trump obstructed justice:
* TRUMP BLOCKED KEY WITNESSES: Trump refused to comply with the congressional investigation and blocked members of his administration from testifying, despite lawful subpoenas compelling them to do so.
At Trump’s direction, TWELVE current or former aides refused to testify in the inquiry. They include:
* Mick Mulvaney -- Trump’s chief of staff ordered OMB to withhold the aid at Trump’s direction and coordinated the pressure campaign through the “three amigos.”
* John Eisenberg -- Multiple witnesses came to Eisenberg, the White House’s top national security lawyer, with concerns about Trump’s conduct.
* Michael Duffey -- Duffey, a political appointee in OMB, took control of the portfolio that included Ukraine aid after career officials raised concerns about the legality of withholding the assistance.
* And many more.
* TRUMP DIRECTED GOVERNMENT AGENCIES TO WITHHOLD DOCUMENTS: Trump directed White House agencies to defy lawful subpoenas.
* Congress made 71 specific requests or demands for documents -- not a single one was turned over.
* The Office of Management and Budget and Departments of State, Energy, and Defense have refused to turn over even a single record to Congress.
* Witnesses have testified about taking meticulous and contemporaneous notes on the matter, but the State Department has refused to allow congressional investigators to view them.
* TRUMP’S WHITE HOUSE REFUSES TO STATE ITS CASE, despite a lawful subpoena to do so (spoiler alert: They have no case).
* Trump stonewalled the investigation by refusing to turn over key documents requested by Congress.
* The White House’s attorney officially told Congress they would refuse to participate in the inquiry to even state their case.
* In an official letter, the White House counsel told Congress that Trump and his administration would not participate in the inquiry.
Trump’s obstruction of justice is unlike anything we’ve seen in American presidential politics before.
* Past presidents who were subject to an impeachment inquiry complied with some legal demands for documents at times when Trump has refused, and gave the go ahead to White House aides to testify if subpoenaed.
* Richard Nixon: “All members of the White House staff will appear voluntarily when, requested by the committee. They will testify under oath, and they will answer fully all proper questions.”
* Nixon produced documents in response to some White House subpoenas, including transcripts of more than 30 recordings or meetings involving the president.
* Bill Clinton provided written responses to 81 questions from the House Judiciary Committee.
* Among others, both Clinton’s Chief of Staff Erksine Bowles and Counselor Mack McLarty testified.
In America, nobody is above the law - not even the president. Congress must be able to engage in investigations of serious abuses of the public trust.

Dear Friends,
Happy 2020! We hope you had a wonderful holiday season with family and friends.
2020 – our year to elect a Democratic President – has arrived. We couldn’t be more excited and we know you share our enthusiasm.
There is a lot of hard work ahead of us, but it will be some of the most important work we’ve done to date. Please look for more updates from us on ways to get involved in this very important election year.
2020 Election Timeline
Today and tomorrow, presidential candidates and those looking to be presidential nominating delegates will file their petitions to be on the ballot in Illinois. As you know, Illinois Democrats will have 184 delegates and 13 alternates going to the Democratic National Convention July 13-16 in Milwaukee. Of those 184, 101 will be elected in the Democratic Primary on March 17, 2020.
A full list of primaries and caucuses can be found here.
More information on the Illinois delegation selection process can be found in the state party’s Delegate Selection Plan.
Illinois Primary
The presidential primary in Illinois is March 17. Even though we are not one of the first states to hold our primaries, Illinois will still be an extremely important state as we select the next President of the United States. We can take nothing for granted.
Every election is different. But with our strong Democratic base in Illinois, we can elect not just a Democratic President, but Democratic candidates up and down the ballot. We are the party that stands up for the people of Illinois, for the working families, women, people of color, the LGBTQ community, people with disabilities and organized labor. Illinois Democrats have championed policies that protect these Illinoisans and we will continue to do so under Governor Pritzker, our Democratic statewide Constitutional officers and the Democratic majorities in the Illinois House and Senate.
Volunteer to Elect Democrats in 2020
From Chicago to Cairo, Democratic candidates for local, state and national office need volunteers to knock on doors, make phone calls, input and manage voter data and social media. Be part of making government work better for everyone – click here to volunteer.
Milwaukee, Here We Come
The Democratic National Convention Committee has announced hotel assignments for each delegation and the details of the DNC in Milwaukee next July are coming together. We are thrilled that our neighbors to the north are the hosts of this important event and that 26 state delegations will be staying in Illinois – either in Rosemont or Lake County. The Midwest has a crucial role to play in electing a Democrat for President in 2020 and Illinois is proud to be involved in making that happen.
More details on events and logistics for the Convention will be coming soon, so stay tuned!
If you are interested in potentially becoming a volunteer for the Convention, please click here and provide your contact information. While we cannot guarantee a role, we hope to get as many Illinois Democrats involved in the Convention as possible.
Impeachment Watch
We start the new year preparing for a Senate trial of President Trump’s impeachment. Impeachment is not what Democrats set out to do in 2019, but the President's actions demanded it. It is certainly not an action taken lightly or because Democrats dislike President Trump or his policies. Above all, it is about love of country, upholding the integrity of the Constitution and protecting our future.
We will continue to arm you with talking points as the Senate trial and other developments unfold.
Topline Messages – Impeachment: Senate Trial
* At the start of an impeachment trial, senators take an oath to be “impartial” jurors. The American people deserve a full and fair trial.
* Instead, Senate Republicans have already admitted that they won’t even attempt to hold a fair trial.
* Mitch McConnell refused to accept Democrats’ proposals for a fair trial.
* McConnell admitted he is “fully coordinating” with the White House, and Lindsey Graham and McConnell won’t even pretend to be impartial jurors.
* While Senate Republicans have abdicated their constitutional duty to run a fair trial, Democrats laid out a structure for a full and fair and Senate trial.
* Their proposal is modeled off of the Clinton trial procedures, which passed unanimously, and McConnell voted for.
* Senate Democrats proposed calling for key documents and testimony from firsthand witnesses who were blocked by Trump from participating in the House inquiry.
* These witnesses include Mick Mulvaney, John Bolton, top Mulvaney aide Robert Blair, and OMB associate director Michael Duffey.
* An overwhelming majority, including nearly two-thirds of Republicans, say Trump should allow these witnesses to testify in a Senate trial.
* Republicans who complained for months about the need for more firsthand testimony should join Democrats in demanding that the White House stop blocking key administration officials from testifying, and release documents they claim would exonerate Trump.
* Americans deserve a full and fair trial. Senators must uphold their oath to the Constitution instead of voting for a partisan show trial that ignores the facts and chases debunked conspiracy theories.

Dear Friend,
As we reflect on Governor Pritzker's first year in office and look at the work ahead in 2020, we know how important it is to address the concerns of those who live in rural Illinois.
As Democrats, we are committed to listening, learning and supporting rural communities across the state. At the end of the day, we all want the same things: to be able to live, work and raise our families in safe, thriving communities. Chairman Madigan and Illinois Democrats are committed to making that a reality, regardless of where you live in Illinois.
Here's a look at some of the recent projects and programs Illinois Democrats have championed to strengthen rural communities.
Under the leadership of Governor Pritzker, we have:
* Passed the bipartisan Rebuild Illinois capital plan – the largest infrastructure investment in Illinois history – to rebuild crumbling roads and bridges across Illinois and create hundreds of thousands of jobs. Projects include critical renovations at SIU-Carbondale, updates to the DuQuoin State Fairgrounds, improvements to the Rockford mass transit district and more.
* Launched an effort to bring high-speed broadband internet to every corner of the state, eliminating a major obstacle to economic development.
* Ensured the new law expanding gaming in the state included development of a casino in Carterville which will bring over a thousand construction jobs to Williamson and surrounding counties.
* Raised the minimum wage for all Illinois workers to $9.25/hour in 2020 and eventually $15/hour in 2025, addressing the failure at the federal level to increase the minimum wage of $7.25/hour.
* Strengthened critical access hospitals in rural downstate communities.
* Stabilized our public colleges and universities, the economic engines and biggest employers in many parts of the state, by increasing public university and community college funding by 5%.
* Expanded skills development, including the first increase for career and technical education in a decade.
* Increased college affordability by expanding in-state college scholarships to nearly 7,000 more students and merit scholarships for high achieving college-bound students by 40%.
* Refocused community college workforce development programs to concentrate on high-growth industries.
* Fully funded reconstruction of Quincy Veterans’ Home and restarted long-delayed 200-bed Chicago Veterans' Home by spring of 2020.
* Other Democratic leaders also continue to fight for all Illinoisans: Senator Dick Durbin has introduced a bill that would support financially vulnerable rural hospitals facing risk of closure.
* Attorney General Kwame Raoul is fighting attempts by Republican attorneys general to abolish the Affordable Care Act which provides health care to hundreds of thousands in rural Illinois.
* Democratic leaders in the Illinois House and Senate continue to focus on increasing access to health care through the expansion of telemedicine.
Of course, there is more work to be done.
In case you missed it, I recently discussed the importance of rural communities in advancing Democratic values with Tom Miller on his Morning Newswatch radio program on WJPF-AM, River Radio of Southern Illinois. Have a listen!
Thank you for all you do to support the ideals of the Democratic party. Please reach out any time with anything you need as we continue to build a strong Illinois together.

Dear Friend,
Last night we witnessed history once again - the impeachment of President Trump. As many on the House floor pointed out, yesterday was a tragic one in America's history. Impeachment is not what Democrats set out to do in 2019, but the President's actions demanded it. It is certainly not an action taken lightly or because Democrats dislike President Trump and his policies. Above all, it is about love of country, upholding the integrity of the Constitution and protecting our future.
As always, we want to arm you with talking points that will allow you to respond to the pushback and disinformation that will come from the other side of the aisle. People across Illinois and the entire nation will be inundated with a Senate trial in the coming weeks. We will continue to provide you with updates, helping you debunk the confusion and chaos that will likely stem from Republican maneuvers in the Senate.
Thank you for supporting Democrats and our ideals during this tumultuous time. We know it can be overwhelming, but we know it's worth doing to defend our democracy.
Sincerely,
Mary Morrissey
Executive Director
Democratic Party of Illinois
## Impeachment: House Vote
Background: Yesterday, the House impeached the president.
* Yesterday was a great day for our Constitution, but a solemn day for our democracy. The president violated his oath of office, and in the face of his abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, the House had a responsibility to hold him accountable.
* House Democrats did not run for office to impeach a president, but to improve people’s lives and defend the Constitution. The president’s actions forced their hand.
* Republicans in Congress were given a choice: to protect the Constitution and serve American voters, or to defend this president’s lies and corruption. They chose the latter, and the American people will not forget their betrayal.
* Americans will make their voices heard at the ballot box. And when the history of this day is written, those who voted for impeachment will be remembered for their courage and commitment to protecting our democracy.
* Trump’s misconduct is exactly what the Founders sought to protect our democracy from when they provided Congress with the power to impeach.
* Trump’s ongoing misconduct represents a clear and present danger to our democracy and national security.
* Trump has betrayed his oath of office, betrayed our Constitution’s system of checks and balances, betrayed our national security, and be­trayed the integrity of our elections for his own personal political gain. He gave the House no choice: impeachment was the only constitutional recourse.
## Impeachment: Senate Trial
* At the start of an impeachment trial, senators take an oath to be “impartial” jurors. The American people deserve a full and fair trial.
* Instead, Senate Republicans have already admitted that they won’t even attempt to hold a fair trial.
* Mitch McConnell refused to accept Democrats’ proposals for a fair trial.
* McConnell admitted he is “fully coordinating” with the White House, and Lindsey Graham and McConnell won’t even pretend to be impartial jurors.
* While Senate Republicans have abdicated their constitutional duty to run a fair trial, Democrats laid out a structure for a full and fair and Senate trial.
* Their proposal is modeled off of the Clinton trial procedures, which passed unanimously, and McConnell voted for.
* Senate Democrats proposed calling key documents and testimony from firsthand witnesses who were blocked by Trump from participating in the House inquiry.
* These witnesses include Mick Mulvaney, John Bolton, top Mulvaney aide Robert Blair, and OMB associate director Michael Duffey.
* An overwhelming majority, including nearly two-thirds of Republicans, say Trump should allow these witnesses to testify in a Senate trial.
* Republicans who complained for months about the need for more firsthand testimony should join Democrats in demanding that the White House stop blocking key administration officials from testifying, and release documents they claim would exonerate Trump.
* Americans deserve a full and fair trial. Senators must uphold their oath to the Constitution instead of voting for a partisan show trial that ignores the facts and chases debunked conspiracy theories.
## Impeachment: Republicans’ Debunked Talking Points
* While Democrats seek the facts, Republicans have wasted their allotted time attacking the witnesses, blaming the process, and peddling already-debunked conspiracy theories.
Republicans’ debunked talking points:
* LIE: The process has not been fair.
* Republicans asked for public hearings, and they got them. They asked that Trump’s lawyers be allowed to cross-examine witnesses, and they were invited to do that too. But now, Trump says there should be no hearings at all, and the White House won’t participate in House hearings. We’re not sure how much longer they can use this excuse.
* Their real complaint is clear: they don’t want Trump to be investigated.
* LIE: Democrats should have waited for the courts to compel witnesses to testify.
* The threat facing our democracy is urgent and imminent. The president is already trying to cheat in our next election.
* We already have overwhelming and sufficient evidence that Trump abused the power of the presidency and is now engaged in unprecedented obstruction of Congress.
* Congress cannot allow Trump to interfere in its constitutional duty and delay this process. And relying on the courts can take years.
* This impeachment inquiry has already lasted longer than the impeachments of Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton.
* LIE: Democratic witnesses had no firsthand knowledge of their allegations.
* Republicans who desire more firsthand testimony should join Democrats in demanding that the Senate call firsthand witnesses, and that the White House stop blocking key administration officials from testifying and release documents they claim would exonerate Trump.
* The House heard from three witnesses who listened in on the July 25 call and two who were directly involved in the pressure campaign.
* LIE: Democrats need to call the whistleblower to testify.
* The whistleblower’s complaint has been corroborated by firsthand witnesses, and the White House itself.
* The president and Republicans have put the whistleblower’s life in danger. House Democrats are following the law and protecting the whistleblower’s identity.
* LIE: Democrats aren’t getting anything done because they are focused on impeachment.
* While Trump is tweeting, Democrats in the House have passed nearly 400 bills, including to lower health care costs and prescription drug prices, raise wages, improve gun safety, clean up corruption, safeguard our elections, and more.
* Meanwhile, Republicans in the Senate have refused to take up most of these bills, and Trump doesn’t have a plan to address these issues.
* The truth is that Trump has broken his promises on everything from infrastructure to gun safety to drug prices and more, and now he is trying to point fingers to excuse his ineffectiveness.
* LIE: The aid was withheld because of concerns about “corruption.”
* Emails confirm the aid was not withheld because of corruption: in fact, the White House scrambled to justify the hold weeks after Trump’s order.
* The Department of Defense certified that Ukraine met all anti-corruption requirements to receive military aid. There was no reason for aid to be withheld.
* In fact, every agency except OMB — which had been ordered to freeze the aid — agreed that Ukraine had made substantial progress in combating corruption and corruption in Ukraine did not warrant withholding aid.
* The concern about corruption is rich, coming from this administration.
* As multiple witnesses have stated, when Trump said “corruption,” it was code for investigations into his opponent. Trump has even admitted this himself.
* Trump never said the word “corruption” during his call with Zelensky, but did mention his political rival by name multiple times.
* If Trump was worried about corruption, he wouldn’t have fired Ambassador Yovanovitch, a standard-bearer of America’s anti-corruption efforts, have sought repeatedly to cut foreign aid programs that combat corruption in Ukraine, or have released military aid to the corrupt previous government.
* LIE: None of this matters because the aid was released to Ukraine and no investigation was announced.
* The administration did not release military aid to Ukraine for months. It finally did so just days after Congress learned of the existence of the whistleblower complaint and began investigating the scheme.
* Before that happened, Zelensky was preparing to announce the investigations Trump wanted in an interview on CNN.
* As constitutional experts testified, Trump getting caught and not being able to pull off his scheme does not change the fact that his conduct was impeachable.
* LIE: There was no quid pro quo. Sondland only “presumed” there was a quid pro quo linking military aid to investigations.
* Sondland was explicitly told by Giuliani that there was a quid pro quo linking a White House meeting to a public announcement of the investigations Trump wanted into his political rivals. This came after Trump personally directed Sondland to work with Giuliani on Ukraine matters.
* In this context, and “in the absence of any credible explanation” for why aid was withheld, Sondland realized that receiving military aid was also contingent on Ukraine announcing the investigations.
* Multiple other witnesses have confirmed that Trump withheld military aid and a White House meeting to pressure Ukraine to announce investigations that would benefit him politically.
* Kent testified that the aid was withheld at the direction of Trump, until Ukraine announced “nothing less” than the investigations he requested.
* We also have the July 25 phone call summary and Mulvaney’s press conference clearly linking military aid to investigations into Trump’s political rivals.
* LIE: Zelensky said there was no pressure on the July 25 call.
* Of course Zelensky was going to say there was no pressure — Ukraine is heavily dependent on our military aid. By withholding it, Trump endangered Ukrainian lives and strengthened Russia’s hand.
* Not to mention, Ukraine’s president needs the backing of the United States to shore up his own support in Ukraine and to continue to counter Russian aggression.
* According to testimony, Zelensky knew it was a bad idea to interfere in an election, but felt so much pressure from Trump that he eventually agreed to make the announcement.
* In a recent interview, Zelensky criticized Trump for blocking aid, saying “We’re at war. If you’re our strategic partner, then you can’t go blocking anything for us.”
* LIE: The Ukrainian government was not aware that U.S. military aid was being withheld.
* This Republican talking point crumbled, live on national TV.
* Emails suggest the Ukrainians knew there was a hold on military aid the very day of Trump’s call with Zelensky — and the day before Sondland and Volker met with Zelensky and Ukrainian officials.
* Ukraine’s government was aware, months before the call, that Trump wanted them to investigate his political rivals. Zelensky met with his advisors soon after he was elected to discuss how to respond to pressure from Trump and Giuliani to pursue an investigation for Trump’s political benefit.
* LIE: Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election.
* This is a debunked conspiracy theory pushed by Putin and Russia to distract from Russia’s very real interference in the 2016 election on behalf of Trump.
* The Intelligence Community has stated unequivocally that Russia interfered in our democracy, and continues to do so. Even Republican-led Senate and House Intelligence committees found that was true.
* There is no evidence that Ukraine interfered in our election — the Republican Senate Intelligence Committee investigated that claim and found no basis for it.
* A Ukrainian politician writing an op-ed, after Trump said he’d hand Crimea over to Russia, is in no way comparable to the Russian government executing a coordinated campaign to interfere in our elections.

Dear Friends,
We need your help protecting the vote in November. We are hoping you – or someone you know – is interested in serving as a Democratic election judge for the November 3 general election.
Election judges are on the front lines of protecting Illinois voters from President Trump and the Republican Party that has launched a national effort to recruit 50,000 volunteers to “monitor polling places and challenge ballots and voters deemed suspicious.” We all know that really means doing everything they can to keep Democratic voters, especially voters of color and immigrants, from the ballot box.
We can’t let that happen. Will you help your fellow Illinoisans fairly and safely cast their ballots by becoming an election judge?
Election judges are paid by the county clerk or local election authority to process voters in their neighborhood Election Day voting site. All judges will be paid based on successfully completing a training class and their Election Day assignment. If you are interested in becoming an election judge, click here to sign up.
Already an election judge? Please submit your information so we can keep you informed about training opportunities. And don’t forget to invite a friend to be an election judge!
Sincerely,
MICHAEL J. MADIGAN

Dear Friends,
We just witnessed an historic special session of the Illinois General Assembly in the midst of an unprecedented public health crisis. We are proud of how Democrats came together in a safe way and worked with our colleagues across the aisle to put Illinois and its residents first. Democrats stood with our most vulnerable communities and those residents and workers most impacted by the COVID-19 crisis to provide much-needed relief and resources.
Here are the highlights that we encourage you to share with your supporters and communities:
COVID-19 Crisis Relief
Faced with difficult decisions, Democrats passed a state budget that provides critical funding for testing, access to health care, rental assistance, unemployment benefits for those facing layoffs and furloughs, resources to help small business owners rebuild their life’s work and job training for people whose careers have been disrupted. The budget provides flexibility to keep services running during the crisis, while also increasing legislative oversight of state spending to aid in a strong and fair recovery.
Expanded Voting Access
Illinois is known for its strong and comprehensive voting laws that provide voters a variety of ways to be heard. With COVID-19 likely posing a threat in November, Democrats expanded voting access further to ensure residents can vote safely and securely. Led by the House Democratic Women’s Caucus, Democrats passed a bill that will greatly expand vote by mail options in the November 3 general election. The bill is headed to Governor Pritzker’s desk and we can continue our work to get out the vote!
Fair Tax Language
Democrats finalized the language for the graduated income tax (Fair Tax) measure that will appear on the ballot November 3. The joint resolution provides that every household in Illinois will be mailed a pamphlet before the general election providing arguments for and against the Fair Tax. Now more than ever we need to level the playing field to ensure working families who are struggling to pay their rent don’t pay the same or greater percentage of their income in taxes. We will continue working with all of you to ensure Illinois residents understand the many benefits a Fair Tax will bring to the overwhelming majority of Illinois taxpayers.
Workers’ Rights
Labor and business came together to approve a bipartisan bill that will make it easier for workers who contract COVID-19 to obtain worker’s compensation benefits. The rules apply to first responders, healthcare workers and other essential workers who are making significant sacrifices to keep the rest of us safe during this unprecedented pandemic.
Property Tax Relief
Democrats passed a bill that provides immediate property tax relief for seniors, veterans and people living disabilities by suspending late payments and tax sales and allowing them to keep their tax exemptions without having to reapply.
Expanded Healthcare Access
Democrats passed legislation to expand Medicaid, increase access to tele-health and mental health resources, and secured additional support for hospitals battling the virus in rural and low-income communities.
Education Support
Understanding the extensive changes our teachers and students have endured during this crisis, Democrats passed bills to be sure teachers and students can continue to be successful, whether instruction occurs in the classroom or online.
In case you missed it, Speaker Madigan issued this statement at the close of this unprecedented session.
We applaud all of the Democrats and Republicans legislators who came together to do the challenging but important work needed for the people of Illinois in this uncertain time.
And we thank all of you for continuing to fight side-by-side with our Democratic leaders to pass laws that lift up every Illinoisan, especially during this unprecedented crisis. Now we must turn our attention to the critical work we must do to win in November, and we are encouraged by the many voices across the state willing to step up and join us!
Sincerely,
Mary Morrissey

Dear Friends,
We hope this message finds you and your families well as we navigate uncharted territory together. “Normal” life seems hard to remember as we face a public health crisis impacting all aspects of our lives. Our work schedules and daily routines have been upended and we are finding new ways to gather and communicate.
In these uncertain times, it’s important to remember that we're all in this together. Under the outstanding leadership of Governor Pritzker, we are taking measures as a state to ensure we keep everyone safe and emerge from this crisis stronger. So take care of yourselves, your families and your neighbors. We’ve been through difficult times before and we’ll get through this too.
Lending a Hand
Governor Pritzker has taken on a national role in his response to the COVID-19 crisis and we are grateful for his leadership as the Trump administration continues to be slow to react.
With misinformation and rumors swirling, please get your information from the Governor’s office and other state officials. They are on the front lines of this crisis and are sharing information regularly through this website and daily press briefings.
There are many ways we can help each other during this challenging time. Food banks need donations, small businesses need support and our must vulnerable residents need our attention. Here is a list of ways to get involved.
All In Illinois
Governor Pritzker today announced the All In Illinois campaign. He is encouraging all Illinoisans to stay home to protect themselves, their neighbors, their communities, their healthcare workers, and their state. As we know, we’re all in this together.
Here’s what you can do to help right now:
* Update your Facebook profile picture with an “All In Illinois” frame
* Encourage others to stay home and be All In for Illinois
* Post on social media using the hashtag #AllInIllinois
* Share the website [[URL REDACTED]] with your networks
Together, we will get through this challenging time for our state and our country.
Campaigning in a Virtual World
Even in these difficult times, it’s important to remember that democracy must continue. Now more than ever, we are experiencing the devastating effects of incompetency and disinformation from President Trump and his administration. It’s time for true leadership in the Oval Office, and we are motivated and committed to making that happen.
Of course, the way we will campaign for our new president and Democrats up and down the ballot will be unlike anything we’ve done before. We’ll need to make more phone calls, virtually knock on doors, find new ways to gather and organize, continue to manage data and share information on social media. I’m confident we’ll rise to the occasion and we are here to help everyone master a new set of virtual campaign tools.
Please stay tuned as we roll out our virtual campaigning program over the next few weeks.
2020 Illinois Primary
As you know, we held our primary election March 17. It wasn’t without its challenges, but we are proud to have forged ahead in a way that balanced safety with the importance of selecting our presidential delegates, precinct committee people and Democratic nominees for federal, state and local office.
Thank you to everyone who helped us make that happen, especially Governor Pritzker. We know the choice to move forward was not easy, but we are confident it was the right one. Here is a great piece on why our elections must continue.
In case you missed it, Chairman Madigan issued the following statement on primary night:
“The 2020 Illinois primary was like none we’ve experienced before, and I am grateful for all those who came together to ensure people could exercise their right to vote, including the dedicated staff of election authorities, election judges, volunteers and most importantly, the voters. We pulled together and found ways to hold one of the most important elections in our nation’s history in a safe and secure way. Even in these uncertain times, we reminded the nation that you can count on Illinois – a state that represents what America looks like – to deliver on making critical changes for our country. Tonight, we are one step closer to electing a Democrat for President.”
We’ll continue to be in touch as this crisis unfolds and we campaign in one of the most important elections in our lifetime. Thank you for everything you do to support our Democratic ideals and each other in these trying times.

Dear Friends,
The Democratic Party of Illinois today released a video featuring elected officials and other party leaders from across the state thanking frontline workers for their immense sacrifice during this public health crisis.
Illinois Democratic leaders took a minute while staying home to thank the doctors, nurses, pharmacy and grocery store workers, delivery drivers, truck drivers, postal workers and so many more for their courage and dedication in this uncertain time.
""Frontline workers are making countless sacrifices every day to protect Illinois residents,"" Michael J. Madigan, Chairman of the Democratic Party of Illinois, said. ""We owe these workers not only our thanks, but also our respect and support as they put in long hours, many times away from their own families. They are the heroes in this fight.""

## Illinois Green Party Co-Hosts Video Teach-In for Peace Tonight
Contrary to the old song “Down By the Riverside,” we DO have to ""study war"" -- to know how to overcome it.
Consider: How many Americans even know that the U.S. is at war in Somalia? Or that it still periodically bombs Libya? When was the last time you ever heard a representative of the peace movement on MSNBC, CNN, Fox, NPR, etc.? Why isn't the issue of militarism and war raised whenever a politician or pundit says that we ""can't afford"" single payer health care, free college tuition, or the Green New Deal?
Join us this evening to hear how you can help become part of the solution, and help put an end to war!
### Building the Peace Movement Teach-In Wednesday May 20, 2020
Start: Wednesday, May 20, 2020, 7:00 p.m. Central Time
Bring your questions and suggestions. We'll hear briefly from a number of key speakers before moving into Q&A.
This event marks the 50th Anniversary of the Kent State and Jackson State murders of peace activists by National Guard troops and police.

## Special Meeting to Decide Whether to Endorse 2020 Candidates
7PM Thursday May 21, 2020
Online Video/Phone Conference (Participants must register for the meeting at [[URL REDACTED]]…/tZAld-qtpj4rGNK19eEQTEdm5Thj0VaL8…)
Invited attendees: Members of the Cook County Green Party and the DuPage County Green Party
We are holding a special meeting to decide whether to endorse Alia Sarfraz for US House of Representatives (IL-8) for the November 3rd, 2020 General Election. Here’s Alia’s completed candidate questionnaire for your review: [[URL REDACTED]]…
US House District 8 ([[URL REDACTED]]…/Congressional-Distr…/Overview) has 716,964 residents. About half the district is in Cook County, about 40% in DuPage County, and about 10% in Kane County. The district represents all or parts of several cities (Chicago, Des Plaines, Elgin, Elmhurst, Oakbrook Terrace, Rolling Meadows, Wheaton, Wood Dale) and villages (Addison, Arlington Heights, Barrington Hills, Bartlett, Bensenville, Bloomingdale, Buffalo Grove, Carol Stream, Carpentersville, East Dundee, Elk Grove Village, Glen Ellyn, Glendale Heights, Hanover Park, Hoffman Estates, Itasca, Lombard, Mount Prospect, Oak Brook, Palatine, Roselle, Schaumburg, South Barrington, South Elgin, Streamwood, Villa Park, Wheeling).
Per Illinois Green Party bylaws, chapters that reside in the district are responsible for deciding whether to endorse candidates in that district. In this case those chapters are the Cook County Green Party and the DuPage County Green Party.
We may have at least one other candidate seeking endorsement at the meeting. If we add that candidate to the meeting agenda, we will try to give members at least 24 hours to review their completed questionnaire.
If you are not able to join us via video on your computer or smart device, you can still join us by calling into the meeting on your phone.
## Virtual chapter meetings
While in-person Green Party meetings and events remain on hiatus for obvious reasons, our chapters are learning to adapt by conducting video and/or phone conference calls. If you reside in or near one of our chapters, and haven’t yet gotten involved or been involved lately, you are encouraged to connect with them as we forge ahead into campaign 2020. Here are some of the upcoming “virtual” meetings scheduled:

Peoria Area Green Party
For Immediate Release: September 15, 2020
U.S. Senate Candidate David Black to Visit Peoria
Peoria, IL—David Black, Illinois attorney and Green Party candidate for the United States Senate, will be in Peoria for a rolling meet and greet, news conference, and virtual open house on Tuesday, September 22, 2020.
The sites for the meet and greet/press conference are all outdoors. Social distancing will be observed and masks will be required in accordance with local, state, and federal health guidelines. The event will begin at 2:45 pm at the NW corner of Jefferson Street and Main Street at the “Peace and Harvest” sculpture, created by artist Mary Anderson Clark. The candidate will address the Green New Deal and his position on military spending. The “Peace and Harvest” sculptures were created by a federally funded arts program, the Works Progress Administration (WPA), in 1938. The agency employed over 8.5 million people from 1935–1943, a time of great economic strife due to the Great Depression.
The event will move south on Jefferson Street to Preston Jackson’s “Knockin’ on Freedom’s Door” sculpture at the corner of Liberty Street and Jefferson Avenue, outside the Peoria Civic Center. The sculpture honors Peoria’s role in the historic Underground Railroad movement. While there, at 3:45 pm, Mr. Black will speak about U.S. border and amnesty issues.
The final stop will take place at 4:45 pm, at the site of Preston Jackson’s Richard Pryor sculpture, titled “Richard Pryor: More Than Just a Comedian,” at the corner of SW Washington Street and State Street. Mr Black will speak to the issue of police violence as documented in the life history of one of Peoria’s greatest comedians, who spoke out about his relationship with the police in the 1970s. In visiting these public sculptures, the Peoria Area Green Party hopes to convey that Peoria’s values are Green Party values.
Finally, the candidate will host a Virtual Open House at 7:00 pm, open to everyone, to discuss his entire platform and to answer questions from the general public. More information to access the event is found at:
[[URL REDACTED]] Questions for the virtual open house may be submitted to Peoria Area Green Party Coordinator Sheldon Schafer at 309-868-4028 or via email [[URL REDACTED]]

## Biden vs. Trump?!
### As if a deadly virus pandemic didn't give us enough to worry about right now, the thought of having Joe Biden and Donald Trump appearing as the sole ""choices"" for president on the November ballot is itself a pretty sickening thought.
### But don’t despair. With your help, we will have a real choice on the ballot!
[[URL REDACTED]]
Whether you are a member of the Green Party, a friend or just curious, the chances are pretty good that you would like to see a better choice for president appear on the general election ballot. Yet, barring something approaching a miracle, that appears to be what the Democratic and Republican parties will be serving up to U.S. voters this November.
However, with your help, we can get a real candidate for social progress on the ballot – an eco-socialist candidate who goes beyond even the best aspects of the Bernie Sanders platform, taking an uncompromising stand for peace, environmental restoration, economic security for all, and health care as a human right.
That candidate will either be longtime New York Green Howie Hawkins, who recently won the Illinois Green Party presidential preference vote with over 73 percent of the total, or rival candidate Dario Hunter. Howie is currently in the lead among the candidates seeking the nomination of the national party, and because he won our preference vote, his name will appear on our ballot access petition. In the event that Dario wins the nomination, our efforts to get Howie on the ballot will still count, and we will be able to substitute the national Green Party’s choice on the November ballot.
## To have that choice on the ballot, however, we need your help.
Even in normal times, it takes a monumental effort to get our candidates on the ballot. Illinois has among the most repressive ballot access laws in the nation. The Democrats and Republicans have created an unlevel playing field, requiring other political parties to gather 25,000 petition signatures from registered voters just to get their candidates’ names on the November ballot – and to collect those signatures in just 90 days. (Democratic and Republican presidential candidates only needed 3,000 signatures, with petitioning taking place last Fall.) In practice, this requires us to actually collect over 50,000 signatures, in order to survive the almost inevitable legal challenges to our petition filing.
You have probably noticed, however, that these are not normal times. Under the current national, state and local emergency declarations limiting public gatherings and public health protocols requiring “social distancing,” normal petitioning has been rendered impossible. At this time, we cannot ask members and volunteers to risk their health by physically approaching strangers, nor can we ask members of the public to get in close physical proximity to a petitioner and handle a clipboard and pen handled by unknown numbers of others. Normal petitioning is simply out of the question for the foreseeable future – yet the normal petitioning period begins tomorrow -- March 24th \-- and ends on June 22nd.
Under this public health emergency, both the Green Party and the Libertarian Party have written a letter to Governor Pritzker and other responsible state officials demanding emergency relief – specifically, a waiver of our normal petitioning requirement. The complete text of our letter may be found here.
This demand is entirely reasonable. However, unless and until we actually obtain a waiver or other relief from the petitioning requirement, we cannot assume that the same public officials who benefit from the status quo will act reasonably. Therefore, we are asking our members and supporters, and all Illinoisans who support the democratic rights of voters to have their choices appear on the ballot, to take the following steps:
* Download our petition and petitioning instructions here. Beginning on March 24th, but not before, if you are a registered Illinois voter, fill out and sign the first line yourself, and if you still have normal contact with other Illinois voters (close family members, spouse or partner, co-workers), ask them to fill out and sign on the lines under yours.
* Once you have obtained all of the signatures that you think you can obtain safely, you can fill out the bottom portion of the petition as a circulator, but do not sign on the circulator line just yet, or anything below the circulator signature line. As of right now, there is still a requirement that the circulator signature be notarized. We are hoping to obtain relief from this requirement. We will have a follow-up announcement when we know more. In the meantime, there is no reason to make arrangements with a notary just yet.
* Once you have obtained all of the signatures that you think you can obtain safely, you should also contact our ballot access coordinator, Anna Schiefelbein, at [[URL REDACTED]] or 1-800-670-7048, and let her know that you have one or more petition signatures, leaving your contact information.
* If you are someone who normally would be willing to petition on behalf of our candidates, but cannot do so due to the current emergency, we will soon have affidavit forms on our website for you to fill out. This will help us both in our efforts to persuade public officials to act, and, if necessary, a future legal action to obtain relief.
* Please sign our “virtual” or online petition here. Although it is not a legal substitute for a notarized hard copy petition signature, this will also help both our efforts to persuade public officials to act, and, if necessary, a future legal action to obtain relief.
* Please donate to our ballot access drive. At this point, we do not know whether we will still be required to do the impossible, meet some sort of revised petitioning requirement, or do something else entirely. However, if our efforts to persuade government officials do not succeed, we intend to file a legal challenge seeking an injunction to have our candidates placed on the ballot without the petitioning requirement. In any event, a financial contribution would be of great assistance. Please donate what you can!
* If you know of a specific public event that would have been held this Spring, but has been canceled due to the emergency, please enter it into our event calendar here, even though it won’t be held. The reason is that we want to build a list of petitioning opportunities that we have had to miss, for possible future litigation purposes.
For questions about any of the above, please contact our Ballot Access Coordinator, Anna Schiefelbein, at 1-800-670-7048, or [[URL REDACTED]]
## If you are a Sanders supporter, don’t just “#DemExit.” Get on board with the Green Party!
We in the Illinois Green Party certainly sympathize with activists who fought hard to change the Democratic Party from within by working for Bernie Sanders. But once again, the corporate Democrats who run that political party pulled out all the stops to deny him the nomination and give it instead to another rightwing corporatist war-monger, branded as a “moderate,” whatever that’s supposed to mean. (“Moderate” war? “Moderate” destruction of the eco-system? “Moderate” poverty?)
The relentless media attacks against Sanders and the incessant repetition of the dubious claim that Biden was more “electable” successfully herded most mainstream Democrats to get in line – although, as in 2016, outright manipulation of the election count also may have played a significant role in the outcome.
Whatever the causes, as Glen Ford observed in Black Agenda Report: “The Democrats were always a dead end, but folks had to get their asses kicked TWICE to learn that you can’t turn a ruling class party against the ruling class.”
But you don’t have to compromise your values. Indeed, the best of the values embodied by Sanders are far better reflected in the Green Party and its candidates. Please take a look at the Green Party and its candidates, and if you like what you see, please help our ballot access drive by following the steps listed above – and join us!

## Illinois Green Party Spring Convention Coming February 29th!
The Illinois Green Party 2020 Spring Convention and membership meeting will take place on Saturday, February 29, 2020, from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. at the Third Unitarian Church, 301 N. Mayfield, Chicago.
The meeting will be followed by a social hour from 5:00-6:00 pm, and a presidential forum, featuring recognized Green Party candidates for president of the United States, at 6:00 p.m.!
The day will be capped off by a fundraising dinner for the Illinois Green Party at 7:30.
Our meetings are open, and you do not have to attend the business meeting in order to attend the evening events. However, you have to be a dues-paying member of the party to participate in decision-making, so if you have not yet joined, this would be a good time to take care of that task, by following this link.
It will be a full day, but a great opportunity to meet and network Greens from around the state who are making a difference in their communities, including local officeholders, candidates and activists working for peace, economic security and equality, universal health care, climate justice and much more.
The business meeting will have a pretty full agenda, as we discuss petition planning and strategizing for campaign 2020, election of officers, amendments to our by-laws, possible selection of a U.S. Senate candidate, selection process for our presidential ticket – and more. Please mark your calendars now, and plan on joining us that day.
The finalized agenda will be released as soon as possible. However, it will be a full-day conference, so if you plan on attending the business meeting, please try to arrive a little early to register and be ready to go at 9.

## Our 2020 ballot-access drive is coming up fast. Please help us hit the ground running!
Due to the ridiculously unfair ballot access laws in Illinois, it is a major ordeal to get our candidates on the ballot, especially for national or statewide office. But you can help us get off to a great start by volunteering to help out, donating to our ballot access fund, and/or pledging to sign our petition when the petitioning period begins. If every Illinois voter receiving this newsletter made a commitment to sign our petition, we could meet over 20 percent of our goal right off the bat!
For more information on the ballot access drive and to learn how you can help, please visit our Ballot Access 2020 information page.
## Upcoming Events:
[[URL REDACTED]]
###  Saturday, February 15th, Warrenville: Green Party Forum: Ecosocialism and the Green New Deal, 11am – 1pm, Warrenville Public Library, West Room, 28W751 Stafford Place, Warrenville, IL
The vast majority of us are concerned about the looming specter of mass extinction of our children and grandchildren as a result of global warming. The worldwide scientific community concurs. We must take action immediately!
All we see from the vast majority of Republican Party candidates and officeholders is denial. Even more dangerously, all we see from Democratic Party candidates and elected officials are weak quarter measures that do not sufficiently address the urgency and thus greenwash the problem. These two parties offer Thelma and Louise solutions that will drive us off the cliff at either 60 mph or 50 mph.
The Green Party offers real solutions that will solve this existential threat – eco-socialism and the Green New Deal.
Join us for a Green Party Forum to discuss these solutions. Our guest speakers will be Rich Whitney and Peter Schwartzman.
Rich Whitney is an attorney from Carbondale, Illinois, now working as an appellate public defender. Rich is one of the founding members of the Illinois Green Party and served as the Party’s first candidate for Governor in 2006, winning over 360,000 votes (10.4%). Mr. Whitney’s current activist roles include serving as co-chair of the Illinois Green Party, and as a steering committee member of Southern Illinoisans Against Fracturing our Environment (SAFE), a group devoted to the fight against fracking and other fossil fuel extraction. He is an active participant in the Green Party Peace Action Committee, the Peace Coalition of Southern Illinois, the Chicago Committee Against War and Racism, the United National Antiwar Coalition, and the Illinois Coalition Against Fracking. Rich is also a Green public official, serving as Vice-Chair for the Jackson County Mass Transit District.
Peter Schwartzman is an elected Illinois Green. Peter has served as an Alderperson on the Galesburg City Council since 2011. Mr. Schwartzman is also a Professor of Environmental Studies at Knox College in Galesburg. He has a Ph.D. in Environmental Sciences from the University of Virginia. Peter recently co-authored the book The Earth Is Not for Sale: A Path Out of Fossil Capitalism to the Other World That is Still Possible.
The forum will be moderated by Steve Alesch, Political Director of the DuPage County Green Party.
This forum is sponsored by the DuPage County Green Party. This event is neither sponsored nor endorsed by the Warrenville Public Library District. This event is free and open to the public.
Please RSVP
Facebook Event
Please distribute this event flyer widely and post it everywhere you can at DuPage County coffeehouses, grocery stores, libraries, etc.
For more information contact [[URL REDACTED]], 630-835-7358.
###  Tuesday, February 25th, Carbondale: Honduras: Humanitarian Crisis as U.S. Policy, 6:30-8:00 p.m., Carbondale Township Hall, 217 E. Main St., Carbondale.
Please note: This is a change of venue from that of our usual fourth Tuesday program, to accommodate an anticipated larger than usual audience. To enter the meeting hall, please use the BACK ENTRANCE, off the alleyway parallel to Monroe Street; parking also available off Monroe.
Two speakers from Honduras will share their personal experiences of the aftermath of the 2009 military coup and 2017 electoral fraud that have profoundly damaged human rights in Honduras.
Americans often hear of the crisis at the border, without understanding how U. S. policy contributes to the flow of migrants seeking safety outside their beloved countries. This program will feature a live video talk with Miguel Angel Giron, a Honduran activist forced to flee after fellow organizers were murdered. Giron led a migrant caravan through Mexico, applied for asylum in the U.S. and was detained for 8 months before being granted asylum. He will explain the ongoing situation in Honduras and help Americans learn how U.S. policy effects fair elections and human rights in his country, fueling the migrant crisis.
Refreshments will be provided; the program is open and free to the public. Sponsors include Shawnee Green Party, Peace Coalition of Southern Illinois & Southern Illinois Immigrant Rights Project. Facebook event page here. Please share!
Reminders/Ongoing:
* Please sign and share this petition calling upon Governor Pritzker “to use his authority as governor of Illinois to impose an immediate ban on the granting of all new drilling permits for oil and natural gas that use any and all forms of hydraulic fracturing.”
* Please support the Embassy Protectors Defense Committee. The four embassy protectors arrested for protecting the Venezuelan embassy go to trial this week, after the court ruled that they cannot present a defense based on the fact that they were in the embassy with the express authorization of the Venezuelan government. Please read – and share – this article, to spread awareness of this injustice.

## Illinois Greens Score Major Victory in Lawsuit!
Justice is something for which we constantly struggle but only occasionally obtain in the U.S. legal system. Once in a while, though, we get a measure of it. And we are pleased to announce that this just occurred in the lawsuit we recently filed in federal court in the Northern District of Illinois.
As explained in our last newsletter, Illinois has among the most repressive ballot access laws in the nation, requiring so-called “new” parties to gather 25,000 petition signatures from registered voters, in just 90 days, in order to get their candidates’ names on the November ballot. We have achieved that monumental task a number of times in the last 20 years. However, the public-health measures now in place in response to the COVID-19 pandemic made petitioning virtually impossible.
Accordingly, on April 2nd, the Illinois Green Party joined with the Libertarian Party of Illinois and two independent candidates seeking ballot access in a lawsuit filed against Illinois governor J.B. Pritzker and the Illinois State Board of Elections. The lawsuit sought emergency injunctive relief from the petitioning requirement during the 2020 election cycle.
Thanks to great legal work by attorneys Oliver Hall of the Center for Competitive Democracy and Ohio attorney Mark Brown (with an assist by our own Scott Summers), we not only persuaded the court, but even the defendants, that the petitioning requirements were unconstitutional under the current conditions. After some negotiating, the parties came to an agreement that was entered into this preliminary injunction order, accompanying an opinion and order by Judge Rebecca R. Pallmeyer, explaining the legal basis for the injunction.
The highlights of the preliminary injunction order are as follows:
* The portions of the Election Code requiring hard copy petition signatures are enjoined (suspended) for this election cycle.
* Candidates for the Green and Libertarian parties shall qualify for placement on the ballot for each office in which they had previously placed candidates on the ballot in 2018 or 2016, without having to submit any petition signatures. This covers our candidates for our presidential ticket, as well as our U.S. Senate candidate, Rockford attorney David F. Black. Three independent candidates will also qualify for the ballot based on their past ballot access status.
* Other Green, Libertarian, new party or independent candidates may qualify for the ballot by submitting petition signatures equal to 10 percent of the usual legal requirement, by an extended filing deadline of August 7th. Electronic petition signatures, using a finger or computer mouse or stylus (similar to what many merchants now use for credit card signatures) will be accepted for this purpose.
“This is a great legal victory, not only for the Green and Libertarian parties, but for the voters of Illinois, who have a right to cast their ballot for the candidates and parties of their choosing,” said Illinois Green Party co-chair Rich Whitney. “That right is ordinarily suppressed, and frequently denied altogether, by our state’s unfair ballot access laws. Ironically, the extraordinary conditions created by the pandemic both required and permitted the administrators of that unfair system to do the right thing this one time. We were also fortunate enough to have a judge who clearly understood that the Constitution required the granting of this relief.”
As a result, our presidential candidate, who will either be longtime New York Green Howie Hawkins or Ohio Green Dario Hunter, will appear on the November ballot, giving Illinois voters a badly needed alternative to the dismal and nauseating choices presented by the two corporatist/war machine parties, as will our Senate candidate Black, about whom you will learn more in an upcoming newsletter.
It also means that Murphysboro Green Josh Hellmann will be able to return to the ballot, joining Whitney as a candidate for Jackson County Board. This is in addition to our excellent candidates running for the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District (MWRD) of Greater Chicago and other candidates already on the ballot in jurisdictions where we are recognized as an established party. The Green Party may be able to field a few additional candidates under the terms of the injunction; watch our newsletters for future announcements.

## Can you help an ally in the cause of peace?
There are only so many publishers of reliable news and information these days, and even fewer that provide reliable information on the peace and environmental movements, and on the wars, arms races and environmental hazards that make these movements so vitally necessary. One of these publishers is Nukewatch, which has been providing valuable reporting on the related threats posed by nuclear weapons and nuclear power since 1979.
Funding is always a challenge for organizations and publications that stand for social progress – including the Green Party – even in the best of times. Under the current conditions, just as millions of workers are struggling to make ends meet, so are many of these organizations, including Nukewatch. We recently learned from one of our members that Nukewatch is now in especially dire straits. Please take a look at this excellent resource, and if you can see your way clear to help out with a small donation, please consider doing so.
## Chapters meetings going virtual
While in-person Green Party meetings and events remain on hiatus for obvious reasons, our chapters are learning to adapt by conducting video and/or phone conference calls. If you reside in or near one of our chapters, and haven’t yet gotten involved or been involved lately, you are encouraged to connect with them as we forge ahead into campaign 2020. Here are just a few of the upcoming “virtual” meetings scheduled:
The next meeting of the 50th Ward Green Party will be held via teleconference on Sunday, May 3, at 1:00 p.m. Please contact George Milkowski at [[URL REDACTED]] or call 773-262-7026 if you would like to attend this meeting.
The Dupage Greens will meet Wednesday, May 13th, 7-8:30pm, via online Video/Audio Conference. Facebook event here.
The Shawnee Green Party (Southern Illinois) will have a virtual meeting on Wednesday, May 13th at 6:30 p.m.; contact [[URL REDACTED]] if you do not receive notice by the list-serve.

“We must recognize that we can’t solve our problem now until there is a radical redistribution of economic and political power… this means a revolution of values and other things. We must see now that the evils of racism, economic exploitation and militarism are all tied together… you can’t really get rid of one without getting rid of the others… the whole structure of American life must be changed. America is a hypocritical nation and [we] must put [our] own house in order.”
Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., Report to SCLC Staff, May 1967.
[[URL REDACTED]]
As we commemorate the life and struggles of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., today, we are once again called upon to recognize the difference between the “sanitized” version of Dr. King that is generally presented to us in the corporate media and the activist for peace, justice and redistribution of wealth that he was in real life. The corporate media like to focus on his faith, commitment to non-violence in the face of oppression, his “I Have a Dream” speech – and not much else. They certainly don’t want people to read or reflect upon his “Beyond Vietnam” address one year prior to his assassination or his other later works condemning militarism, war, and the societal structure that generates them.
The corporate usurpers of King’s legacy would not want people to recognize how that legacy has been co-opted and perverted by the corporate-sponsored political parties, as Glen Ford, executive editor of Black Agenda Report, explains in this incisive, no-punches-pulled essay.
As a political party dedicated to ending racism and all forms of oppression, economic exploitation, militarism and war, the Green Party provides a vehicle for carrying on Dr. King’s work on the political field, uncorrupted by corporate money and influences. We are active in the peace movement, active in the environmental movement, active in numerous causes seeking a just redistribution of wealth and an end to poverty, privation and prejudice.
But we also want to move beyond mere protest. We seek to advance these causes by campaigning for and winning government office. We want to use the power of the state to serve the public good, not the interests of a small class of profiteers whose system is causing so much death and destruction.
We have a lot to accomplish in 2020. If you have not already done so, please join our party and get involved in our efforts to accomplish these goals.
## This Saturday: No war on Iran! U.S. out of Iraq!
U.S. aggression against Iran threatens to begin yet another disastrous, bloody war. The U.S. has declined for now to carry out further military strikes against Iran, but the imposition of even harsher U.S. imposed sanctions is an economic war that will claim the lives of thousands of Iranians. The people of the world must fight back and demand: No war on Iran! U.S. out of Iraq!
On Saturday, January 25, actions across the world will oppose a new war. Now is the time for all those opposed to war to speak up. Please join us.
In Chicago: Saturday, Jan. 25th from Noon–3:00 p.m.

Remember: You have to be a dues-paying member of the party to participate in decision-making, so if you have not yet joined, this would be a good time to take care of that task.

## Upcoming Events:
Tuesday, January 28th, Carbondale: The Case for Banning Throwaway Plastics, The Varsity Center Exhibition Room, 418 S. Illinois Ave., Carbondale, 6:30-8 p.m.
Despite being one of the most pervasive materials on the planet, plastic and its impact on human health is poorly understood. Yet exposures to plastic are expanding into new areas of the environment and food chain as existing plastic products fragment into smaller particles and concentrate toxic chemicals. As plastic production increases, this exposure will only grow.
Our basic thesis is that we must move beyond extremely problematic efforts to recycle plastics and move toward a major phase-out of plastics, especially the incredible quantities of throwaway plastics currently overwhelming the eco-system. We will have a brief presentation and sharing of materials followed by a discussion on how to move forward, locally and otherwise.
Tuesday, Feb. 4th, Carbondale: 2020 Margie Parker Teach-In for Peace
Carbondale Civic Center, 200 S. Illinois Ave. Carbondale. 6:00 P.M. Social Hour catered by Cristaudo’s, Presentation about Poor People’s Campaign: A National Call for Moral Revival.

## The Green Party: Leading the way on social progress
“Marijuana should be legalized, though its legal use should be restricted to adults.”
That’s what the very first platform of the Illinois Green Party declared – in March 2000. As Illinoisans get ready to celebrate the legalization of recreational cannabis in Illinois in 2020, it bears recalling that Greens were pushing for this 20 years ago. Marijuana legalization was a mainstay of Rich Whitney’s 2006 Green Party campaign for governor, and the calls for legalization, decriminalization of drug offenses generally, and other sweeping criminal justice reforms have been central to many Green campaigns ever since then.
It took the corporate political parties nearly 20 more years of pressure and persuasion to finally come around to that common-sense position (and the bill signed into law still had its shortcomings). They were too beholden to the covert racism of the “war on drugs” and the influence of the prison-industrial complex to end prohibition of cannabis. They finally came around only when the crushing costs of maintaining the system of mass incarceration helped push them into it.
That same first platform of the ILGP also called for “universal entitlement for all residents to comprehensive health care benefits including preventive, curative, rehabilitative and long-term care,” through “single-payer health insurance, publicly administered and funded, delivered by a non-profit system.” Today, of course, the demand for “improved Medicare for all” is supported by a strong majority of the American people and is grudgingly making headway even within the Democratic Party (albeit painstakingly slow and with innumerable efforts to water it down) against the powerful health insurance lobby and its allies. Once again, the Green Party was way ahead of the curve.
We also called for the passage of living wage laws – a forerunner of today’s “fight for 15.”
There hasn’t been very much social progress in the U.S. in recent years – there has been a lot more regress – but where progress has occurred, the Green Party has been on the cutting edge. Consider marriage equality. In 2004, Jason West, the Green Party mayor of New Paltz, New York, performed the first “out” gay and lesbian marriages, despite being charged with a criminal offense for doing so. He stated at the time: “Just wait 10 or 20 years and this will be normal.”
We have been in the forefront of the struggle for ballot integrity and fairer voting systems like ranked choice voting – now slowly but surely coming into use at the state and local level.
We have long been among the loudest voices sounding the alarm on the climate crisis, and the broader environmental crisis (now recognized as a mass extinction event) from our very inception. Though some try to downplay it, the concept of the Green New Deal came from the Green Party. In December 2005, in accepting the Greens nomination for governor, Rich Whitney declared: “I will fight for a ‘New Deal’ for sustainable energy development in Illinois.” The comprehensive federal Green New Deal proposal of the Green Party also greatly predates the watered down version now promoted by some Democrats. And we are still the only party that recognizes the central importance of putting an end to U.S. militarism and war if we are to win the struggle for a healthy eco-system.
We could cite a number of other examples of how we understood, long ago, the direction society had to go in order to create a better future for humankind and all life on the planet.
So why does the Green Party consistently lead the way on social progress? First, the Green Party is based on values and principles – our Ten Key Values. Most Democratic and Republican candidates are political prostitutes for the plutocracy, trying to appeal to voters with sloganeering, bombast and appeals to emotion.
Second, the Green Party and its candidates categorically reject corporate campaign funding and financial support, direct and indirect. We run to serve the good of the people, the working class and the underserved, not corporate profiteers. We are not for sale and cannot be bought. We are serious about building a government of, by, and for the people, not government to the highest bidder.
Third, the Green Party is a movement-based party. We are involved in the day-to-day struggles of the peace, environmental, labor, human rights and social justice movements, the movements for single-payer health care, eco-socialism and a solidarity economy, education and tax reform in Illinois, the growing movement for monetary reform – and much more. We aspire to represent these movements on the electoral field, so our platform is informed by these movements.
The failings of our social system and government today are not due to a lack of solutions. For the most part, we know what the solutions are, because these movements have already done the work of figuring out how to solve the problems they are struggling against. What is lacking is not solutions but the political will to implement them.
That is why it is so vitally important to support the one political party that uncompromisingly stands up for those movements, the one party that stands firmly for genuine social progress. If the people leave politics to the powerful few, the powerful few will continue to dominate.
2020 will be an important year for the Illinois Green Party. At the top of the ticket, we face the monumental task of getting our presidential and VP candidate on the ballot, in a state with one of the most oppressive ballot access laws in the country. At the local level, we have some outstanding candidates running for The Metropolitan Water Reclamation District in Cook County, and we expect to run a number of competitive campaigns for county office in Southern Illinois and elsewhere.
We can make some breakthroughs in 2020 – but we need your help to do it. A political party is only as strong as its members make it, by what they do or fail to do. Here are some things you can do to make 2020 a banner year for the Green Party:
1. Become a duespaying member of the Illinois Green Party. Becoming a duespaying member is a requirement for participating in our decision-making. For “us” to succeed, you need to be an active part of “us.” We are not asking a lot – standard dues are just $60 a year, and only $12 a year for persons of low-income – but we do ask you to make this modest contribution to help our efforts to build a better future for all Illinoisans.
2. Support our statewide petition drive for ballot access. We’ve done it before, but it is always a huge uphill climb to collect at least 50,000 signatures from registered voters. We will have more details forthcoming as we get closer to the March 24, 2020 start date. Your volunteering to collect at least a few signatures is critical to our success. Meanwhile, you can help us get a head start by donating to our ballot access fund, to help us supplement our volunteer efforts with paid petitioners.
3. Get involved! Think about running for local office or volunteering for a campaign. Help promote and participate in Green Party events. Contact us, either through your nearest chapter, or by contacting [[URL REDACTED]]
Here’s to building a stronger Green Party, and winning some more races, in 2020!

The two corporate parties never make it easy for Greens to get on the ballot, and Illinois has some of the worst ballot access laws in the nation. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic hit, it was extremely difficult for third-party candidates to satisfy the high petition-signature requirements that the duopoly parties had established to qualify for the November ballot. After the pandemic, it went from extremely difficult to impossible -- until the Green and Libertarian parties successfully sued state officials to lower those requirements and allow electronic petitioning in this election cycle.
Even after our legal victory, it was still quite a challenge to meet the lower requirements. But thanks to a lot of hard work by our candidates and volunteers, voters in Illinois will be able to cast a ballot on November 3rd for candidates who stand for real social progress -- not just for President and U.S. Senate, but, in many parts of the state, Congress, State Rep and local candidates as well.
Here is a list of the Green Party candidates that will be on the November 3,2020 ballot:
*     * Howie Hawkins for President of the U.S.
* Angela Walker for Vice President of the U.S.
* David F. Black for U.S. Senate (IL)
* Thomas Wilda for Congress (IL-5) - parts of Cook and DuPage Counties
* State Representative
* Christopher Kruger for State Representative (IL-17) - parts of Cook County
* Anna Schiefelbein for State Representative (IL-85) - parts of DuPage and Will Counties
* Randy Auxier for State Representative (IL-115) - parts of Jackson, Jefferson, Perry, Union, and Washington Counties
* Metropolitan Water Reclamation District (MWRD) of Greater Chicago - Cook County
* Tammie Felicia Vinson
* Troy Antonio Hernandez
* Rachel Wales
* Jackson County Board
* Joshua Hellmann \- District 3
* Rich Whitney \- District 4
* Charlie Howe \- District 6
* Jessica Bradshaw for Jackson County Circuit Clerk - all of Jackson County, IL
* Rich Giovanoni for Niles Township Green Party Committeeperson, Cook County
More information on the candidates can be found at [[URL REDACTED]]
In addition, we expect the following two candidates for state representative to appear on the ballot, pending the outcome of objections filed by persons seeking to protect the duopoly candidates. We are optimistic that we will defeat the objectors and give voters a real choice in these races as well:
* Alia Sarfraz for State Representative (IL-52) - parts of Cook, Kane, Lake, and McHenry Counties
* John Keating for State Representative (IL-96) - Christian, Macon, and Sangamon Counties
IN OTHER NEWS . . .
* The Green Party US Presidential Nominating Convention was held on July 11, 2020 virtually. Howie Hawkins, of New York, and Angela Walker, of South Carolina, were nominated as the Green Party US Presidential and Vice Presidential Candidates, having received 210 of 355 delegate votes cast at the convention. Howie and Angela, who are also the Socialist Party USA nominees, are running on a platform of an Ecosocialist Green New Deal.
To learn more about Howie and Angela you can visit [[URL REDACTED]] or tune in for their weekly livstream, every Tuesday night at 7:00 PM CDT. Streaming on Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Periscope, and Twitch.
* The Wisconsin Green Party is in their petition drive to get Howie Hawkins and Angela Walker on the ballot. The signatures are due August 4th. If anyone is interested in going to Wisconsin for petitioning, they are offering to pay $1 per valid physical signature. Volunteers are welcomed.

## Join Us in Chicago Saturday!
Last call and reminder: The Illinois Green Party’s 2020 Spring Convention and membership meeting will take place on Saturday, February 29, 2020, from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. at the Third Unitarian Church, 301 N. Mayfield, Chicago, Illinois. For those taking public transit, the Church is just a few short blocks away from either the Central or the Austin stops on the CTA Green Line.
The meeting will be followed by a social hour from 5:00-6:00 pm, and a presidential forum, featuring recognized Green Party candidates for president of the United States, at 6:00 p.m. The forum will feature Green Party US Recognized Candidates Howie Hawkins, Dario Hunter, and David Rolde. More information about the candidates can be found here.
The day will be capped off by a fundraising dinner for the Illinois Green Party at 7:30. Thanks to the generosity of the Cook County Green Party, our fundraising dinner will be a home-cooked meal/potluck. This will keep our admission prices low: The suggested donation is just $20 a plate; $10 for low income; children under 12 free. You can purchase advance tickets here.
The dinner will include a silent auction, so if you can donate a suitable item of value for the silent auction, that would be greatly appreciated.
The convention itself will be mostly focused on party business, including proposed amendments to our by-laws, election of officers and Green National Committee reps, planning for our 2020 petition drive and campaigns, and more. The proposed agenda and other details of the meeting may be found here.

## Reminder: If you plan on running as a Green in 2020, you cannot vote in the Democratic or Republican primary.
Illinois’ byzantine and oppressive ballot access laws often cause confusion but one thing is clear: If you, or someone you know, plans on running for public office as a Green in 2020, such as for county office (which we are encouraging!), you cannot vote in the March 17th primary election for another political party. You also cannot vote in the Democratic or Republican primary if you wish to be one of our presidential electors (whose names will appear on the statewide petition).
We get it: Some Greens may be tempted to jump on board the Bernie bandwagon (despite serious concerns that, among other things, he may not be quite the peace candidate that some think he is) for just this one vote. Or they may want to cast a protest vote, or perhaps support another particular candidate running for a different office in a corporate party primary. Needless to say, as a voice of the Illinois Green Party, this newsletter cannot countenance doing so, but neither are we looking to castigate those who make that choice.
But do be aware that if you vote in the primary of another political party, Illinois law considers you a “member” of that party for that election cycle, and, therefore, you cannot turn around and proclaim yourself a candidate, or an elector, of our political party.
You will still be able to sign the ballot access petitions of our candidates. You can – and should – still circulate petitions for our candidates. You can – and should – still vote Green in the general election. You could still run as a Green Party candidate in future election cycles. But you would be legally prohibited from running as a Green Party candidate or serving as an elector in 2020.
## Help Wanted: Ballot Access Coordinator
The Illinois Green Party seeks a Ballot Access Coordinator to help manage our petition drive to get our presidential and U.S. Senate candidates on the November ballot. This is projected to be a half-time (20 hour per week) paid position. For more details, please see this link. Interested candidates should send a cover letter and resume to: [[URL REDACTED]]
## Our 2020 ballot-access drive is coming up fast. Please help us hit the ground running!
Due to the ridiculously unfair ballot access laws in Illinois, it is a major ordeal to get our candidates on the ballot, especially for national or statewide office. But you can help us get off to a great start by volunteering to help out, donating to our ballot access fund, and/or pledging to sign our petition when the petitioning period begins. If every Illinois voter receiving this newsletter made a commitment to sign our petition, we could meet over 20 percent of our goal right off the bat!
For more information on the ballot access drive and to learn how you can help, please visit our Ballot Access 2020 information page.

## There is a peace movement in the U.S. – and we’re a big part of it.
Some commentators, even on the left, lament that there is no peace movement in the U.S. – but there is. The problem is that the corporate media like to pretend it does not exist. They deliberately ignore it, almost never present its spokespersons or report their statements and rarely cover its actions. But the peace movement is active, working hard to educate Americans about the predatory and destructive nature of U.S. foreign policy, the military-industrial complex and the national security state, demand an end to the “forever wars” that Congress keeps funding, and confront officeholders and candidates with that demand.
As with so many other movements for progress in the U.S. today, there are more of us doing this work than we are led to believe.
One of the organizations leading the peace movement today is UNAC – the United National Antiwar Coalition. The Illinois Green Party is a member of UNAC. Check out its website and its blog-site to help keep current on the peace movement in the U.S.
## Upcoming Events:
March 13 – 15, International Days of Action Against Sanctions and Economic War. There will be actions conducting in the U.S. and elsewhere protesting the crimes against humanity known as economic sanctions. Illinois actions TBA. For general information, visit: [[URL REDACTED]]
Reminders/Ongoing:
* Please sign and share this petition calling upon Governor Pritzker “to use his authority as governor of Illinois to impose an immediate ban on the granting of all new drilling permits for oil and natural gas that use any and all forms of hydraulic fracturing.”

As previously announced, the Illinois Green Party’s 2020 Spring Convention and membership meeting will take place on Saturday, February 29, 2020, from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. at the Third Unitarian Church, 301 N. Mayfield, Chicago, Illinois.

Three important updates:
First, for members (and persons ready to join) -- there will be some proposed amendments to our by-laws on the agenda. You can view the proposed amendments here. Most of the amendments are aimed at re-structuring the party to give the Coordinating Committee greater decision-making authority and responsibilities between membership meetings.
Second, we will be having a silent auction at our fundraising dinner, so if you can donate a suitable item of value for the silent auction, that would be greatly appreciated.
Third, thanks to the generosity of the Cook County Green Party, our fundraising dinner will be a home-cooked meal/potluck. This will keep our admission prices low: Suggested donation of just $20 a plate; $10 for low income; children under 12 free. If you are a local member or supporter who would like to help out with a dish or other contribution to the dinner (or beer or wine for the social hour), please contact Rita Maniotis, at [[URL REDACTED]]
It will be a full day, but a great opportunity to meet and network with Greens from around the state who are making a difference in their communities, including local officeholders, candidates and activists working for peace, economic security and equality, universal health care, climate justice and much more.
The business meeting will have a pretty full agenda, as we discuss petition planning and strategizing for campaign 2020, election of officers, amendments to our by-laws, possible selection of a U.S. Senate candidate, selection process for our presidential ticket – and more. Please mark your calendars now, and plan on joining us that day.
The finalized agenda will be released as soon as possible. However, it will be a full-day conference, so if you plan on attending the business meeting, please try to arrive a little early to register and be ready to go at 9.

Tuesday, February 25th, Carbondale: Honduras: Humanitarian Crisis as U.S. Policy, 6:30-8:00 p.m., Carbondale Township Hall, 217 E. Main St. Please note: This is a change of venue from that of our usual fourth Tuesday program, to accommodate an anticipated larger than usual audience. To enter the meeting hall, please use the BACK ENTRANCE, off the alleyway parallel to Monroe Street; parking also available off Monroe.
Two speakers from Honduras will share their personal experiences of the aftermath of the 2009 military coup and 2017 electoral fraud that have profoundly damaged human rights in Honduras.

This program will feature a live video talk with Miguel Angel Giron, a Honduran activist forced to flee after fellow organizers were murdered. Giron led a migrant caravan through Mexico, applied for asylum in the U.S. and was detained for 8 months before being granted asylum. He will explain the ongoing situation in Honduras and help Americans learn how U.S. policy effects fair elections and human rights in his country, fueling the migrant crisis.
Refreshments will be provided; the program is open and free to the public. Sponsors include Shawnee Green Party, Peace Coalition of Southern Illinois & Southern Illinois Immigrant Rights Project.
March 13 – 15, International Days of Action Against Sanctions and Economic War. There will be actions conducting in the U.S. and elsewhere protesting the crimes against humanity known as economic sanctions. Illinois actions TBA. For general information, visit: [[URL REDACTED]]
