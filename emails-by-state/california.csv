"President Trump's approval at an all time high
March 26, 2020
222 Days Until the November Election
Hello,
In the late hours of the night, President Trump and the Republicans were able to defeat the Democrats' attempt to hijack the Coronavirus stimulus relief bill that is critical to helping every American. Under President Trump's leadership, the stimulus will stabilize industries, provide small business relief and get cash to American families.
President Trump's approval rating is at an all time high. To top it off, an overwhelming majority of Americans approve of the President’s management of the Coronavirus crisis. President Trump is keeping America safe!

"President Trump was on FIRE tonight
September 29, 2020
35 Days Until the November Election
Hello,
President Trump was on FIRE tonight during the first Presidential Debate against incompetent Sleepy Joe Biden.
He just finished an incredible debate, perhaps his best debate EVER. It was a great and triumphant moment for our Country and Republicans across the Nation. He delivered a unifying message and reminded us that he will ALWAYS put America First, unlike Sleepy Joe.
We know the Fake News Media will only report LIES about his historic debate performance and how STRONG our movement is, which is why we were really disappointed to see that you chose not to step up and help make this our BEST fundraising day EVER.
You’ve always been one of our best supporters, so we’re going to give you ONE MORE CHANCE to get on the donor list and show President Trump your support.
Please contribute $20 to get at the top of the Presidential Debate Donor List by 11:59 PM TONIGHT, and your gift will be 8X MATCHED. >>

"Democrats never live by the rules they set for the rest of us
September 4, 2020
60 Days Until the November Election
Hello,
Nancy Pelosi got caught getting her hair done WITHOUT A MASK. Now Negligent Nancy is saying she was SET UP by the hair salon. Do the American people really think the SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE can be set up so easily?
Send Nancy a Hair Dryer >>
Nancy Pelosi’s favorite saying MUST be ‘Do as I say, but not as I do.’ Democrats never live by the rules they set for the rest of us.
Those rules don’t apply for the Liberal Elite like Nancy Pelosi.
Churches who exercise their First Amendment rights have had their leases revoked. You can’t get your hair done, eat inside at a restaurant, travel, or even attend a funeral. The Democrats love control.
Contribute TODAY and we will send Nancy Pelosi a hairdryer with a note from you expressing your disdain for her HYPOCRISY.

"It’s going to take EVERY Patriot stepping up if we want to DEFEAT radical Hidin' Joe Biden and Phony Kamala Harris’s dreams
September 15, 2020
49 Days Until the November Election
Hello,
Hidin’ Joe Biden’s radical agenda is an existential THREAT to millions of American jobs.
Not only is Biden willing to sacrifice jobs for the Green New Deal, but he's also guaranteed an end to fossil fuels. Hidin’ Biden is also on the record multiple times calling for a ban on coal and fracking.
It’s not just energy sector workers who would be harmed by Hidin’ Joe Biden’s agenda. Manufacturing workers have Joe Biden to blame for their industry’s job losses: 60,000 American factories and approximately 3.5 million jobs were lost after he helped China get into the World Trade Organization.
Hidin’ Biden's presidency would be a threat to America.
President Trump is a champion for America’s energy independence and American workers, but Hidin’ Biden is actively campaigning on an agenda that would defeat American workers. The choice is clear.
The Election is just under 2 MONTHS AWAY, and we need our best supporters to step up to the front lines as we head into November. With your help, we want to send a message to remind Hidin' Joe Biden that WE WILL PROTECT AMERICAN WORKERS. Contribute $25 TODAY and your donation will be 5X MATCHED.

We need you right now, friend. It’s going to take EVERY Patriot stepping up if we want to DEFEAT radical Hidin' Joe Biden and Phony Kamala Harris’s dreams of turning America into a BIG GOVERNMENT SOCIALIST Nation.
Are you with us?
Thank you,

"I'll be upfront with you, we are slightly behind on our June fundraising goal
June 18, 2020
138 Days Until the November Election
Hello,
I wanted to reach out to you today to talk to you about where we are in relation to the 2020 general election. We are just over 4 months out from the November election. November 3rd will be here before we know it and we really don't have any time to waste.
I'll be upfront with you, our June fundraising has been lagging. It is so important that we hit every single one of these monthly goals if we want to make sure we Republicans are victorious in November. We've had to adapt quite a bit to the current circumstances and these changes cost money.
Luckily we have loyal Republicans like you, friend. If you could contribute just $10 today, we can get back on track to meet this June fundraising goal. It's a known fact that California Democrats will outspend us this cycle, so this makes it even more important that we hit this goal.

"Nancy Pelosi is one of the most vocal supporters of keeping the American businesses and economy closed
September 3, 2020
61 Days Until the November Election
Hello,
Did you happen to see Nancy Pelosi's new haircut? That's right, footage was just released of Nancy Pelosi walking into a salon to get a haircut. Hairdressers in San Fransisco haven't been able to operate indoors for almost 6 months, but apparently Nancy Pelosi can just walk right in. The hypocrisy.
Nancy Pelosi is one of the most vocal supporters of keeping American businesses and the economy closed. Democrats, like Pelosi, have made exceptions to the rules time and time again. During the pandemic, Democrats have literally thrown Americans in jail for opening their salons and gyms. Even the owner of the salon said, ""It was a slap in the face that she went in, you know, that she feels that she can just go and get her stuff done while no one else can go in."" To top this whole ordeal off, PELOSI HAD HER MASK AROUND HER NECK.
This type of leadership is WRONG for California. Push back against Nancy Pelosi and contribute $35 today.

Hello,
Californians are struggling under King Newsom’s reign. Businesses’ doors shut. Children not allowed to go to school. Thousands filing for unemployment. This is all we can expect from King Newsom and his Democrat cronies. Does it bring him joy to watch California collapse under his rule?
KING NEWSOM needs to be stopped. If we gather all of our passionate PATRIOTS like you, friend, we are confident we can end his tyrannical rule over hardworking Californians.
Send a Message to King Newsom
California used to be a beautiful and thriving state, but with King Newsom, it is in shambles. Are you as tired of it as we are?
We NEED your input. Please tell KING NEWSOM enough is enough. Californians want their freedoms and state back.
TELL KING NEWSOM NO

Hello,
Now, more than ever before, the California Trailblazers NEED your support.
“The California Trailblazers Program is essential in the effort to revitalize California as it identifies and trains candidates throughout our state who are committed to the principles of efficient and accountable government, personal initiative, and free enterprise.
I’m impressed with the candidates Trailblazers recruits every election cycle as they continue to work tirelessly to better our local communities. I believe these leaders will provide the new and innovative ideas that our state needs.” - House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy
The goal of the California Trailblazers is simple:

CAGOP
END OF QUARTER DEADLINE
Hello,
I have good news and bad news.
Let's start with the bad news:
TONIGHT is the end of our September End-of-Quarter fundraising deadline, and we are 91 contributions short. We are still working around the clock here at the CAGOP, but we are just 91 donations short of our fundraising goal, and I noticed that you hadn't donated yet.
CONTRIBUTE TODAY
My team just informed me that all donations made by MIDNIGHT would be 8X matched. That means even the smallest donation can help us reach our goal and take the fight to the Democrats in November, which is less than 40 days away. This November will be the most expensive election ever, and we must be prepared to take on the RADICAL California Democrats. We can't do it without you, friend.

"It’s going to take all hands on deck if we’re going to give Republicans the resources they need to FIGHT BACK
September 23, 2020
41 Days Until the November Election
Hello,
There is a vacancy on the Supreme Court and President Trump is committed to filling it. The RADICAL Democrats will stop at NOTHING to keep him from doing his job and are now threatening to IMPEACH him for filling the vacancy on the Supreme Court.
The President was elected to make decisions on behalf of the American People, one of which is filling the vacancy on the United States Supreme Court.
It’s going to take all hands on deck if we’re going to give Republicans the resources they need to FIGHT BACK against the lies coming from the Left and their Fake News media friends.
FILL THAT SEAT >>>
There are 41 days left until Election Day, and we only have one question for you, friend:
Who do you think President Trump should nominate for Supreme Court Justice?
TAKE THE POLL
We need input from our top PATRIOTS during this CRITICAL time.
Thank you,
Team Trump CA

She was elected as the State Chairman from Michigan in February of 2015. Ronna served as a Trump delegate and chaired the Michigan Delegation to the 2016 Republican National Convention.
She has served as a Precinct Delegate, as a District Committee Executive Member and State Committeewoman in Michigan and served as National Delegate to the Tampa Convention representing Michigan’s 11th District. In 2013, she served as Co-Chair for the Mackinac Leadership Conference and was appointed by Governor Rick Snyder to serve on the Board of Marriage and Family Therapists. In her local community of Northville, Ronna has served on land planning and public safety committees and is actively involved in her local PTA. She received her B.A. in English from Brigham Young University. Ronna is married to Patrick McDaniel and has two children, Abigail and Nash.
We are thrilled to have Chairwoman McDaniel come share her incredible story and winning strategy to help us continue taking the fight to the California Democrats, winning in 2020 and beyond, and continuing our path to the California Republican Comeback!

With a presence on over 2,000 high school and college campuses nationwide, 250,000 student members, and over 150 full-time staff, Turning Point USA is the largest and fastest growing conservative youth activist organization in the country.
At just 26-years-old, Charlie has appeared on CNBC, Fox News and FOX Business News over 600 times, is an editor-at-large at Newsweek, a regular columnist for [[URL REDACTED]], Breitbart, Washington Times, and The Hill, and was named to the Forbes “30 under 30” list.

Charlie's social media reaches over 100 million people per month and according to Axios, he is one of the ""top 10 most engaged"" Twitter handles in the world behind only President Trump among conservatives. Charlie is the host of “The Charlie Kirk Show”—which regularly ranks among the top news shows on Apple podcast charts—where Charlie delivers in-depth analysis of the modern political and cultural landscape, mixing in political philosophy and history with his signature campus activism alongside interviews with some of the most influential people of our time. Charlie is the author of recent New York Times best seller ""The MAGA Doctrine: The Only Ideas That Will Win the Future"" which was also a #1 Amazon best seller.
We are looking forward to hearing Charlie share his ideas about breaking molds and redefining the future of America’s conservatism!

Hello,
Over a week ago, Gavin Newsom moved California to the second stage of reopening the state. Now businesses like clothing stores, flower shops, and some manufacturers will be able to open their doors once again.
Many Californians have taken to the street to protest Newsom’s stay at home order. These protesters have demanded that Newsom reopens our state now. Others feel that we need to take things slowly, in phases.
We want to hear from you, Hello. Do you think Gavin Newsom should reopen California? Take the survey now.

"Republicans are more united than ever before and we are prepared to WIN big in November.
August 20, 2020
75 Days Until the November Election
Hello,
Sleepy Joe Biden couldn’t have picked a worse running mate. Kamala Harris is as FAR-LEFT as it gets.
Kamala Harris supports extreme policies including:
* Eliminating private health insurance
* The $93 trillion Green New Deal
* A massive tax hike on hardworking Americans
Statement from CAGOP Chairwoman Jessica Millan Patterson:
“Kamala Harris epitomizes the extremist far left. She has compared law enforcement to the KKK, wants to eliminate the private health insurance millions of families rely on and failed to keep California streets safe when it was her job to do so. Biden has chosen to cater to the far-left with this radical pick. In every single office she has held in San Francisco and statewide, Kamala Harris has failed Californians. Our nation deserves better than her out-of-touch radical policies.”
Protect President Trump >>>
Republicans are more united than ever before and we are prepared to WIN big in November. We know Joe Biden and Kamala Harris don’t stand a chance against President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence. Americans are tired of the RADICAL and extremist views on the left. It’s PATRIOTS vs. Socialism this November.
We need to know you are with us, friend. We are doing everything we can to protect our FREEDOMS and make sure President Trump is re-elected. We cannot let the Socialists win.

Enough is enough. Californians are ready to end King Newsom’s reign. It’s time to tell King Newsom you are tired of his control.

"I hope this letter finds you, your family and your neighbors safe and healthy
March 28, 2020
220 Days Until the November Election
###  Dear Convention Goer - Please see the message below sent earlier today to delegates from Chairwoman Patterson regarding the Spring Training Convention:
Dear California Republican Party Delegates,
I hope this letter finds you, your family and your neighbors safe and healthy. You are all in my thoughts daily, as we navigate this challenge together.
As I wrote to you earlier this week, the daily business of the CAGOP is moving forward despite this new reality. We are working hard to bring you new tools and direction on how to continue our important work as we all accept that these challenging conditions will probably be with us for longer than any of us had anticipated.
As you know, our Spring Training Convention has long been scheduled for May 1-3, 2020. Our Board of Directors met virtually this morning and voted overwhelmingly to cancel the Convention and ensure the safety of our delegates, leaders, speakers and guests. We look forward to seeing all of you at our next Convention in February 2021.
Convention Registrants
If you have registered for the convention and/or purchased tickets to any banquets and VIP receptions, your options are below:
* Donate the amount paid for registration/tickets as a contribution to the CRP to spend on efforts for the November 2020 election.
* Apply the amount paid for registration/tickets to registration/tickets for the February 2021 Convention.
* Request a refund for the amount paid for registration/tickets.
Please email [[URL REDACTED]] to let our team know how you’d like to proceed.
If you have reserved a hotel room under the California Republican Party room block at the Los Angeles Airport Marriott, you do not need to take any action. The hotel will automatically cancel your reservation at no penalty to you.
Convention Business
There are two important matters of business that were scheduled for our convention – the Initiatives Committee and the election of our National Committeeman and National Committeewoman. Our board decided that the Initiatives Committee will meet on a date to be determined, based on safety, health directives and other key factors. The committee will make a recommendation to our Executive Committee for their vote, as has been done during unique circumstances in the past. We will provide you with more information as the dates are confirmed.
The election of our National Committeeman and National Committeewoman will take place by mail-in ballot, using a process similar to how we elect our platform committee. We are exploring resources for giving the candidates the opportunity to present to you prior to the vote. More information will be provided to you on this process as it becomes finalized; however, this process must be completed before the Republican National Convention in August.
Thank you for your patience, dedication and understanding as our leadership and staff work diligently to ensure we can continue our important work while navigating the challenges faced by our unprecedented times. I sincerely believe that we will successfully continue on our path towards the California Republican Comeback because we have the vision, the candidates, the staff and the volunteers who are committed to improving California for decades to come.
Please let us know if you have any questions. Stay healthy, and until it is safe, please stay home.
Thank You,
Jessica Millan Patterson
Chairwoman, California Republican Party

Friend,
The Democrats won't stop crying about the impeachment trial. These very Democrats, led by Nancy Pelosi, have held back the articles of impeachment from the Senate for weeks! Didn't the Democrats also say impeaching President Trump was so very urgent?
Could this get more embarrassing for Pelosi? This impeachment sham has revealed the political ploy of the Democrats! The Democrats only agenda is to ATTACK President Trump and the Republicans.

"Here is how you can do your part
February 6, 2020
26 Days Until the March 3rd Primary Election
Hello,
Earlier this week, President Donald J. Trump gave a HISTORIC State of the Union Address. Talk about a TOTAL HOME RUN.
Under his leadership, our nation is on a “Great American Comeback.” President Trump is doing his part, are you?
Here is how you can play your part:
Sign-up to be a Trump Team Leader
As a Trump Team Leader, you will be one of the most important assets for the President in 2020 and all Republicans across California. Democrats and the Fake News will do whatever they can to take us down.
As one of President Trump’s MOST LOYAL supporters, sign-up to be a Trump Team Leader. Do you want to cement your name in history or sit on the sidelines? We need ALL hands on deck.
BE A TRUMP TEAM LEADER
At President Trump’s HISTORIC State of the Union Address, Nancy Pelosi ripped up her copy of President Trump’s Address. Pelosi didn’t just rip apart a HISTORIC document, but she ripped up America’s historically low unemployment, record economic growth, more secure borders, and EVEN a service member’s reunion with his family.
If we don’t help re-elect President Trump, Pelosi and FAR LEFT LIBERAL CRONIES will DESTROY everything that our President has worked so hard to achieve.
Now we need YOU to take the next step and join us to help defend our values. Will you join the fight and volunteer to become a Trump Team Leader?

END OF QUARTER DEADLINE
Hello,
We are approaching our end of quarter fundraising deadline and I see your name is still missing. Last week I told you we were lagging with our June fundraising, but I just wanted to check in and let you know how close we are to reaching our goal.
CONTRIBUTE TODAY
We are still working around the clock here at the CAGOP, but we are just 92 donations short of our fundraising goal and I noticed that you haven’t donated yet.
Contribute to EOQ>>
If just 92 supporters like you contribute any amount, we will meet our fundraising goal for the November 3rd Election so we can elect more California Republicans. We don’t have any time to waste if we want to defeat the radical Democrats who are ruining our beautiful state.
Luckily there is still time. Contribute just $10 to help us reach our goal.

"It’s going to take EVERY Patriot stepping up if we want to DEFEAT radical Hidin' Joe Biden and Phony Kamala Harris’s dreams
September 15, 2020
49 Days Until the November Election
Hello,
Hidin’ Joe Biden’s radical agenda is an existential THREAT to millions of American jobs.
Not only is Biden willing to sacrifice jobs for the Green New Deal, but he's also guaranteed an end to fossil fuels. Hidin’ Biden is also on the record multiple times calling for a ban on coal and fracking.
It’s not just energy sector workers who would be harmed by Hidin’ Joe Biden’s agenda. Manufacturing workers have Joe Biden to blame for their industry’s job losses: 60,000 American factories and approximately 3.5 million jobs were lost after he helped China get into the World Trade Organization.
Hidin’ Biden's presidency would be a threat to America.
President Trump is a champion for America’s energy independence and American workers, but Hidin’ Biden is actively campaigning on an agenda that would defeat American workers. The choice is clear.
The Election is just under 2 MONTHS AWAY, and we need our best supporters to step up to the front lines as we head into November. With your help, we want to send a message to remind Hidin' Joe Biden that WE WILL PROTECT AMERICAN WORKERS. Contribute $25 TODAY and your donation will be 5X MATCHED.
Contribute $10
Contribute $25 >>
Contribute $50
Contribute $75

We need you right now, friend. It’s going to take EVERY Patriot stepping up if we want to DEFEAT radical Hidin' Joe Biden and Phony Kamala Harris’s dreams of turning America into a BIG GOVERNMENT SOCIALIST Nation.
Are you with us?
Thank you,
Team Trump California

Hello,
The Supreme Court is under attack by the RADICAL Democrats. The Democrats want to DESTROY the Supreme Court with a SCHEME to pack justices.
Stand with Judge Amy Coney Barrett
The Radical Democrats' court-packing scheme would politicize the Supreme Court. We can't let that happen, friend.
Washington elites will not silence us. It's time to take our country back, and it starts with confirming Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court.
The Democrats are refusing to even meet with Judge Amy Coney Barrett. They cannot argue against her nomination on her merits or impeccable credentials; instead, they will resort to DISGRACEFUL personal attacks.
Please contribute $35 to the Supreme Court Defense Fund to help Republicans FIGHT against the Radical Democrats and get President Trump's nominee confirmed.

"Democrats cannot manage the integrity of our elections
May 11, 2020
176 Days Until the November Election
#  Special Election Alert
Patriot,
Governor Gavin Newsom and California Democrats, through a series of executive actions, keep changing the rules regarding our elections.
Now an additional in-person vote center was just opened in a heavily Democrat area of Los Angeles County just days before the Special Election - and when all signs point to a GOP victory, a brazen and a sudden attempt to influence the results.
We are days away from a Republican flipping a Democrat held congressional seat for the first time in over 20 years. This victory would also provide a key first step toward re-taking the House in 2020.
###  We need an emergency infusion of resources to maintain the integrity of this election and all elections this year.

Mike Garcia is in an excellent position to win in Congressional District 25, and California Democrats are doing everything in their power to stop him.

As the Field and Political Director for the CAGOP, it is my job to make sure our resources are used efficiently to elect Republicans. We currently have two extremely important special elections in Southern California. The ballots have dropped, and election day is just days away.

We can WIN both of these seats with your help.

We can’t rely just on the phone calls to get us to 51% on May 12th. We NEED more mailers, tv ads, and Facebook ads to ensure California Republicans VOTE in these elections. These all cost money…

"We're on a Path to Victory
CAGOP
END OF QUARTER DEADLINE
Hello,
I wanted to give you a brief update on some of our accomplishments from the last couple of months.
Just last month, we had two Special Election victories that have made waves across the country. For the first time in over 20 years, California Republicans flipped a Congressional seat. We were also able to hold the 28th Senate District with a double-digit lead. Loyal Republicans like you, friend, played such a huge role in last month's wins. We are feeling very optimistic going into the November General Election.
CONTRIBUTE TODAY
Along with the victories, we have had some intense battles in court over Gavin Newsom's unilateral power grabs. Newsom has continued to use the Coronavirus pandemic to shape the California election laws in favor of the Democrats. We promise to fight tooth and nail in court to defeat these unconstitutional Executive Orders.
Contribute to EOQ>>
We are just 4 months away from the 2020 General Election, and we have the opportunity to record more historic victories. Our massive volunteer effort is well underway, helping us persuade and turn out voters across the state. The CAGOP needs all the resources we can get our hands on to defeat as many Democrats as possible. I'm asking you to chip in just $20 before the June end of the quarter fundraising deadline. We are so close to hitting our fundraising goals this month, and you can get us over the line, friend.

"There’s one big exception that continues to put California voters at risk
CAGOP
End of the Month Deadline
Hello,
As we move forward together during this difficult time, it is so important that we continue to listen to health care officials and practice social distancing. Everyone has done a great job staying home to flatten the curve.
There’s one big exception that continues to put California voters at risk – Ballot Harvesting. Governor Newsom refuses to discourage Democratic operatives' ballot harvesting in the two special elections currently taking place in Southern California. The California Republican Party is suing Governor Newsom to stop ballot harvesting for California’s May 12 Special Elections.  Governor Newsom has been dodging his responsiblities on this issue. He and his fellow Democrats have no problem risking the safety and wellbeing of many Californians in the 25th Congressional District and the 28th Senate District.
CONTRIBUTE TODAY!
Ballot harvesting involves a campaign operative visiting a voter’s home and offering to return the voter’s ballot to elections officials. Because of the close personal contact involved, as well as the exchange of a document, this puts the voter and the ballot harvester at a much higher risk of spreading COVID-19. This is completely unacceptable.
Contribute Before the End of the Month Special Election Deadline
The CAGOP has prioritized the safety of California’s voters. In order for us to educate voters and ensure they return their own ballot, we have to make sure we can advertise as much as possible to voters in these two key districts.
Chip in $35 today before the End of the Month Special Election Deadline to help us WIN in Congressional District 25 and State Senate District 28!
Contribute $100

It is so important that we have a well-funded campaign to ensure victory in these two important districts.

#  Make Award Shows Great Again
Friend,
Remember when award shows were entertaining? Did you watch the Golden Globe Awards last night? Hollywood liberals have taken over the award shows and turned them into an opportunity for left-wing radicals to flood the airwaves with radical leftist propaganda.
Award shows have become a competition to see which uneducated Hollywood elite can be the most radical.
Make Award Shows Great Again
Do you think the Hollywood Liberals should make award shows political?

"We want to make sure we have as many registered Republicans as possible
April 11, 2020
206 Days Until the November Election
Hello,
While we are all focused on staying safe and healthy at home during this challenging time, we want to make sure we have as many Republicans’ voter registration up to date. We received dozens of phone calls in the days before the March primary election from Republicans whose voter registration was changed without their knowledge. We don’t want this to be an issue for anyone when it comes time to vote again in November, so please take the time to check your voter registration status.
CHECK VOTER STATUS
If, for any reason, you find you are not registered Republican, or your information is not up to date, please take the time and update your information now. If you want your ballot to be sent to you in the mail, you will also need to update your voter registration!
UPDATE VOTER REGISTRATION
Republicans up and down the state are counting on you, NAME, so take a few minutes to make sure your voter registration is up to date.
Please stay safe, stay healthy and stay home.

43 Days Until the November Election
Hello,
While the RADICAL Democrats and the Fake News media play politics with the Coronavirus, OUR President is doing whatever it takes to KEEP AMERICA SAFE.
Take the Poll Now
* Under President Trump, we will return to our unprecedented prosperity.
* The Trump campaign released a new ad highlighting President Trump as the Jobs President.
* In August:
* 1.4 million jobs were added back to the economy and the unemployment number dropped.
* The women’s unemployment rate decreased by 2%.
* The Black unemployment rate dropped 1.6%.
* The Hispanic American unemployment rate dropped 2.4%.
* The Asian American unemployment rate dropped 1.3%
* In the past 4 months, more than 10 million jobs have been added to the economy – nearly half the jobs lost during the global pandemic.
* President Trump’s efforts to protect American workers and businesses during the Coronavirus pandemic have clearly worked.
* Operation Warp Speed is close to delivering a Coronavirus vaccine, which will further help reopen the economy.
* Joe Biden would be the worst person to put in charge of the economy. It would immediately collapse under Biden and the Democrats.
* As Vice President, Biden presided over the worst recovery since the Great Depression.
The September Official Trump Approval Poll will be LIVE for the NEXT 24 HOURS. Make sure to submit your response as soon as possible.

Critical End of Month Deadline
Hello,
And it got me thinking about what a leap the California Republican Party has made since I arrived here 7 years ago.
We’ve had great teams here, you know them, Tanya, Fabian, Tate, they were here to help get Republicans elected up and down our great state.
CONTRIBUTE TODAY!
But the crew I have now, Krista, Elisa, Bryan, Janessa, Michael and all the others are the most dedicated team yet. They literally work 7 days a week raising money, training and recruiting volunteers, talking to voters and making sure we take the fight to the Democrats ever single day. Heck, this week they have been giving up their lunch hours to phone voters in legislative and congressional districts before Super Tuesday.
Contribute to EOM>>
I need your help to leap again. We need to hire field teams to get out there, to help take back Congress, get rid of the supermajority in Sacramento and to reelect the President.
March is the month I revise our budget and with your generosity today I can add in those new positions. Thank you for everything you have done, friend, I am in awe of the support we get from donors like you. I am committed to getting your gift right to work to help us win elections.

California Patriot,
Having become Chairwoman in February, we have accomplished so much this year.
We've guaranteed that the President will be on the ballot in California by successfully fighting SB27, the Sacramento Democrats' unconstitutional overreach.
Our digital engagement has hit new benchmarks. We've served over 20 million advertising impressions to 3.5 million California voters. We've sent over four times the number of emails than in 2018.
Our fundraising is ahead of schedule. We've had a 15% increase in major donor commitments, a 33% increase in small-donor donations and 1000% increase in online donations from 2018.
Despite these accomplishments, we are still outraised by our democrat counterparts, nearly 10-1.

Hello,
Today marks 233 years since the signing of the US Constitution. The Republican Party is fighting every day to preserve and UPHOLD the Constitution and values our founders fought to keep.
The future of our country is at stake because the RADICAL Democrats are attempting to turn America into a SOCIALIST country. We can’t let that happen, friend.
Protect America >>>
The Republican Party and President Trump are fighting to uphold our Constitution. We need our biggest PATRIOTS to step up right now. It’s going to take EVERY Patriot stepping up if we want to CRUSH Sleepy Joe Biden and Phony Kamala Harris’s dreams of turning America into a BIG GOVERNMENT, SOCIALIST Nation.
Rioters and looters continue to burn their way through cities and tear down our historical monuments. They are attempting to DESTROY our Constitution and Sleepy Joe supports them. Sleepy Joe Biden’s soft spot for rioters and radical socialists doesn’t bode well for the American people.
The November Election is less than 2 MONTHS AWAY. The choice is simple this November. The choice is between radical Socialists who want to destroy America or PATRIOTS who will FIGHT to preserve the GREATEST Nation on Earth.

Great news - I just got the green light to have all online donations 500% matched. This is an opportunity to have a HUGE impact with your contribution. If you have been thinking about helping elect Republicans, now is the time to do so. Opportunities like this do not come around very often.
Online donations are essential for many important programs we use to elect Republicans, like targeted ads and our voter contact efforts. Our historic victories last month would not have been possible without donations like yours. This election cycle is far from over and may be one of the most expensive in history, so we need all of the help we can get to defeat the liberal California Democrats. Chip in just $10 to have a $50 impact.

Hello,
Phony Kamala Harris is a career California politician. Her failed policies and legacy can be seen through our state and the formerly beautiful San Francisco. We can’t let her RUIN America like she’s ruined California.
For DECADES Phony Kamala’s liberal policies have hurt California’s hard-working families. Kamala SUPPORTS the idea of a national AB 5, the new California law, which kills independent contractor jobs. Kamala thinks AB 5 should go beyond California law. That would destroy MILLIONS of American jobs.
Harris supports extreme policies including:
* Eliminating private health insurance
* The $93 trillion Green New Deal
* A massive tax hike on hard-working Americans.
Kamala has FAILED California, and we can’t let her FAIL America. We are less than 2 MONTHS AWAY from the most CRITICAL election in the history of our country. It’s SOCIALISTS vs. PATRIOTS this November.

Just a couple of days ago, Senate Republicans threw out the Democrats' SHAM impeachment, and they haven't stopped whining about it. Petty Pelosi can't stand the fact that there will be four more years of President Trump's America!
Pelosi the Ripper can't keep playing games. It's time for the Democrats to work for the American people. President Trump and the Republicans have been doing their jobs. Republicans have employed more Americans, supported working families, and secured our border.
Now the do-nothing Democrats are talking about about impeaching President Trump AGAIN! Do YOU think the Democrats will vote to impeach President Trump?

"That California Republican Party will win again
California Republican Party
#  Welcome to the Party
Hi,
Thank you for signing up to volunteer with the California Republican Party. Grassroots supporters like you help spread our message and values to voters all across our state. I appreciate your support of our cause.
My name is Jessica Millan Patterson, and I am the Chairwoman of the California Republican Party. Our mission is very simple: elect Republicans to local, state and federal office.
It is so important that we build a ground game to compete with the democrats in 2020. Volunteers like you are vital to the future of the party.
I am a wife and mother of two. I am the daughter of proud Americans, both of whom worked day and night to make ends meet. During my early childhood, I was taught the valuable lessons of hard work, family values, freedom, and opportunity. While attending a California State University, I worked as a waitress on roller-skates to pay for my college education.
I started my path in politics working as an intern back when California was a Red state. Since that time, I have worked on campaigns for President, Governor, Congress, and the California State Legislature. My career has been focused on one goal – electing Republicans.
###  That is why I was inspired to run for Chairwoman of the California Republican Party, to help lead California back to being a Red state.
These principles have guided me as a mother, community servant, and most importantly, as an American. The rise of socialism threatens these very principles and ideals. A strong California Republican Party destroys the one party system our state has become, and hinders the far-left socialist agenda being pushed. We, as Republicans, have one very simple goal to execute: elect and re-elect Republicans in California.
It is with people like you who will help me on this mission. The Republican Party is not about one person, or one idea, but rather the deep rooted principles our founding fathers envisioned: life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
To help us accomplish our mission, you can get involved with the State Party. I hope you will find the best way you can get involved and help spread our message.
I look forward to engaging with you and growing this relationship, and I look forward to working towards our common goal: winning in the next election!
Thank You,
Jessica Millan Patterson
Chairwoman, California Republican Party

"The Supreme Court is under attack by the RADICAL Democrats
October 12, 2020
22 Days Until the November Election
Hello,
The Supreme Court is under attack by the RADICAL Democrats. The Democrats want to DESTROY the Supreme Court with a SCHEME to pack justices.
Stand with Judge Amy Coney Barrett
The Radical Democrats' court-packing scheme would politicize the Supreme Court. We can't let that happen, friend.
Washington elites will not silence us. It's time to take our country back, and it starts with confirming Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court.
The Democrats are refusing to even meet with Judge Amy Coney Barrett. They cannot argue against her nomination on her merits or impeccable credentials; instead, they will resort to DISGRACEFUL personal attacks.
Please contribute $35 to the Supreme Court Defense Fund to help Republicans FIGHT against the Radical Democrats and get President Trump's nominee confirmed.
Contribute $20
Contribute $35
Contribute $50
Contribute $75
Contribute $100
This is CRITICAL. Let's show President Trump we will stand by his side and support his nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett.
Thank you,

"Californians are sick and tired of the government overreach and corruption from KING NEWSOM and his Democrat cronies
October 10, 2020
24 Days Until the November Election
Hello,
Today is King Newsom’s birthday.
Here is our birthday WISH: We hope you spend less time this year chasing headlines and more time finding solutions to the problems caused by your RADICAL agenda.
SEND A MESSAGE >>>
While it's customary to give gifts to the one celebrating their birthday this year we wanted to focus on the ""gifts"" King Newsom has bestowed upon us: A backlog in unemployment claims, the highest poverty rate in the nation, out of control cost of living, and a homelessness crisis that has spiraled out of control.
Californians are sick and tired of the government overreach and corruption from KING NEWSOM and his Democrat cronies. Send King Newsom a birthday message. >>>
SEND A BIRTHDAY MESSAGE
Stand with us and join the California Comeback so we can put an END to King Newsom’s reign. We will put a stop to his tyrannical actions like stomping on our rights. It’s time to show them that REPUBLICANS are ready to take back our state this November.
Thank you,

#  WILL THE DEMOCRATS MOVE ON?
Hello,
Just a couple of weeks ago, Senate Republicans threw out the Democrats' SHAM impeachment, and they haven't stopped whining about it. Petty Pelosi can't stand the fact that there will be four more years of President Trump's America!
Pelosi the Ripper can't keep playing games. It's time for the Democrats to work for the American people. President Trump and the Republicans have been doing their jobs. Republicans have employed more Americans, supported working families, and secured our border.
Now the do-nothing Democrats are talking about about impeaching President Trump AGAIN! Do YOU think the Democrats will vote to impeach President Trump?

"Newsom asked President Trump to Bailout California
May 22, 2020
165 Days Until the November Election
Hello,
Can you believe Gavin Newsom and the Sacramento Democrats? After years of touting a surplus in the state’s budget, Newsom is now asking President Trump to bail out California.
This comes just weeks after Newsom issued stimulus payments to illegal immigrants, and he’s threatening that first responders will be the first to be laid off. From the boondoggle High Speed Rail Project to millions for enforcement of the job-killing bill aimed at flexible workers, Democrats have proven they can’t be trusted with the state budget. The out of control and irresponsible spending by the California Democrats must be stopped.
Municipalities with Republican leadership, like San Diego, take fiscal responsibility seriously and work hard to balance their budgets. We need to stop the Democrat supermajority in Sacramento and bring in new, responsible leadership.
If we want to put a stop to decades of failed leadership from the California Democrats, we need to continue our momentum and elect more Republicans in November. We have already flipped Congressional and State Assembly seats this cycle with your help. And we’re just getting started.

"California Republican Party Ballot Security Boxes are safe, secure and legal
October 19, 2020
15 Days Until the November Election
#  FUND the CAGOP Ballot Security Boxes
Hello,
The Democrats will stop at NOTHING to win this ELECTION.
Last week, they lied to the public about our ballot security box program and said that it was illegal. They were wrong and instead of apologizing they doubled down on their circus.
BUT, that didn’t stop Secretary of State Padilla and Attorney General Becerra from holding two press conferences accusing us of something THAT THEY KNEW WE DIDN’T DO.
Contribute $35 TODAY to push back against the Democrats' false claims.
Fund the Box: $20
Fund the Box: $35>>>
Fund the Box: $50

This is exactly what Socialists and Authoritarian Dictators do. They write laws to suit them. When someone figures out a way to do something under those laws that doesn’t suit them, then they use the color of authority to shut the PEOPLE down.
Well, the California Republican Party will not back down. We will continue our perfectly legal ballot collection program. We hope you agree.

"Since arriving in Washington nearly 50 years ago, Sleepy Joe Biden has failed to get the job done for the American people
August 21, 2020
74 Days Until the November Election
Hello,
Did you watch Joe’s Democratic Convention speech? It was painful. Since arriving in Washington nearly 50 years ago, Sleepy Joe Biden has failed to get the job done for the American people. He should stop making promises to America he knows he can’t keep.
Biden's Failures
CHINA: Biden has spent decades appeasing China and supported its membership in the World Trade Organization along with “Most Favored Nation” trade status which killed 3.4 million American jobs.
HEALTH CARE: Biden supports a full government takeover of health care, which would slowly kill Americans’ private insurance plans.
OPIOID CRISIS: Biden is responsible for worsening the opioid epidemic.
FOREIGN POLICY: Biden has been wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue of the last 40 years.
LAW ENFORCEMENT: Biden wants to absolutely defund the police and law enforcement.
GREEN NEW DEAL: Biden likes and supports the crazy $93 trillion Green New Deal.
ECONOMY: Biden’s agenda would eliminate 19 MILLION jobs and reduce our GDP by $7.1 TRILLION.
TAXES: Biden wants to hike taxes on the American people by $4 TRILLION and his tax agenda would raise taxes on 82% of middle-class Americans.
SAY NO TO SLEEPY JOE
Thankfully the corrupt Democrat Convention is finally over. It has been filled with LIES and RADICAL ideas by the far-Left and the Fake News. Joe Biden has been the embodiment of FAILED leadership and a diminished Biden has no business getting anywhere near the White House. We MUST re-elect President Trump this November. He continues to fulfill the promises he made to the American people even with the FAKE NEWS media against him.
They want to ruin President Trump and patriotic Republicans like yourself, friend.
President Trump fights against the RADICAL left every day so Americans can continue thriving under his leadership. It is obvious Sleepy Joe is unqualified for the job and the Democrats are scared.

"Californians in TJ Cox's district are struggling under COVID-19 restrictions, but those restrictions don't apply to him.
August 5, 2020
90 Days Until the November Election
Hello,
Do you know which National Park Democrat Congressman TJ Cox (CD-21) recently abused his power to visit?
Yosemite National Park.
Can you believe it? Californians in TJ Cox's district are struggling under COVID-19 restrictions, but those restrictions don't apply to him. He recently sought special treatment by requesting to gain access to Yosemite National Park for a family trip. The same National Park TJ and the rest of his Democrat cronies supported locking down in fear of a COVID-19 surge.
Send a Message
We are tired of Democrat privilege. We must put an END to the abuse of power from the LEFT-WING California Democrats.
If we don't get to enjoy our beautiful National Parks, then neither should the man who was in favor of shutting them down.
Tell TJ to Stay Home Like the Rest of Us

"Unprocessed Ballots will be counted
March 9, 2020
239 Days Until the November Election
#  Unprocessed Ballot Fund
Patriot of Team California,
The March 3rd Primary was a huge success for our party. But the battle for the primary is far from over. While the results look good, we cannot be caught off guard when the final vote totals come in.
There are over 3.24 MILLION unprocessed ballots left to be counted.
Frankly that massive number is unacceptable. To put into perspective, the total number of unprocessed ballots is nearly as many as the COMBINED votes cast for Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden, Michael Bloomberg and Elizabeth Warren in California last Tuesday.
That is why I am asking you today to contribute $45 to our Unprocessed Ballot Fund.
UNPROCESSED BALLOT FUND
EMAIL: [[EMAIL_REDACTED]]
ACCOUNT NUMBER: 0033i00000BCDlIAAX
UNPROCESSED BALLOT FUND CONTRIBUTION: REQUESTED
SUGGESTED CONTRIBUTION AMOUNT: $45

Please contribute to the Unprocessed Ballot Fund today. It is critical that we have the resources to make sure the integrity of the March primary is upheld.
Contribute $100
Contribute $45>>>
Contribute $35
Contribute $25
Contribute Other Amount
In 2018, there were several seats that we had won on election day but subsequently lost because of unprocessed ballots counted weeks later. We can't let that happen again.
Democrats are capable of doing anything to keep control of the House of Representatives and retain Nancy Pelosi as Speaker. What you can do to stop their liberal agenda is Contribute to the Unprocessed Ballot Fund Today.
Thank you for your support!

"Sleepy Joe Biden’s Democrat Party has made it abundantly clear just how radical they’ve become
September 4, 2020
60 Days Until the November Election
Hello,
Bumbling Biden should be retiring, not running for President. It’s clear to the American people that he is UNQUALIFIED to run our country.
A Sleepy Joe Biden presidency would mean a DISASTER for Americans. Biden would sacrifice hundreds of thousands of blue-collar jobs for Green New Deal policies. He would raise taxes on 82% of Americans and continue stoking racial injustice.
Biden’s corrupt family dealings, his soft view on China, and his DISASTROUS trade, health care, and national security policies are a threat to the greatest nation on earth.
SAY NO TO JOE
Sleepy Joe Biden’s Democrat Party has made it abundantly clear just how radical they’ve become. Joe Biden’s track record of advocating for failed policies, his embrace of the RADICAL Left’s agenda, coupled with his family benefiting from his elected position, does not bode well for the American people. We need to stop Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in their tracks.
It’s clear President Donald Trump and the Republican Party will claim VICTORY over the radical Democrats this November.
We are counting on you, friend. Please contribute $25 by 11:59 PM TONIGHT to help us DEFEAT Sleepy Joe.

We hope this email finds you and your family healthy and safe. We are still working around the clock here at the CAGOP, and there is an important deadline that I wanted to make sure you were aware of.
The end of the month special election deadline for the special election is TONIGHT at 11:59PM. We are just 74 donations short of our fundraising goal and I noticed that you haven’t donated yet. I know Bryan has already talked to you about the importance of this fundraising deadline, but I can’t stress it enough. It is absolutely critical that we hit our goal.
If just 74 supporters like you contribute any amount, we will meet our fundraising goal for this special election.

The past two years as Chairwoman of the California Republican Party have been incredible. We are feeling optimistic and confident in our candidates as we near the finish line..
Governor Newsom is not on the ballot this November but what is on the ballot are his cronies who have enabled his FAILING policies to inflict hardship on Californians.
Republicans, by contrast, are focused on solving the problems Sacramento & Washington D.C. Democrats have caused. We’ve made a ton of progress this cycle and have great candidates. Now we need you to vote.
We face Democrat opponents who could undo every bit of progress we've made in our California Republican Comeback.

Democrats care more about petty politics than actually getting things done. President Trump is getting things done!

"Democrats cannot manage the integrity of our elections
May 12, 2020
175 Days Until the November Election
#  Special Election Alert
Patriot,
Governor Gavin Newsom and California Democrats, through a series of executive actions, keep changing the rules regarding our elections.
Now an additional in-person vote center was just opened in a heavily Democrat area of Los Angeles County just days before the Special Election - and when all signs point to a GOP victory, a brazen and a sudden attempt to influence the results.
We are hours away from a Republican flipping a Democrat held congressional seat for the first time in over 20 years. This victory would also provide a key first step toward re-taking the House in 2020.
###  We need an emergency infusion of resources to maintain the integrity of this election and all elections this year.

Mike Garcia is in an excellent position to win in Congressional District 25, and California Democrats are doing everything in their power to stop him.
Please understand, everyone in Congressional District 25 was already mailed a ballot in the name of voter safety. How does opening one in-person vote center in a heavily Democrat area at the last minute contribute to voter safety?

Patriot, will you contribute $25 to help us win Congressional District 25 on Tuesday?

"Nancy Pelosi FINALLY sent the articles of impeachment to the Senate
California Republican Party
Friend,
Nancy Pelosi FINALLY sent the articles of impeachment to the Senate! This took almost a month for Pelosi to finally realize the Democrats didn't have the power to say how the trial would go in the Senate.
President Trump can finally get the fair trial he deserves in the Senate to prove that the Democrats only wanted to overturn the 2016 election! The American people don't think President Trump should be removed from office. Republicans want FOUR more years of President Trump's leadership.
Now that the articles of impeachment are in the hands of the Senate, we can't forget that all 45 of the California House Democrats voted to impeach President Trump. All 45 of these do-nothing Democrats need to be voted out of office in 2020!

#  Kamala's Record
Hello,
Phony Kamala Harris is a career California politician. Her failed policies and legacy can be seen through our state and the formerly beautiful San Francisco. We can’t let her RUIN America like she’s ruined California.
For DECADES Phony Kamala’s liberal policies have hurt California’s hard-working families. Kamala SUPPORTS the idea of a national AB 5, the new California law, which kills independent contractor jobs. Kamala thinks AB 5 should go beyond California law. That would destroy MILLIONS of American jobs.
Harris supports extreme policies including:
* Eliminating private health insurance
* The $93 trillion Green New Deal
* A massive tax hike on hard-working Americans.
Kamala has FAILED California, and we can’t let her FAIL America. We are less than 2 MONTHS AWAY from the most CRITICAL election in the history of our country. It’s SOCIALISTS vs. PATRIOTS this November.
Step up today to put a stop to the Biden/Harris ticket. Contribute $25 today and your donation will be 5X MATCHED.

"This new plan would eliminate over 350,000 good paying jobs
September 24, 2020
40 Days Until the November Election
#  King Newsom
Hello,
King Newsom has officially LOST IT. I mean, we already knew he was out of his mind, but this is REALLY BAD. He recently signed a new Executive Order that will BAN the sale of new gas-powered vehicles.
Does he think we will be driving around in spaceships?
MILLIONS of Californians are out of work, thousands of businesses are closed, there is a backlog of 1.6 million unemployment claims, 19,000 firefighters are currently battling 27 major wildfires, and King Newsom wants to BAN the sale of new gas-powered cars.
This new plan would eliminate over 350,000 good-paying jobs in our oil and gas industry while ignoring the MILLIONS of already unemployed Californians and the tens of thousands of shuttered businesses.
Time and time again, King Newsom is focused on chasing headlines INSTEAD of focusing on the real problems caused by his TYRANNICAL rule.
He continues to use unilateral Executive Orders and strip us Californians from our freedoms and rights. King Newsom loves to issue edicts that hurt Californians. If King Newsom can’t even properly manage California, imagine if he were to RULE our entire COUNTRY. We can’t let that happen, Hello.

"Since arriving in Washington nearly 50 years ago, Sleepy Joe Biden has failed to get the job done for the American people
August 20, 2020
75 Days Until the November Election
Hello,
Did you watch Joe’s Democratic Convention speech? It was painful. Since arriving in Washington nearly 50 years ago, Sleepy Joe Biden has failed to get the job done for the American people. He should stop making promises to America he knows he can’t keep.
Biden's Failures
CHINA: Biden has spent decades appeasing China and supported its membership in the World Trade Organization along with “Most Favored Nation” trade status which killed 3.4 million American jobs.
HEALTH CARE: Biden supports a full government takeover of health care, which would slowly kill Americans’ private insurance plans.
OPIOID CRISIS: Biden is responsible for worsening the opioid epidemic.
FOREIGN POLICY: Biden has been wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue of the last 40 years.
LAW ENFORCEMENT: Biden wants to absolutely defund the police and law enforcement.
GREEN NEW DEAL: Biden likes and supports the crazy $93 trillion Green New Deal.
ECONOMY: Biden’s agenda would eliminate 19 MILLION jobs and reduce our GDP by $7.1 TRILLION.
TAXES: Biden wants to hike taxes on the American people by $4 TRILLION and his tax agenda would raise taxes on 82% of middle-class Americans.
SAY NO TO SLEEPY JOE
Thankfully the corrupt Democrat Convention is finally over. It has been filled with LIES and RADICAL ideas by the far-Left and the Fake News. Joe Biden has been the embodiment of FAILED leadership and a diminished Biden has no business getting anywhere near the White House. We MUST re-elect President Trump this November. He continues to fulfill the promises he made to the American people even with the FAKE NEWS media against him.
They want to ruin President Trump and patriotic Republicans like yourself, friend.
President Trump fights against the RADICAL left every day so Americans can continue thriving under his leadership. It is obvious Sleepy Joe is unqualified for the job and the Democrats are scared.

"Things are getting ridiculous
February 21, 2020
11 Days Until the March 3rd Primary Election
#  End the violence from the left
Hello,
I recently started at the California Republican Party and I'm scared. The left's impeachment sham failed and now their anger has resulted in increased violence against Republicans.
In Florida last week, a man drove his van through a Trump campaign voter registration tent. The man allegedly told police, ""someone had to take a stand."" We need to stand up and elect Republicans to STOP this senseless violence.
In New Hampshire, a man was arrested for allegedly assaulting a 15-year-old Trump supporter and two adults near a polling site during the state’s primary election.
But the left's violence isn't limited to the East Coast.
On the campus of UC Santa Cruz, violent protesters smashed a College Republican information table.
And last week, a brazen vandal attacked the Humboldt County Republican Party Headquarters. He was charged with burglary, vandalism, attempted arson, and battery.
This cannot continue.
##  Please Contribute $45 today to fight back through the political process and not the violent tactics of the left.

Friend,
Democrats want to silence your voice. Ever since President Trump won, they have been trying to undo the votes of American Patriots.
These impeachment hearings are proof that the WACKY Dems are only about politics.

Yes

If you agree that President Trump has worked to promote our nation’s great freedom, you need to REGISTER REPUBLICAN.

"Sneak Preview: Facebook Ads
May 8, 2020
179 Days Until the November Election
Hello,
I hope you and your family are healthy and safe during these uncertain times.
As you may know, we have two special elections going on right now. Because of these challenging times, we have had to quickly adjust and creatively campaign to ensure we win both seats. Normally we rely heavily on volunteers walking neighborhoods and knocking on doors to educate, persuade and turn out Republicans. Unfortunately, we won’t do this for the special elections in the 25th Congressional District and the 28th Senate District because we will not risk the health and safety of our volunteers or our voters.
We’re relying heavily on targeted advertising to make sure every Republican returns their ballot. Here is a sneak preview of some of the ads we would like to run on Facebook:
We need these ads to reach every Republican in these two vital districts – but we can’t do that unless we hit our goal for this critical Special Election Fundraising Deadline. Our donors have even activated a 4X MATCH.
Contribute just $20 to have a huge impact on these special elections. With your help, we can make sure every Republican turns in their ballot before May 12th.

"Sleepy Joe Biden’s Democrat Party has made it abundantly clear just how radical they’ve become
September 5, 2020
59 Days Until the November Election
Hello,
Bumbling Biden should be retiring, not running for President. It’s clear to the American people that he is UNQUALIFIED to run our country.
A Sleepy Joe Biden presidency would mean a DISASTER for Americans. Biden would sacrifice hundreds of thousands of blue-collar jobs for Green New Deal policies. He would raise taxes on 82% of Americans and continue stoking racial injustice.
Biden’s corrupt family dealings, his soft view on China, and his DISASTROUS trade, health care, and national security policies are a threat to the greatest nation on earth.
SAY NO TO JOE
Sleepy Joe Biden’s Democrat Party has made it abundantly clear just how radical they’ve become. Joe Biden’s track record of advocating for failed policies, his embrace of the RADICAL Left’s agenda, coupled with his family benefiting from his elected position, does not bode well for the American people. We need to stop Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in their tracks.
It’s clear President Donald Trump and the Republican Party will claim VICTORY over the radical Democrats this November.
We are counting on you, friend. Please contribute $25 by 11:59 PM TONIGHT to help us DEFEAT Sleepy Joe.

Hello,
As the Chairwoman of the California Republican Party, I am extremely excited about the progress we've made in sharing our vision for a better future for California. Californians are sick and tired of being forgotten about by RADICAL California Democrats. California Republicans continue to be focused on solving California's problems caused by them.

Our two HUGE Special Election victories made waves across the country. For the first time in over 20 years, California Republicans flipped a Congressional seat. We also held the 28th Senate District with a double-digit lead. It's clear that because of loyal Republicans like you, friend, we are READY to Take the Fight to the Democrats this November. We are feeling very optimistic going into the General Election.
Gavin Newsom and his Left-Wing Democrat cronies have FAILED California. He has continued to use the Coronavirus pandemic to shape the California election laws in favor of the Democrats. We promise to fight tooth and nail to ensure a FREE and FAIR election.

We are just over a month away from the November election, and we have the opportunity to record more historic victories. Our massive volunteer effort is well underway, helping us persuade and turn out voters across the state.

"Now more than ever, it is critical that the CALIFORNIA PROTECT THE VOTE FUND has the resources it needs
Hello,
Governor Gavin Newsom is back on his high horse trying to strip us Californians of our freedoms and unilaterally change our voting procedures. Thanks to Assemblyman James Gallagher (AD-3) and Assemblyman Kevin Kiley (AD-6), a judge ruled Governor Gavin Newsom's unconstitutional power grab may be an “impermissible use of legislative powers in violation of the California Constitution.”
Now an appeals court has blocked the temporary freeze. This critical legal fight will continue on June 26th when the Newsom must defend his position in court.
Now more than ever, it is critical that the CALIFORNIA PROTECT THE VOTE FUND has the resources it needs.

Hello,
The Democrats are at an all-time low. For years now, the alt-left has been taking over the Democratic Party. Today's Democrats are not the Democrats of even 4 years ago, these Democrats are ones filled with hate. Now more than ever, it is critical that we defeat as many Dems as possible at the ballot box.
Over the last few years, California Democrats like Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff have incited violent threats towards Republicans. Everywhere you turn, you see constant attacks from the left. Respect for our country is nonexistent with today's Democrats.
The looming threat of the modern Democrats is here, but we have the chance to protect our democracy before it's too late. Contribute $35 today to defeat the alt-left and help us elect as many Republicans as possible.

"Governor Newsom tried to BURY a scathing report on EDD's continued failures.
October 4, 2020
30 Days Until the November Election
Hello,
California Democrats have FAILED.
California is the capital of poverty, homelessness, blackouts, and a failed response to COVID-19, which has resulted in a HUGE statewide economic crisis. Governor Gavin Newsom and the DEMOCRATS HAVE FAILED CA. >>>
THOUSANDS of Californians leave our state every day to find a better life and opportunities in other states. More than 150,000 Californians sleep in shelters, cars, or on the streets.
We are home to the HIGHEST housing costs, rising energy costs, the HIGHEST gas prices, and the WORST-IN-THE-NATION commute times.
If that wasn't enough, Gavin Newsom’s poor leadership and the restrictive policies from Democrats have caused the state’s unemployment claims to SKYROCKET.
More than 10 MILLION unemployment claims have been filed since Governor Gavin Newsom first closed our state on March 19th.
California is the 5th largest economy in the world, but yet we have an employment department with a backlog of 1.5 MILLION unresolved claims dating back to March of this year. California Democrats are to blame.
We need to send a message to the California Democrats. Chip in $35 today to help us send the Democrats packing.

Thanks to Assemblyman James Gallagher (AD-3) and Assemblyman Kevin Kiley (AD-6), a judge ruled Governor Gavin Newsom's unconstitutional power grab may be an “impermissible use of legislative powers in violation of the California Constitution.”
Now an appeals court has blocked the temporary freeze. This critical legal fight will continue on June 26th when the Newsom must defend his position in court.

Subject: This is a critical time
March 31, 2020
217 Days Until the November Election
Hello,
First and foremost, I hope this email finds you and your family safe and healthy. This ‘new normal’ is a challenging time for all of us - and is changing our daily lives dramatically. But I wanted to provide you some updates on the California Republican Party and our successes and goals moving forward, because we WILL get through this, together.
The March 3rd California Primary brought significant success for the California Republican Party. We had strong showings in several targeted races that ensure we have strong candidates on the ballot in November - and, in fact, solidified that we are picking up at least one seat in the state Assembly. We are also successfully positioned to fight for two seats in a special election May 12th, and have had outstanding fundraising and built an infrastructure with staff and volunteers that put us on our path to victory.
We are all navigating the new reality brought to us with the Coronavirus pandemic. ""Stay at home"", ""flattening the curve"" and ""social distancing"" have become everyday phrases, and we see our families, friends and neighbors working together like never before to help each other through the “Stay at Home” orders issued for California.
This is the new normal, and we are working hard to find new and creative ways to get our message out and elect more Republicans. We can't organize by knocking on doors in neighborhoods. We can't have volunteers come to our offices. There are no meetings or community events to engage with voters. Fundraising toward our critical end of quarter deadline is challenging.
While everyone is struggling with finding a new path and figuring out what this all means for themselves and their families, there is plenty of hope. The President secured a stimulus package to stabilize industries, offer small business relief, and provide cash for families. They have fast tracked a trial for a coronavirus treatment. And more tests are becoming available.
And while we continue to work together as a community to get through this unprecedented period, we must continue to prepare to fight for our Republican values in November.
I'm asking you, if you are able, please contribute to our end of quarter fundraising deadline today.

We sincerely hope that you and are family are safe and healthy during this unprecedented and challenging time. As I’m sure you know, we have to keep moving forward to election day. We have an upcoming special election in the 25th Congressional District next month. The CAGOP has been working tirelessly (from our homes) to make sure we elect Republican Mike Garcia in that district. It’s extremely important that we turn this seat RED if we want to have a Republican majority in the House!
We’ve been hard at work, persuading voters and trying to get Republicans over the line. We are employing new strategies and tactics, even in these times of social distancing, to ensure we make as many quality voter contacts as possible before the election.

Hello,
Did you hear the one about the Democrats attempting to stop our ballot collection efforts in their tracks?
They failed.
But we are more determined than ever to make voting easy, convenient, and safe for all voters. Will you help us?
This was a blatant effort by the Democrats to suppress Republicans from voting in this election. They've sowed division and created angst and spread mischaracterization about our secure ballot collection program.
We need your help to spread the word that not only are the Democrats telling lies but that we are here and ready to help any voter figure out how to vote and how to protect their vote. That is why we are asking you, friend, today for a gift of $35 to our ballot box fund.

#  CAGOP Sues Newsom To Stop Ballot Harvesting
Hello,
While Californians continue to stay safe at home and social distance, Governor Gavin Newsom has dodged questions on the dangers of Ballot Harvesting with two critical special elections just days away. We are working hard to elect Republicans in Congressional District 25 and State Senate District 28, but need to make sure our volunteers and campaign workers stay safe.
The California Republican party has asked the courts to intervene because Newsom won't.
We need your support TODAY to fund this legal battle.

BACKGROUND
* On March 19, 2020, Gov. Gavin Newsom issued a statewide “Stay-at-Home Order” directing all California residents to shelter in place unless they were essential workers.
* As Californians look to participate in the upcoming special elections on May 12, the California GOP is now demanding Gov. Newsom make clear that his order prohibits ballot harvesting, which involves a stranger visiting a voter’s home and returning that voter’s ballot to the election officials.
* Strangers should not be going to voters’ homes to collect ballots, as it is a threat to the health and wellbeing of Californians and could increase the spread of COVID-19.
* Despite receiving a letter from the California GOP demanding answers weeks ago, Governor Newsom has been dodging the issue and putting Californians’ lives at risk.

"Governor Newsom tried to BURY a scathing report on EDD's continued failures.
October 4, 2020
30 Days Until the November Election
Hello,
California Democrats have FAILED.
California is the capital of poverty, homelessness, blackouts, and a failed response to COVID-19, which has resulted in a HUGE statewide economic crisis. Governor Gavin Newsom and the DEMOCRATS HAVE FAILED CA. >>>
THOUSANDS of Californians leave our state every day to find a better life and opportunities in other states. More than 150,000 Californians sleep in shelters, cars, or on the streets.
We are home to the HIGHEST housing costs, rising energy costs, the HIGHEST gas prices, and the WORST-IN-THE-NATION commute times.
If that wasn't enough, Gavin Newsom’s poor leadership and the restrictive policies from Democrats have caused the state’s unemployment claims to SKYROCKET.
More than 10 MILLION unemployment claims have been filed since Governor Gavin Newsom first closed our state on March 17th.
California is the 5th largest economy in the world, but yet we have an employment department with a backlog of 1.5 MILLION unresolved claims dating back to March of this year. California Democrats are to blame.
We need to send a message to the California Democrats. Chip in $35 today to help us send the Democrats packing.

It’s clear that Joe Biden and the RADICAL Democrats do not support our incredible law enforcement officers. The men and women serving our communities are some of the BRAVEST hardworking individuals. They risk their lives everyday to keep our communities safe. Democrats are a direct threat to law enforcement in America.

We can’t let Democrats defund and abolish our police departments. It would be TERRIBLE for America. President Trump STANDS for law and order and our police officers.
Keep our Communities Safe
Your input is critical, friend. We need to know if you stand behind President Trump’s decision to BACK THE BLUE. Under Joe Biden’s radical defund the police agenda, the American People’s safety would be in jeopardy and law and order wouldn’t exist.

This is HISTORIC:
With Mike Garcia's win on Tuesday, we flipped a Democrat-held House seat in California for the first time in over twenty years. This would not have happened without your continuing and generous support.
We want to celebrate this victory with you but must continue to work to keep this seat red in November.
You will hear from Leader McCarthy and Congressman-Elect Garcia on what this victory means for Republicans, and how we can continue this momentum through November to STOP Nancy Pelosi and Take Back the House. I will also share my ideas on the California Republican Comeback and what we can do to make sure the next Speaker of the House from California is a Republican - Kevin McCarthy.
Patriot, Contribute $10 and join our exclusive Virtual Victory Party.

Liberal Megadonors
Hello,
We sincerely hope that you and your family are safe and healthy during this unprecedented and challenging time.
While we’re all focused on staying home and healthy, did you catch what Mike Bloomberg did? Bloomberg transferred $18 MILLION to the DNC! Liberal megadonors, like Bloomberg, are the reason why the Democratic Party is so corrupt. Funneling this money through the DNC is the ONLY reason California Democrats claim not to accept donations from PACs and megadonors. Could the Democrats be any shadier?
The Left may have LIBERAL megadonors, but they don’t have the grassroots support we do. Thankfully, we have you, friend, and millions of others who want turn California RED.
Send a message to the CORRUPT California Democrats and contribute $35 now!
Contribute $10
Contribute $35 >>
Contribute $50
Contribute $75
Contribute $100
We can’t elect Republicans without you, friend. It’s hard to compete against the Democrat megadonors without your help. If everyone chips in, we will hit our fundraising goal.
Please stay healthy, stay safe and stay home.
Thank You,

#  Gavin Newsom Approval Poll
Hello,
Gavin Newsom and the California Democrats have been exploiting the Coronavirus pandemic to support their political causes. Newsom’s executive orders are not focused on helping Californians in this time of crisis. Instead, Governor Newsom wants to ensure that he and his cronies stay in power for as long as possible.
Newsom’s policies have been historically bad for California. The fake news media claims that Newsom is polling through the roof, but we don’t believe it. Take the Official CAGOP Poll today so we can have the most accurate polling numbers.

"Protecting the vote is our last stand to preserve democracy
September 21, 2020
43 Days Until the November Election
Hello,
We're less than 45 days away from Election Day. Ballots drop in just a matter of days, and it is so critical that we PROTECT THE VOTE. The far-left Dems have done everything in their power to make sure President Trump is not re-elected. We can't stress how important it is that we make sure every vote is counted this November.
Protecting the vote is our last stand to preserve democracy. Americans deserve to have confidence in their elections, and we will not stand idly by while Democrats try to rob the 2020 elections. Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff already failed at their witch hunt of an impeachment. Who's to say they won't go even further? Put a stop to ballot tampering and voter fraud by chipping in $35 today. We have even activated a 7X match for all contributions before 11:59 pm.

"Democrats cannot manage the integrity of our elections

#  Special Election Alert
Patriot,
Governor Gavin Newsom and California Democrats, through a series of executive actions, keep changing the rules regarding our elections.
Now an additional in-person vote center was just opened in a heavily Democrat area of Los Angeles County just days before the Special Election - and when all signs point to a GOP victory, a brazen and a sudden attempt to influence the results.
We are a day away from a Republican flipping a Democrat held congressional seat for the first time in over 20 years. This victory would also provide a key first step toward re-taking the House in 2020.

Hello,
The Democrats will stop at NOTHING to win this ELECTION.
Last week, they lied to the public about our ballot security box program and said that it was illegal. They were wrong and instead of apologizing they doubled down on their circus.
BUT, that didn’t stop Secretary of State Padilla and Attorney General Becerra from holding two press conferences accusing us of something THAT THEY KNEW WE DIDN’T DO.

This is exactly what Socialists and Authoritarian Dictators do. They write laws to suit them. When someone figures out a way to do something under those laws that doesn’t suit them, then they use the color of authority to shut the PEOPLE down.
Well, the California Republican Party will not back down. We will continue our perfectly legal ballot collection program. We hope you agree.

#  45 vs. The 45 Out of Touch California Democrats
Friend,
Donald Trump, the 45th President of the United States, has been constantly under attacked by the 45 out of touch California Democrats in Congress. These 45 Democrats followed Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff closely throughout this WITCH HUNT!
President Trump is at war with the Democrats from California. On Wednesday, he tasked us with ""voting Pelosi the hell out of office!""
We need YOU to act NOW to help the California Republican Party get rid of the California Democrats in 2020.

#  CAGOP Sues Newsom To Stop Ballot Harvesting
Hello,
While Californians continue to stay safe at home and social distance, Governor Gavin Newsom has dodged questions on the dangers of Ballot Harvesting with two critical special elections just days away. We are working hard to elect Republicans in Congressional District 25 and State Senate District 28, but need to make sure our volunteers and campaign workers stay safe.
The California Republican party has asked the courts to intervene because Newsom won't.
We need your support TODAY to fund this legal battle.

BACKGROUND
* On March 19, 2020, Gov. Gavin Newsom issued a statewide “Stay-at-Home Order” directing all California residents to shelter in place unless they were essential workers.
* As Californians look to participate in the upcoming special elections on May 12, the California GOP is now demanding Gov. Newsom make clear that his order prohibits ballot harvesting, which involves a stranger visiting a voter’s home and returning that voter’s ballot to the election officials.
* Strangers should not be going to voters’ homes to collect ballots, as it is a threat to the health and wellbeing of Californians and could increase the spread of COVID-19.
* Despite receiving a letter from the California GOP demanding answers weeks ago, Governor Newsom has been dodging the issue and putting Californians’ lives at risk.
Election Integrity Legal Fund
Thank you always for your support. Stay safe and stay healthy.

CAGOP
Contribute Today
California Patriot,
Adam Schiff is my Congressman and I remember the last time we impeached a President.
Here is the excuse Schiff gave in 2000 when he ran for Congress in the shadow of the Clinton impeachment. He was the “anti-impeachment crusader.”
> “The district simply has not been a priority for him. He has been more engaged in national partisan ideological crusades than in issues important to the district,” Adam Schiff in 2000
Impeachment is the only reason Adam Schiff was elected as my Congressman. Now, Schiff has drunk the socialist kool-aid and leading his own impeachment crusade against Trump.

"Court blocks Newsom from changes in Election Procedures
June 12, 2020
144 Days Until the November Election
#  Protect the Vote Alert
Hello,
A judge has granted a temporary restraining order against Governor Gavin Newsom's executive order that would allow counties to reduce the number of polling location precincts on election day.
This is not only a victory protecting our elections but important to limiting Newsom's egregious use of executive power.
The ruling also prevents Newsom from,
> ""exercising any further legislative powers in violation of the California Constitution and applicable statute, specifically from unilaterally amending, altering, or changing existing statutory law or making new statutory law.""
The Governor's office will challenge the ruling.
Fellow Californian, we need an emergency contribution today to the California Protect the Vote Fund so we can help sustain the pressure on Governor Newsom and prevent his unconstitutional power grab.
Protect the Vote: $50
Protect the Vote: $35
Protect the Vote: $25
Protect the Vote: $10
Protect the vote: Other
###  Gavin Newsom will continue to fight for the ability to ignore the California constitution and existing election laws. Please give us the ability to fight back through an emergency contribution today.

Hello,
We hope you and your family are staying safe and healthy at home as we all do our part flatten the curve. Now more than ever, it is critical that Americans come together to get through this difficult time.
Instead of coming together to find common sense solutions, Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats have continued to play partisan games. Both Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer have decided to hold up small business loans that are so critical to Americans. Just days ago, the existing small business loan program just ran OUT OF MONEY.
The Democrats are holding the American worker hostage by not finding a solution for America’s small businesses. This is why we need to defeat Nancy Pelosi and her squad in November. Now is not the time to play partisan games that damage small businesses across the country.
Send a message to Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer by chipping in $20 to defeat the Democrats that are holding the American workforce hostage.

"Since arriving in Washington nearly 50 years ago, Sleepy Joe Biden has failed to get the job done for the American people
August 21, 2020
74 Days Until the November Election
Hello,
Did you watch Joe’s Democratic Convention speech? It was painful. Since arriving in Washington nearly 50 years ago, Sleepy Joe Biden has failed to get the job done for the American people. He should stop making promises to America he knows he can’t keep.
Biden's Failures
CHINA: Biden has spent decades appeasing China and supported its membership in the World Trade Organization along with “Most Favored Nation” trade status which killed 3.4 million American jobs.
HEALTH CARE: Biden supports a full government takeover of health care, which would slowly kill Americans’ private insurance plans.
OPIOID CRISIS: Biden is responsible for worsening the opioid epidemic.
FOREIGN POLICY: Biden has been wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue of the last 40 years.
LAW ENFORCEMENT: Biden wants to absolutely defund the police and law enforcement.
GREEN NEW DEAL: Biden likes and supports the crazy $93 trillion Green New Deal.
ECONOMY: Biden’s agenda would eliminate 19 MILLION jobs and reduce our GDP by $7.1 TRILLION.
TAXES: Biden wants to hike taxes on the American people by $4 TRILLION and his tax agenda would raise taxes on 82% of middle-class Americans.
SAY NO TO SLEEPY JOE
Thankfully the corrupt Democrat Convention is finally over. It has been filled with LIES and RADICAL ideas by the far-Left and the Fake News. Joe Biden has been the embodiment of FAILED leadership and a diminished Biden has no business getting anywhere near the White House. We MUST re-elect President Trump this November. He continues to fulfill the promises he made to the American people even with the FAKE NEWS media against him.
They want to ruin President Trump and patriotic Republicans like yourself, friend.
President Trump fights against the RADICAL left every day so Americans can continue thriving under his leadership. It is obvious Sleepy Joe is unqualified for the job and the Democrats are scared.

"The Supreme Court is under attack by the RADICAL Democrats
October 18, 2020
16 Days Until the November Election
Hello,
The Supreme Court is under attack by the RADICAL Democrats. The Democrats want to DESTROY the Supreme Court with a SCHEME to pack justices.
Stand with Judge Amy Coney Barrett
The Radical Democrats' court-packing scheme would politicize the Supreme Court. We can't let that happen, friend.
Washington elites will not silence us. It's time to take our country back, and it starts with confirming Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court.
The Democrats are refusing to even meet with Judge Amy Coney Barrett. They cannot argue against her nomination on her merits or impeccable credentials; instead, they will resort to DISGRACEFUL personal attacks.
Please contribute $35 to the Supreme Court Defense Fund to help Republicans FIGHT against the Radical Democrats and get President Trump's nominee confirmed.

This is CRITICAL. Let's show President Trump we will stand by his side and support his nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett.

"The RADICAL left-wing mob’s takeover of Sleepy Joe Biden and the Democrat Party is complete.
August 20, 2020
75 Days Until the November Election
Hello,
Sleepy Joe Biden’s Democrat Party has made it abundantly clear just how radical they’ve become during the wacky Democrat National Convention.
The RADICAL left-wing mob’s takeover of Sleepy Joe Biden and the Democrat Party is complete.
So far, Corrupt Sally Yates, Cryin’ Chuck Schumer, John Kerry, Michelle Obama, Socialist Squad Leader Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Bill Clinton, and Barack Obama, have all taken the stage to spread FAKE NEWS and lies about OUR President.
Joe Biden is set to give his speech tonight. How many teleprompters will he have to help him not forget his words?
Will Joe bring up:
* He supported disastrous trade deals like NAFTA which resulted in 850,000 American jobs lost.
* He led the effort to grant China “Most Favored Nation” status and supported its membership to the World Trade Organization which eliminated 3.4 million American jobs.
* Under the Obama/Biden economy, 787,000 Americans fell into poverty and wage growth stagnated.
* Obama and Biden promised unemployment would never rise above 8% with the stimulus. Instead, it rose above 8% and stayed there – for 43 straight months as Biden helped preside over the slowest economic recovery since WWII
* While in the Senate, Biden was instrumental in passing a 1994 crime bill that experts say “helped lay the groundwork for the mass incarceration that has devastated America’s black communities.”
STOP BIDEN >>>
Joe Biden’s track record of advocating for failed policies, his embrace of the RADICAL left’s agenda, coupled with his family benefiting from his elected position, does not bode well for the American people. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris don’t stand a chance.
President Trump routinely reminds the American people: he built the greatest economy once, and he is doing it again. It’s clear President Donald Trump and the Republican Party will claim VICTORY over the radical Democrats this November.

Many Californians have taken to the street to protest Newsom’s stay at home order. These protesters have demanded that Newsom reopens our state now. Others feel that we need to take things slowly, in phases.

"For DECADES Phony Kamala’s policies have hurt California’s hard-working families
September 12, 2020
52 Days Until the November Election
#  Kamala's Record
Hello,
Phony Kamala Harris has been a career California politician. Americans don’t want to see our nation to become San Francisco or California. Her policies and legacy can be seen through our state and the formerly beautiful San Francisco. We can’t let her RUIN America like she’s ruined California.
For DECADES Phony Kamala’s policies have hurt California’s hard-working families. Kamala SUPPORTS the idea of a national AB 5, the new California law, which takes away the flexibility and kills independent contractor jobs. Kamala thinks AB 5 should go beyond California law. That would kill MILLIONS of American jobs.
Harris supports extreme policies including:
* Eliminating private health insurance
* The $93 trillion Green New Deal

Hello,
There is no other way to put this. Speaker Nancy Pelosi is a disgrace.
Last night President Donald J. Trump gave an amazing State of the Union speech laying out just how strong the United States has become under his leadership.
Meanwhile, the Democrat party is in shambles. They can't count the votes in Iowa. Their representatives sat on their hands and refused to celebrate record low unemployment for African Americans, Latinos, Asians, disabled people and women. And Speaker Nancy Pelosi disgraced herself and her party by ripping President Trump's speech - LITERALLY.
It is time for Speaker Nancy Pelosi to go.

Did you happen to read Chairwoman Patterson's email yesterday? Yesterday marked one year of her leadership at the California Republican Party and it's been a year full of great strides!

"Help us target voters in these critical special elections
May 8, 2020
179 Days Until the November Election
Hello,
I hope you and your family are healthy and safe during these uncertain times.
As you may know, we have two special elections going on right now. Because of these challenging times, we have had to quickly adjust and creatively campaign to ensure we win both seats. Normally we rely heavily on volunteers walking neighborhoods and knocking on doors to educate, persuade and turn out Republicans. Unfortunately, we won’t do this for the special elections in the 25th Congressional District and the 28th Senate District because we will not risk the health and safety of our volunteers or our voters.
We’re relying heavily on targeted advertising to make sure every Republican returns their ballot. Here is a sneak preview of some of the ads we would like to run on Facebook:
We need these ads to reach every Republican in these two vital districts – but we can’t do that unless we hit our goal for this critical Special Election Fundraising Deadline. Our donors have even activated a 4X MATCH.
Contribute just $20 to have a huge impact on these special elections. With your help, we can make sure every Republican turns in their ballot before May 12th.

"New FAKE POLLS claim that Biden has this race locked up and President Trump doesn't stand a chance
June 15, 2020
141 Days Until the November Election
#  FAKE NEWS POLLS
Hello,
It's official - Joe Biden is the Democrat nominee, after receiving enough delegates to the Democratic National Convention just a few days ago. New FAKE POLLS claim that Biden has this race locked up and President Trump doesn't stand a chance.
We all know from experience that the fake polls were way off in 2016. Those polls actually claimed that President Trump didn't stand a chance against Crooked Hillary. Boy, were they WRONG.
These polls CANNOT BE TRUSTED. We need your help in this week's poll, friend. Who do you think will win the 2020 presidential election?

"Do you think Nancy Pelosi could have dragged the impeachment sham on any longer?
California Republican Party
#  ALERT: HOUSE DEMS WILL FINALLY VOTE TO SEND ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT TO THE SENATE
Friend,
Do you think Nancy Pelosi could have dragged the impeachment sham on any longer?
Pelosi and the far-left Democrats have created a circus out of the people's house. They couldn't have made it any clearer that the Democrats' top priority is getting rid of President Trump since he was elected.
You would think Pelosi would have wanted to move the articles of impeachment to the Senate as soon as possible since she's been waiting three years to do so. But NO! Nancy Pelosi doesn't want to move on; she wants to continue to be the ring leader of the lefties!
The articles of impeachment are finally going to a trial in the Senate, where the American people can see that Pelosi and Schiff have been lying the entire time.
PRESIDENT TRUMP CAN FINALLY BE CLEARED OF WRONGDOING!
If we want to prevent more impeachment shams from occurring, then we need to get rid of Nancy Pelosi, Adam Schiff, and the rest of the California Democrats that voted to impeach President Trump.

"Bernie or Biden vs. President Trump
March 8, 2020
240 Days Until the November Election
#  Bernie or Biden vs. President Trump
Hello,
The 2020 Presidential election is well underway and there are just a couple of Democrats left! Well actually there's three but Gabbard is a long shot...
We have Bernie Sanders, a self-proclaimed Democratic Socialist, that wants to tax you until you bleed and then some. Sander's radical plans include medicare for all, free college, and abolishing ICE.
On the other end of the race is Joe Biden. Biden is the perfect example of the swamp! He has been working in Washington for almost 50 years. Biden's career has been filled with scandal after scandal.
TAKE THE POLL
Lately, President Trump has been asking who is going to be the easiest Democrat for him to beat. We wanted to poll California Republicans and ask you the same question.
Which Democrat is going to be easier for President Trump to beat in 2020?
Crazy Bernie or Sleepy Joe?
TAKE THE SURVEY
This survey is very important for the Republican Party. It's critical that you take the poll NOW!

California Republican Party
Friend,
Are you watching this? Adam Schiff and his liberal House colleagues continue their attempt to overturn the 2016 election of President Trump!
Yesterday marked three years since President Trump was sworn into office. For THREE years, these Democrats have been focused on petty politics instead of working to improve the lives the American people. Since the President has been in office, we have an economy that has continued to grow, more jobs, and improved international relations. The Democrats don't want to accept the truth that President Trump’s America is working for the American people.
California has 45 Democrats that voted to impeach President Trump. If we want to prevent another impeachment sham in the future, it's critical that we DEFEAT THE 45 DEMOCRATS in 2020.

This is the FINAL countdown before the 2020 General Election. Every day is CRITICAL to bringing home Republican victories on November 3rd. Can we count on you to help get us over the finish line?
CONTRIBUTE TODAY
The past two years as Chairwoman of the California Republican Party have been incredible. We are feeling optimistic and confident in our candidates as we near the finish line..
Governor Newsom is not on the ballot this November but what is on the ballot are his cronies who have enabled his FAILING policies to inflict hardship on Californians.
Republicans, by contrast, are focused on solving the problems Sacramento & Washington D.C. Democrats have caused. We’ve made a ton of progress this cycle and have great candidates. Now we need you to vote.
We face Democrat opponents who could undo every bit of progress we've made in our California Republican Comeback.
Contribute to EOM>>
That's why I am counting on YOU, friend, to help get us over the line and CRUSH our October End-of-Month fundraising goal.

"Our challenges are looming
March 27, 2020
221 Days Until the November Election
Hello,
First and foremost, I hope this email finds you and your family safe and healthy. This ‘new normal’ is a challenging time for all of us - and is changing our daily lives dramatically. But I wanted to provide you some updates on the California Republican Party and our successes and goals moving forward, because we WILL get through this, together.
The March 3rd California Primary brought significant success for the California Republican Party. We had strong showings in several targeted races that ensure we have strong candidates on the ballot in November - and, in fact, solidified that we are picking up at least one seat in the state Assembly. We are also successfully positioned to fight for two seats in a special election May 12th, and have had outstanding fundraising and built an infrastructure with staff and volunteers that put us on our path to victory.
We are all navigating the new reality brought to us with the Coronavirus pandemic. ""Stay at home"", ""flattening the curve"" and ""social distancing"" have become everyday phrases, and we see our families, friends and neighbors working together like never before to help each other through the “Stay at Home” orders issued for California.
This is the new normal, and we are working hard to find new and creative ways to get our message out and elect more Republicans. We can't organize by knocking on doors in neighborhoods. We can't have volunteers come to our offices. There are no meetings or community events to engage with voters. Fundraising toward our critical end of quarter deadline is challenging.
While everyone is struggling with finding a new path and figuring out what this all means for themselves and their families, there is plenty of hope. The President secured a stimulus package to stabilize industries, offer small business relief, and provide cash for families. They have fast tracked a trial for a coronavirus treatment. And more tests are becoming available.
And while we continue to work together as a community to get through this unprecedented period, we must continue to prepare to fight for our Republican values in November.
I'm asking you, if you are able, please contribute to our end of quarter fundraising deadline today.
Contribute $100
Contribute $50>>>
Contribute $45
Contribute $35

###  Your generous contribution today will help us secure victories in November.
Thank you for all that you do. We'll get through this together.
Thank You,
Jessica Millan Patterson

"California is the capital of poverty, homelessness, wildfires, blackouts
September 18, 2020
46 Days Until the November Election
Hello,
We need your input.
The RADICAL Democrats' great California progressive experiment has FAILED. Governor Gavin Newsom and his Democrat cronies cannot keep the lights on, track COVID 19 cases, pay unemployment claims, get public education on track or support our economy.
Official Newsom Approval Poll
California is the capital of poverty, homelessness, wildfires, blackouts, and a FAILED response to COVID-19 and the resulting economic crisis. Californians aren’t working because the Liberal Democrats’ simply cannot manage these challenges.
Just the other day, Newsom blamed the raging California wildfires on CLIMATE CHANGE instead of Democrat mismanagement of our state.
Take the Poll >>>
Newsom announced his economic task force to navigate the state’s economic recovery, but where are the results he PROMISED? California’s struggling families and small businesses need answers NOW.
Gavin Newsom will be releasing over 18,000 convicted criminals back into our neighborhoods. California families are already struggling with finding work, feeding their families, and navigating government controlled shutdowns – they shouldn’t have to worry about thousands of new violent criminals in our communities.
Please take our Official Newsom Approval Poll NOW to let us know what YOU think about the job he is doing as Governor.
Newsom Approval Poll
Your input is CRITICAL. Please take the Official Newsom Approval Poll Today.
Thank you,

#  CAGOP Sues Newsom To Stop Ballot Harvesting
Hello,
While Californians continue to stay safe at home and social distance, Governor Gavin Newsom has dodged questions on the dangers of Ballot Harvesting with two critical special elections just days away. We are working hard to elect Republicans in Congressional District 25 and State Senate District 28, but need to make sure our volunteers and campaign workers stay safe.
The California Republican party has asked the courts to intervene because Newsom won't.
We need your support TODAY to fund this legal battle.

BACKGROUND
* On March 19, 2020, Gov. Gavin Newsom issued a statewide “Stay-at-Home Order” directing all California residents to shelter in place unless they were essential workers.
* As Californians look to participate in the upcoming special elections on May 12, the California GOP is now demanding Gov. Newsom make clear that his order prohibits ballot harvesting, which involves a stranger visiting a voter’s home and returning that voter’s ballot to the election officials.
* Strangers should not be going to voters’ homes to collect ballots, as it is a threat to the health and wellbeing of Californians and could increase the spread of COVID-19.
* Despite receiving a letter from the California GOP demanding answers weeks ago, Governor Newsom has been dodging the issue and putting Californians’ lives at risk.

Thank you always for your support. Stay safe and stay healthy.

"The more Americans have gotten to know Judge Amy Coney Barrett over the past few weeks, the more they approve of her nomination
October 23, 2020
11 Days Until the November Election
Hello,
Yesterday the Senate Judiciary Committee voted to move Judge Amy Coney Barrett one step closer to being a Supreme Court Justice.
Judge Amy Coney Barrett is a woman of unparalleled achievement, towering intellect, sterling credentials, and unyielding loyalty to the Constitution.
The more Americans have gotten to know Judge Amy Coney Barrett over the past few weeks, the more they approve of her nomination. Americans WANT and NEED the Senate to seat this highly qualified jurist to the bench without DELAY.
The Fake News Media will do anything to serve the RADICAL Democrat Party, whether it’s hiding their corruption or attacking the kids of a brilliant jurist poised to become the FIRST working mom to sit on the Supreme Court.
It’s time for Democrats to do their job, stop the delay tactics, and confirm Judge Amy Coney Barrett. Confirming Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court is critical to Making America Great Again.
Please contribute $35 to ensure President Trump’s re-election and support this incredible nominee.
Contribute $20
Contribute $35
Contribute $50
Contribute $75
Contribute $100
Let’s send a message to the Radical Left that we will not be silenced.

Hello,
We sincerely hope that you and are family are safe and healthy during this unprecedented and challenging time. As I’m sure you know, we have to keep moving forward to election day. We have an upcoming special election in the 25th Congressional District next month. The CAGOP has been working tirelessly (from our homes) to make sure we elect Republican Mike Garcia in that district. It’s extremely important that we turn this seat RED if we want to have a Republican majority in the House!
We’ve been hard at work, persuading voters and trying to get Republicans over the line. We are employing new strategies and tactics, even in these times of social distancing, to ensure we make as many quality voter contacts as possible before the election.

"Confirming Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court is CRITICAL to Making America Great Again
October 5, 2020
29 Days Until the November Election
Hello,
Judge Amy Coney Barrett is a true Constitutionalist committed to upholding the rule of law, and President Trump is committed to seeing her Supreme Court confirmation through.
Confirming Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court is CRITICAL to Making America Great Again.
She has an unquestionable record as a strong, conservative Constitutionalist. Unfortunately, the RADICAL Democrats have already launched a vicious campaign to smear her simply because a Republican President nominated her.
Judge Amy Coney Barrett
* Judge Barrett understands that a judge's role is to faithfully interpret the law, not to legislate from the bench.
* She is a former Justice Antonin Scalia clerk who currently sits on the 7th Circuit, which hears appeals from Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin.
* President Trump nominated her to the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals, and she was confirmed by a bipartisan vote on October 31, 2017.
* She has sterling academic credentials – received her B.A. from Rhodes College and is a graduate of Notre Dame Law School.
This is further proof that our President keeps his promises and will ALWAYS put America First. Let's show President Trump that we will stand by his side and support his nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett.
Please contribute $35 to the Supreme Court Defense Fund to help Republicans FIGHT against the Radical Democrats and get President Trump's nominee confirmed.

There are many challenges ahead. With the critical March 3rd primary only days away, I want to engage, activate and deploy as many of the volunteers and Neighborhood Team Leaders as possible.
But I need the funds to do it.
Please Contribute $25 before 11:59 PM Tonight.

77 Days Until the November Election
Hello,
Thousands of Californians are being told to prepare for MORE blackouts. As the California heat wave continues, now more than ever Californians need power.
Newsom and the Sacramento Democrats' failed leadership has led to rolling blackouts this weekend with the threat of more to come. We must STOP the #NewsomBlackouts.
These blackouts are unacceptable. Tell Gavin to leave the POWER ON.
Leave the Power On
Gavin has us all locked in our houses due to his failures managing COVID, and now he can’t even keep the lights on. Californians deserve better.

Hello,
We hope you are safe and healthy during this difficult time. We are all navigating the daily changes associated with these uncertain days, but we believe that we can face these challenges together while also working hard to elect Republicans throughout the state.
CONTRIBUTE TODAY>>>
As the Field and Political Director for the CAGOP, it is my job to make sure our resources are used efficiently to elect Republicans. We currently have two extremely important special elections in Southern California. The ballots have dropped, and election day is just days away.

We can WIN both of these seats with your help.

We can’t rely just on the phone calls to get us to 51% on May 12th. We NEED more mailers, tv ads, and Facebook ads to ensure California Republicans VOTE in these elections. These all cost money…

#  CAGOP Sues Newsom To Stop Ballot Harvesting
Hello,
While Californians continue to stay safe at home and social distance, Governor Gavin Newsom has dodged questions on the dangers of Ballot Harvesting with two critical special elections just days away. We are working hard to elect Republicans in Congressional District 25 and State Senate District 28, but need to make sure our volunteers and campaign workers stay safe.
The California Republican party has asked the courts to intervene because Newsom won't.
We need your support TODAY to fund this legal battle.

BACKGROUND
* On March 19, 2020, Gov. Gavin Newsom issued a statewide “Stay-at-Home Order” directing all California residents to shelter in place unless they were essential workers.
* As Californians look to participate in the upcoming special elections on May 12, the California GOP is now demanding Gov. Newsom make clear that his order prohibits ballot harvesting, which involves a stranger visiting a voter’s home and returning that voter’s ballot to the election officials.
* Strangers should not be going to voters’ homes to collect ballots, as it is a threat to the health and wellbeing of Californians and could increase the spread of COVID-19.
* Despite receiving a letter from the California GOP demanding answers weeks ago, Governor Newsom has been dodging the issue and putting Californians’ lives at risk.

King Newsom likes to hold press conferences and talk about his socialist agenda. Yet, in the middle of a pandemic with millions of unemployed Californians and thousands of businesses closed, KING NEWSOM supports an $11.5 billion a year property tax hike.
King Newsom has LOST IT again. While California families are struggling to put food on their tables, King Newsom and his cronies live like royalty. He will stop at nothing to DESTROY California.
Enough is enough. Californians are ready to end King Newsom’s reign. It’s time to tell King Newsom you are tired of his control.
We need to send a message to King Newsom. Chip in $35 today to help us put a stop to his tyrannical leadership.

55 Days Until the November Election
#  Happy Birthday California
Hello,
Today is California’s birthday. Now more than ever, we need to protect our beautiful Golden State from being DESTROYED by the radical Left-Wing Liberals.
Gavin Newsom and his Democrat cronies have California under their radical grasp. Skyrocketing housing costs, rising energy costs, high gas prices, and the worst-in-the-nation commute times are driving families apart. Too many Californians have left our state for better opportunities in other states.
More than 150,000 Californians sleep in shelters, cars or on the streets. California Democrats’ ever-increasing taxes and fees have created an increased income gap, a rapidly growing homeless population, and an unaffordable California. More than 16 million people live in deep financial distress and a third are enrolled in Medi-Cal. Gavin Newsom's lack of leadership is leaving Californians struggling.
California Republicans are working hard to STOP the Liberal Democrats, but we need your help, friend. Let’s give California the best birthday present and ELECT more Republicans who will RESTORE California. Chip in $35 to help us win in 2020.

We sincerely hope that you and your family are safe and healthy during this unprecedented and challenging time.
While we’re all focused on staying home and healthy, did you catch what Mike Bloomberg did? Bloomberg transferred $18 MILLION to the DNC! Liberal megadonors, like Bloomberg, are the reason why the Democratic Party is so corrupt. Funneling this money through the DNC is the ONLY reason California Democrats claim not to accept donations from PACs and megadonors. Could the Democrats be any shadier?

"We have a few ideas on what Gavin should talk about in his speech tonight
August 20, 2020
75 Days Until the November Election
Hello,
Did you hear Governor Gavin Newsom is set to give a speech this evening at the wacky Democratic National Convention? Instead of focusing on the rolling #NewsomBlackouts, out of control raging wildfires and his COVID management FAILURES, he will be speaking to a bunch of Left-Wing SOCIALISTS endorsing Sleepy Joe Biden for President.
We have a few ideas on what Gavin should talk about in his speech tonight…
Newsom's Talking Points
* Hundreds of thousands of Californians have still not received their EDD checks.
* Released over 18,000 felons into our neighborhoods.
* He listens to the unions, not parents, when it comes to California schools.
* California has the highest cost of living in our nation
* He closed millions of small businesses and provided them little relief or guidance - many which will never reopen again.
* California has more than half of all unsheltered homeless people in the country.
* As Mayor of San Francisco, he spent 1 billion on homelessness. Today, SF still has more homeless people than nearly any other city worldwide.
* He signed #AB5 , which killed millions of jobs for hairstylists, freelancers, and flex workers and drove companies like Uber and Tesla out of California
Our list could go on. We have had ENOUGH of Gavin and his failed progressive California policies. America doesn’t want to turn into the next California.
The RADICAL Democrats like Gavin Newsom want to destroy our country. We must DEFEAT them this November.
Republicans are ready to win BIG and re-elect President Trump. We can’t do it without your support, friend>.
Please contribute $35 to help us DEFEAT Gavin and his unpatriotic Democrat cronies.

Register to Vote Republican
The 229 Radical Democrats that voted to impeach President Trump are trying to undo the 2016 election. This is a TOTAL ATTACK on democracy. The Democrats don’t care about our freedom, which is why they have declared this impeachment war on President Trump.
These SOCIALIST Democrats HATE that Trump is pro-America. Any American patriot who believes that the socialist Democrats have left them behind needs to register Republican today.
Vote GOP for DJT
President Trump fights tirelessly for you, friend. He needs to know where you stand and if you are going to help re-elect him in 2020. We’re finalizing our list to show President Trump who will continue to support him in 2020.

March 2, 2020
1 Days Until the March 3rd Primary Election
Hello,
This is the best chance we have had in many years to replace Adam Schiff but we can only do it if all Republicans in California’s 28th Congressional District get out and vote for Eric Early in the March 3rd Primary Election.
The 28th District is comprised of West Hollywood, Hollywood, Los Feliz, Glendale, Burbank, Silverlake, Echo Park, La Cañada Flintridge, Montrose, Sunland, Tujunga and parts of Pasadena.
The March Primary Election is this Tomorrow, March 3rd.
For the last three years, Adam Schiff has been working to undermine our President, and we must vote for Eric Early to replace him in California’s 28th Congressional District.
Eric is a prominent Los Angeles attorney, a businessman who runs a nationally recognized 30 lawyer firm and has a great family. He has helped many Republicans in their campaigns, and now we all need to help him.
Every Republican must show up and vote for Eric Early on March 3 so he can take on Adam Schiff in the November election.
Eric Early is the endorsed Republican in the race, and along with having the California Republican Party endorsement, Eric has been endorsed by the L.A. County Republican Party, John and Ken, Dennis Praeger, former L.A. County Supervisor Mike Antonovich, former L.A. County D.A. Steve Cooley, former Governor Pete Wilson, the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association PAC and many other wonderful organizations and individuals.

Hello,
We hope this email finds you and your family healthy and safe. We are still working around the clock here at the CAGOP, and there is an important deadline that I wanted to make sure you were aware of.
The end of the month special election deadline for the special election is TONIGHT at 11:59PM. We are just 74 donations short of our fundraising goal and I noticed that you haven’t donated yet. I know Bryan has already talked to you about the importance of this fundraising deadline, but I can’t stress it enough. It is absolutely critical that we hit our goal.
If just 74 supporters like you contribute any amount, we will meet our fundraising goal for this special election.
Contribute $5 today before the End of the Month Special Election Deadline so we can turn the 25th Congressional District RED and ensure another Republican holds the 28th Senate District.

"Online donations are essential for many important programs we use to elect Republicans
June 4, 2020
152 Days Until the November Election
#  ALL CONTRIBUTIONS: 5X MATCHED
Hello,
Great news - I just got the green light to have all online donations 500% matched. This is an opportunity to have a HUGE impact with your contribution. If you have been thinking about helping elect Republicans, now is the time to do so. Opportunities like this do not come around very often.
Online donations are essential for many important programs we use to elect Republicans, like targeted ads and our voter contact efforts. Our historic victories last month would not have been possible without donations like yours. This election cycle is far from over and may be one of the most expensive in history, so we need all of the help we can get to defeat the liberal California Democrats. Chip in just $10 to have a $50 impact.

"The radical Democrats should be making California more affordable, not less.
July 1, 2020

Hello,
The Democrats are at it again with yet ANOTHER gas tax increase. California already has the highest gas prices in the nation. Will this tax increase actually fix our roads like they SAID, or is it another lie from the Democrats? Californians deserve to know where their tax money is going. The radical Democrats should be making California more affordable, not less.
SEND A MESSAGE >>>
Tell Gavin Newsom and the rest of the crazy Democrats you've had ENOUGH TAX INCREASES.

"Newsom and the California Democrats can’t keep the lights on
August 21, 2020
74 Days Until the November Election
#  #NewsomBlackouts
Hello,
As the California wildfires rage on, Californians are stuck without power thanks to Gavin Newsom. The #NEWSOMBLACKOUTS must come to an end. It’s clear Gavin is scrambling and panicking due to his unpreparedness to protect California.
Californians already pay 55% more on electricity than any other state in the nation. The RADICAL California Democrats' progressive ideas on renewable energy are the cause of this DISASTER. This is a warning to the rest of America about the risks of the Left-Wing Democrats' Green New Deal policies.
TELL GAVIN TO TURN THE LIGHTS ON
Newsom and the California Democrats can’t keep the lights on, accurately track COVID 19 cases, pay unemployment claims, get public education on track or support our economy. The Democrats' great California progressive experiment has FAILED.
California is the capital of poverty, homelessness, blackouts, and a failed response to COVID and the resulting economic crisis. Children aren’t learning because the teacher’s union is calling the shots. Californians aren’t working because the Democrats simply cannot manage these challenges.
End the #NewsomBlackouts
Where are the results Gavin Newsom promised? California’s struggling families and small businesses need answers.
Thank you,
CAGOP

"Thank you for making the primary election a success
March 4, 2020
244 Days Until the November Election
#  The California Comeback continues to roll after the March 3rd Primary
Hello,
Last night's California primary election was a huge success for the California Republican Party. I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for volunteering for us.
There are lots of votes yet to be counted and with democrats in control of the counting, we expect it to take a long time. But make no mistake, the early returns prove that your hard work, commitment and dedication helped several campaigns last night and put us in an excellent position to win races in November.
There are several races we are in an good position to flip red in November.
You will be hearing from us very soon on the candidates and races we will be focusing on for November but we can't wait for the dust to settle to share our excitement.
##
We are ready to flip several California districts Red. Thank you for your help.
The California Republican Party is committed to tackling Homelessness, Housing, and Affordability in the state but we need your continued help to keep our momentum going.
Onward to November.
Thank You,

"Nancy Pelosi is one of the most vocal supporters of keeping the American businesses and economy closed
September 2, 2020
62 Days Until the November Election
Hello,
Did you happen to see Nancy Pelosi's new haircut? That's right, footage was just released of Nancy Pelosi walking into a salon to get a haircut. Hairdressers in San Fransisco haven't been able to operate indoors for almost 6 months, but apparently Nancy Pelosi can just walk right in. The hypocrisy.
Nancy Pelosi is one of the most vocal supporters of keeping American businesses and the economy closed. Democrats, like Pelosi, have made exceptions to the rules time and time again. During the pandemic, Democrats have literally thrown Americans in jail for opening their salons and gyms. Even the owner of the salon said, ""It was a slap in the face that she went in, you know, that she feels that she can just go and get her stuff done while no one else can go in."" To top this whole ordeal off, PELOSI HAD HER MASK AROUND HER NECK.
This type of leadership is WRONG for California. Push back against Nancy Pelosi and contribute $35 today.

"Pelosi REFUSES to send the articles of impeachment to the Senate
California Republican Party
#  You're Guilty Nancy Pelosi
Friend,
Do you remember when Adam Schiff and Nancy Pelosi didn't want to hear from the Republicans and pushed for a speedy impeachment trial? It's been over TWO WEEKS since Nancy Pelosi and the far-left Democrats IMPEACHED President Trump!
The Democrats never wanted a fair trial... They wanted to play partisan politics.
Nancy Pelosi KNOWS this impeachment sham is a WITCH HUNT. Pelosi is wasting time by refusing to send the articles of impeachment to the Senate. She KNOWS that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell plans on throwing out the articles of impeachment!
Send a Message to Pelosi
Pelosi REFUSES to send the articles of impeachment to the Senate.
Tell Nancy Pelosi she is OBSTRUCTING the Senate!
Tell Pelosi She's Guilty

Friend,
Did you see the President's tweets? Gavin Newsom has failed California. Newsom and the Democrats have the power to fix the homeless CRISIS, but instead, they focus on making this state unaffordable.
Governor Newsom and the Democrats have neglected this crisis for too long. The Dems are forking out millions of dollars without a plan in sight. We need new leadership in California to tackle this CRISIS!
Under Gavin Newsom's leadership, homelessness has only gotten worse. Who do you think should solve the homeless crisis in California? Take the survey NOW!

Critical End of Month Deadline
#  End the violence from the left
Hello,
I work at the California Republican Party and I'm scared. The left's impeachment sham failed and now their anger has resulted in increased violence against Republicans.
In Florida, a man drove his van through a Trump campaign voter registration tent. The man allegedly told police, ""someone had to take a stand."" We need to stand up and elect Republicans to STOP this senseless violence.
In New Hampshire, a man was arrested for allegedly assaulting a 15-year-old Trump supporter and two adults near a polling site during the state’s primary election.
But the left's violence isn't limited to the East Coast.
CONTRIBUTE TODAY!
On the campus of UC Santa Cruz, violent protesters smashed a College Republican information table.
And a couple of weeks ago, a brazen vandal attacked the Humboldt County Republican Party Headquarters. He was charged with burglary, vandalism, attempted arson, and battery.
This cannot continue.

"This new plan would eliminate over 350,000 good paying jobs
September 24, 2020
40 Days Until the November Election
#  King Newsom
Hello,
King Newsom has officially LOST IT. I mean, we already knew he was out of his mind, but this is REALLY BAD. He recently signed a new Executive Order that will BAN the sale of new gas-powered vehicles.
Does he think we will be driving around in spaceships?
MILLIONS of Californians are out of work, thousands of businesses are closed, there is a backlog of 1.6 million unemployment claims, 19,000 firefighters are currently battling 27 major wildfires, and King Newsom wants to BAN the sale of new gas-powered cars.
This new plan would eliminate over 350,000 good-paying jobs in our oil and gas industry while ignoring the MILLIONS of already unemployed Californians and the tens of thousands of shuttered businesses.
Time and time again, King Newsom is focused on chasing headlines INSTEAD of focusing on the real problems caused by his TYRANNICAL rule.
He continues to use unilateral Executive Orders and strip us Californians from our freedoms and rights. King Newsom loves to issue edicts that hurt Californians. If King Newsom can’t even properly manage California, imagine if he were to RULE our entire COUNTRY. We can’t let that happen, Hello.
Contribute $35 to help us FIGHT against King Newsom’s tyranny.

Stand with us and join the California Comeback so we can put an END to King Newsom’s Reign. We will put a stop to his tyrannical actions from stomping on our rights.

"Last night, he had alerted statewide officials of his intent to close all beaches.
April 30, 2020
187 Days Until the November Election
#  Gov. Newsom backpedals on beaches
Hello,
Oops, Governor Newsom had to backpedal…again.
Earlier today, reports statewide – verified by the California Police Chiefs’ Association and local officials up and down the state – indicated that Governor Newsom would close all California beaches.
Because…it definitely makes sense to allow people to crowd into grocery stores but not let them responsibly enjoy the beautiful outdoors we are so lucky to have in California.
But then Governor Newsom backpedaled and only issued his arbitrary edict for Orange County. Despite his claim that this was always the plan, officials throughout the state called his bluff.
Last night, he had alerted statewide officials of his intent to close all beaches.
Although health officials consistently advocate a science based approach to addressing this pandemic – there is absolutely NO science that says responsibly enjoying fresh air and salt water will risk your life in Orange County – but not anywhere else.
And this arbitrary decision by our Governor shows we need new leadership.
Please donate today to help us stop Governor Newsom and his backpedaling.

"Gavin Newsom and his Democrat cronies have California under their Radical grasp
September 9, 2020
55 Days Until the November Election
#  Happy Birthday California
Hello,
Today is California’s birthday. Now more than ever, we need to protect our beautiful Golden State from being DESTROYED by the radical Left-Wing Liberals.
Gavin Newsom and his Democrat cronies have California under their radical grasp. Skyrocketing housing costs, rising energy costs, high gas prices, and the worst-in-the-nation commute times are driving families apart. Too many Californians have left our state for better opportunities in other states.
More than 150,000 Californians sleep in shelters, cars or on the streets. California Democrats’ ever-increasing taxes and fees have created an increased income gap, a rapidly growing homeless population, and an unaffordable California. More than 16 million people live in deep financial distress and a third are enrolled in Medi-Cal. Gavin Newsom's lack of leadership is leaving Californians struggling.
California Republicans are working hard to STOP the Liberal Democrats, but we need your help, friend. Let’s give California the best birthday present and ELECT more Republicans who will RESTORE California. Chip in $35 to help us win in 2020.

"There’s one big exception that continues to put California voters at risk
CAGOP
End of the Month Deadline
Hello,
As we move forward together during this difficult time, it is so important that we continue to listen to health care officials and practice social distancing. Everyone has done a great job staying home to flatten the curve.
There’s one big exception that continues to put California voters at risk – Ballot Harvesting. California Democrats refuse to discourage Democratic operatives' ballot harvesting in the two special elections currently taking place in Southern California. This means Democrats have no problem risking the safety and wellbeing of many Californians in the 25th Congressional District and the 28th Senate District.
CONTRIBUTE TODAY!
Ballot harvesting involves a campaign operative visiting a voter’s home and offering to return the voter’s ballot to elections officials. Because of the close personal contact involved, as well as the exchange of a document, this puts the voter and the ballot harvester at a much higher risk of spreading COVID-19. This is completely unacceptable.
Contribute Before the End of the Month Special Election Deadline
The CAGOP has prioritized the safety of California’s voters. In order for us to educate voters and ensure they return their own ballot, we have to make sure we can advertise as much as possible to voters in these two key districts.
Chip in $35 today before the End of the Month Special Election Deadline to help us WIN in Congressional District 25 and State Senate District 28!
Contribute $100
Contribute $50>>>

It is so important that we have a well-funded campaign to ensure victory in these two important districts.

"This new plan would eliminate over 350,000 good paying jobs
September 25, 2020
39 Days Until the November Election
#  King Newsom
Hello,
King Newsom has officially LOST IT. I mean, we already knew he was out of his mind, but this is REALLY BAD. He recently signed a new Executive Order that will BAN the sale of new gas-powered vehicles.
Does he think we will be driving around in spaceships?
MILLIONS of Californians are out of work, thousands of businesses are closed, there is a backlog of 1.6 million unemployment claims, 19,000 firefighters are currently battling 27 major wildfires, and King Newsom wants to BAN the sale of new gas-powered cars.
This new plan would eliminate over 350,000 good-paying jobs in our oil and gas industry while ignoring the MILLIONS of already unemployed Californians and the tens of thousands of shuttered businesses.
Time and time again, King Newsom is focused on chasing headlines INSTEAD of focusing on the real problems caused by his TYRANNICAL rule.
He continues to use unilateral Executive Orders and strip us Californians from our freedoms and rights. King Newsom loves to issue edicts that hurt Californians. If King Newsom can’t even properly manage California, imagine if he were to RULE our entire COUNTRY. We can’t let that happen, Hello.
Contribute $35 to help us FIGHT against King Newsom’s tyranny.
Contribute $10
Contribute $35 >>

Stand with us and join the California Comeback so we can put an END to King Newsom’s Reign. We will put a stop to his tyrannical actions from stomping on our rights.

We are less than 75 days from the November Election. Even though Governor Newsom’s name will not be on the ballot, we can stop his power grab by ELECTING more Republicans throughout the state. We WILL bring balance back to Sacramento.

"This is a critical time
March 29, 2020
219 Days Until the November Election
Hello,
First and foremost, I hope this email finds you and your family safe and healthy. This ‘new normal’ is a challenging time for all of us - and is changing our daily lives dramatically. But I wanted to provide you some updates on the California Republican Party and our successes and goals moving forward, because we WILL get through this, together.
The March 3rd California Primary brought significant success for the California Republican Party. We had strong showings in several targeted races that ensure we have strong candidates on the ballot in November - and, in fact, solidified that we are picking up at least one seat in the state Assembly. We are also successfully positioned to fight for two seats in a special election May 12th, and have had outstanding fundraising and built an infrastructure with staff and volunteers that put us on our path to victory.
We are all navigating the new reality brought to us with the Coronavirus pandemic. ""Stay at home"", ""flattening the curve"" and ""social distancing"" have become everyday phrases, and we see our families, friends and neighbors working together like never before to help each other through the “Stay at Home” orders issued for California.
This is the new normal, and we are working hard to find new and creative ways to get our message out and elect more Republicans. We can't organize by knocking on doors in neighborhoods. We can't have volunteers come to our offices. There are no meetings or community events to engage with voters. Fundraising toward our critical end of quarter deadline is challenging.
While everyone is struggling with finding a new path and figuring out what this all means for themselves and their families, there is plenty of hope. The President secured a stimulus package to stabilize industries, offer small business relief, and provide cash for families. They have fast tracked a trial for a coronavirus treatment. And more tests are becoming available.
And while we continue to work together as a community to get through this unprecedented period, we must continue to prepare to fight for our Republican values in November.
I'm asking you, if you are able, please contribute to our end of quarter fundraising deadline today.
Contribute $100
Contribute $50>>>

###  Your generous contribution today will help us secure victories in November.
Thank you for all that you do. We'll get through this together.

"The more Americans have gotten to know Judge Amy Coney Barrett over the past few weeks, the more they approve of her nomination
October 22, 2020
12 Days Until the November Election
Hello,
This morning the Senate Judiciary Committee voted to move Judge Amy Coney Barrett one step closer to being a Supreme Court Justice.
Judge Amy Coney Barrett is a woman of unparalleled achievement, towering intellect, sterling credentials, and unyielding loyalty to the Constitution.
The more Americans have gotten to know Judge Amy Coney Barrett over the past few weeks, the more they approve of her nomination. Americans WANT and NEED the Senate to seat this highly qualified jurist to the bench without DELAY.
The Fake News Media will do anything to serve the RADICAL Democrat Party, whether it’s hiding their corruption or attacking the kids of a brilliant jurist poised to become the FIRST working mom to sit on the Supreme Court.
It’s time for Democrats to do their job, stop the delay tactics, and confirm Judge Amy Coney Barrett. Confirming Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court is critical to Making America Great Again.
Please contribute $35 to ensure President Trump’s re-election and support this incredible nominee.
Contribute $20
Contribute $35
Contribute $50
Contribute $75
Contribute $100
Let’s send a message to the Radical Left that we will not be silenced.
Thank you,

California Democrats will stop at nothing to see President Trump removed from office. Just last week, we saw Adam Schiff's sad excuse for why the Democrats want President Trump out of office. Schiff can try his hardest to drag out this SHAM, but the American people are tired of it.

Hello,
Now, more than ever before, the California Trailblazers NEED your support.
“The California Trailblazers Program is essential in the effort to revitalize California as it identifies and trains candidates throughout our state who are committed to the principles of efficient and accountable government, personal initiative, and free enterprise.
I’m impressed with the candidates Trailblazers recruits every election cycle as they continue to work tirelessly to better our local communities. I believe these leaders will provide the new and innovative ideas that our state needs.” - House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy
The goal of the California Trailblazers is simple:
RECRUIT
California Trailblazers, modeled after the successful national Young Guns program, successfully recruits, trains and elects Republicans to state legislative office.
Rigorous fundraising and campaign benchmarks are required before advancing to the next tier. As our members advance through the tiers, additional support is given to ensure a strong and competitive campaign.
TRAIN
The Trailblazer Program also provides resources of ongoing education for candidates to learn campaign fundamentals. Candidates will have access to industry professionals to assist in developing finance, grassroots, administrative, and political plans.
The program will supply quality fundraisers, coalition building experts, media training, issue briefings and more to ensure Trailblazer candidates have the tools to win on Election Day.

Friend,
The California Legislature is back in session on Monday which means the Democrats are back to DESTROY our state!
We know the Democrats plan on introducing an abundance of bad legislative proposals on day one. We highly doubt any bills from the left will fix any of our state's serious problems like homelessness or the cost of living. California Democrats deserve 100% of the blame for the failed policies that have devastated California.

"The CAGOP needs all the resources we can get our hands on to defeat as many Democrats as possible
CAGOP
END OF QUARTER DEADLINE
Hello,
As the Chairwoman of the California Republican Party, I am extremely excited about the progress we've made in sharing our vision for a better future for California. Californians are sick and tired of being forgotten about by RADICAL California Democrats. California Republicans continue to be focused on solving California's problems caused by them.
CONTRIBUTE TODAY
Our two HUGE Special Election victories made waves across the country. For the first time in over 20 years, California Republicans flipped a Congressional seat. We also held the 28th Senate District with a double-digit lead. It's clear that because of loyal Republicans like you, friend, we are READY to Take the Fight to the Democrats this November. We are feeling very optimistic going into the General Election.
Gavin Newsom and his Left-Wing Democrat cronies have FAILED California. He has continued to use the Coronavirus pandemic to shape the California election laws in favor of the Democrats. We promise to fight tooth and nail to ensure a FREE and FAIR election.
Contribute to EOQ>>
We are just over a month away from the November election, and we have the opportunity to record more historic victories. Our massive volunteer effort is well underway, helping us persuade and turn out voters across the state. So far, we have recruited more than 37,500 new volunteers and now have over 5 MILLION registered Republican Patriots.
The CAGOP needs all the resources we can get our hands on to defeat as many Democrats as possible. I'm asking you to chip in just $20 before the September End-of-Month fundraising deadline.

"Newsom doesn't know how to fix the homeless crisis!
California Republican Party
Friend,
Under Gavin Newsom’s FAILED leadership, California is suffering an unprecedented homelessness epidemic. You don’t need to look any farther than San Francisco, where then-Mayor Newsom spent $1.5 billion on homelessness and the problem got WORSE, to see that his policies don’t work. We need new leadership and real solutions - while Gavin Newsom just wastes hard-earned taxpayer money and the problem continues to get worse.
Now Newsom wants to spend ONE BILLION OF YOUR TAXPAYER DOLLARS ON THE HOMELESS! Newsom also wants President Trump and the Federal Government to give him federal land to send the homeless to. Californians want real solutions to the homeless crisis. California needs to pass sensible legislation that lowers the cost of living, creates affordable housing and creates more jobs.

"Do you stand with President Trump?
California Republican Party
Friend,
Are you watching this? Adam Schiff and his liberal House colleagues continue their attempt to overturn the 2016 election of President Trump!
It has been over three years since President Trump was sworn into office. For THREE years, these Democrats have been focused on petty politics instead of working to improve the lives the American people. Since the President has been in office, we have an economy that has continued to grow, more jobs, and improved international relations. The Democrats don't want to accept the truth that President Trump’s America is working for the American people.
California has 45 Democrats that voted to impeach President Trump. If we want to prevent another impeachment sham in the future, it's critical that we DEFEAT THE 45 DEMOCRATS in 2020. The responsibility lies on you, friend. Chip in $45 NOW to defeat the 45 California Democrats that voted to impeach President Trump!

#  WE’RE SUING GAVIN NEWSOM
Hello,
Once again, Gavin Newsom has used the pandemic to push the Democrats’ political agenda. Gavin Newsom’s executive order to mail ballots to all registered voters without necessary ballot safeguards is an illegal and brazen power grab ahead of November’s elections. To stop him we have filed a lawsuit with the RNC and the NRCC against Gavin Newsom and his illegal power grab.
It is vital that ballot integrity become a priority in California. Once again Newsom and the Democrats have threatened the security of our elections.
We must fight back against Gavin Newsom’s illegal power grab. Contribute $35 to the Election Integrity Legal Fund to help us protect the California elections from further Democrat meddling.

April 9, 2020
208 Days Until the November Election
Hello,
While we’re all focused on staying healthy and staying home until this challenging time is over, Democrats are hoping that you’ve forgotten everything they’ve done to stop Republicans from helping Americans.
Do you remember the 45 California Democrats that voted to impeach President Trump? We sure do! As we move forward through this difficult time, it’s critical that we remember that all 45 of those Democrats are up for election this November.
We have Republicans that are ready to defeat those 45 Democrats, but we need your help. It’s critical that we elect as many Republicans as possible, so we don’t see another SHAM impeachment from Nancy Pelosi and her cronies!
We have some really close races, friend, and you can play an important role. Chip in just $20 today so we can send a message to Pelosi that we’re tired of her partisan games.

20 Days Until the March 3rd Primary Election
#  Bernie Sanders vs. President Trump
Hello,
Did you catch the results of last night's primary in New Hampshire? The most radical Democrat on the campaign trail, Bernie Sanders, pulled ahead with a win.
Crazy Bernie is a real-life socialist! He even honeymooned in the SOVIET UNION back in the '80s! Sanders isn't a fan of democracy. Bernie wants you to be a socialist too, friend!
The Democratic Party has been taken over by the far-left socialists like Bernie Sanders and AOC! Socialism does not belong here in America. In 2020, we need to vote to defeat socialism! Are you going to take a stand against the radical socialist Democrats?
2020 ELECTION
Who would you vote for in the 2020 general election in November?
PRESIDENT TRUMP
CRAZY BERNIE

March 17, 2020
231 Days Until the November Election
Hello,
During these challenging times we want everyone to be smart and safe. First and foremost, we hope for health and safety for you, your family and your community as we all face these uncertain and changing times. For guidance on how to protect yourself and your community from Coronavirus, please see recommendations and guidelines from the CDC.
CDC GUIDELINES
Like many offices around California, we have moved temporarily to a remote work environment. However, the CAGOP remains fully open and operational, and will continue to focus on the important work of electing officials who will help forge the path towards helping all Californians live their best lives.
As we all continue to navigate these changing and uncertain times, please follow our Facebook, Instagram and Twitter accounts for any updates. With that in mind, we are currently exploring all options for potentially postponing our May 2020 Spring Training Convention, and will keep everyone updated as we finalize those decisions. You can also email us with questions or concerns at [[URL REDACTED]] or [[URL REDACTED]]  and we will get you answers as soon as they are available.
We are continuing to work with our partners and grassroots team around the state on various projects, and will continue to do so during this period of disruption. We believe that protecting our fellow Californians’ health and safety, and preparing to win elections this fall, are not mutually exclusive, and we will continue to advance both of those objectives during this challenging time.

Bernie Sanders wants America to be a socialist country! Are you willing to let this happen? Bernie Sanders and the Democrats will stop at nothing to try and make you a socialist. They may call it ""Democratic Socialism,"" but we all know this is still socialism.

Hello,
The Democrats are at an all-time low. For years now, the alt-left has been taking over the Democratic Party. Today's Democrats are not the Democrats of even 4 years ago, these Democrats are ones filled with hate. Now more than ever, it is critical that we defeat as many Dems as possible at the ballot box.
Over the last few years, California Democrats like Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff have incited violent threats towards Republicans. Everywhere you turn, you see constant attacks from the left. Respect for our country is nonexistent with today's Democrats.
The looming threat of the modern Democrats is here, but we have the chance to protect our democracy before it's too late. Contribute $35 today to defeat the alt-left and help us elect as many Republicans as possible.

Hello,
King Newsom loves to control every aspect of Californians' livelihoods. While California families struggle to put food on their tables, King Newsom lives like royalty. He will stop at nothing to destroy California. He doesn’t care that our roads are in complete disrepair, homelessness continues to plague our communities and we have the highest cost of living in the Nation. And our reward? King Newsom will raise our taxes AGAIN.

Enough is enough. Tell King Newsom you are tired of his control.

#  Pass Coronavirus Relief
Hello,
Americans need relief, and they need it now. They need our leaders to work together to address this unprecedented crisis immediately. But, instead, Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democrats are trying to pack this bill with an unrelated Democrat wish-list - and they’re inserting petty partisan politics into a debate that should be focused solely on helping America through one of the most challenging times in our nation’s history.
Sign the Petition to tell Senate Democrats to pass Coronavirus Relief Stimulus.
Sign the Petition
Democrats voted against working class Americans in the form of denying them $1.8 Trillion in assistance.
* Democrats Voted No on direct payments to families ($1,200 for adults making under 75k)
* Democrats Voted No on funding for hospitals
* Democrats Voted No on supporting unemployment funding
* Democrats Voted No on small business relief
Pass the Bill>>>
Tell Senate Democrats that you want them to pass the bipartisan bill for Coronavirus Relief Stimulus.
Thank you for your support.
Stay safe and healthy.

"Nancy Pelosi is one of the most vocal supporters of keeping the American businesses and economy closed
September 2, 2020
62 Days Until the November Election
Hello,
Did you happen to see Nancy Pelosi's new haircut? That's right, footage was just released of Nancy Pelosi walking into a salon to get a haircut. Hairdressers in San Fransisco haven't been able to operate indoors for almost 6 months, but apparently Nancy Pelosi can just walk right in. The hypocrisy.
Nancy Pelosi is one of the most vocal supporters of keeping American businesses and the economy closed. Democrats, like Pelosi, have made exceptions to the rules time and time again. During the pandemic, Democrats have literally thrown Americans in jail for opening their salons and gyms. Even the owner of the salon said, ""It was a slap in the face that she went in, you know, that she feels that she can just go and get her stuff done while no one else can go in."" To top this whole ordeal off, PELOSI HAD HER MASK AROUND HER NECK.
This type of leadership is WRONG for California. Push back against Nancy Pelosi and contribute $35 today.

"Once again, Gavin Newsom has used the pandemic to push the Democrats’ political agenda
May 28, 2020
159 Days Until the November Election
#  WE’RE SUING GAVIN NEWSOM
Hello,
Once again, Gavin Newsom has used the pandemic to push the Democrats’ political agenda. Gavin Newsom’s executive order to mail ballots to all registered voters without necessary ballot safeguards is an illegal and brazen power grab ahead of November’s elections. To stop him we have filed a lawsuit with the RNC and the NRCC against Gavin Newsom and his illegal power grab.
It is vital that ballot integrity become a priority in California. Once again Newsom and the Democrats have threatened the security of our elections.
We must fight back against Gavin Newsom’s illegal power grab. Contribute $35 to the Election Integrity Legal Fund to help us protect the California elections from further Democrat meddling.
Contribute $10
Contribute $35 >>
Contribute $50
Contribute $75
Contribute Other
If we do not put a stop to Newsom’s executive order in the courts, ballots will be sent to voters with invalid registrations, voters who have moved, and voters who have passed away up and down the state. Contribute $35 to the Election Integrity Legal Fund before it’s too late.
Thank You,
CAGOP
