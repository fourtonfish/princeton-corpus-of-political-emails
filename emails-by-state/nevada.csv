This special session must be about people, not politics.
As legislators meet to deal with the $1.2 Billion budget shortfall, the top priority needs to be remembering that Nevada families are struggling.

UPDATE:
NEVADA REPUBLICANS PUT A STOP TO NEW TAX BILL
Late last night a new tax bill was killed thanks to Nevada Republicans.
“The bill passed the Assembly 29-13, on party lines, before faltering again along party lines in a late-night hearing in the Senate. With a 13-8 Senate vote, the bill failed to garner the two-thirds majority needed to pass it.”
“But the bill’s fast rise through the Legislature was slapped down by Senate Republicans, many of whom signaled early on in the day that they would oppose the proposal.”
\- The Nevada Independent

Nevada's vote-by-mail primary stirs fraud concerns, as unclaimed ballots pile up: 'Something stinks here'
Read the full story here >>
""Red flags are being raised about the all-mail voting system being used in Nevada’s most populous county ahead of the state’s June 9 primary election amid reports that thousands of ballots are being sent to inactive voters -- fueling concerns about the possibility of voter fraud and ballot harvesting.""
'This just seems fraudulent to me, something stinks here.'— Jenny Trobiani, a postal worker in Clark County
“The Clark County Registrar made the right decision in moving to mail ballots to all registered voters -- not just those deemed ‘active,’ expanding the number of in-person polling locations, and updating their signature review process,” Nevada Democrats said in a statement earlier this month.
""According to the court filing, the changes will cost county taxpayers at least $323,000.""

“Anyone can turn in a ballot they pick off the ground,” Keith Schipper, the Nevada Trump Victory communications director, told Fox News. “This is a dangerous proposition.”
Schipper added that with Democrats vowing to continue legal action to overturn the state’s ban on ballot harvesting, Republicans are concerned about how the issue will affect the outcome of November’s presidential election in a key battleground state.
“They made it pretty clear they will continue with the lawsuit to make sure they get what they want for the November election,” Schipper added.

""In Orange County, Calif. – once seen as a Republican stronghold in the state – every House seat went to a Democrat after an unprecedented 250,000 vote-by-mail drop-offs were counted, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.""
“People were carrying in stacks of 100 and 200 of them. We had had multiple people calling to ask if these people were allowed to do this,” Neal Kelley, the registrar for voters in Orange County, said at the time.

CRITICAL: LAST END OF QUARTER DEADLINE OF THE ELECTION
QUICK DONATE TO BEAT THE DEADLINE >>
I wanted to send you a quick update about what we raised before the debate last night.
We did ok, but we’re still short of what we need. We’re short $3,792 to be exact.
The reason this is so bad is that we have our END OF QUARTER FEC DEADLINE TONIGHT and everyone is going to be watching to see how motivated Nevadans are to support Republicans across the state and down the ballot.
This is our LAST END OF QUARTER DEADLINE BEFORE ELECTION DAY and the most important deadline we have in an election year. If we don’t raise the $3,792 it will be BAD.
Knowing that, a generous donor has offered to 5X MATCH all contributions that come in before the FEC FILING DEADLINE tonight at midnight!
Can we ask you to please contribute just $5, $15, $25, $50, or $100 more to utilize the 5X match and help us raise what we need?
Chip-in here: [[URL REDACTED]]
The next 34 days decide it all and these dollars raised are what fund our operation through to victory. Make sure we raise this TODAY.

MEMO:
END OF YEAR REPORT: 2019
TO: GRASSROOTS FIELD TEAM
Patriot --
As one of our activists on the ground, I wanted to write you a quick update on where we are now that we’ve wrapped up 2019.
Impeachment made the End of Quarter FEC Deadline more important than ever, and as we get closer to the Feb 22nd Democrat Presidential Caucus here in Nevada there is a lot resting on our shoulders here at the Nevada Republican Party.
That’s why our financial situation is so important right now. We had a record-breaking year, far outraising opponents and reaching heights we’ve never reached before. However, we were short.
I’ll put it plainly -- we aren’t where we need to be knowing that ALL NATIONAL EYES WILL BE ON US for the “First in the West” Democrat Presidential Caucus coming up.
With that said, I’m asking you for a special donation of $3 or more to help raise what we need. Can I count on you?
Quick Donate Here >>
We still need $6,500 more to prepare to have ALL NATIONAL EYES ON US!
We can’t mess this up. Will you pitch-in? Here's the quick donate link: [[URL REDACTED]]
As you know, Democrat Presidential Candidates have been spending HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS here in Nevada. Filling our airwaves with lies, threats, and FAKE NEWS. We have to fight back and set the record straight about what’s right for Nevadans.
I cannot stress enough how crucial this is.
We need every Battle Born patriot in this fight -- And YOU are a pivotal part of our strategy. Can we count on you to help us make this happen?
Quick Donate Here >> [[URL REDACTED]]
It’s up to us to get this right.
Are you with me?

2. Give a huge shout-out to the donors who stepped up to help us out-fundraise Nevada Democrats over the weekend. WOW. What an incredible group of patriots!
The great news is that we reached our goal and then some and it’s all because of Nevadans who donated to make sure we saw this deadline through over the weekend. We are lucky to have you on our team.
For those who missed my email over the weekend about needing to raise $20,000 to catch up with the Nevada Democrats - don’t worry, there is still an opportunity to chip-in to help.
You’re the first to hear about this because I always want to make sure you get the exclusive inside scoop before everyone else -- there is a TRIPLE MATCH in effect today.
Here’s the link to secure donate and have your contribution worth 3X: [[URL REDACTED]]
The weekend deadline is over but please take advantage of the TRIPLE MATCH in effect that will only last until 11:59 PM tonight. The purpose of the match is to help show the Biden team that we have more momentum than them, even during their own convention. (You’ll see another email about it later that we’re sending to everyone).
So make sure to give $5, $15, $25, $150 or whatever you can now.
Just think how embarrassing it’s going to be for Democrats when we raise more than them in Battleground states during THEIR convention.

My opponent isn’t even from my district. She was hand-picked by the Democrat Majority Leader (the Nancy Pelosi of Nevada) for her strong anti-second amendment stance and then moved to our district just to run for office...

Will you help pitch-in to make sure we flip State Senate District 5 BACK TO RED? It’s CRITICAL that we flip this seat or we could lose the State Majority … AGAIN.
I still need 52 low dollar donors to get where we need to be. Can I count on you to pitch-in $5 now to be one of them?
Chip-in $5 To MAKE NEVADA RED AGAIN
You and I both know that principles matter. That’s why fighting to protect our Second Amendment Rights isn’t the only reason we have to win this fight. Just look at what the Democrats pushed through at the State Legislature here in Nevada since they’ve been in charge:
* Passed 67 anti-business bills targeting both Nevada businesses directly and our state’s business environment
* Lowered penalties on violent felons
* Removed accountability and killed School Choice
* Spent more time on their own pay raise than they did teachers’
* Tried to make Nevada a Sanctuary State
* Created legislation that allows criminals to sue homeowners if they get hurt burglarizing YOUR home
* Pushed through an illegal new tax on Nevadans
This could be the easiest seat to flip this year, but I need your help. Can I count on you to give just $5 today?
Need to know more about me? As an educator married to a police officer, I know how important safety and education are to Nevada families.
I’m passionate about our freedoms, allowing small businesses to thrive, and about improving our education system.
With two sons in the military, supporting our Veteran and military heroes is close to my heart. Ensuring their benefits should be job number one, whether it’s expanding access to childcare or working with small businesses to hire more veterans. We can do more to take care of those who have sacrificed for our country.
The bottom-line is I love our great state and we have a tremendous opportunity this year to represent Nevada’s working families and create a BETTER Nevada education system.
Are you with me?
Democrat leadership has sold US out to a handful of groups who spend millions of dollars lobbying them and keeping them in power.
We are the party of the families, the workers, and of the American Dream. We need to tell our story. Are you with me?

Governor Steve Sisolak made another horrible decision regarding the COVID-19 Response this week. He put the Lord of Layoff in charge of Nevada’s economic response …
SIGN THE PETITION: Tell Governor Sisolak that the Lord of Layoffs is the wrong choice to lead our economic response
Sisolak announced former MGM Resorts International CEO Jim Murren will head a public-private partnership—called the COVID-19 Response, Relief and Recovery Task Force—to address Nevada’s economic response.
Sisolak is so out of touch that he chose the Lord of Layoffs to manage an economic crisis..
Jim Murren is the guy that accepted a $32 million payoff to leave his role at MGM a month ago, only to lay off MGM’s employees weeks later with only a promise to pay them for two weeks. Did Sisolak ask Murren about the $32 million pay off and whether he would forego it so that MGM’s workforce can receive a paycheck during this unprecedented shutdown?
This is leadership at its worst. We have to tell Governor Sisolak what a bad choice this was. Add your name to the petition telling Governor Sisolak that the Lord of Layoffs was the WRONG choice to lead Nevada’s economic response!
Sign here >>
SIGN THE PETITION: Tell Governor Sisolak that the Lord of Layoffs is the wrong choice to lead our economic response
Why does Sisolak think Murren, the Lord of Layoffs, is a good face for Nevada’s economic response?
Murren’s business practices also cast a dark shadow on Sisolak’s task force. The MGM CEO sued victims of 1 October less than a year after the worst mass shooting in U.S. history, and laid off over a thousand employees in 2019.
Jim Murren is a failed CEO who is profiting during a time of economic turmoil while his former employees stress over how they are going to keep a roof over their head.
“When things started breaking apart, [Murren] made sure he put his golden parachute together. That’s not fair”
-Anonymous part-time employee at Aria, Las Vegas Review Journal
SIGN THE PETITION: Tell Governor Sisolak that the Lord of Layoffs is the wrong choice to lead our economic response
Overall, Governor Sisolak's FAILED leadership is becoming more and more obvious by the day. At a time when Nevadans are looking for clarity from state leadership during an unprecedented pandemic, Gov. Steve Sisolak has repeatedly fumbled his response with confusing directives.
Sisolak’s confusing directives stand in stark contrast to President Trump’s bold and aggressive approach to handling the coronavirus outbreak.
From closing our borders, partnering with the private sector, and negotiating a nearly $2 trillion relief package, President Trump is delivering for Americans.
This is the time to take a stand and choose the RIGHT leadership for Nevada and for our nation.
We hope to see your name on the list standing with us.

“Democrats are trying to keep President Trump from speaking to voters because they know the enthusiasm behind his re-election campaign cannot be matched by Joe Biden - a historically weak candidate controlled by the radical left who could hold a campaign event in a broom closest. The President’s uplifting message of American greatness resonates with people, while everyone knows that Biden is a tool of the radical left who would raise taxes and tank the incredible comeback that is already underway. President Trump will be traveling to Nevada on the dates planned. Additional details will be announced soon.”
Show Democrats like King Sisolak that we WILL NOT BE BULLIED AND SILENCED INTO SUBMISSION.

Nevada GOP Unveils ‘DNC Big Rig’ Outside Bernie Sanders' Events in Nevada
With the DNC meddling in the election, the NVDems having transparency problems, and the last minute overhaul of the Democrat Nevada Caucus system (that seems to be rigged against Bernie Sanders) ...

Subject: Highly Concerning: Clark County is making their own voting rules
Nevada GOP
ALERT: HEARING SCHEDULED
Clark County is not allowing Republicans to watch the ballot counting process and it is our RIGHT to meaningfully observe!
The Nevada Republican Party and President Donald Trump’s re-election campaign filed a lawsuit against Clark County on Friday, alleging the county has violated state election law during its counting of mail-in ballots
Quick Donate to the Legal Defense Fund >>
Under the law, we have the right to meaningfully observe ballot processing. Clark County Election Department is stripping those rights away from the people.
As such, we joined with the Trump Campaign to file a lawsuit against Clark County to stop counting mail ballots until our case can be made. They declined our request to stop the count before a ruling can be made, but we still have our hearing scheduled for Wednesday.
It is the LAW for a reason. This protects our vote and their assault on our voter rights is yet another assault on election integrity. Will you help fund our lawsuit and chip-in to the LEGAL DEFENSE FUND NOW?
And even more terrifying, after promising signature matching would safeguard mail-in ballots, Clark County has lowered the standard to catch forges!
We will NOT sit back and watch our election go by without proper checks and balances … THE PUBLIC.
Will you?

UPDATED STORY:
Republicans sue Clark County over mail ballot counting
Judge denies request to stop mail ballot counting in Clark County
By Rory Appleton Las Vegas Review-Journal
A Carson City judge Friday denied to halt ballot counting in Clark County in response to a lawsuit filed by Republicans that contends the county has violated state election law.
The Nevada Republican Party and President Donald Trump’s re-election campaign filed the lawsuit against Clark County Registrar Joe Gloria and Nevada Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske on Friday. The lawsuit asked a judge to stop the counting and verification of mail ballots until the case could be heard.
But Attorney General Aaron Ford, whose office defends Cegavske in litigation, tweeted Friday afternoon that his office had “defeated President Trump’s and Nevada GOP’s request for a temporary restraining order to stop the counting of the ballots.”
CONTRIBUTE TO THE LEGAL DEFENSE FUND
Ashley M. Forest, a spokeswoman for Ford’s office, said Judge James Wilson denied the temporary restraining order. A hearing on the lawsuit has been scheduled for next week, however. Cegavske’s office declined to comment on the lawsuit.
Former Attorney General Adam Laxalt, a Trump co-chair for Nevada, said the campaign’s primary issue is with how the required voter signatures on the outside of mail ballot envelopes are verified in Clark County. In order for a ballot to be counted, the signature on the envelope must match the signature on file with the county’s election office.
CONTRIBUTE TO THE LEGAL DEFENSE FUND
Laxalt Tweet
Laxalt said the county uses a machine that only matches signature verification at 40 percent — lower than the 50 percent recommended setting by its manufacturer and the standards in other Nevada counties. He also questioned the training and expertise of staff tasked with checking signatures that the machine declines.
Laxalt said both major parties also have no way of challenging any mail-in ballot signatures as they are verified in this process — a right which he said they do have during in-person voting. Once a ballot is verified, it is separated from its envelope, and the two can not be reunited.
He cited the Bush v. Gore decision in the U.S. Supreme Court that settled the 2000 election in saying that Clark County’s more relaxed standards are “diluting” the votes cast in other counties, which is not legal. Different counties in the same state may not have different standards for rejecting ballots, he said.
Laxalt also challenged the county’s current ballot rejection rate of a little more than 1 percent. “If it’s true all 99 percent are valid voters — their signatures match and they are legally able to vote — then for sure they should count,” Laxalt said. “But we know we have 85,000 voters who shouldn’t be on the rolls — people who’ve died or moved and the rolls haven’t been cleaned. So it strains credibility than only 2,000 of the first 200,000 (mail-in ballots) have been rejected.”
Republicans criticize mail ballots
Other complaints in the lawsuit match those in a letter sent by Republican lawyers to Cegavske earlier this week. The letter claimed the county was not allowing observers into all of the rooms in which ballots are handled, was positioning observers too far away for “meaningful observation” and would not allow the GOP to place cameras in observation areas. State law allows for members of the public to observe ballot counting and processing at county offices.
The party accused the county of failing to be transparent during a newly adopted election format.
State and national Republicans, including Trump himself, have routinely criticized both state Democrats, who adopted new election standards given the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and mail-in balloting, which they say increases chance of ballot fraud.
Experts have said mail balloting is safe, and Cegavaske testified earlier this year that her office did not find any fraud during the state’s all-mail primary election in June. So far, mail ballots have trended heavily in Democrats’ direction. Statewide, 160,125 Democrats have mailed in ballots compared to 74,384 Republicans as of Friday.
In Clark County, 107,928 Democrats and 38,355 Republicans have mailed in ballots. Republicans have begun to outpace Democrats in in-person early voting, however, cutting the statewide Democratic lead from 17 percentage points to about 11 points over the course of the week.
Clark County is largely Democratic and holds the lion’s share of the state’s voters, while the rural counties — whose votes Laxalt claims are being “diluted” — tend to lean more Republican.
Access granted
In response to the lawsuit, Clark County spokesman Dan Kulin said the election department “has gone above and beyond to provide access to observers,” creating additional observation areas beyond what is required under state law. “The lawsuit includes many misleading or inaccurate claims,” Kulin said.
Kulin said the room Republicans complain about being denied access to is, in fact, a call center for reaching out to voters who need to fix, or “cure,” issues with their mail-in ballots. Because election staff may discuss personal information with voters over the phone, observation is not permitted. The call center does not house any ballots, Kulin said.
The county believes the request for cameras in observation areas is likely not legal under state law, with Kulin adding that it is also inappropriate to allow one party to have exclusive access and control over cameras during the election.
Kulin said this process is administered by two-person, bipartisan counting boards. The ballots are not removed from their privacy sleeves until their envelopes have been stored in a secure location. Any ballots with problems are not returned to their envelope, but rather a separate folder. “At no time is the envelope with the voter’s name sought or used in this step of the process,” Kulin said.
The Republican lawsuit also misrepresents how ballots are verified, first by machine and then by hand, according to Kulin.
The number 40 does not refer to a percentage, but rather a scored setting based on factors such as writing style, the slant of the letters and how someone crosses their t’s. And there is no manufacturer’s recommended setting, Kulin said; jurisdictions across the country use a wide variance.
As of Friday, 30 percent of mail ballots have been accepted by the machine’s settings, meaning 70 percent have been personally verified by election staff, Kulin said.
Democrats respond to lawsuit
Nevada State Democratic Party Chairman William McCurdy II said the lawsuit was “an obvious attempt to impede record-breaking momentum in Clark County, the most diverse county in the state.”
He said Trump and his allies have resorted to “baseless attacks to undermine confidence in Nevada’s election integrity” and our making one last, desperate play as Democrats hold an early advantage. “The demands articulated in the GOP’s lawsuit amount to voter suppression, plain and simple,” McCurdy said.
The Trump campaign and the Nevada Republican Party also sued to try to invalidate the mail-balloting system before the election, but that lawsuit was rejected by the Nevada Supreme Court. And a federal lawsuit against Assembly Bill 4, which authorized sending mail ballots to all active registered voters during a pandemic, was similarly rejected by a federal judge.

RNC Chairwoman McDaniel & Nevada Republican Party Demand Investigation into Nevada Election Chaos and Democrats’ Shady Backroom Deal
With the ballot harvesting lawsuit underway and the Democrats’ shady backroom deals that have led to inactive ballots strewn across the ground at apartment complexes and in garbage cans for anyone to fill out … we need to keep up our important fight to protect voter rights and election integrity.
THE LATEST:
In a letter sent yesterday to Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford, RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, in partnership with the Nevada Republican Party, demanded an investigation into troubling events in Clark County that may have violated Nevada’s open public meeting and election laws.
ADD YOUR NAME TO THE LETTER DEMANDING AN INVESTIGATION >>
The letter sent today demands that Attorney General Ford:
1. Investigate under NRS 241.039 whether the Clark County Commissioners violated Nevada’s open public meeting law when they decided, behind closed doors, to capitulate to the Democrats’ demands without notifying, broadcasting, or allowing citizens to provide their input.
2. Investigate which Clark County officials made this decision, when it was made, and which outside groups were consulted in the manner.
3. Investigate whether local officials have maintained the election’s integrity with the decision to send ballots to all inactive voters.
4. Investigate if civil penalties should be instituted against anyone who has tried to exploit these circumstances under provision NRS Title 24.
We all know why the Democrats are doing this. They want to remove election safeguards so that they have more of a chance of winning in November.
It’s shady, and it’s wrong.
Fight back with us. Add your name to the letter demanding an investigation.
Thank you,

"Endorse President Trump for President!
Nevada GOP
The Democrat harassment, Fake News attacks, and blatant lies have never been about President Trump…
Their target has always been me and you.
But President Trump takes the hits from the media and lying Democrats to help stand up for you and me.
Now it’s our turn to stand up and support our President. Will you sign here to ENDORSE DONALD J. TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT?
Endorse Donald J. Trump for President
Just take a look at everything he has accomplished so far:
* Brought two radical ISIS leaders to justice
* Appointed two conservative Supreme Court Justices
* Implemented the Nation’s most historic tax cuts
* Rebuilt our Nation’s military
* Strengthened our borders like never before - the WALL is being FINISHED
* And, so much more!
ENDORSE DONALD J. TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT >>
The Liberal Swamp hates the idea of people like us being in charge of America, and there is no line they won’t cross to prevent that from happening (we’ve seen it again and again).
Now, heading into November, we have to show our strength and support on the ground. Prove that we have President Trump’s back and that he has our endorsement and our vote in November!
Thank you for standing with us and especially with our President, Donald J. Trump!
-Nevada Republican Party
P.S. We want to have a LONG list of Nevada Patriots who stand in support of our President. Can we add your name to the ENDORSE PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP LIST now?

Nevada GOP
Is our state next?
Read the full story from Fox News below:
Fox News Headline
BY RON BLITZER:
Homeowners, beware.
State and local governments scrambling to raise money during the economic crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic are looking to increased property taxes -- as well as wealth taxes and more -- to fill budget holes.
TELL NEVADA LEGISLATORS NO NEW TAXES!
BAD BILL FIGHT BACK FUND
The proposals come as officials are trying to strike a balance. Historic job losses caused by lockdowns fueled the downturn that's put the squeeze on city and state budgets. Washington sought to offset this with stimulus payments, additional unemployment benefits, business grants and more. Any push to raise taxes too dramatically could hurt the economy even more.
But some officials argue that increases are unavoidable.
Property tax rates in Nashville, Tenn., will be increasing by 34 percent in what Mayor John Cooper described as a “painful but necessary” move that will raise money for the city, which has taken a hit during the pandemic.
Elsewhere, the debate is raging.
This November, Californians will vote on whether to strip decades-old protections from commercial and industrial properties. Since 1978, tax reassessments to the fair market value of California property have only been done when the property is sold or there is new construction. Otherwise, assessments are capped at increases of 2 percent a year. The new measure, if approved, would make exceptions from this for industrial and non-agricultural commercial property, requiring them to be reassessed to fair market value at least every three years.
SIGN THE PETITION: TELL NEVADA LEGISLATORS NO NEW TAXES!
BAD BILL FIGHT BACK FUND
CORONAVIRUS IN THE US: STATE-BY-STATE BREAKDOWN
In Chicago, Mayor Lori Lightfoot said property tax increases are “on the table” to help address budgetary problems that include a projected shortfall of nearly $700 million that she said could become even greater.
“Those are the last choices and tools that I want to use, but I can’t take any of them off the table,"" she said.
In Texas, Dallas lawmakers were considering a massive property tax hike of as much as 8 percent but needed the city council to pass a measure allowing them to increase rates by more than 3.5 percent. In May, the resolution failed after a 12-3 vote.
“I want to take this option off the table,"" City Council member Cara Mendelsohn said, according to local NBCDFW. ""And if we were to pass this resolution and we were to increase taxes even close to this amount, we would be creating the next disaster for Dallas.”
Other areas are looking at different methods of increasing revenue, such as wealth taxes. A New York state senator from Queens said in May that “the only people who actually have money right now are billionaires,” and introduced a bill that would treat capital gains as income and would tax unrealized capital gains.
That money would not be used for existing programs, however. The funds raised by the increased taxes on billionaires would go to a new “worker bailout fund” that would provide monthly payments of $3,300 for people who do not qualify for unemployment benefits or CARES Act payments.
Other New York state lawmakers are pushing for income tax hikes for those who earn more than $5 million.
SIGN THE PETITION: TELL NEVADA LEGISLATORS NO NEW TAXES!
BAD BILL FIGHT BACK FUND
In Seattle, a new measure approved by the City Council will add a tax on companies with at least $7 million in annual payroll. The “JumpStart Seattle” tax will tax businesses up to 2.4 percent on Seattle-based employees who earn more than $150,000. The bill specifically references the emergency conditions imposed by the pandemic.
Last week, New Jersey approved a plan to borrow up to nearly $10 billion to address a massive budget shortfall. Republicans have warned that this could lead to an increase in property taxes or a wealth tax, while Gov. Phil Murphy has said that if the state does not borrow, he would “have no choice but to raise property taxes,” according to [[URL REDACTED]]

Fellow Patriot,
King Sisolak is doing everything he can to help Democrats down the ballot WIN here in Nevada and he’s doing it the same way he won in 2018 -- with OUTSIDE SPECIAL INTEREST DONORS FUNDING HIS CAMPAIGN.
Don’t let them buy our great state. Make sure we secure victories for Republicans all the way down the ballot.

FUND THE STRATEGY
The presidential contest isn’t the only critical race we need to win. We have really important House and State Senate races we also NEED to take back Republican majorities.
To do so, we have to use the right strategy.
As a key player, we wanted to keep you updated on our plan and ask you to fund and see our strategy through to the end.
The average donation our grassroots donors contribute is $36. Can we count on you to give a recurring weekly donation of $36 to help fund our program through Election Day on 11/3?
GIVE A RECURRING WEEKLY DONATION OF $36 >>
GIVE A RECURRING WEEKLY DONATION OF $72 >>
GIVE A RECURRING WEEKLY DONATION OF ANOTHER AMOUNT >>
Every contribution makes an incredible difference, and each weekly recurring donation will make a HUGE impact on just how many seats, districts, and majorities we flip.
Here’s the strategy and plan currently underway:
* Targeting specific districts and seats we can know we can flip RED.
* Contacting as many voters as possible (We have already contacted over 2 MILLION!).
* Helping Republican candidates have the infrastructure and resources they need to see victory. Especially critical U.S. House races and State Senate races that can help us take back the Majority.
* Running a targeted voter registration program that helps ensure conservatives are registered and ready to vote.
* Organizing our get out the vote during a pandemic and with the last-minute rule change.
* Growing our Election Day Operation team ready to watch for voter fraud, problems at the polls, and more.
* Placing digital ads to fight the fake news and liberal lies.
* Expanding our internships and team recruitment for the incredible growth we’ve been seeing every day.
* And more!
Each of these important strategies has a specific plan in place that will tip the scales in our favor. But we have to fund it. Can we count on you to help us by giving $36 a week until 11/3?
Your contribution means everything to our grassroots team and will make the difference in our fight against outside special interest groups trying to BUY our great state.
Don’t let us lose this battle.
Fight back and show King Sisolak and his special interest pals that we won’t stand for this anymore.

Nevada is a swing state but we’re seeing a trend:
Every time Nevada votes blue, outside special interest groups spent heavily in the state and BOUGHT the election.
When I say bought, I’m talking about big names like Bloomberg and George Soros. Not to mention celebrities and lobbyists that bought the state for their Democrat friends.
It’s sad. It’s sad that special interest groups instead of American patriots are deciding the future of our nation and states like Nevada.

BAD BILL ALERT: Legislators want to remove election safeguards & tie the hands of our law enforcement officers
All donations made to the FIGHT BACK FUND before the session will be TRIPLE MATCHED >>
We all know why Governor Sisolak and Democrats wanted this Special Session called:
In control of the State Senate Majority, Democrats are bringing a HEFTY liberal policy agenda into the legislative special session.
These are the BAD BILLS to watch for so far:
1. Outrageous restrictions against law enforcement that will tie their hands and put the safety of Nevadans at risk. Remember what happened in Seattle? Local government tied the hands of law enforcement, forcing them to tell small businesses they were on their own for protection. This can’t happen in Nevada.
2. Watch for changes to election laws that would REMOVE SAFEGUARDS that were originally put in place to protect Nevadans from voter fraud. If Democrats get their way ballots will be sent to the dead. (Yes, you read that right).
As the minority party, Republicans aren’t privy to all of the secret plans at play but as we hear of important bills and issues we will bring them to your attention.
Here at the Nevada GOP we are ALWAYS fighting to combat the radical policies of the liberal left here in our great state. The best part is, we have a group of generous donors willing to TRIPLE MATCH all contributions made before the session starts to help us FIGHT BACK.

I wanted to send this along because this disturbing threat should be deeply concerning for all Nevadans.

“Douglas County might have to pay the state back $8.9 million in federal coronavirus pandemic aid it received after it opted to allow President Donald Trump to hold a gathering at Minden-Tahoe Airport on Saturday in violation of the state’s restrictions on the size of public gatherings.
Gov. Steve Sisolak, in a call with reporters Wednesday, said he was “disappointed that Douglas County chose to allow the venue to host the event and go against the directives” and that the county’s aid allotment was being reviewed.
Chiming in on Sisolak’s behalf were Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen, U.S. Rep. Dina Titus and state Democratic Chairman William McCurdy II, who said in a statement that the president’s events “could undo the months of concerted efforts from Nevadans who have followed these directives, stayed home, and socially distanced when necessary to be outside their home.”

Fox News
Ex-Clinton lawyer threatens to sue Nevada unless ballot harvesting permitted
A prominent Democratic lawyer who represented Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign is threatening to sue the state of Nevada unless it immediately suspends prosecutions for ballot harvesting before the June 9 primary, among a slew of other demands, according to a letter obtained by Fox News on Tuesday.
Marc Elias, now representing the Nevada Democratic Party, also called for a substantial expansion to in-person voting access in the upcoming primary — though just days ago, he said it was a ""national disgrace"" that Wisconsin was moving ahead with in-person voting amid the coronavirus pandemic. (In both cases, he cited health concerns.) Democrats had feared that high turnout in Wisconsin would hurt their chances, while they have a more optimistic outlook in Nevada.
Writing on April 10 to Nevada Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske, a Republican, Elias first took aim at Nevada Revised Statutes section 293.330(4), which permits only certain individuals, like family members, to return ballots. In his letter, Elias argued that ""many Nevada voters will not be able to return their mail-in ballots themselves and do not have family members – or are separated from these family members because of social distancing – who can do so for them.""
""We ask that your office and the office of the Nevada Attorney General immediately announce a suspension of prosecutions under this statute for all elections for which mail-in balloting will be the primary means of voting in the state,"" Elias said. The move could allow anyone, including political operatives, to return voters' ballots en masse to polling stations.
At the same time, Elias called for Nevada to stop throwing out ballots when signatures on voters' ballots appear different from those on voters' registrations, saying ""lay election officials have never had the necessary expertise"" to make an accurate determination.
""In an environment where the vast majority of Nevada voters will be casting a mail-in ballot for the first time, there is the real possibility that hundreds of thousands of Nevada voters could be disenfranchised due to the arbitrary determinations of these untrained officials,"" Elias wrote. In the alternative, Elias said that those found to have mismatched or missing signatures should be given an additional two weeks, instead of the normal one-week deadline, to clarify the matter.
Elias also demanded that Nevada ""require mail-in ballots be sent to all registered voters in Nevada, not just those in an active status."" Elias asserted that state election law doesn't distinguish between the two categories of voters.
Republicans have argued that many states fail to adequately clean up their voter rolls. Last year, California was forced to remove 1.5 million ineligible voters after a court settlement last year when California's rolls showed a registration of 112 percent.
Further, Elias urged that Nevada ""require more than just one in-person vote center per county in the State’s most populous counties as well as those with geographically distant population centers.""
""Nevada voters have a proud tradition of voting in person either during the early voting period or on election day,"" Elias wrote. ""Having only a single in-person location in each county poses certain risks and hardships to voters in various circumstances—voters in dense urban communities, for example, will be forced into dangerously overcrowded polling places, while rural voters will have to travel unreasonable distances just to cast their ballots.""
Marc E Elias
On April 6, though, Elias called it a ""national disgrace"" that ""may well cost lives"" when the Wisconsin Supreme Court blocked an order to shut down in-person voting there. ""No one should have to chose between voting and their health,"" Elias wrote on Twitter.
Elias, among other things, is known for his role hiring private research firm Fusion GPS to probe Donald Trump during the 2016 campaign – efforts which resulted in the unverified anti-Trump dossier.
Elias did not respond to a request for comment from Fox News, but Republicans argued that the letter exposed Democratic partisanship.
“Democrats’ hypocrisy knows no bounds,"" Republican National Committee (RNC) Chief of Staff Richard Walters told Fox News. ""The same people who were fear mongering about in-person voting last week are suddenly demanding more opportunities for in-person voting.”
Elias did appear to be citing health concerns in both cases, however -- first by criticizing Wisconsin for having in-person voting at all, and later by arguing that limited polling locations In Nevada would force voters into overcrowded spaces.
But Walters pointed to the ballot-harvesting request as part of a bigger scheme.
Walters added: “Democrats’ entire strategy is to legalize ballot harvesting nationwide, and this letter proves it. Sending far-left activists door-to-door to collect ballots not only jeopardizes people’s health, it threatens the security of their ballot. The last thing our country needs during a time of crisis is to weaken confidence in our elections, but that is exactly what would happen if Democrats get their way.”

In 2018, despite holding substantial leads on Election Day, many Republican candidates in California saw their advantage shrink, and then disappear, as late-arriving Democratic votes were counted in the weeks following the election. Many observers pointed to the Democrats' use of ballot harvesting as a key to their success in the elections.
“Anecdotally there was a lot of evidence that ballot harvesting was going on,” Neal Kelley, the registrar for voters in Southern California’s Orange County, told Fox News.
In Orange County – once seen as a Republican stronghold in the state – every House seat went to a Democrat after an unprecedented “250,000” vote-by-mail drop-offs were counted, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.
“People were carrying in stacks of 100 and 200 of them. We had had multiple people calling to ask if these people were allowed to do this,” Kelley said.
Fox News' Andrew O'Reilly contributed to this report.

UPDATE: Nevada Legislature Special Session Ends after Republicans Block Tax Bill & Pass Bipartisan Vote On Budget Cuts
Thanks to Republican legislators, this Special Session of the Nevada Legislature did not end in massive tax hikes or overreaching mandates.
But it was a close call and this session made it even more clear that RIGHT NOW we need more Republican legislators representing us on the state and local level.
Another session is coming. In the meantime help us fight to win back seats in the Assembly and State Senate. QUICK DONATE TO FLIP THE STATE LEGISLATURE BACK TO REPUBLICAN CONTROL IN NOVEMBER >>
-Political Team
CARSON CITY — The Legislature made a final and substantial tweak Sunday to the last remaining bill of its budget-focused special session, adding $50 million in K-12 funding for at-risk students using federal pandemic aid.
The action, after 12 legislative days that saw grinding progress on a focused agenda to close a $1.2 billion state budget gap, brought the Legislature’s 31st special session to an end, but likely not the state’s pandemic-related budget woes. Still ahead are a possible second session and further fiscal tightening amid uncertainty over another possible round of federal assistance, a resurgent virus spread, and stagnant or worsening economic trends.
As lawmakers debated their final measure on Sunday, Gov. Steve Sisolak said he would postpone calling an expected second legislative session due to concerns over COVID-19. In a statement, he said he had “serious reservations about having our lawmakers convene again for a similar — or longer — period of time in the midst of this spike in our State.”
QUICK DONATE TO FLIP THE STATE LEGISLATURE BACK TO REPUBLICAN CONTROL IN NOVEMBER
The amended version of the bill passed the Assembly on a 36-6 bipartisan vote. It had passed on a party-line, 29-13 vote Saturday night, but the Assembly moved to reconsider the measure Sunday morning to add federal relief dollars from the CARES Act, and quickly passed the amended version before noon.
CARES Act money must be used to address pandemic-related emergencies. The funds to schools will go to support programs schools have had to implement in the face of COVID-19, such as remote learning, and help students who are disproportionately affected by the shutdowns.
QUICK DONATE TO FLIP THE STATE LEGISLATURE BACK TO REPUBLICAN CONTROL IN NOVEMBER
Senate debate
“The teachers and the students who know that this upcoming school year is going to be more difficult need some support,” said Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro, D-Las Vegas.
The bill took several more hours to get through the Senate. After a public comment period, senators adopted the amendment in committee and then unanimously passed it about 5:40 p.m. Sunday, concluding the main business of the session and clearing the way for adjournment.
“This bill reflects many of the decisions that were made that constitute some of our shared priorities,” said Sen. Ben Kieckhefer, R-Reno, as the Senate prepared to vote. “It reflects the reality of our COVID-ravaged economy, and it fulfills the mission of why we were gathered here under the governor’s call.”
Assembly Speaker Jason Frierson, D-Las Vegas, who sought the amendment, said the revised bill will have the state Department of Education set up block grant programs that schools will be able to apply for, a process that he said would be swift and would prioritize money for at-risk students.
“I don’t think we’re in a position to turn away an opportunity to provide services to kids that are going to be disproportionately impacted by this pandemic,” Frierson said.
In spite of bill’s bipartisan support, Democrats who backed it decried missed opportunities that could have restored even more funding but failed to win necessary support. The Senate twice failed to pass a rewrite of mining taxes long sought by progressives who say the politically favored industry is undertaxed.
“Know that I don’t take this vote lightly and recognize that we must and can do better,” said Sen. Dallas Harris, D-Las Vegas. Sen. Julia Ratti, D-Sparks, added that she’d been “authentically optimistic” the mining tax proposal could have passed.
QUICK DONATE TO FLIP THE STATE LEGISLATURE BACK TO REPUBLICAN CONTROL IN NOVEMBER
Agency budget cuts
Other sections of the omnibus bill make various cuts to state agencies. In Saturday night’s revision, the bill halved the originally proposed number of furlough days for state workers, from 12 to six, and restored nearly $139 million to the budget through transfers and reallocation of other existing revenues. The total amount of agency cuts is around $400 million, down from $535 million.
Of the restored money, $81 million is for health care and social services, including $49 million to optional Medicaid services that faced elimination. Another $41.5 million covers the cost of the reduced furloughs — $25.8 million — and also reinstates merit pay for state workers and cancels layoffs.
Significant cuts to the state’s K-12 budget, including $70 million from weighted funds for low-achieving students and $31 million for the state’s Read by Grade 3 program, were not restored in the changes.
In a statement, Sisolak thanked Frierson and Cannizzaro, both Democrats, for passing the bill.
“This program under AB3 represents our shared priorities to support education and healthcare with all financial resources available,” the statement reads. “While we may not be allowed under federal restrictions to use (Coronavirus Relief Fund) dollars to fund budgeted programs reduced or eliminated due to the state’s dramatic revenue shortfall, we can use these dollars for new programs to help those directly impacted by COVID-19.”
QUICK DONATE TO FLIP THE STATE LEGISLATURE BACK TO REPUBLICAN CONTROL IN NOVEMBER
Potential future funds
With the state’s budget balanced, the funding focus now shifts to the federal level, where state lawmakers and officials are hoping that more relief could be on the way.
The Legislature passed a resolution during the special session calling on the federal government to provide flexible funding to help the state manage its fiscal shortfall. Prior to the session, the Legislature’s Interim Finance Committee created a 12-member subcommittee that will be chaired by Frierson; it will oversee how federal relief dollars are distributed.
Those funds could help the state offset the significant budget holes left behind to K-12 and higher education and to various health care programs.
AB3 specifically laid out the programs the state will prioritize if that federal relief does come, starting with the weighted student funding program and Read by Grade 3 program. Additional funding would then go toward eliminating the remaining state worker furloughs and then to restoring the other various budgets that were cut.
The Legislature formally adjourned the session about 7:15 p.m. and the governor released a statement moments later.
“While all states are facing devastating impacts to their budgets as a result of the COVID-19 recession, Nevada once again finds itself hit the hardest due to an overreliance on an unbalanced revenue structure and the continued need to successfully diversify our economy beyond hospitality and tourism,” the governor said.
He added that all interests should “commit ourselves to the overwhelming consensus that was expressed by both parties during this session: That there are longstanding, structural problems that must be addressed to ensure Nevada is no longer the most vulnerable state in the nation every time the economy takes a downturn.""

Keep up the fight,
-Nevada Republican HQ
P.S. Make sure Nevadans know the TRUTH about this bad bill by forwarding around the information below.
THE TRUTH ABOUT NEVADA VOTING LAW AB4:
With less than 100 days until Election Day, the liberal ruling class in Carson City rammed through legislation in the late-night hours of the weekend and without giving the public any notice.
Democrats used the guise of COVID-19 to put in place a plan to remove election safeguards they have wanted OUT OF THE WAY for years. This bill wasn’t about mail-in ballots for voters’ safety … it was about Democrats running a fourth-quarter hail mary election scheme. This isn’t just a bad bill, it violates the Constitution.
Here’s why this legislation is detrimental to election integrity:
* The bill legalizes ballot harvesting, allowing third-party special interest organizations to gather ballots and turn them in to the Election Department.
* It forces country registrars to mail ballots to all registered voters. The difference between universal mail-in and absentee ballots is that absentee ballots are REQUESTED, ensuring that voters are receiving their ballot at the correct location.
* Allows for two mail ballots returned in one envelope to be counted.
* Creates a loophole for ballots be counted if they arrive DAYS AFTER Election Day with no postmark.
* Gives too much power to the executive branch by allowing this law to be applied during any declared state of emergency or disaster.
* Limits in-person polling places in rural counties, but not in urban Democrat-leaning counties and fails to provide uniform safeguards for processing and counting ballots. Voters will be treated differently based on where they live.
* Allows ballots to be counted even if it fails the signature-verification process
These safeguards were put in place to prevent voter fraud and ballot manipulation and Democrats just removed them.
Why wasn’t Nevada’s top election official, Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske, consulted on AB4?
Because she testified that the current plan allowed Nevadans to vote safely, and testified to the legislature that ballot harvesting would be ""devastating"" to the Silver State.
Democrats knew they could get away with this bad legislation during a pandemic, and they did. They took advantage of fear to pass a bill they’ve wanted rammed through for decades.

"SACK SISOLAK!
Nevada Political Insider News Alert
QUICK ACTION LINK: SACK SISOLAK! Pitch-in here: [[URL REDACTED]]
Nevada Assemblyman Chris Edwards blasted Governor Steve Sisolak for repeatedly ignoring legislators and failing to keep them apprised of the state’s response to the COVID-19 crisis.
Chris Edwards Tweet
SACK SISOLAK!
It's time to SACK SISOLAK! Pitch-in $2 or whatever you can now: [[URL REDACTED]]
The revelation that Sisolak is keeping elected officials in the dark while he navigates the Silver State through this pandemic comes less than a week after it was revealed the governor had failed to request President Trump declare a major disaster in Nevada, which would give the state access to critical equipment for its health care workers, while simultaneously sniping at President Trump over the need for resources.
Chris Edwards Tweet
SACK SISOLAK!
Sisolak has failed Nevadans, and he isn’t taking public rebukes well. After Edwards called the governor out for his disregard of local leaders, Sisolak used his staff to lash out at Edwards while demanding the legislator toe the line and “tone it down.”
Steve Sisolak is failing Nevadans. Instead of owning up to his mistakes, the thin-skinned governor is deflecting blame and lashing out at critics who dare to speak up.

Nevada is known as the “First in the West Caucus” and is usually a type of make-or-break moment for presidential candidates. Soon, all eyes will be on our state and we're short of what we need to raise before the 2020 Democrat circus comes to town.

They have even out-fundraised some of the other states. We can’t let them show us up in fundraising and activism -- not while we’re in the national spotlight. With only 30 days until the Democrat Caucus, let’s out-fundraise the NVDems and show them who Nevada REALLY wants in office …

Instead of embracing freedoms they are being destroying.
Today our flag, Constitution, values, freedom of religion, speech, and Right to bare arms are all under attack.

Lately, it feels like this statement by President Lincoln couldn’t be more true:
“If destruction be our lot, we must ourselves be its author and finisher. As a nation of freemen, we must live through all time, or die by suicide.”

GOP accuses Clark County of ‘shady’ deal with Democrats in lawsuit
By Shea Johnson Las Vegas Review-Journal
National and state Republican officials sued Clark County on Monday, accusing officials of making a “shady backroom deal” with Democrats over the conduct of the June 9 mail-in primary election.
The lawsuit seeks public records to explain how county officials decided to add two in-person voting sites on primary election day, send mail ballots to all registered voters, including inactive ones, and allow deputized “field registrars” to collect ballots.
The changes to how the mail ballot-only contest would be conducted were revealed last month.
CHIP-IN: STOP BALLOT HARVESTING LEGAL DEFENSE FUND
The Nevada State Democratic Party, which had gone to court to push state and county election officials to expand voter access, said the changes will accomplish that goal. At least two county commissioners supported the amended plan but could not provide any detail on how it came to be.
But the Republican National Committee and Nevada Republican Party claimed in Monday’s legal filing in state district court that the plan will waste taxpayer dollars and was reached outside of the state’s open meeting law and without public input.
The GOP said, among other contentions, that the county will knowingly waste more than $166,000 on mailing ballots to inactive voters as part of its $300,000-plus revised plan, according to the complaint. (Inactive voters are registered voters to whom the county has sent election postcards that have been returned as undeliverable.)
Republicans had sought public records from Registrar of Voters Joe Gloria, county commissioners and county staff, including correspondence with Democrats, on the change to the election plan. They argued that county officials withheld records, citing attorney-client privilege, or simply failed to produce them.
CHIP-IN: STOP BALLOT HARVESTING LEGAL DEFENSE FUND
“Every Nevadan should be concerned that officials in the state’s largest county are refusing to turn over public records that could reveal how a shady backroom deal to rewrite our primary’s election rules with the Democrat Party came to be,” said Nevada Republican Party Executive Director Jessica Hanson in a statement.
The Republican National Committee also accused Democrats of seizing on the coronavirus pandemic in an effort to push a partisan election agenda, including by asking courts to suspend prosecution of so-called ballot harvesters and signature verification procedures for absentee ballots. The county has not made those changes, however.
“Since the Democrat-dominated Clark County Commission is refusing to comply with state law and release public records, we have been left with no other choice but to ask the court to force the county to hand them over,” said Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel in a statement.
The Republicans’ lawsuit Monday names the county, Gloria and the all-Democratic commission as defendants.
In an email, a county spokesman said, “this lawsuit is based upon suspicions, not facts and we expect to prevail.”

QUICK ACTION:
Add your name and join us in telling Governor Sisolak he can NEVER take away our Religious Freedom >>
Last night, Nevadans gathered for an Evangelicals for Trump event to praise together. In response to the event, Governor Steve Sisolak went on a political tirade against the religious group calling the gathering “callous” and “dangerous”.
Once again Governor Sisolak has shown that he doesn’t believe in the Rights of ALL Nevadans … just some.
This is the problem of big government tyrants like Steve Sisolak. He believes he has the power to grant or limit OUR RIGHTS, when they were never his to control. Government is established to PROTECT our Rights, not take them away. Our founders made that clear:
""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.""
-Declaration of Independence
This is true for all of us. Not just some.
Protestors and rioters can gather in the streets, casinos can open, but when religious groups want to assemble he calls it “CALLOUS”.
This is WRONG.
Remind Governor Steve Sisolak that he CANNOT pick and choose who has Rights and who doesn’t! Add your name and join us in telling Governor Sisolak he can NEVER take away our Religious Freedom >>
After all, instead of tweeting and bullying political and religious groups, Governor Steve Sisolak should get to work -- But he’s made it VERY clear that he’s only working for SOME Nevadans.
And it’s not us.

"Democrats are ramming the ballot harvesting bill through.
TRUMP TWEET
URGENT ACTION NEEDED NOW TO STOP THE BALLOT HARVESTING BILL (AB4)!
This is serious and it can't wait. Democrats are trying to RAM THIS BILL THROUGH AGAIN NOW (the hearing is underway)! President Trump is joining us and asking for ALL HANDS ON DECK.
ACTION NEEDED:
⚠️ GATHER Nevada Legislative Building NOW TO PROTEST THE ELECTION LAW CHANGE BILL (AB4)!
Nevada Legislative Building
401 S. Carson St.
Carson City, NV 89701
⚠️ CALL State Senate Majority Leader
Nicole Cannizzaro (775-684-1475) and demand she pull AB4!
WHAT YOU CAN SAY WHEN YOU CALL: ""As a Nevada constituent I demand you stop bill AB4. I do not support it. The Nevada Secretary of State has a plan to allow Nevadans to vote safely. I oppose bill AB4 and demand legislators PULL IT.""
⚠️ Make sure your friends and family express their disgust on AB4 on the ""Share Your Opinion"" page of the legislative website. Here’s the link >>
⚠️ Call your Legislator and DEMAND they vote against AB4. Find legislator’s contact info here >>
This is serious and it can't wait. Democrats are trying to RAM THIS BILL THROUGH NOW! We’re going to need ALL hands on deck to stop this bill -- and FAST.
BACKGROUND IN CASE YOU MISSED IT:
Democrats unveiled their 100-page bill to change election law here in Nevada and it’s everything we feared it would be.
The worst part is they were trying to get it away with it by pushing it through in the middle of the night (on a Friday nonetheless) while Nevadans weren't watching!!
This bill already passed the Assembly and we stopped it in the Senate -- but they're picking it up again. If this bill passes, November’s election will be vote-by-mail, putting the integrity of the results at risk of fraud, and ballot harvesting will be legalized meaning strangers can go door-to-door to take voters’ ballots.
This is different than absentee voting. Democrats want to REMOVE safeguards from our election process and they’re selling it under the guise of keeping people safe during a pandemic.
STOP THEM. Don’t let Nevada Democrats remove election safeguards and change our voting laws into a process that invites voter fraud. As if weakening our election system wasn’t enough -- Democrats want to spend MILLIONS that could be better spent on the education and healthcare budgets they just gutted...
We are fighting back, but I’ll be blunt it’s just not enough.
If we’re going to have any hope in stopping this monstrosity then we are going to need your help.
This is serious. Please pass this information along by forwarding this email to friends and family and by making sure Nevadans are aware of just how dangerous this bill is to the future of our great state.

As one of our insiders, I wanted to write you a quick update on our strategy for 2020:
First, some great news is that our fundraising and grassroots organization is stronger than ever. We have been working hard to build the infrastructure we need to communicate, get out the vote, and register voters during a worldwide pandemic and the system is now in place.
With this system in place it’s important that we focus on MAKING NEVADA RED AGAIN. We have two important House races that could tip the scales overall, two State Senate seats that could flip the Nevada Legislature to RED, and so many more local offices we need to defend and turn back throughout the state.
YOU are a pivotal part of making these Republican victories happen. Can we count on you to help strengthen our strategy?
Contribute $20 for 2020 here: [[URL REDACTED]]
Our plan includes a well-organized team of grassroots volunteers, paid staff, infrastructure, and a unique election organization model and a targeted push to encourage Republicans to get out the vote in November. In order to make sure Republicans get elected and that we fulfill these goals, our effort requires both organization and funding.
As you can see, the infrastructure is ready but we still need more funding to get where we need to be.
Contribute $20 for victory in 2020: [[URL REDACTED]]
After crunching the numbers here’s what it comes down to:
If we have 20,000 Nevada Republicans pitch-in $20 or more we will TAKE BACK NEVADA and win the Congressional seats, State Senate Majority, and the other Republican races down the ticket that we need.
We had a record-breaking quarter and we’re reaching heights we’ve never reached before. But we are short of what we need to make this last push through the General Election.
Will you pitch-in just $20 for 2020 here and help us reach the 20,000 donor goal? Here's the secure link again: [[URL REDACTED]]

"break the left-wing super-majority

Special interests are pouring money into local elections like mine.
Simply put, there is no way we can break the left-wing Democrats’ super-majority at the Nevada Legislature if we don’t win this seat -- and that’s why I’m running to take back the 37th District here in our home state.
Will you pitch-in just $5 to help grow our grassroots effort on the ground and MAKE NEVADA RED AGAIN?
“All politics is local” couldn’t be more true (as we’ve witnessed even more recently).
That’s why taking back the 37th Assembly District will be crucial in determining the balance of power here in Nevada, and we can’t afford to lose.
STOP THE LIBERAL NEVADA SUPER-MAJORITY!
Andy Matthews for Assembly
Democrats are going to throw everything at us as they desperately try to maintain their grip on power. But we can’t let them continue to make our great state look more like California with each policy they pass.
Don’t let Nevada become just another extension of California. Fight back against the Democrat Super-Majority and pitch-in here >>
Here’s a reminder of just how bad things have become. Since the Democrats took over the super-majority at the Nevada Legislature, this is what has happened:
* Tried to make Nevada a Sanctuary State
* Lowered penalties on violent felons
* Passed an illegal new tax on Nevadans
* Spent more time on their own pay raise than they did teachers’
* Created 28 new state agencies and programs
* Created legislation that allows criminals to sue homeowners if they get hurt burglarizing YOUR home
* Passed 67 anti-business bills targeting both Nevada businesses directly and our state’s business environment
As the election draws closer, more and more money from special interests will be poured into the effort to help fund the Left’s radical agenda … and we can’t afford to back down from the fight.
Can I count on you to pitch-in just $5 or whatever you can now to help us fight back and MAKE NEVADA RED AGAIN?
Let’s fight back and crush the super-majority stronghold the Democrats (and let’s be honest, their special interest groups) have right now.

As an important part of our movement, we wanted to send over an update on the fight to protect YOUR voting rights.
Last week, over 700 Nevadans protested against Assembly Bill 4. Patriots from every county across the state showed up to speak out against the sweeping overhaul of Nevada’s election rules that were rammed through in less than 72 hours.
FUND THE FIGHT
As you know, AB4 mandates ballots be mailed to all voters, legalizes ballot harvesting, allows for the potential of counting two mail ballots returned in one envelope, and lets ballots be counted if they arrive days after Election Day with no postmark.
This horrible legislation invites extensive voter fraud and dampens election integrity.

TRUMP DEPUTY CAMPAIGN MANAGER: Nevada’s November Nightmare
President Trump is gaining ground in Nevada. Democrats know it, so they cut a midnight backroom deal in a brazen attempt to rig November’s election. Governor Sisolak ensured mass chaos and an election nightmare with the stroke of a pen.
That is why President Trump’s campaign and the Republican National Committee filed a lawsuit last Tuesday to stop the chaos in Nevada. The President is fighting to make sure every citizen’s vote counts — and counts once. Our lawsuit seeks to invalidate Assembly Bill 4 as unconstitutional on two grounds. First, the legislation allows ballots cast after Election Day to be counted. Second, it violates the principle of one person one vote by not preventing some from having their vote count more than once.
DONATE TO THE LEGAL DEFENSE FUND
Nevada Democrats implemented the exact universal vote-by-mail system President Trump has warned against for months. The state will mail every voter — living or dead, at home or moved — a ballot. This is the same system that led to the “train wreck” primary in New York. We still don’t know the results of key races six weeks after that election. Even Andrew Cuomo has been forced to admit the system is flawed. And this is the same system that left 100,000 votes uncounted in California’s primary.
Rather than learning from their Democrat counterparts’ failures, Nevada’s liberal leadership decided to turn New York’s primary disaster into a November nightmare, making it impossible for results to be delivered on election night.
There are secure options for voting during the pandemic. Many states, like Florida, provide a safe and secure absentee system and allow for robust early voting to avoid crowded polling locations and lines. In the traditional absentee framework, the voter request of a ballot is a key safeguard that protects Florida’s system, as it prevents election offices from blindly mailing live ballots to every name on their likely outdated and inaccurate voter rolls. Florida also requires signature matching and voter verification, crucial election integrity safeguards remarkably absent from Nevada’s new system.
PITCH-IN TO HELP FUEL THE FIGHT FOR ELECTION INTEGRITY
Nevada also now claims the ignominious first in the nation status for being the first place harvesters can openly harvest ballots after Election Day. The state will accept mailed ballots without postmarks up to three days after the election. So ballots cast after November 3 — invalid ballots — will be included in the state’s results. For example, if a Nevada voter wakes up on November 4 and finds President Trump is winning the state, he can make house calls to his neighbors, family, friends and even strangers who hadn’t submitted their ballots. He can get paid to harvest those ballots, drop only the Biden ballots in the mailbox and have those invalid votes counted. This is fraud. It defies the principle of election integrity. And the Democrats’ policy openly allows it.
Put simply, this is Democrat elected officials delaying the election until they can find enough votes to win.
But that’s not all. The law also lets paid operatives fill out ballots for voters 65+ under the guise of “voter assistance.” Rather than protecting voters from COVID, which Democrats falsely claim is their aim, this law invites harvesters into older voters’ homes to falsify ballots, increases chances of exposing this vulnerable population to COVID and swings the door wide open to intimidation of older voters.
Universal mail-in voting will make a mockery of the American ideal of “one person, one vote.” In a free and fair election, President Trump wins hands down. Democrats are trying every hare-brained idea they can come up with to ensure that doesn’t happen.

"Fox News Alert
RNC Chair McDaniel: Democrats use coronavirus as excuse to try eliminating safeguards against election fraud
Ronna McDaniel
By Ronna McDaniel | Fox News
Imagine an election where a ballot is sent to a person regardless of eligibility, signed by someone else, picked up and delivered by a campaign operative, and still counted. If Democrats got their way, that is what would happen in Nevada this June, and nationwide in November.
Democrats have sued Nevada in an attempt to block the state from enforcing election laws on the books in their upcoming primary. Their demands? Nevada must suspend its prosecution of ballot harvesters, where the practice is illegal, and refuse to allow election officials to verify signatures on ballots, contrary to state law. They claim this basic check to see whether a ballot is from the same voter who signed up to vote is “not needed to ensure the integrity of the election.""
This is the Democrats’ standard for “integrity” in elections. The first red flag should have been that it is Marc Elias and Perkins Coie who are doing the suing.
If you need a refresher, Perkins Coie is the Democratic law firm, paid by the Hillary Clinton campaign, that hired Fusion GPS to dig up dirt on Donald Trump in 2016. They failed, but still compiled a dossier full of foreign-solicited lies about Trump and Russia, which was leaked by Obama intelligence officials to try to sabotage the new president’s administration, sow doubt in his election victory, and invalidate the votes of 63 million Americans. Not the best track record on “integrity.”
But why wait to sow confusion and doubt after an election when Democrats can do so before? That is their ongoing campaign to remove voting safeguards through the courts, and now using a pandemic to fundamentally upend the way we vote to further their political aims.
Elias and Perkins Coie first threatened to sue Nevada unless the state breaks its own voting laws. You read that right. In a letter sent to the secretary of state, Elias demanded election officials throw out signature verification requirements.
To Elias and the Democrats, it is OK if a signature on a ballot does not even remotely match a voter’s registration on file. They claim election officials do not have the “necessary expertise” to check, even though signature verification is already conducted on every voter registration in Nevada and checked for every voter who shows up at the polls. Voters also have the chance to contact election officials in the event of a mistake.
While they tried and failed to allow people to vote a full week after Election Day in Wisconsin, Democrats are still committed to expanding ballot harvesting and weakening ballot security.
Democrats also want ballots sent to “all registered voters in Nevada,” regardless of whether the voter has moved away. This would increase the number of ballots in circulation far beyond those eligible to vote.
For its primary, Nevada is providing mail-in ballots to active voters, but not inactive ones. Registrations are marked “inactive” only after officials have received reliable information such as from the U.S. Postal Service that the voter has moved and fails to respond to a mailing asking the voter to confirm his or her address.
It is critical that mail-in voting has these safeguards, given fraud is easier by mail, and states are known to have millions of dead and ineligible voters on their rolls.
STOP BALLOT HARVESTING IN NEVADA >>
In 2018 there were over 239,000 inactive voters in Nevada, meaning Democrats want roughly a quarter-million extra ballots floating around during the primary. This would be convenient for their “voter assistance” plans, the Democrats’ euphemistic go-around for ballot harvesting in states where it is banned.
Democrats are using “social distancing” as an excuse to allow campaign operatives to traffic in ballots, and stop the enforcement of crucial voter integrity laws. In Nevada, it is a felony for a person to handle a ballot other than their own. The law already has an exception for a voter to allow an authorized family member to return their ballot, making Democrats’ excuses ring hollow.
It is not really about social distancing. If it were, Democrats would not want to put their campaign operatives at risk by sending them door-to-door to handle thousands of ballots.
The only thing Democrats are consistent on is their mission to gut voting integrity. And their hypocrisy.

This is big.
Politico just upgraded our state for the 2020 presidential election to “Lean Democrat” – putting Joe Biden one step closer to winning Nevada and the White House.
Our efforts and your support are working.
But here’s the thing: the closer we get, the more the GOP is going to fight back. And it’s already started.
Donald Trump just dumped a ton of money into our state, buying up air time to run his re-election ads. He knows our message is resonating with voters so he’s doing everything in his power to drown us out.
But it’s not too late to stop him. We need to raise $7,000 before the weekend to ensure we can compete with Trump’s advertising campaign. Click here to make a $10 contribution right now and help us fight back →

Donald Trump filling Nevada airwaves with his campaign ads tells us one thing: he knows he’s losing ground in our battleground state.
But 2016 taught us we cannot be complacent.
If we don’t counter Trump’s ad spending, his dishonest and harmful rhetoric will go unchallenged.

"King Steve Sisolak's team email
Sisolak’s office pushed local officials to shut down Trump event, records show
By Victor Joecks Las Vegas Review-Journal
King Steve Sisolak pushed Las Vegas officials to stop a recent Trump event. That’s according to emails and documents obtained from the city of Las Vegas via a public records request.
King Sisolak is purposefully trying to stop Trump events in Nevada. Fight back by pitching in to the SACK SISOLAK FUND HERE >>
On July 30, the Trump campaign announced that it was holding an “Evangelicals for Trump” rally. Because Sisolak currently limits church gatherings to 50 people, the Ahern Hotel provided the venue.
Through his office, His Royal Highness worked to stop it. Scott Gilles, Sisolak’s senior advisor, emailed Clark County Commission Chairwoman Marilyn Kirkpatrick to “flag” the meeting. “What would the next step be to ensure this event, which looks to likely violate current directives, is not allowed to proceed?” Gilles wrote.
Because the Ahern Hotel is in the city, Kirkpatrick sent that email to Carolyn Levering, the city’s emergency management administrator. The request by Sisolak’s office left city officials scrambling. Records show this was the first they had heard about the event.
CLAIM YOUR SACK SISOLAK BUMPER STICKER HERE >>
Tom Perrigo, executive director of Community Development, eventually emailed that he “talked to Licensing and they are contacting the Licensee to remind them of the rules.” Perrigo then followed up with Levering.
“Please don’t share this email, but you can share that we’ve asked for a plan to show how the event will be conducted in compliance with the Governor’s order,” he wrote. Levering then emailed Kirkpatrick an update.
But the governor’s edicts allow most businesses to operate at 50 percent capacity, even if that means having more than 50 people in one place. An Ahern Hotel official said fire occupancy for the room was 1,605 people. That implies an 800-person cap.
Ahern officials did their best to comply with Sisolak’s guidelines, as they understood them. They provided a detailed safety plan, including enforced mask use, social distancing and a floor plan. But with the pressure coming from Carson City, city officials didn’t give Ahern the benefit of the doubt.
CLAIM YOUR SACK SISOLAK BUMPER STICKER HERE >>
Eventually, Ahern employees told city officials the event was a “peaceful First Amendment right to worship and assemble protest.” Sisolak has frequently allowed protests to exceed his 50-person limit.
The event was scheduled to take place on Aug. 6. On the Tuesday prior, city officials issued a courtesy notice of a violation. On the day before the event, Robert Summerfield, the city’s planning director, told staff to “hold off on any more contact (with Ahern Hotel) on this until I hear back from CMO and CAO.” That’s the city manager’s office and the city attorney’s office.
Emails suggest those conversations took place over the phone or in person. By Thursday morning — the day of the event — something had changed. The city sent Ahern a notice demanding that it not hold the event. It threatened fines and to suspend its licenses.
The governor was also personally interested, according to his staff.
“Do you have any update on what’s happening with this event[?]” Gilles emailed on Thursday morning. “Chairwoman Kirkpatrick said CLV was on it. Governor keeps asking for updates.”
Sisolak Team Email
King Sisolak frequently complains about how busy he is dealing with the coronavirus. He somehow found the time to monitor a specific event put on by the opposing political party. That’s not all.
CLAIM YOUR SACK SISOLAK BUMPER STICKER HERE >>
“Some of our council people and the Governor’s office is calling Metro inquiring why they are not shutting down the event,” Jorge Cervantes, chief operations and development officer, emailed on Thursday night. The event went forward with more than 500 people attending, according to organizers. City staff issued a $250 fine, which Ahern officials are now suing over.
This isn’t standard operating procedure.
“The Governor’s Office has no influence in the enforcement actions taken by local government, and it does not request that local governments shut particular events down,” Sisolak’s press office wrote in an email.
Gilles’ emails show that wasn’t true in this case. Through his office, Sisolak targeted this specific event and put pressure on local officials to shut it down. It’s logical to conclude that political considerations motivated these actions. That’s scary stuff.
The rule of law is supposed to prevent this. Unfortunately, that bedrock principle has given way in many areas to the royal decrees of King Sisolak, who now uses his power to target his political opponents.

FLIP THE STATE SENATE & MAKE NEVADA RED AGAIN
RJ Article
CARSON CITY — A District Court judge sided with Republican state senators Monday in throwing out two revenue bills passed by the Legislature in 2019, ruling that they were passed in the Senate without the constitutionally required two-thirds majority vote.
Intent clear, judge says
“The intent of this particular provision of the Constitution is clear and the language is clear,” he said. “It clearly states an affirmative vote of not fewer than two thirds of the members elected to each house is necessary to pass a bill or joint resolution which creates, generates or increases any public revenue” in any form.
Take Back the State Senate Majority!
Russell predicted that the case would likely end up before state Supreme Court. Lawyers for the executive agencies and the Legislature had no comment on the ruling Monday or on their next steps.
The challenge involves Senate Bill 551 and Senate Bill 542 from the 2019 session. SB551 extended the existing Modified Business Tax rate past its original July 2019 sunset date, generating some $98 million. SB542 extended for two years a $1 technology fee motorists pay to DMV that was set to sunset last July. That fee generates about $7 million.
The two measures passed the Senate on party-line 13-8 votes at the end of the 2019 session. The bills initially came before the Senate for votes with a disclaimer that they were tax measures requiring a two-thirds majority. They were voted down in that form, but came back before the Senate 15 minutes later without the two-thirds requirement disclaimer. The eight Republican senators filed a lawsuit after the session was over.
MAKE NEVADA RED AGAIN >>
Democratic argument rejected
Ahead of the disputed 2019 votes, and throughout the legal case, lawyers for the Legislature and Democratic lawmakers sought to differentiate the revenue bills not as new tax bills but as extensions of existing taxes that did not need supermajority support. But Russell rejected that argument entirely. He dismissed individual Democratic lawmakers from the case, including Senate majority leader Nicole Cannizzaro, D-Las Vegas, but said plaintiffs could still seek attorneys fees from the state divisions charged with collecting the tax.
“The judge ruled correctly on the plain meaning of the law,” Senate Minority Leader James Settelmeyer, R-Minden, said outside the court immediately following the ruling. “I wish it would have been decided much sooner, but then again I would have liked that decision to have happened 10 minutes after they made the ludicrous opinion that they don’t need a two-thirds (majority).”
He added: “We weren’t as Senate Republicans saying we were against taxation. We weren’t saying no, we’re saying we needed to have a discussion. And we had to be involved in it. And we had to make some decisions together. And that wasn’t being done. It was all being decided one way.”

"news you might have missed
We're still short $15,937 of what we need to fund the STOP BALLOT HARVESTING LEGAL DEFENSE FUND. Will you help us fight back? Pitch-in just $2.50 or whatever you can now to the STOP BALLOT HARVESTING LEGAL DEFENSE FUND to protect voter rights!

RNC Chair McDaniel: Democrats and voter fraud in Nevada — here's how it will impact you
Democrats say they want more “inclusive” voting practices. They fail to mention just how inclusive their plans are: sending ballots to dead voters.
Nevada is a case study of the lengths Democrats will go to secure a voting edge.
Pitch-in $2.50 to the STOP BALLOT HARVESTING LEGAL DEFENSE FUND
First Marc Elias and Perkins Coie sued the state on behalf of Democrat groups, demanding election officials break laws against ballot harvesting, ignore signature verification requirements and send ballots to inactive voters the state believes moved away. They demanded more in-person voting locations while arguing voting in person was too dangerous for the June 9 mail-in vote primary.
The message was sent, and Democrats in Clark County got in line. A new voting plan was reached “shrouded in mystery,” according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal. Officials would now increase the number of in-person voting locations in the Democrat-heavy region, mail ballots to all “voters” and allow “field registrars,” commonly known as ballot harvesters, to pick them up. All at the expense of taxpayers of $323,000, and the rule of law.
The result has made Clark County look more like Tammany Hall. What is unfolding should concern every American.
FIGHT FOR OUR VOTER RIGHTS! PITCH-IN TO THE STOP BALLOT HARVESTING LEGAL DEFENSE FUND!
Ballots

Dozens of ballots are being found pinned to community bulletin boards. “From Friday to Monday, I could have voted 20 times,” said one resident of an apartment complex in Las Vegas. “That’s what’s so concerning about all this.”
Who is to stop a Democrat “field registrar” from picking them up, signing them and dropping them off? That sounds outrageous. But it is what Democrat groups are seeking in their lawsuit.
Trained poll officials would no longer be able to throw out fraudulent ballots that do not match their signature on file. Instead, the lawsuit would prohibit what it calls the “dubious art of signature matching” and circumvent Nevada’s ballot harvesting ban. Signature matching is so “dubious” it has been required for every new voter registration in Nevada and used to verify every voter who shows up at the polls for years.
This is not unique to Nevada. Democrats are attacking the integrity of our elections across the country and circling the wagons.
Democrats are welcoming voter fraud in Nevada. And they are not even hiding it.
The Elias lawsuit is explicit. It states the statewide ban on ballot harvesting “hamstrings” the ability of Democrat groups, including the Democratic National Committee, the Nevada State Democratic Party, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and Priorities USA, to “assist voters in making the transition to vote by mail.”
Democrats are happy to “assist,” as long as you vote Democrat.
This is not unique to Nevada. Democrats are attacking the integrity of our elections across the country and circling the wagons.
From Planned Parenthood to the Center for American Progress, left-wing activist groups are pushing the same false talking points that while we flatten the curve we must upend our elections. Voting must be more “inclusive” (by adopting liberal policies).
STOP BALLOT HARVESTING IN NEVADA - FIGHT THE LAWSUIT >>
Nancy Pelosi’s $3 trillion bill would launch a federal takeover of our elections, all in line with Elias’ lawsuits in 29 states. Their mission is to nationalize ballot harvesting, gut signature verification and voter ID laws and send millions of ballots to voters who have died or moved away, before November.
That's why the Republican National Committee and Trump campaign have launched our Protect the Vote effort, a digital platform which spotlights our efforts to protect against the Democrats' assault on our elections as they push for sweeping changes, including vote-by-mail and more ballot harvesting amid the coronavirus pandemic
The opportunity for fraud with these Democrat proposals is enormous. There are over 200,000 inactive voters in Clark County alone. Inactive voters are given the opportunity to update their registrations and can still request a ballot in the upcoming election. Individuals are only deemed inactive after the state receives evidence from the Postal Service that they have moved.
“Knowingly mailing a ballot to a wrong address is bad enough,” a Review-Journal editorial recently argued. “Combining that with the elimination of signature verification is an open invitation to shenanigans and makes absolutely no sense.”
That’s why this week I sent a letter to Nevada Attorney General Aaron D. Ford requesting an investigation into Clark County’s backroom deal, and potential violations of state election and open meeting laws. Democrat officials in Clark County did not allow any public input before unilaterally upending its election procedures.
Our elections must be free, fair and secure. They should not enable voter fraud at the taxpayers’ expense.

DONATE TO TAKE BACK ANTI-TRUMPER SUSIE LEE’S DISTRICT >>
Hey-- After hemming and hawing over whether to vote for the impeachment sham, Nevada Democrat Susie Lee has decided to blindly follow Nancy Pelosi off the cliff. And here’s what the polls are saying about it:
BREAKING POLL UPDATE:
Poll Gives Susie Lee Unfavorable Rating
Polls Show Susie Lee has 43% unfavorable rating and that 52% of constituents said they do NOT support impeachment
A whopping 52% of Democrat Congresswoman Susie Lee’s Nevada constituents said they did not support impeaching President Trump.
SHOW SUSIE LEE JUST HOW BAD THE FALLOUT WILL BE FOR VOTING YES ON IMPEACHMENT. PITCH-IN NOW >>
Despite saying she had “no regrets” backing the impeachment inquiry and boasting last month that she was “upholding her oath to the U.S. Constitution” when she voted to move forward with it, Lee now appears to be worried about the fallout should she vote for this shameless political ploy according to the Washington Post.
She should be worried! Lee’s constituents have made it crystal clear where they stand on impeachment as they demanded the freshman Congresswoman stop the madness repeatedly over the last few months.
Show Susie Lee just how bad the fallout will be for voting yes on impeachment ...
Put on the pressure by flooding her office with calls and make her a one-term congresswoman by pitching in here to take her out of office!

"Late last night

Late last night Democrats tried to push through their 100-page bill to change election law. (see the details below)
BUT BECAUSE OF YOU IT DID NOT PASS … yet.
We won round 1, help us prepare for round 2
Left-wing special interests and their paid-for progressive pals at the Nevada Legislature thought they could get away with pushing this bill through in the middle of the night but luckily, grassroots conservatives like you pulled through to help us fight back by making calls, giving public testimony, and by sharing your disgust with the bill on the NVleg website. AB4 ended up passing in the Assembly, but NOT in the Senate!
This is a VICTORY for our grassroots movement. But the Senate is picking it up again TODAY. So we need even more responses telling legislators DO NOT PASS AB4!

\---- FORWARD MESSAGE ----
From: BAD BILL ALERT
Subject: TAKE ACTION NOW: They’re trying to pass this in the middle of the night because you aren't watching
⚠️ BAD BILL ALERT ⚠️
AB4
**CALL YOUR LEGISLATOR NOW!**
This is serious and it can't wait until morning. We’re going to need ALL hands on deck to stop this bill -- and FAST.
Democrats unveiled their 100-page bill to change election law here in Nevada and it’s everything we feared it would be.
The worst part is they’re trying to get it away with it by pushing it through in the middle of the night (on a Friday nonetheless) while Nevadans aren’t watching!!
This bill already passed the Assembly and is on it's way to the Senate. If this bill passes, November’s election will be vote-by-mail, putting the integrity of the results at risk of fraud, and ballot harvesting will be legalized meaning strangers can go door-to-door to take voters’ ballots.
This is different than absentee voting. Democrats want to REMOVE safeguards from our election process and they’re selling it under the guise of keeping people safe during a pandemic.
STOP THEM. Don’t let Nevada Democrats remove election safeguards and change our voting laws into a process that invites voter fraud. Here’s what we need you to do:
TAKE ACTION:
* Make sure Nevadans express their disgust on AB4 on the ""Share Your Opinion"" page of the legislative website. Here’s the link >>
* Sign our petition to STOP AB4 and the Democrats from trying to pass a bill that weakens election integrity and invites voter fraud. ADD YOUR NAME >>
* Call your Legislator and DEMAND they vote against AB4. Find legislator’s contact info here >>
As if weakening our election system wasn’t enough -- Democrats want to spend MILLIONS that could be better spent on the education and healthcare budgets they just gutted...
We are fighting back, but I’ll be blunt it’s just not enough.
If we’re going to have any hope in stopping this monstrosity then we are going to need your help.
This is serious. Please pass this information along by forwarding this email to friends and family and by making sure Nevadans are aware of just how dangerous this bill is to the future of our great state.

"our letter
Nevada GOP
Friend,
As you know, we have sued Clark County and the state of Nevada to protect the integrity of Nevada’s election.
Today, we asked Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske, our last line of defense, to do the right thing and halt the processing of mail ballots in Clark County until the court takes up the issue.
At issue is the lack of meaningful observation of the handling of ballots from the public being allowed in Clark County, as well as the incredibly low standard being applied to the signature verification process in Clark County that has allowed an improbable 99 percent of ballots to be counted thus far.
While our hearing is scheduled for this Wednesday, Nevadans cannot afford to wait. Ballots are being separated from the envelope with the signatures every time the county declares a signature match. There could be countless fraudulent votes that will never be caught because of this.
You can read the letter we sent to Secretary Cegavske today here.
The Nevada Republican Party and Trump campaign are committed to a free, fair, and transparent election.
We must ensure that every ballot counted was properly cast. While it is frustrating Democrats do not share this principle, we know Secretary Cegavske does.
That is why she must make Clark County pause their processing of mail ballots today.
We want to be sure you are up to speed with where we are on this issue as new developments come up, and we will continue to do so in the coming days.
Thank you for all your support.

We don’t have time to sit back and watch to see what happens. It’s CRITICAL that we raise $25,000 more for the LEGAL DEFENSE FUND to fight the Clinton-funded law firm suing Nevada to change our voting laws.
I’ll be frank with you, we’re behind and this is NOT the time to be low on funds. The reason I’m writing this now is because we have an End of Month deadline we have to meet and this fund is included.
But here’s the thing, I do have some good news -- Every contribution made before MIDNIGHT TONIGHT to the LEGAL DEFENSE FUND will be TRIPLE MATCHED!
Triple Match My $500 >>
Triple Match My $150 >>
Triple Match My $50 >>
Triple Match My $25 >>
Triple Match My $10 >>
Triple Match My $3 >>
Another Amount >>
If you’ve already contributed, can we ask to have you give just $5 more? EVERY contribution makes a huge difference when we all band together to fight for our state.
You remember how we fought and won on so many issues during the Nevada Legislative Session.
Just like we did then, it’s time to pull together.
Triple Match My Donation To The Legal Defense Fund >>
Democrats have built a hefty online fundraising advantage and are pushing through their far left progressive special interests from D.C. here in Nevada.
Not only that! If we fail, we risk letting the radical left build momentum to take down President Trump.
We have to build ASAP. Contribute whatever amount you can today, and your donation amount will be 3X matched!
Thank you for fighting with us,
Legal Defense

VOTE ALERT: CRITICAL SAFEGUARDS IN JEOPARDY BECAUSE OF SHADY BACK ROOM DEALS
The Ballot Harvesting lawsuit is still pending so Democrats made a shady back room deal and “DIRECTED” Clark County to change the voting process…
The worst part is, OUR TAXPAYER DOLLARS ARE PAYING FOR IT.
SIGN THE PETITION: STOP BALLOT HARVESTING IN NEVADA
FUEL THE LEGAL DEFENSE FUND TO STOP BALLOT HARVESTING (WE STILL NEED TO RAISE $15,000 MORE)
The details: Yesterday, Clark County caved to the Liberal Left’s pressure to change some of Nevada’s election safeguards. One of which is mailing absentee ballots to ALL voters, including inactive voters.
Leave it to Democrats to celebrate sending hundreds of thousands of ballots to people who live in other states like California and even to those who have passed on …
Yes you read that right.
That means our fight is still on, and even more important now. Will you make sure that your friends and family have signed our petition and that we raise $15,000 more for the LEGAL DEFENSE FUND?
SIGN THE PETITION: STOP BALLOT HARVESTING IN NEVADA
FUEL THE LEGAL DEFENSE FUND TO STOP BALLOT HARVESTING
Democrats on the Clark County Commission struck a shady backroom deal with the Nevada Democratic Party and outside liberal organizations to waste over $300,000 of taxpayers’ money on changes to June’s primary election.
Not only that but they will be paying an undisclosed sum to “deputize and train” 20 individuals, as well as their travel, to ballot harvest.
Yep, that’s right. Not only are our county officials allowing strangers to take ballots from Nevadans during a pandemic, they are paying these individuals OUR TAX DOLLARS.
At a time when our local governments’ budgets are being decimated due to the closure of the Nevada economy, Democrat elected officials are wasting money to fund their party’s power grab that puts the integrity of our elections at risk.
It’s reckless and irresponsible to say the least.
Fight back with us. They’re hearing our voices and trying to go around the will of the people with shady back room deals because they KNOW we’re angry.
Take action now:

Fellow Patriot -
Democrats are using the coronavirus pandemic to gut election fraud protections and they’re focusing here on Nevada! (more background below)
WILL YOU HELP US STOP BALLOT HARVESTING IN NEVADA AND FUEL OUR LEGAL DEFENSE FUND?
They want our state to throw election fraud safeguards out the window when it’s more critical than ever! We ARE the frontlines of the fight.
We can’t win this fight without your help. Can we count on you to pitch-in a few bucks?
I know things are tough right now, but if everyone pitches in a few bucks we’ll have what we need to catapult our LEGAL DEFENSE FUND TO STOP BALLOT HARVESTING IN NEVADA.
The integrity of our elections are at stake.
The DNC and their coastal elite lobbyist pals are using a high-powered (Clinton funded) law firm for the fight when they know fundraising is low because Nevadans are struggling.
It’s WRONG.
Fight with us. Pitch-in whatever you can now.
I’ve included more background information below. Will you forward this along to friends and family and make sure they know just how important this is?
Thank you,
Michael J. McDonald, Chairman
Nevada Republican Party
MORE BACKGROUND:
As you know, the Nevada Primary was changed to a mail-by-ballot only election. All active voters would receive absentee ballots and be able to either mail the ballot or drop it off at a designated location that would be available in each county, according to Cegavske's office.
Mail-in voting has these safeguards for a reason considering fraud is easier by mail, and states like ours could end up having millions of dead and ineligible voters on their rolls.
Sending ballots to citizens with active voter status only helps safeguard against election fraud.

Nevada parents are not alone. President Trump, the CDC, and the American Academy of Pediatrics have all issued recommendations of reopening schools 5 days a week.
Keeping schools closed, or implementing hybrid options, only HURTS those most vulnerable.
At 6:00 pm tonight, the Clark County School District (CCSD) Board of Trustees will take a vote on Governor Sisolak’s proposed reopening plan with a hybrid learning option. Organizations, families and individuals are gathering together to urge the CCSD to vote no and to make it clear we don’t support Governor Sisolak’s plan.
HOW TO HELP:
CONTACT TRUSTEES & GOVERNOR SISOLAK AND TELL THEM YOU DO NOT SUPPORT THE HYBRID EDUCATION PLAN
BEFORE 6PM TONIGHT
Governor Sisolak:
Las Vegas Office: (702) 486-2500
Carson City Office: (775) 684-5670

⚠️ BAD BILL ALERT ⚠️
AB4
**CALL YOUR LEGISLATOR NOW!**
This is serious and it can't wait until morning. We’re going to need ALL hands on deck to stop this bill -- and FAST.
Democrats unveiled their 100-page bill to change election law here in Nevada and it’s everything we feared it would be.
The worst part is they’re trying to get it away with it by pushing it through in the middle of the night (on a Friday nonetheless) while Nevadans aren’t watching!!
This bill already passed the Assembly and is on it's way to the Senate. If this bill passes, November’s election will be vote-by-mail, putting the integrity of the results at risk of fraud, and ballot harvesting will be legalized meaning strangers can go door-to-door to take voters’ ballots.
This is different than absentee voting. Democrats want to REMOVE safeguards from our election process and they’re selling it under the guise of keeping people safe during a pandemic.
STOP THEM. Don’t let Nevada Democrats remove election safeguards and change our voting laws into a process that invites voter fraud. Here’s what we need you to do:
TAKE ACTION:
* Make sure Nevadans express their disgust on AB4 on the ""Share Your Opinion"" page of the legislative website. Here’s the link >>
* Sign our petition to STOP AB4 and the Democrats from trying to pass a bill that weakens election integrity and invites voter fraud. ADD YOUR NAME >>
* Call your Legislator and DEMAND they vote against AB4. Find legislator’s contact info here >>
As if weakening our election system wasn’t enough -- Democrats want to spend MILLIONS that could be better spent on the education and healthcare budgets they just gutted...
We are fighting back, but I’ll be blunt it’s just not enough.
If we’re going to have any hope in stopping this monstrosity then we are going to need your help.
This is serious. Please pass this information along by forwarding this email to friends and family and by making sure Nevadans are aware of just how dangerous this bill is to the future of our great state.

QUICK DONATE >>
I won’t take up too much of your time, but I wanted to give you an update on our financial situation.
We are CRUSHING the Democrats in grassroots fundraising right now and if we keep this up we will break records for grassroots donations as we have never seen before.
Here’s the thing, to keep up the pace we have been asked by President Trump’s team to fundraise $65,000 (from just here in Nevada) during the Republican Convention.
This is a large goal for us to accomplish in just a few days, but if we can keep up the pace and momentum then we can get there. I know we’ve asked a lot of you recently, but you’re the team we rely on the most to keep this operation running and to fulfill the goals we get asked to fulfill.
Can you help us by contributing whatever you can now to reach the $65,000 we need to raise in just a few days?
Here’s a secure link to donate now: [[URL REDACTED]]
After you do, if you can think of any friends or family that would chip-in to help us will you send them this link? [[URL REDACTED]]
It would be embarrassing to take a major dip in fundraising during the Republican Convention when we did so well during the Democrat Convention.
Make sure we don’t let OUR President down. Chip-in what you can now to help fund our operation to register voters, get out the vote, train candidates and volunteers, provide infrastructure, run online ads, and to MAKE NEVADA RED AGAIN.
Here’s the link again: [[URL REDACTED]]

"our great state then and now
I grew up in a Nevada where we learned the state song in elementary school and grew up with state pride knowing and LOVING that Nevada joined the Union on October 31st, in the midst of the Civil War, and as part of the political effort to pass the 13th Amendment abolishing slavery.
That’s something to be proud of.
Our great state IS something to be proud of, but Democrats and coastal elites are trying to turn Nevada into something that she is not.
Today is our most important End of Month Deadline and our LAST of the election. If we don’t reach the $10,000 we need this won’t be the Nevada we love. I know we’ve asked a lot of you these last couple of months, but we HAVE to meet this deadline. Can we count on you to chip-in and beat this deadline TONIGHT?
Luckily, we had a donor reach out last night and offer to 4X MATCH all contributions made before the deadline. So if you hurry and chip-in now your contribution will make 4X the impact.

While some San Francisco Bay Area counties have moved to allow salons to restart indoor operations, San Francisco is not one of them. And San Francisco did not permit even outdoor salon services until Tuesday.”

We’re hearing word that Democrats are going to try to remove CRITICAL election safeguards AND push legislation that ties the hands of our law enforcement officers and puts the safety of Nevadans at risk. Here’s how we need you to take action:
ACTION CENTER:
CHIP-IN: CONTRIBUTE TO THE NEVADA LEGAL DEFENSE FUND
SIGN NOW: PROTECT NEVADA ELECTION INTEGRITY
TELL LEGISLATORS: DON’T HANDCUFF OUR COPS
We need you active and attentive over the next week.
Without law enforcement, our Nevada cities would turn into another Portland or Seattle where law enforcement’s hands are tied and small businesses are on their own. Without election safeguards, our chances at a fair and just system are through.
Democrats are taking advantage of the pandemic and they think we will let them remove our Rights and give in to fear.
Show them just how wrong they are. Let your voice be heard.
Thank you for fighting with us,
Jess, Nevada Republican Party

"Review-Journal: Republicans sue Clark County over mail ballot counting
Nevada GOP
ALERT: HEARING SCHEDULED
Clark County is not allowing Republicans to watch the ballot counting process and it is our RIGHT to meaningfully observe!
The Nevada Republican Party and President Donald Trump’s re-election campaign filed a lawsuit against Clark County on Friday, alleging the county has violated state election law during its counting of mail-in ballots
Quick Donate to the Legal Defense Fund >>
Under the law, we have the right to meaningfully observe ballot processing. Clark County Election Department is stripping those rights away from the people.
As such, we joined with the Trump Campaign to file a lawsuit against Clark County to stop counting mail ballots until our case can be made. They declined our request to stop the count before a ruling can be made, but we still have our hearing scheduled for Wednesday.
It is the LAW for a reason. This protects our vote and their assault on our voter rights is yet another assault on election integrity. Will you help fund our lawsuit and chip-in to the LEGAL DEFENSE FUND NOW?
And even more terrifying, after promising signature matching would safeguard mail-in ballots, Clark County has lowered the standard to catch forges!

UPDATED STORY:
Republicans sue Clark County over mail ballot counting
Judge denies request to stop mail ballot counting in Clark County
By Rory Appleton Las Vegas Review-Journal
A Carson City judge Friday denied to halt ballot counting in Clark County in response to a lawsuit filed by Republicans that contends the county has violated state election law.
The Nevada Republican Party and President Donald Trump’s re-election campaign filed the lawsuit against Clark County Registrar Joe Gloria and Nevada Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske on Friday. The lawsuit asked a judge to stop the counting and verification of mail ballots until the case could be heard.
But Attorney General Aaron Ford, whose office defends Cegavske in litigation, tweeted Friday afternoon that his office had “defeated President Trump’s and Nevada GOP’s request for a temporary restraining order to stop the counting of the ballots.”
CONTRIBUTE TO THE LEGAL DEFENSE FUND
Ashley M. Forest, a spokeswoman for Ford’s office, said Judge James Wilson denied the temporary restraining order. A hearing on the lawsuit has been scheduled for next week, however. Cegavske’s office declined to comment on the lawsuit.
Former Attorney General Adam Laxalt, a Trump co-chair for Nevada, said the campaign’s primary issue is with how the required voter signatures on the outside of mail ballot envelopes are verified in Clark County. In order for a ballot to be counted, the signature on the envelope must match the signature on file with the county’s election office.
CONTRIBUTE TO THE LEGAL DEFENSE FUND
Laxalt Tweet
Laxalt said the county uses a machine that only matches signature verification at 40 percent — lower than the 50 percent recommended setting by its manufacturer and the standards in other Nevada counties. He also questioned the training and expertise of staff tasked with checking signatures that the machine declines.
Laxalt said both major parties also have no way of challenging any mail-in ballot signatures as they are verified in this process — a right which he said they do have during in-person voting. Once a ballot is verified, it is separated from its envelope, and the two can not be reunited.
He cited the Bush v. Gore decision in the U.S. Supreme Court that settled the 2000 election in saying that Clark County’s more relaxed standards are “diluting” the votes cast in other counties, which is not legal. Different counties in the same state may not have different standards for rejecting ballots, he said.
Laxalt also challenged the county’s current ballot rejection rate of a little more than 1 percent. “If it’s true all 99 percent are valid voters — their signatures match and they are legally able to vote — then for sure they should count,” Laxalt said. “But we know we have 85,000 voters who shouldn’t be on the rolls — people who’ve died or moved and the rolls haven’t been cleaned. So it strains credibility than only 2,000 of the first 200,000 (mail-in ballots) have been rejected.”
Republicans criticize mail ballots
Other complaints in the lawsuit match those in a letter sent by Republican lawyers to Cegavske earlier this week. The letter claimed the county was not allowing observers into all of the rooms in which ballots are handled, was positioning observers too far away for “meaningful observation” and would not allow the GOP to place cameras in observation areas. State law allows for members of the public to observe ballot counting and processing at county offices.
The party accused the county of failing to be transparent during a newly adopted election format.
State and national Republicans, including Trump himself, have routinely criticized both state Democrats, who adopted new election standards given the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and mail-in balloting, which they say increases chance of ballot fraud.
Experts have said mail balloting is safe, and Cegavaske testified earlier this year that her office did not find any fraud during the state’s all-mail primary election in June. So far, mail ballots have trended heavily in Democrats’ direction. Statewide, 160,125 Democrats have mailed in ballots compared to 74,384 Republicans as of Friday.
In Clark County, 107,928 Democrats and 38,355 Republicans have mailed in ballots. Republicans have begun to outpace Democrats in in-person early voting, however, cutting the statewide Democratic lead from 17 percentage points to about 11 points over the course of the week.
Clark County is largely Democratic and holds the lion’s share of the state’s voters, while the rural counties — whose votes Laxalt claims are being “diluted” — tend to lean more Republican.
Access granted
In response to the lawsuit, Clark County spokesman Dan Kulin said the election department “has gone above and beyond to provide access to observers,” creating additional observation areas beyond what is required under state law. “The lawsuit includes many misleading or inaccurate claims,” Kulin said.
Kulin said the room Republicans complain about being denied access to is, in fact, a call center for reaching out to voters who need to fix, or “cure,” issues with their mail-in ballots. Because election staff may discuss personal information with voters over the phone, observation is not permitted. The call center does not house any ballots, Kulin said.
The county believes the request for cameras in observation areas is likely not legal under state law, with Kulin adding that it is also inappropriate to allow one party to have exclusive access and control over cameras during the election.
Kulin said this process is administered by two-person, bipartisan counting boards. The ballots are not removed from their privacy sleeves until their envelopes have been stored in a secure location. Any ballots with problems are not returned to their envelope, but rather a separate folder. “At no time is the envelope with the voter’s name sought or used in this step of the process,” Kulin said.
The Republican lawsuit also misrepresents how ballots are verified, first by machine and then by hand, according to Kulin.
The number 40 does not refer to a percentage, but rather a scored setting based on factors such as writing style, the slant of the letters and how someone crosses their t’s. And there is no manufacturer’s recommended setting, Kulin said; jurisdictions across the country use a wide variance.
As of Friday, 30 percent of mail ballots have been accepted by the machine’s settings, meaning 70 percent have been personally verified by election staff, Kulin said.
Democrats respond to lawsuit
Nevada State Democratic Party Chairman William McCurdy II said the lawsuit was “an obvious attempt to impede record-breaking momentum in Clark County, the most diverse county in the state.”
He said Trump and his allies have resorted to “baseless attacks to undermine confidence in Nevada’s election integrity” and our making one last, desperate play as Democrats hold an early advantage. “The demands articulated in the GOP’s lawsuit amount to voter suppression, plain and simple,” McCurdy said.
The Trump campaign and the Nevada Republican Party also sued to try to invalidate the mail-balloting system before the election, but that lawsuit was rejected by the Nevada Supreme Court. And a federal lawsuit against Assembly Bill 4, which authorized sending mail ballots to all active registered voters during a pandemic, was similarly rejected by a federal judge.

Judge blocks lawsuit challenging how Clark County counts mail-in ballots
By Colton Lochhead Las Vegas Review-Journal
November 2, 2020
CARSON CITY — A Carson City judge on Monday blocked a lawsuit brought by President Donald Trump’s re-election campaign that attempted to change how Clark County is processing mail-in ballots in the final days of the election.
The Nevada Republican Party and Trump’s re-election campaign filed the lawsuit on Friday asking the court to force Clark County to alter how it has been counting and verifying mail ballots, to allow “meaningful” observation of all stages of the process, including allowing a camera inside the room where ballots are stored at the county facility, and for a way to challenge mail ballots.
The lawsuit had asked for a temporary restraining order to immediately halt the county’s efforts. Carson City District Court Judge James Wilson denied that request hours after the lawsuit was filed but allowed the case to move forward to a hearing.
During opening statements in the hearing Wednesday, Nevada Deputy Solicitor General Gregory Zunino said the lawsuit had clear partisan motives of trying to disqualify ballots cast in Democratic-leaning Clark County.
“Clark County is a blue county, and this is a numbers game. And quite frankly they would like to exclude as many ballots in Clark County as they can. They want a high rejection rate,” Zunino said. “They are not challenging the process in Elko County or Humboldt County or Carson City because those are red counties.”
Attorneys for the Trump campaign and state Republican Party argued the county’s signature verification process for mail-in ballots was lacking and that observers were not given ample opportunities to view or challenge the work of election workers.
Those charges mirror complaints raised by Republicans in recent weeks that watchers are being kept too far away from the process for “meaningful observation” and that county officials would not allow the Republican party to install cameras inside the observation areas.
The county’s process, they argued, left the door open to risk of voter fraud, a common refrain from Trump and Republicans on mail ballots that judges have dismissed in other lawsuits filed by conservative groups in Nevada this year.
In September, U.S. District Court Judge James Mahan dismissed a lawsuit brought by the Trump campaign, writing that “not only have plaintiffs failed to allege a substantial risk of voter fraud, the State of Nevada has its own mechanisms for deterring and prosecuting voter fraud.”
Elections experts have said mail-in ballots are safe, and Nevada’s Republican Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske testified this year that her office did not find any fraud during the state’s primary election, which was conducted almost entirely by mail.
This is likely not to be the last lawsuit filed in Nevada by the Trump campaign this election cycle.
Speaking to reporters ahead of a campaign rally in Charlotte on Sunday, Trump said that they plan to file numerous lawsuits in key battleground states like Pennsylvania and Nevada on election night, according to a tweet from PBS Newshour White House Correspondent Yamiche Alcindor.
“We’re gonna go in, the night of, as soon as that election’s over, we’re going in with our lawyers,” Trump said.
Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford tweeted out in response to Trump’s comments, “And we’re ready.”

Nevada GOP Requests Investigation Into Mail Tampering by Biden Ally
COLLIN ANDERSON OCT 6, 2020 4:10 PM
The Nevada Republican Party asked federal law enforcement to investigate a Culinary Union chapter for illegally tampering with mailboxes while canvassing for Democratic nominee Joe Biden. In a Monday letter sent to U.S. Attorney for the District of Nevada Nicholas Trutanich, party chairman Michael McDonald highlighted a recent canvassing effort in which a member of Culinary Union Local 226 was pictured leaving campaign literature in a voter's mailbox. Under federal law, ""only U.S. Postal Service delivery personnel are allowed to place items in a mailbox"" in order to ""ensure the integrity of our customer's mailbox,"" according to a 2010 USPS press release.
DEMAND AN INVESTIGATION OF TAMPERING
""Not only are such actions a violation of Federal law and a violation of Nevada citizens' right to privacy, they open the door to potential fraud and ballot manipulation in a year where Nevadans will be nearly universally voting by mail,"" the letter states. ""And if operatives are going door to door and placing campaign literature in mailboxes, nothing would stop an unscrupulous canvasser from removing live ballots from mailboxes and filling them out for their preferred candidate or removing them from households and simply throwing them away.""
SIGN THE PETITION: INVESTIGATE MAIL TAMPERING IN NEVADA
Clark County—which includes the city of Las Vegas—mailed sample ballots to voters on September 25 and is scheduled to mail official ballots on Saturday, according to the Nevada secretary of state. Thirteen Nevada counties have already mailed official ballots to voters.
""Put simply, the election is underway,"" McDonald's letter says. ""In the year 2020, the integrity of our elections is at stake, and we cannot allow potentially rogue activists to compromise them.""
Culinary Union Local 226 has long supported Democrats, spending nearly $1.5 million to boost former president Barack Obama in the 2008 cycle, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. The chapter is an affiliate of hospitality labor group UNITE HERE, which has spent more than $16.1 million backing Democrats over the last three decades. Both the Culinary Union and UNITE HERE have endorsed Biden for president.

"I am gravely concerned
Morning in Nevada PAC
Friend --
I am writing to you because I am gravely concerned about the security of the election this November.
In the recent special session, Nevada Democrats rushed through “election reforms” on party-line, weekend votes, under the cover of night and without members of the public present. These “reforms” include a radical embrace of universal mail-in voting and California-style “ballot harvesting.”
Morning in Nevada PAC is fighting back against Governor Sisolak’s attack on our elections. We are gathering signatures from patriotic Nevadans across the state to show Governor Sisolak that we see through his vote-by-mail scheme and demand a fair election.
I am asking you to sign our petition to halt these “reforms” before it’s too late. We will submit our petition to the Nevada Secretary of State, and we need 10,000 more signatures to meet our goal. Please take just one minute to sign our petition to save our elections.
Click Here to Sign the Petition to Save our Elections
sign petition
We at Morning in Nevada PAC have shown time and again that with the help of Nevadans like you, we can make a big difference. We successfully led the fight to stop a dangerous sanctuary state bill during the last legislative session, and we need to have you on board for the fight ahead!
This threat to our election integrity could not be more serious, and that’s why we are leading the effort to fight back. Recently, the Las Vegas Review-Journal published an op-ed I wrote about how our state simply lacks the tools and infrastructure to conduct a universal mail-in election securely, and how the Democrats’ “reforms” have left our November elections susceptible to widespread error. The reforms drastically weaken our signature verification requirements, and Nevada’s Secretary of State recently testified that we have only one full-time investigator to look into election irregularities.
As I wrote in the op-ed: “A radically new, untested and risky election system is coming our way for November. Nevada is simply not ready for it.”

"the very foundation of our nation is under attack.
Morning in Nevada PAC
RGJ
My fellow Nevadans,
This is former Nevada Attorney General and current Morning in Nevada PAC President Adam Laxalt. I’m reaching out to you today because the very foundation of our nation is under attack.
I hope you’ll check out an important Op-Ed I wrote recently, calling out the left and the Democrats for their assault on our nation, our history, and our Founding Fathers. As I say in the Op-Ed, “even the Fourth of July, that great American holiday of unity and celebration, has become a matter of controversy and division in the hysteria of the present moment."" It’s incredible, but it’s true. You can read the full Op-Ed by clicking here.
The far left in this country, which includes mainstream Democrats, has fully embraced a radical, revisionist and dishonest history of America. They essentially want to cancel America and its history. In the face of this assault, we must stand with President Trump in fighting back against these extremists who are maligning our country.
It’s alarming how few of our elected leaders have been willing to stand against the mob to support our most fundamental values. It’s absolutely crucial that Republicans and conservatives across Nevada speak with one voice in defense of our ideals. We must fight for the American way of life.
Thank you.
For Nevada,

"Team —
Amid growing concern around COVID-19, schools across Nevada have closed, businesses on the Las Vegas Strip are temporarily shutting their doors, and Governor Sisolak declared a state of emergency.
These precautions are necessary to stop the spread of the virus — but across the country, workers whose jobs don’t offer paid leave have been put in an incredibly difficult situation.
Last year, Democrats in the Nevada State Legislature led the charge to pass the “Paid Leave for Any Reason” bill, which guarantees up to 40 hours of paid leave per benefit year here in Nevada.
It is time for Congress to follow suit and pass paid leave at the federal level. Add your name if you agree →

People should not have to choose between taking care of themselves or a loved one and putting food on the table.

"# Jacky Rosen
Team, I'm emailing for $3.
My friend Senator Rosen said I should reach out -- and here's why: Senate control is on the line this year and Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight is saying Democrats won't be able to take back the Senate without New Hampshire. Our likely right-wing opponent knows this – so he's pouring millions from his personal fortune into our race to try and buy this seat and protect McConnell's Senate majority.
My team set a goal to raise $45,000 before midnight, but as of now, we're falling $8,432 short. I'll be honest: If we miss this critical goal, Democrats will lose any chance of taking back Senate control.
That's why grassroots donations from reliable Democrats like you are so important. Senate races in New Hampshire are always close: The last one was won by just 1,017 votes. But if you join thousands of grassroots donors who want to flip the Senate blue and make a contribution of $3, we'll be able to win in New Hampshire and take back the Senate majority.
Luckily, there’s still time for us to reach this goal -- so I'm counting on you to give now:
Split a $3 donation between my campaign and Jacky Rosen right now -- before our fundraising deadline at midnight -- to help defend New Hampshire's Senate seat and take back the Senate for Democrats.
Thanks,
Senator Jeanne Shaheen

Now that recent polling shows this election is a one-point race, we know Mitch McConnell and his corporate special interest donors are going to spend millions more to try to tear our campaign down.
We can't let them get away with it.
I'm asking you to split $5 or more to Senator Rosen's and my campaigns today. Washington Republicans have booked more money in North Carolina than any other state, and small-dollar donations from folks like you are vital to our plan to fight back and win.
We have a good shot at flipping this Senate seat, and our race has been rated a toss-up by just about every major election forecaster out there. The road to flipping the Senate runs right through North Carolina, so we cannot afford to slip up and fall short now.
In such a tight race, everything we do matters and we need all hands on deck to end Mitch McConnell's Senate majority.
Will you split a contribution of $5 or more to Senator Rosen's and my campaigns today to flip the Senate?
Let's do it!

The Republican National Convention is making it clearer than ever: Democrats can’t afford to lose the 2020 fight. Will you pitch in $5 now to help us win?

\---Original Message from Jacky Rosen---
team,
The Republican National Convention starts today.
In stark contrast with our Democratic National Convention last week, we’re expecting to hear divisiveness, extreme partisanship, and outright lies about Democrats from the GOP all week.
We need to be ready to fight the political noise and misinformation -- because we can’t afford to lose any steam in the fight to win the White House and flip the Senate. Can we count on you in this fight? Make a $5 contribution right now.
We know that President Trump and the GOP will say anything to try and win this election. They know that the American people are sick and tired of the extreme Republican agenda -- so the GOP is pulling out all the stops to distract voters and suppress Democrats from casting ballots.
Just look at their shameful attacks on the U.S. Postal Service. Like former First Lady Michelle Obama said last week, “folks who know they cannot win fair and square at the ballot box are doing everything they can to stop us from voting.” That includes the GOP’s attempt to sabotage mail-in voting -- the safest way to cast our ballots during this unprecedented public health crisis.
We need all hands on deck to win the 2020 fight. Chip in $5 now.
Thank you,
Jacky

We wanted to make sure you saw this, team:
In November, we can turn these three Southern states blue by electing Democratic Senators who will fight for the people of their states and for our future as part of a Democratic majority.
Will you pitch in $5 now to support Jaime Harrison, Mike Espy, and Adrian Perkins?

\---Original Message from Jacky Rosen---
Team,
Most Southern states may have been reliably Republican for decades -- but this year, Democrats are poised to beat the odds and flip red seats blue across the South.
Will you contribute $5 right now to stand with Democratic Senate candidates Jaime Harrison in South Carolina, Mike Espy in Mississippi, and Adrian Perkins in Louisiana?
A new poll shows that Democrat Jaime Harrison is only down by two points to Lindsey Graham. That means that this seat is up for grabs -- and with our support Jaime can win this race.
In Mississippi, Democrat Mike Espy is running to defeat Cindy Hyde-Smith, a rubber stamp for the Trump-GOP agenda, and move Mississippi forward. He needs our help to flip this seat.
And we’ve got a brand new candidate in Louisiana, Shreveport Mayor Adrian Perkins, who needs us to help him launch his campaign to defeat Republican Bill Cassidy.
When we elect these candidates, we’ll be making history -- for the South and for the nation -- with a Democratic Senate. Contribute $5 right now.

Did you tune in last night for the opening of the Democratic National Convention?
We heard from an exciting group of Democrats, including Jacky Rosen’s Democratic Senate colleagues Catherine Cortez Masto, Doug Jones, Amy Klobuchar, and Bernie Sanders.
We believe that Democrats can win big this November -- including electing a Democratic majority in the Senate. We’re hoping to raise $10,000 before the end of the convention to show that we’re ready to win this fight. Will you pitch in $5 to show your support?
We can’t afford two more years of Mitch McConnell and the GOP leading the Senate. We need a Democratic majority that will fight for affordable health care, gun reform, and climate action.
We need a Democratic Senate that won’t delay when it comes to supporting working families during a pandemic or addressing the problems of systemic racism and injustice in our country.
But we know what we’re up against: President Trump is already wreaking havoc on the U.S. Postal Service to try and keep himself and the Republicans in power. We need to fight back.
Can we count on you? Jacky needs your support to reach this crucial $10,000 fundraising goal by the end of the week. Contribute $5 right now.
Thank you,

President Trump is in Nevada today -- and while our state authorities stopped him from hosting the large campaign rallies he had planned, he’s still doing everything he can to rally his far-right base in an effort to swing our state in his direction in November. But we can’t let that happen.
We need to send Trump a message: we’re keeping Nevada blue. Pitch in $5 now.
The fight for Nevada’s future is on -- and this is a fight that we have to win.
But the Cook Political Report just downgraded Nevada from “Likely Democratic” to “Lean Democratic” -- meaning that our state is once again an important battleground.
That’s why we need all hands on deck if we’re going to keep Nevada blue in 2020 and beyond.
Together, I know that we can defeat President Trump and the GOP and ensure that Democrats win big in 2020. Donate $5 or whatever you can to join me in the fight.

In 2018, voters here in Nevada and in neighboring Arizona elected women to the U.S. Senate.
In 2020, we have the opportunity to elect (and re-elect) even more strong Democratic women.
That includes Barbara Bollier in Kansas, MJ Hegar in Texas, and Tina Smith in Minnesota.
Our Democratic candidates are up against the wire ahead of the FEC’s June 30 deadline. Can you rush in a $5 contribution now to help them meet their fundraising goals?
Barbara Bollier would make history as the first female physician to ever serve in the Senate.
MJ Hegar is fighting for real change in Texas -- a battleground state on the verge of turning blue.
And Tina Smith is working hard for Minnesota families, but she needs our support in this race.
If we’re going to take back the Senate, we need to support Democratic women like Barbara, MJ, and Tina. Winning or losing these races could mean the difference in control of the Senate.
Barbara, MJ, and Tina need our help to meet their end-of-quarter goals. Will you pitch in $5 or whatever you can to support these incredible women before the deadline?

Will you pitch in $5 right now to elect these women -- and help them flip the Senate?
Every day in the Senate, I am fighting for families in Nevada and across the country.

I am so excited about the big news we got yesterday. Joe Biden, our Democratic nominee for President, has selected my friend Senator Kamala Harris as his running mate for November!
Kamala showed up in a big way to help us flip this Senate seat in Nevada in 2018. Now, it’s our turn to show up for her and ensure she is elected as our next Vice President! Will you pitch in $5 to help elect Joe and Kamala -- and flip the Senate in November?
Kamala has been a champion in the Senate on the issues that matter most, from protecting and expanding affordable health care to fighting climate change to pushing for gun safety reform.

My friend Jacky said I should reach out today with an update on our race in Alabama.
We’ve known all along that once Alabama voters saw the truth about my record of getting things done for them -- and saw through Tommy Tuberville’s false ads and complete lack of experience -- that we could win this race. Thanks to supporters like you, we have been getting the truth out.
It’s clear voters are responding -- the latest polls show us vaulting into the lead. Let’s keep it up:
I need your help to keep this Alabama Senate seat blue. Will you split a $5 contribution to my campaign and Jacky Rosen right now to join the fight?
In 2017, we proved the Washington pundits wrong and showed the nation that unity and hope can win when we flipped Alabama’s Senate seat. In 2020, we’re going to prove it once again.
We’re leading Tuberville in the polls, but we’ve got to keep up this momentum until the election.
Pitch in $5 to my campaign and Jacky Rosen now to expand our lead in Alabama.

Democrats have some truly exciting opportunities to flip red seats blue in this election -- but we simply can't take back the Senate if we don't defend every Democratic Senate seat up this year.
That's why I'm in this fight to re-elect all of our Democratic incumbents this November, including Senators Jeanne Shaheen, Gary Peters, Doug Jones, Tina Smith, Mark Warner, and Cory Booker.
Can we count on you in the fight to defend our Democratic champions -- and make sure we can build a Democratic Senate majority? Pitch in $5 now to show your support.
Even if we defeat President Trump, we still won't be able to make real progress for our nation with Mitch McConnell and the GOP standing in the way. That's why we need to win this fight.

I am doing everything in my power to protect lives and livelihoods during this pandemic. But unfortunately, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says he doesn't feel ""the sense of urgency"" for the Senate to take further action to support workers, families, and businesses through this crisis.
The Senate should be working right now to support the people on the frontlines of this crisis, like hospital workers, first responders, grocery store employees, delivery drivers and so many more. Add your name now to tell Mitch McConnell that it’s time for action.
The House has already passed additional legislation to help provide economic relief for millions of Americans, hazard pay for essential workers, unemployment benefits, and rental assistance
But instead of taking the HEROES Act up for debate or a vote in the Senate, Mitch McConnell has called back Senators to confirm right-wing judges to lifetime appointments on the bench.
Our top priority during this public health crisis must be the health and economic security of our families, workers, and communities. That’s why I’m asking you to join me in calling for action:
It’s time for the Senate to get to work. Add your name to call on Mitch McConnell and the Senate GOP to come to the table and provide the support workers and families need.

Iowa can be one of the four seats Democrats need to flip from red to blue this November -- but Mitch McConnell and the GOP have already pledged up to $12 million to win this race.

Yesterday was the Alabama Senate Republican primary and it’s official: Democratic Senator Doug Jones is facing a well-funded Republican with a strong chance of taking this seat back for Mitch McConnell.
McConnell’s GOP allies have booked $3.5 million in TV ad buys, starting today, and Doug urgently needs our support to fight back.
Can you please chip in $5 right now to help Doug Jones kick off the general election and keep Alabama’s Senate seat in Democratic hands?
Here’s the good news: Doug is currently tied with his GOP opponent. He can win this re-election fight, but with McConnell and GOP allies laser-focused on this seat, Doug will need all the help we can give him.
Doug has shown tremendous courage as a U.S. Senator. He’s consistently stood up for what’s right, even knowing it’d make him a target for McConnell and big money GOP super PACs.
And right now, Doug is fighting to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic, protect access to affordable health care and expand Medicaid.
Let’s show Mitch McConnell and his GOP super PAC allies that we have Doug Jones’ back. Contribute $5 directly to Doug’s campaign right now to help him kick off the general election and respond to the GOP’s latest ad buy.

For months now, Democrats in Congress have been pushing for a comprehensive relief package to support workers, families, and communities during this COVID-19 crisis.
Shamefully, Mitch McConnell and the GOP have the wrong priorities in this pandemic -- they’ve been focused on shielding corporations from liability rather than standing with working families.
And now, McConnell just sent the Senate home for August recess without a bipartisan deal in sight -- meaning that real economic relief for families and workers is now even further away.
Jacky Rosen is fighting for COVID-19 relief for the people who need it most, but she needs us standing with her. Sign on now to demand Mitch McConnell and the GOP come to the negotiating table and work out a deal immediately during this public health crisis.
The Democratic-led House of Representatives passed the HEROES Act on May 15 -- nearly three months ago. But Leader McConnell said he felt no “sense of urgency” to pass any additional legislation to support working families through this pandemic.
Instead, the GOP thinks that protecting corporations from lawsuits is more important than helping families make ends meet, extending unemployment protections, putting a halt on evictions, and more. We all need to speak out and put the pressure on them to take action.
Add your name right now to call for immediate COVID-19 relief for working families.

I’ll get right to it. We're not where we need to be ahead of our mid-month fundraising deadline. This is our first deadline of the general election, so it's crucial we don't fall short.
Will you split a $5 donation between my campaign and Jacky Rosen right away to help us close the gap?
The Iowa Poll, the gold standard poll in Iowa, has us up THREE points over Republican Senator Joni Ernst. This is going to be the race of the cycle -- one of the closest in the country.
FiveThirtyEight just said ""[...] the Senate has to be considered a toss-up at this point,"" and with the campaign arm of Mitch McConnell's Senate Republicans on the air in Iowa, we have to fight back. We can't take back the majority without winning here in Iowa.
Right now, momentum is on our side -- three polls show us neck and neck with our opponent! But there are attack ads on the air already -- with more on the way. I am not taking a dime of corporate PAC money. Instead, we rely on folks like you to step up and help us fight back.

Thank you so much for your support, team.
This grassroots team stepped up in a big way -- and we were able to reach our July goal.
Now, we have a different goal: we want to make Jacky’s birthday tomorrow the best one yet!
Will you sign Jacky’s card now to wish her a happy birthday?
Because of the pandemic, Jacky can’t celebrate her birthday normally this year -- but if each of us signs her card or leaves her a note, we can still ensure her special day is one to remember.
From fighting for affordable health care to economic opportunity for all, Jacky is standing with us every day in the Senate. Now, let’s show her how much we appreciate her on her birthday.
We can’t wait to give Jacky this special birthday card -- will you sign your name now?
Thank you,
Team Rosen

Team,
Democrats won in Nevada in 2016 -- and we did it again in 2018.
But Nevada is a swing state, and we need to do everything we can to keep it blue in 2020.
According to Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight, President Trump and the GOP are targeting Nevada this year as an opportunity to pick up a win in a state that they narrowly lost in the last election.
But we can stop them. That's why I am asking you for your support for Joe Biden. Together, we can make sure he wins Nevada -- and the White House.
Are you ready for a Democratic victory in November? Chip in $5 now to join the fight.
After President Trump's disastrous presidency, we need to get this country back on track. That starts by electing a Democratic Senate and sending Joe Biden to the White House in November.
With Democrats at the helm, we can finally get to work for the people again -- and make progress on urgent issues like health care, climate change, and raising the minimum wage.
But first, we need to stand with Joe Biden. If we all step up and own a piece of his campaign, we can accomplish our mission of defeating President Trump -- and keeping Nevada blue.
Can Joe and I count on your support in this must-win fight for our nation's future? Donate $5 or whatever you can to help us win big in November.
Thank you,
Jacky

Team,
This November, I will be proud to support my friend and colleague, Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts, for re-election. But first, we need to join together to help him win his primary.
Ed has a clear reason for running, a bold vision for the future, and a record of progressive accomplishments. And we need to ensure every voter in Massachusetts hears his message.
Will you pitch in $5 now to support Ed Markey’s campaign?
Right now, Ed is fending off a formidable primary challenge. Pundits and political insiders say the race is statistically tied -- and his opponent just dropped $2.4 million to double his TV ad buy.
When we take back the Senate this fall, we need champions like Ed Markey as a part of the new Democratic majority, fighting for progressive solutions to climate change and health care. We can’t afford to lose Ed’s essential voice -- especially in such a pivotal moment for our nation.
Now is the moment for all of us to stand with Ed Markey and help him win this crucial primary. Make a $5 contribution right now to support his re-election campaign.
Thank you,

I have a question for you, team.
Are you ready to flip the Senate in 2020?
I know I am. Despite the hundreds of Democratic-led bills that have passed in the House, from commonsense gun reform to action on climate change, Mitch McConnell and the GOP have stalled our progress at every turn. Instead of working for the American people, McConnell’s Senate is focused on confirming extreme judges to lifetime appointments on the federal bench.
And now, with the COVID-19 pandemic and racial injustice requiring our urgent attention, the GOP’s proposals continue to fail to meet the challenges of this moment. Americans can’t afford two more years of this lack of leadership -- we need a Democratic majority in the Senate.
I’m fighting to elect Democratic candidates across the country -- but I need you to stand with me before the midnight end-of-month fundraising deadline. Contribute $5 right now.
Yesterday, we set a goal of receiving 250 donations before the end of the month, and we’re nearly halfway there. We've only got a few hours left to meet our goal before midnight. If you’re with me in the fight to take back the Senate, show your support now:
Pitch in $5 or any amount now to help us meet this goal -- and flip the Senate.

While this crisis is keeping Democrats off of the campaign trail for the time being, our fight for victory in November continues. Please only make a contribution if you are able to do so. We appreciate your support.
Team,
The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated that we need Democratic leadership more than ever. And in the next election, we’ll have the opportunity to succeed in that must-win fight.
We’ve got a tall order in November. We need to hold and expand our Democratic majority in the House -- and we must take back the White House and the Senate from Republican control.
I know we can do this, but it won’t be easy. That’s why it’s critical that we meet our May fundraising goal -- and I need your support before midnight.
I’m doing everything I can to defend our progress here in Nevada and elect Democrats in important races across the country. If you’re with me, pitch in $5 before the deadline.
2020 is a must-win fight for Democrats. While President Trump fails to lead from the White House, Mitch McConnell is delaying action on COVID-19 economic relief in the Senate. It’s clear that Republicans are simply not up to this challenge -- and we urgently need to replace them.
I’m doing everything I can, but I need you with me in this fight:
Will you rush in your $5 contribution before the midnight end-of-May deadline?

Senator Rosen said I should reach out with an update, team:
The general election in the Kansas Senate race starts today. It’s official: Democrats can win this race.
The latest polls show that this race is competitive. Together, we can win in November.
But we’re up against a far-right candidate who will have Mitch McConnell’s full support. A McConnell-aligned super PAC is already spending millions in Kansas -- and the GOP and corporate special interests are about to double down in the fight to keep this crucial seat red.
The general election starts now -- and I need you with me in the fight to flip Kansas’ Senate seat. Split a $5 contribution between my campaign and Jacky Rosen now.
When I’m in the Senate, I will work as hard as I can to expand access to affordable healthcare. I will do everything in my power to ensure we’re taking urgent action on climate change, rooting out corruption and dysfunction in Washington, and fighting for good jobs and a strong economy.
But if the GOP keeps this seat, we can expect more of the same divisive hyper-partisanship we’ve come to expect. I believe Kansans deserve better -- that’s why I need your support.
We can flip this seat -- but with less than three months to go until Election Day, we don’t have any time to waste. Contribute $5 or whatever you can now to join me in the fight.
Thank you,

This will surely be the most important and consequential election in modern history.
It’s all on the line in November: affordable health care, a competent response to the pandemic, reproductive rights, climate action, the Supreme Court, and so much more.
We absolutely must defeat President Trump -- but that alone isn’t enough. We need to take back control of the Senate from Mitch McConnell and his failed Republican majority.
I’m setting a $25,000 end-of-quarter fundraising goal to help keep this fight on track. Can I count on you to pitch in $5 or whatever you can before the September 30 deadline?
Losing this 2020 fight is not an option. There is just too much at stake. And the loss of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has only made it even more clear.
We need a Democratic White House and Democratic Senate so we can finally move this country forward and undo the damage caused by President Trump and Mitch McConnell.

Most Southern states may have been reliably Republican for decades -- but this year, Democrats are poised to beat the odds and flip red seats blue across the South.
Will you contribute $5 right now to stand with Democratic Senate candidates Jaime Harrison in South Carolina, Mike Espy in Mississippi, and Adrian Perkins in Louisiana?
A new poll shows that Democrat Jaime Harrison is only down by two points to Lindsey Graham. That means that this seat is up for grabs -- and with our support Jaime can win this race.
In Mississippi, Democrat Mike Espy is running to defeat Cindy Hyde-Smith, a rubber stamp for the Trump-GOP agenda, and move Mississippi forward. He needs our help to flip this seat.
And we’ve got a brand new candidate in Louisiana, Shreveport Mayor Adrian Perkins, who needs us to help him launch his campaign to defeat Republican Bill Cassidy.
When we elect these candidates, we’ll be making history -- for the South and for the nation -- with a Democratic Senate. Contribute $5 right now.

The Iowa Senate race is one of the most competitive in the country. Will you rush in a contribution to help Theresa Greenfield flip this pivotal seat?
Contribute
\---Original Message from Theresa Greenfield---
Team, Senator Rosen said I could reach out about our must-win Senate race in Iowa.
Control of the Senate hinges on Iowa and this race couldn't be closer. The latest Des Moines Register poll -- the gold standard for polling in Iowa -- shows me leading my opponent by just three points -- that's within the margin of error.
It's never been more important that we flip the Senate, and our best shot is in Iowa. That's why Mitch McConnell and his allies are pouring over $65 MILLION into Iowa and why they just released new ads attacking me.
Will you split a $5 contribution between my campaign and Jacky Rosen today?
Look, I’ve never backed down from a fight. And to be frank, I'm ticked off. From trying to gut Social Security ""behind closed doors,"" to spreading debunked COVID-19 conspiracy theories, Senator Ernst has gone from wrong for Iowa to outright dangerous. It’s not enough just to replace her. We need to flip the Senate and take back the majority to protect the health and safety of Americans. But we can’t do that without flipping this seat right here in Iowa.
If we're going to end McConnell's career as Majority Leader, we need to fight back against the millions he’s pouring into our race to prop up Senator Ernst. I'm not accepting one dime of corporate PAC money, so that’s where you come in. I’m counting on you to step up again today to fight back against McConnell and Ernst.
If you're ticked off like me and ready to bring some decency back to the Senate, I need you to chip in right away.
Split a donation of $5, or whatever you can, between my campaign and Jacky Rosen to help us replace Senator Ernst and take back the Senate.
Thank you,

NEWSWEEK: “These Two Democratic Senators Are in Danger of Losing Their Seats”
Team,
According to the latest from Newsweek, Democratic Senators Gary Peters and Doug Jones are the two most vulnerable Democrats up for re-election in 2020. The GOP are targeting these Democratic champions, hoping to turn these states red and keep their GOP Senate majority.
If we’re going to flip the Senate, we need to hold on to every Democratic seat. We simply can’t afford to lose these fights in Michigan and Alabama -- that’s why we need all hands on deck.
And now, with the Supreme Court on the line, the fight for the Senate is even more important.
Pitch in $5 right now to defend Democratic Senate seats in Michigan and Alabama.
There’s no way around it -- these two races are some of the toughest for Democrats on the 2020 map. But victories here are so consequential -- because we can’t lose any ground as we fight to take back the Senate from Mitch McConnell’s Republican majority.
We need this grassroots team’s support more than ever -- can we count on you to step up now?
Make a $5 contribution -- or whatever you can -- to keep these pivotal seats blue.

My friend Jacky said I should reach out today with an update on our race in Alabama.
We’ve known all along that once Alabama voters saw the truth about my record of getting things done for them -- and saw through Tommy Tuberville’s false ads and complete lack of experience -- that we could win this race. Thanks to supporters like you, we have been getting the truth out.
It’s clear voters are responding -- the latest polls show us vaulting into the lead. Let’s keep it up:
I need your help to keep this Alabama Senate seat blue. Will you split a $5 contribution to my campaign and Jacky Rosen right now to join the fight?
In 2017, we proved the Washington pundits wrong and showed the nation that unity and hope can win when we flipped Alabama’s Senate seat. In 2020, we’re going to prove it once again.

Enough is enough.
The heartbreaking death of George Floyd must be a call to action for all of us. Racial injustice has continued in our country for far too long -- and it’s up to us to come together and end it.
We must take action to stop the wrongful deaths of Black men and women in law enforcement custody. Will you add your voice to the call and sign the petition now?
Police officers take an oath to protect and serve their communities -- but far too often, we are seeing outrageous examples of excessive force, used particularly against people of color.
Because of the actions of these officers, including the officer who killed George Floyd, we continue to see protests in the street. People are rightfully angry and demanding change.
And instead of leading in this moment, the President of the United States authorized the use of tear gas on peaceful protesters in order to clear the way for a photo-op. That is unacceptable.
That’s why, in the Senate, I introduced a resolution to reaffirm Americans’ constitutional right to peacefully protest and condemn President Trump’s actions -- but Mitch McConnell shamefully blocked it. It’s time for Republicans to stop standing in the way of protecting our democracy.
Our nation has a long history -- since before it was even founded -- of systemic racism and oppression against Black people and people of color. We can no longer accept silence or inaction -- each and every one of us must do whatever we can to demand reforms and end these injustices.

Tomorrow marks two years since President Trump, Majority Leader McConnell, and the Senate GOP confirmed Justice Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court in a highly partisan process.
Now, the Republicans are dead set on continuing to undermine the integrity of the Supreme Court by rushing through a confirmation for Amy Coney Barrett -- breaking with their own precedent set by the “McConnell Rule” in 2016 to wait to confirm the next Supreme Court Justice until after the American people have their next president.
We all need to keep speaking out and fighting back to protect the Supreme Court. Everything from affordable health care to reproductive rights are on the line. Add your name to my petition and tell the Senate to wait to confirm a new justice.
We are just weeks away from Election Day -- and voting has already begun in some states. The American people deserve to have a say in this process -- and their voices should be heard in November before the Senate moves forward with a lifetime appointment to the court.
But the GOP are rushing to get this confirmation on the books before the election because they are closer than ever to achieving their goal of a conservative supermajority on the Supreme Court that will overturn the Affordable Care Act, Roe v. Wade, marriage equality, and more.
We need to keep fighting like our lives and futures depend on it. We must hold Senate Republicans to their own rules and wait to confirm the next Supreme Court Justice until after the American people have their next president. Are you with me? Sign your name now.

Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight reports Democrats have ZERO chance of taking Senate control if we lose in Michigan. But my Trump-backed opponent has outraised us four out of the last five quarters, and a brand-new poll from the New York Times shows our race within the margin of error.
Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and Betsy DeVos’ family are funneling TENS of MILLIONS of dollars into Michigan to buy this Senate seat -- and GOP super PACs are spending more to defeat me than any other Democratic senator up for reelection.
With our fundraising gap growing by the day, we need to raise another $50,000 before midnight tonight if we want to stay on track to win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats.

Senator Rosen said I could give you a quick update on our Senate race here in Arizona.
In just a moment, I am going to ask you to make a contribution to our campaign for Senate. Please give me a chance to explain why this request -- especially today -- is so important.
Because of generous supporters like you joining my campaign, I was proud to win the primary in Arizona and become the official Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate.
But now that I’m the nominee, Mitch McConnell is going all-in to defeat us. He just launched a new ad boosting our GOP opponent -- and they have the money to run it until Election Day.
For every dollar the GOP spends against us, we need one from grassroots supporters like you to fight back. Will you pitch in $5 to my campaign and Jacky Rosen now?
Support from people like you is why we’re in a strong position to flip this seat. My campaign is powered by people and grassroots support -- not Mitch McConnell and special interests.
So just know that every time you decide to chip in $3, $5, $10 or whatever you can, it allows us to keep putting one foot in front of the other so we can win this race -- and flip the Senate.
If you are able, will you make a $5 donation to support my campaign and Jacky Rosen in the fight to win in Arizona -- and flip this seat?

Susie Lee is a fighter for Nevada families.
Whether it’s working to strengthen our public education system, protecting and expanding access to healthcare, or making sure our veterans get the benefits they’ve earned, Susie’s never been afraid to roll up her sleeves and get the job done.

And it shows! Republican Super PACs and outside groups have already spent more than $1.8 million to attack Susie Lee!
If we’re going to hold on to our Democratic Majority in the House, we absolutely must win in competitive districts like Susie’s.
But I know that if we each do our part, there’s no challenge we can’t overcome.
So please I hope you’ll join me and support my friend Susie Lee. Donate $5 to her campaign and help her keep Nevada’s 3rd District BLUE in 2020.

Here's the thing, in 2016, Trump lost in Minnesota by just 1.5 points. He’s doing everything he can to make sure that doesn’t happen again. Will you rush an immediate donation to help make sure we have the resources to respond to incoming attacks?
The Trump campaign is spending more than $14 million to flip Minnesota red. And we know Mitch McConnell’s megadonors are chomping at the bit to write a check so big it would make your eyes pop! That’s why I’m coming to you today to ask you to split a donation between myself and Jacky Rosen.
If we want to take back the Senate for Democrats, we need to hold strong in Minnesota and stop Republicans from flipping our state red. Can I count on you to rush a donation to help us fight back?
Ok, I need to run to an emergency Zoom meeting about this now, but thanks for your help.
Thank you,
Tina

Team, Senator Rosen said I could reach out on behalf of my boss, John Hickenlooper.
I wish I didn’t have to send this email, but I just made a tough decision that could make-or-break this campaign.
To be blunt, we weren’t expecting our fundraising to dip as much as it has. Right now, we do not have enough money to launch our final media buy of this election.
To make matters worse, we just got intel that outside Republican groups are launching another round of nasty attacks to sink our campaign in these final days.
The sheer number of attacks directed at our campaign has been alarming. So, I authorized our team to launch a new ad to fight back -- even though we don’t have the money in our budget.
Look, I’m willing to bet grassroots supporters like you can get us back on track and ensure we have the financial resources to fight off the GOP’s attacks before it’s too late. I’ve seen it before, and I’m counting on it now:
Please, split $5 or anything you can between our campaign and Jacky Rosen to help us flip Colorado’s Senate seat blue. We need to raise another $15,394 by midnight.
Every penny matters as we gear up for the worst attacks Republicans will throw at us.
Thank you,

My friend Jacky said I could reach out, folks.
Last night’s debate made it clear: this is the most important election of our lifetimes. We only have 10 days left to determine the future of our country and the stakes could not be higher.
Before I ask if you can chip in to ensure Democrats have the resources to get out the vote and win this election, I hope you’ll hear me out.
We as a country find ourselves in a moral moment. For the past four years, President Trump and Vice President Pence have spread chaos, hatred, and division across our country, all while failing to properly address the COVID-19 pandemic.
Folks, the stakes of this election are at an all-time high. Donald Trump is a president who has threatened the free press and protesters exercising their First Amendment rights, encouraged foreign interference in our elections, and personally profited off the presidency.
Through his words and actions, he’s attacked immigrants, women, Black and brown people, the LGBTQ community, students, seniors, and so many others while completely obliterating our democratic norms and basic decency along the way.
Everything from health care coverage for millions of people, to reproductive freedom guaranteed by Roe v. Wade, to our bedrock environmental protections, to our most basic right to vote, and so much more are on the line in this election.
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have been saying, “This is a battle for the soul of our nation.” And they’re right.
That’s why I’ve been working so hard to make sure that this campaign and others have the resources needed to win this November, so we can take back control of the Senate and remove Trump and Pence from the White House for good.
With so much on the line and with only 10 days to go until Election Day, will you split a contribution between my campaign and my good friend Jacky Rosen’s work to flip the Senate to support us in this fight?
I appreciate anything and everything you do to stand up and fight for what’s right in this moral moment for our nation.

Team,
In 2018, voters here in Nevada and in neighboring Arizona elected women to the U.S. Senate.
In 2020, we have the opportunity to elect (and re-elect) even more strong Democratic women.
That includes Barbara Bollier in Kansas, MJ Hegar in Texas, and Tina Smith in Minnesota.
Our Democratic candidates are up against the wire ahead of the FEC’s June 30 deadline. Can you rush in a $5 contribution now to help them meet their fundraising goals?
Barbara Bollier would make history as the first female physician to ever serve in the Senate.
MJ Hegar is fighting for real change in Texas -- a battleground state on the verge of turning blue.
And Tina Smith is working hard for Minnesota families, but she needs our support in this race.
If we’re going to take back the Senate, we need to support Democratic women like Barbara, MJ, and Tina. Winning or losing these races could mean the difference in control of the Senate.
Barbara, MJ, and Tina need our help to meet their end-of-quarter goals. Will you pitch in $5 or whatever you can to support these incredible women before the deadline?

\---Original Message from Team Rosen---
NEWSWEEK: “These Two Democratic Senators Are in Danger of Losing Their Seats”
Team,
According to the latest from Newsweek, Democratic Senators Gary Peters and Doug Jones are the two most vulnerable Democrats up for re-election in 2020. The GOP are targeting these Democratic champions, hoping to turn these states red and keep their GOP Senate majority.
If we’re going to flip the Senate, we need to hold on to every Democratic seat. We simply can’t afford to lose these fights in Michigan and Alabama -- that’s why we need all hands on deck.
And now, with the Supreme Court on the line, the fight for the Senate is even more important.
Pitch in $5 right now to defend Democratic Senate seats in Michigan and Alabama.
There’s no way around it -- these two races are some of the toughest for Democrats on the 2020 map. But victories here are so consequential -- because we can’t lose any ground as we fight to take back the Senate from Mitch McConnell’s Republican majority.
We need this grassroots team’s support more than ever -- can we count on you to step up now?
Make a $5 contribution -- or whatever you can -- to keep these pivotal seats blue.
Thank you,

Team,
When I talk to supporters in Nevada and across the country, one question I hear most often is, “Can Democrats flip the Senate this November?” My answer is yes -- and here’s how we’ll do it:
According to Larry Sabato’s Crystal Ball, the fight for control of the Senate will likely come down to results in four must-win states for Democrats: Arizona, Colorado, Maine, and North Carolina.
That means we need to organize, raise funds, and elect Mark Kelly in Arizona, John Hickenlooper in Colorado, Sara Gideon in Maine, and Cal Cunningham in North Carolina. Winning these races is key to a Democratic Senate -- so we need to do everything we can.
Can we count on you in this fight to flip the Senate? Pitch in $5 right now to support Mark Kelly, John Hickenlooper, Sara Gideon, and Cal Cunningham.
Mark Kelly is an astronaut and former Navy captain. He’s in the fight because people in Arizona and across the country need access to affordable health care and commonsense gun reform.
John Hickenlooper is a former Colorado governor and small business owner who is ready to bring his problem-solving skills to Washington to get things done and make real progress.
Sara Gideon is the Speaker of the Maine House of Representatives. Maine is ready for a leader like Sara on their side when it counts, from fighting for health care to supporting our economy.
And Cal Cunningham is an Army veteran and state lawmaker who wants to put North Carolina’s Senate seat back to work for the people and fight for economic opportunity and equality for all.
Mark, John, Sara, and Cal are the kinds of leaders we need in the Senate. Not only will they be strong leaders for their states, they will help us build a new Democratic majority.
If you’re ready to flip the Senate, contribute $5 now to support these Democrats.
Thank you,
Jacky

We can’t come up short. Can I count on you to pitch in $5 now to fuel this fight?
Once again, Nevada is a crucial battleground in this election. President Trump’s campaign manager just said: “If the election were held today, the president would win Nevada.”
The Republicans think they can reverse our progress and paint Nevada red -- but together, we can prove them wrong. I’m doing everything I can to support Democrats up and down the ballot, from re-electing Susie Lee in my old congressional district to electing Joe Biden for President.
But let’s be clear: winning these fights won’t be easy -- and there’s too much at stake to be complacent. We need to double down in these last two weeks and ensure we come out on top.

Right now, the Senate Republicans are doing everything they can to rush Amy Coney Barrett’s confirmation to the Supreme Court ahead of the November election -- refusing to follow the precedent of the McConnell Rule they created themselves in 2016 and allowing the American people to have their next President sworn in before any vacancy on the Supreme Court is filled.
I am fighting back -- including by supporting Democratic candidates across the country in the fight to flip red seats blue and take back the Senate from Mitch McConnell.

\---Original Message from Jacky Rosen---
Team,
Tomorrow marks two years since President Trump, Majority Leader McConnell, and the Senate GOP confirmed Justice Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court in a highly partisan process.
Now, the Republicans are dead set on continuing to undermine the integrity of the Supreme Court by rushing through a confirmation for Amy Coney Barrett -- breaking with their own precedent set by the “McConnell Rule” in 2016 to wait to confirm the next Supreme Court Justice until after the American people have their next president.
We all need to keep speaking out and fighting back to protect the Supreme Court. Everything from affordable health care to reproductive rights are on the line. Add your name to my petition and tell the Senate to wait to confirm a new justice.
We are just weeks away from Election Day -- and voting has already begun in some states. The American people deserve to have a say in this process -- and their voices should be heard in November before the Senate moves forward with a lifetime appointment to the court.
But the GOP are rushing to get this confirmation on the books before the election because they are closer than ever to achieving their goal of a conservative supermajority on the Supreme Court that will overturn the Affordable Care Act, Roe v. Wade, marriage equality, and more.
We need to keep fighting like our lives and futures depend on it. We must hold Senate Republicans to their own rules and wait to confirm the next Supreme Court Justice until after the American people have their next president. Are you with me? Sign your name now.

This Pride Month, the Supreme Court made the historic decision declaring that workplace discrimination against members of the LGBTQ+ community is illegal in the United States.
This is an important step forward in the fight for LGBTQ+ civil rights, but we must go further to ensure equality in housing, credit, education, and so many other areas. That’s why I helped introduce the Equality Act last year -- and am still pushing the Senate to pass this legislation.
It’s time to guarantee equal rights for all and outlaw discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. Add your name to my petition right now if you agree.
While we have made tremendous progress in the fight for equality, the LGBTQ+ community is still not fully protected from discrimination. That’s why we need to pass the Equality Act now.
It is simply inexcusable that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has refused to bring this House-passed legislation to the Senate floor for a vote. The LGBTQ+ community should not be forced to wait any longer for full equality under the law. The Senate must take urgent action.
This Pride Month, let’s tell Mitch McConnell and the GOP Senate leadership that we need action and full equality for LGBTQ+ Americans. Sign on now to support the Equality Act.

I wanted to explain why this grassroots team is so instrumental if we’re going to flip this seat. Right now, my opponent Roger Marshall is running attack ads against me in Kansas, distorting my record and spreading misinformation. And he’s not alone -- Mitch McConnell’s allies have already poured millions of dollars into this race in an all-out effort to defeat us in November.

From our record-breaking fundraising numbers to POLITICO upgrading our race rating for November, I am so encouraged about our chances to flip Kansas’ Senate seat. But I also know it’s going to take each and every one of us doing our part to ensure a victory in this election.
We simply can’t afford to come up short in our fundraising this month. We need to do everything we can to keep our campaign on track and our ads on the air. The momentum is on our side -- but we can’t slow down for a minute if we’re going to win this fight.

On Friday night, just as I, and so many across the country were preparing to celebrate Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, we learned that Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg had died.
There’s a Jewish tradition that those who die on the eve of Rosh Hashanah are especially righteous -- and Justice Ginsburg was a true embodiment of righteousness in her tireless fights for justice. From leading in the fight for gender equality to championing our rights on the Supreme Court, she left an immense legacy.
Now, it’s up to us to protect her legacy by fighting our hardest to replace her with a Supreme Court justice who shares her values. I’ll be doing everything I can in the Senate, but here’s the truth: we need reinforcements.

Recently, we’ve been inundated with news that has made me reflect on why I decided to run for Senate.
I decided to run for Senate because for too long we’ve watched partisan politics grind our country to a halt in its most challenging moments. I’m running to put an end to that and to make sure the people of Arizona have a strong ally in Congress.
I want to win this race and be that independent voice, so I’m counting on folks like you to make a contribution to our people-powered campaign. Will you split a $5 donation between my campaign and Jacky Rosen today?

Team,
In the Senate, I am helping to lead the fight to demand answers from Postmaster General Louis DeJoy about the dangerous changes he's made that are slowing down postal service delivery.
We are only two months away from Election Day -- and with more voters than ever planning to receive and send their ballots by mail this year, these delays are harmful and unacceptable.
I’m fighting as hard as I can to protect the U.S. Postal Service from the GOP’s partisan attacks, but I need you with me. Add your name to my petition now.
We need answers on critical issues at USPS like delivery delays, overtime policies, and the removal of mail sorting machines and collection boxes around the country. I am pushing for President Trump's Postmaster General to not only explain these changes -- but reverse them.
Our country's future is at stake in this election -- and we simply can't let it be influenced by these politically-motivated attacks on USPS. We all need to keep speaking out and fighting back.
Sign on now: tell DeJoy and Trump to reverse their reckless attacks on USPS right away.
Thank you,
Jacky

The battle for control of the Senate is on -- and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee is the only committee solely dedicated to electing a Democratic Senate majority this November.
The DSCC just launched their Flip the Senate program -- and they’ve set a $500,000 fundraising goal to help elect Democrats across the country. Pitch in $5 right now.
We know that we can’t count on Mitch McConnell and the Senate GOP to deliver the kind of leadership or push for the real progress we need in this moment.
That’s why the DSCC is doing everything they can to flip competitive Senate seats -- like Colorado, Texas, and North Carolina -- and defend our Democratic incumbents in states like Alabama, Michigan, and New Hampshire. This fight won’t be easy -- but we can’t afford to lose.
We can flip the Senate, but we need to stand together in this critical moment. Will you make a $5 contribution now to help the DSCC meet their $500,000 fundraising goal?
Thank you,
Jacky

Team,
Postmaster General Louis DeJoy testified before the Senate today -- and I questioned him about his role in the reckless Trump Administration sabotage at the U.S. Postal Service.
The American people deserve answers -- not just about the unnecessary changes at the post office, but about what DeJoy and President Trump are going to do to reverse them and ensure that people in Nevada and across the country can send and receive their mail without delays.
I am doing everything I can to defend the U.S. Postal Service from partisan attacks and protect our elections. Are you with me? Contribute $5 now.
We’ve been hearing report after troubling report of “cost-saving measures” like cutting back workers’ hours, decommissioning mail sorting machines, and removing blue mailboxes. These changes have raised concerns about whether mail-in ballots will be received by Election Day.
We need real assurances that these changes at USPS will be reversed -- and that everyone who chooses to vote by mail during this pandemic will have their ballot received and counted.
And we all know that the election isn’t the only thing impacted by delays in the mail -- people in Nevada and across the country receive medicine, bills, and other important correspondence by mail every single day. We need to ensure that USPS is properly funded so that there is never another excuse for politicians to undercut our postal system -- during this crisis and beyond.
I’m fighting as hard as I can to save the USPS. Join me in the fight: pitch in $5 now.
Thank you,

Senator Rosen said I could reach out today, team.
It's never been more important that we flip the Senate, and our best shot is in Iowa. That's why Mitch McConnell and his allies are pouring over $80 MILLION into Iowa and why they just released new ads attacking me -- because the latest polls are calling this a one-point race.
I need your help to fight back and flip this crucial seat in Iowa. Will you split a $5 contribution between my campaign and Jacky Rosen now?
I'm running to replace GOP Senator Joni Ernst because she's not just wrong for Iowa, she's downright dangerous. It's not enough to replace her in November. We need to flip the Senate and take back the majority to protect the health and safety of Americans. But we can't do that without flipping this seat right here in Iowa.
If we're going to end McConnell's career as Majority Leader, we need to fight back against the millions he's pouring into our race to prop up Senator Ernst. I'm counting on you to step up again today to fight back against McConnell and Ernst -- are you in?
Split a donation of $5, or whatever you can, between my campaign and Jacky Rosen to help us replace Senator Ernst and take back the Senate.

Did you see President Obama’s speech last night, Team?
Speaking live from our virtual Democratic National Convention, former President Barack Obama made the powerful case about why the 2020 election is the most important one of our lifetimes.
He said: “this Administration has shown it will tear our democracy down if that’s what it takes to win. So we have to pour our energy into building it up… and voting like never before.”
There is so much at stake in November -- and like President Obama said last night, we need to do everything we can to win this fight. I’m supporting our Democratic candidates across the country and fighting to flip the Senate. Can you pitch in $5 right now?
There is no question that we need to defeat President Donald Trump and elect Joe Biden. But we know that winning the White House won’t be enough if we don’t take control of the Senate from Mitch McConnell and the GOP. Right now, Democrats have the momentum in the fight for control of the Senate, but we can’t slow down with our nation’s future on the line in this election.
That’s why I set a $10,000 fundraising goal for us to reach during the Democratic convention this week -- and We are so close to meeting this goal.
Make a $5 contribution right now to support our fight to flip the Senate in 2020.

Yesterday, Senator Rosen emailed you about four key races that could be key to taking back the Senate from Mitch McConnell and the Republicans this November.
Pitch in $5 to help flip Senate seats in Arizona, Colorado, Maine, and North Carolina.
Contribute
\---Original Message from Jacky Rosen---
Team,
When I talk to supporters in Nevada and across the country, one question I hear most often is, “Can Democrats flip the Senate this November?” My answer is yes -- and here’s how we’ll do it:
According to Larry Sabato’s Crystal Ball, the fight for control of the Senate will likely come down to results in four must-win states for Democrats: Arizona, Colorado, Maine, and North Carolina.
That means we need to organize, raise funds, and elect Mark Kelly in Arizona, John Hickenlooper in Colorado, Sara Gideon in Maine, and Cal Cunningham in North Carolina. Winning these races is key to a Democratic Senate -- so we need to do everything we can.
Can we count on you in this fight to flip the Senate? Pitch in $5 right now to support Mark Kelly, John Hickenlooper, Sara Gideon, and Cal Cunningham.
Mark Kelly is an astronaut and former Navy captain. He’s in the fight because people in Arizona and across the country need access to affordable health care and commonsense gun reform.
John Hickenlooper is a former Colorado governor and small business owner who is ready to bring his problem-solving skills to Washington to get things done and make real progress.
Sara Gideon is the Speaker of the Maine House of Representatives. Maine is ready for a leader like Sara on their side when it counts, from fighting for health care to supporting our economy.
And Cal Cunningham is an Army veteran and state lawmaker who wants to put North Carolina’s Senate seat back to work for the people and fight for economic opportunity and equality for all.
Mark, John, Sara, and Cal are the kinds of leaders we need in the Senate. Not only will they be strong leaders for their states, they will help us build a new Democratic majority.
If you’re ready to flip the Senate, contribute $5 now to support these Democrats.
Thank you,
Jacky

I am fighting as hard as I can in the Senate to defend our families and our values as the Trump Administration maligns immigrants and attacks Americans’ access to affordable health care.
I am fighting for you, friend. Stand with me and pitch in $5 now.
President Trump’s fight to repeal the Affordable Care Act threatens health insurance for millions of people across the country, including protections for people living with pre-existing conditions.
And from his wasteful and senseless quest for a border wall to his cruel treatment of families seeking asylum at our border, the President’s immigration policies are harmful and un-American.
I pledge to keep fighting back, to keep lifting up your voices in the Senate when it comes to these critical battles for our communities and our values. But I can’t do this on my own.
I need you with me in this fight. Will you stand with me and contribute $5 now?

DAILY KOS: ""Nevada Democrat Jacky Rosen Destroys DeJoy in Senate Testimony
Did you see this, team?
Jacky Rosen grilled President Trump's politically-motivated Postmaster General Louis DeJoy during his Senate testimony -- and he did NOT have good answers about his USPS sabotage.
Jacky is fighting hard to protect the U.S. Postal Service, but she needs all of us standing with her in the fight. Will you pitch in $5 toward her end-of-month fundraising goal?
It was clear from his responses that DeJoy did not think about our veterans, our senior citizens, our small businesses, or the integrity of our elections before his controversial actions at USPS.
That's why Jacky is doing everything she can to roll back the changes at USPS that could delay the delivery of everything from life-saving medications to mail ballots for the November election.
She's also working to fully fund the U.S. Postal Service so it can't be used as a political football. Too many people are depending on the post office to let these partisan politicians undermine it.
But Jacky needs us standing with her so she can keep up this critical fight -- and win.
Can you donate $5 now to help Jacky meet her August goal before the deadline?

Senator Rosen said I should reach out, team:
The past few weeks since I won the U.S. Senate nomination here in Texas have been the strongest of our campaign so far, and I am so grateful for the outpouring of support!
It's clear: Texas is fired up and ready to elect a Senator who will always put working families over D.C. special interests and who answers to the people -- not Big Pharma, the gun lobby, or the Koch network. Instead, I'm counting on the support of people like you to win in November.
We’re ready to do something incredible in November: flip Texas blue. Are you with us? Then split a $5 contribution between my campaign and Jacky Rosen right now.
We've got a Texas-sized grassroots army powering this campaign, with over 56,000 donors from more than 190 Texas counties, and our average online donation is just $23! This is truly a movement powered by the people. But it will take all of us working together to win this fight.
Texas is a battleground state. The polls show that we’re in a single digit race. Texans have had it with politicians who sell us out to the highest special interest bidder and march in lockstep with powerful D.C. bosses like Mitch McConnell -- instead of doing what’s right for Texas.
I know we can win this fight. We can flip Texas -- and take back the Senate. But I need your support. Will you pitch in $5 to me and Jacky Rosen now?

Yesterday was the Alabama Senate Republican primary and it’s official: Democratic Senator Doug Jones is facing a well-funded Republican with a strong chance of taking this seat back for Mitch McConnell.

Here’s the good news: Doug is currently tied with his GOP opponent. He can win this re-election fight, but with McConnell and GOP allies laser-focused on this seat, Doug will need all the help we can give him.
Doug has shown tremendous courage as a U.S. Senator. He’s consistently stood up for what’s right, even knowing it’d make him a target for McConnell and big money GOP super PACs.
And right now, Doug is fighting to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic, protect access to affordable health care and expand Medicaid.
Let’s show Mitch McConnell and his GOP super PAC allies that we have Doug Jones’ back. Contribute $5 directly to Doug’s campaign right now to help him kick off the general election and respond to the GOP’s latest ad buy.

We just got some difficult news about our 2020 hopes -- the Associated Press just named the Senate race in Minnesota as one of the top ten seats most likely to flip in November.
That means that this seat is in play for the GOP. But we can’t afford to lose Tina Smith’s voice in the Senate. And we can’t let the Republicans win this race and still win a Democratic majority.

Minnesota is a crucial state for Democrats -- not only to win the White House, but the Senate.
President Trump only lost Minnesota by 1.5 points in 2016. Now, his campaign is pledging to spend millions of dollars to win the state in 2020 and secure a second term -- meaning that Tina’s GOP opponent is hoping to ride the President’s coattails to victory in November.
Now more than ever, we need leaders like Tina Smith in the Senate. But with the GOP targeting Minnesota in this election, we need to show our support and help her win this critical fight.

Team, Senator Rosen said I could reach out about our must-win Senate race in Iowa.
Control of the Senate hinges on Iowa and this race couldn't be closer. The latest Des Moines Register poll \-- the gold standard for polling in Iowa -- shows me leading my opponent by just three points -- that's within the margin of error.
It's never been more important that we flip the Senate, and our best shot is in Iowa. That's why Mitch McConnell and his allies are pouring over $65 MILLION into Iowa and why they just released new ads attacking me.
Will you split a $5 contribution between my campaign and Jacky Rosen today?
Look, I’ve never backed down from a fight. And to be frank, I'm ticked off. From trying to gut Social Security ""behind closed doors,"" to spreading debunked COVID-19 conspiracy theories, Senator Ernst has gone from wrong for Iowa to outright dangerous. It’s not enough just to replace her. We need to flip the Senate and take back the majority to protect the health and safety of Americans. But we can’t do that without flipping this seat right here in Iowa.
If we're going to end McConnell's career as Majority Leader, we need to fight back against the millions he’s pouring into our race to prop up Senator Ernst. I'm not accepting one dime of corporate PAC money, so that’s where you come in. I’m counting on you to step up again today to fight back against McConnell and Ernst.

Hello --
I really need to explain what’s happening in our race, and Senator Rosen said I could reach out to you because we need your help more than ever before. Here it goes:
A new poll just came out showing a close, single-digit race against Cory Gardner -- the tightest margin we’ve seen since Republican groups unleashed a devastating $9 million attack campaign against me.
We cannot risk the Democrats’ best chance to take back the Senate because we got outspent or outworked by right-wing organizations bankrolled by Mitch McConnell.
Gardner’s campaign has double the cash-on-hand than ours, and I’m sure the Koch network is gearing up for another round of nasty attacks designed to sink this race further. We need your help now to make sure we’re ready for them:
If you can afford to give, please split a contribution to my campaign and Jacky Rosen of $5 or more. Any amount makes a huge difference in helping our team fight back against these attacks.
We are 92 days away from this election. I can’t believe it myself. But I am telling you that we are the best shot Democrats have to flip a Senate seat, and we can’t give that up.
That’s why your donation is so important, and why I am personally counting on you to pitch in what you can today.

Team, Senator Rosen said I could reach out. I’m humbly asking for your help to beat Lindsey Graham and flip South Carolina BLUE. Can I count on you to split a $5 contribution between my campaign and Jacky Rosen today?
I’m proud of all that this grassroots team has done. We even OUTRAISED Lindsey the first two quarters of the year!
And according to the nonpartisan election experts at Cook Political Report, this race is a TOSSUP.
We have a real shot to win.
But Lindsey and his wealthy donors are going to do -- and spend -- whatever it takes to destroy our grassroots movement.
We have a plan to reach swing voters across the state and retake the lead, but we need to raise $42,415 before midnight tomorrow.
We can’t do this without you. Will you chip in a few dollars to my campaign and Jacky Rosen to help me defeat Lindsey and flip South Carolina blue?
Together, we can bring hope back to the people Lindsey has left behind.

Team,
On Friday night, just as I, and so many across the country were preparing to celebrate Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, we learned that Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg had died.
There’s a Jewish tradition that those who die on the eve of Rosh Hashanah are especially righteous -- and Justice Ginsburg was a true embodiment of righteousness in her tireless fights for justice. From leading in the fight for gender equality to championing our rights on the Supreme Court, she left an immense legacy.
Now, it’s up to us to protect her legacy by fighting our hardest to replace her with a Supreme Court justice who shares her values. I’ll be doing everything I can in the Senate, but here’s the truth: we need reinforcements.
Split a $5 contribution right now to me and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee to elect a Democratic Senate.
These next few months won’t be easy. But Justice Ginsburg fought every day of her life for justice and equality. Now, it’s our turn.
Will you join me in the fight ahead? Start with a $5 contribution right now to flip the Senate.
Let’s work to make Justice Ginsburg’s memory a blessing,
Jacky

It is simply unconscionable that President Trump and the GOP are continuing their attacks on affordable health care -- even while an unprecedented public health crisis continues to grip our nation. Now, the fate of our health care law hangs in the balance at the Supreme Court.
Last week in the Senate, I took a stand.
I joined my fellow Senate Democrats in introducing a resolution condemning the reckless Republican efforts to dismantle the Affordable Care Act and rip away health care protections for hundreds of thousands of Nevadans along with millions more across the country.
We need all hands on deck to protect the Affordable Care Act -- or millions of people, including those with pre-existing conditions, will lose access to the health care they need. Add your name to my petition now to save the ACA.
Voters in Nevada sent me to the Senate in 2018 to defend the Affordable Care Act -- and that’s exactly what I’m doing. Protecting Americans’ health care is one of my top priorities.
One of the first things I did as a Senator was to introduce a resolution that would have permitted the Senate Legal Counsel to defend our health care law in court since the Trump Administration would not. And every day since, I have been fighting as hard as I can to win this fight.
We simply cannot afford to roll back the Affordable Care Act -- especially during a global pandemic. Sign on to my petition now to condemn the GOP's attacks on health care.
Thank you,
Jacky Rosen

Today, instead of providing pandemic relief for working families and small businesses, the Senate Republican majority instead chose to ignore their own precedent and confirm President Trump's controversial Supreme Court nominee just days away from the November election.
The best way to fight back? Flipping the Senate. Contribute $5 or any amount now.
It is beyond shameful the way that Senate Republicans have rushed this confirmation process -- despite blocking President Obama from appointing Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court in 2016 because it was an election year. But the GOP only cares about rushing a Justice onto the high court to overturn the Affordable Care Act, attack reproductive freedom, and advance extreme conservative interests through the courts.
We need to send Mitch McConnell a message.
Will you pitch in $5 or whatever you can to help Democrats take back the Senate?

There are so many reasons that we all love Nevada. And one of those things that makes our state so special is the diverse fabric of people who call Nevada home -- including the fastest-growing Asian American and Pacific Islander community in the United States.
But as we celebrate Asian Pacific American Heritage Month, we're also seeing a spike in hate crimes and discrimination against Asian Americans amid this global public health crisis.
We can't stand by and let this happen. No one should be forced to live with anxiety and fear in their own country -- and no one should be subjected to racism or xenophobia.
During Asian Pacific Heritage Month and always, I am standing with our AAPI communities in Nevada and across the country. Add your name now to join me.
Here in Nevada, we celebrate our diversity. We know that Asian Americans are making important contributions to our state and our nation, from our culture to our economy.
And we will not stand for xenophobia in Nevada. When anyone tries to fuel anti-Asian racism or hatred in our state, we will stand up and fight back for our neighbors and communities.
Are you with me? Sign on now to show your support and stand with Asian American and Pacific Islander communities in Nevada and across the nation.
Thank you,

In a new article from Vox, longtime Democratic strategist Chuck Rocha sounded an alarm about the dangers of not taking states like Nevada seriously enough in November.
“It worries me that the donor class and the consultant class think that Nevada is a safe blue state… I’ve been seeing some inside polls that say it’s much closer than people think it is.” Rocha warns that if we don’t get out the vote, Nevada could turn red in 2020.
We can't let that happen. Will you rush in a $5 contribution right now to help us meet Jacky Rosen's mid-September fundraising goal before the deadline?
One journalist called Rocha's comments a ""huge red blaring siren"" about Democrats' chances in Nevada. We've worked so hard to turn Nevada blue -- we can't let that slip away this year in one of the most important elections we've ever seen. We need all hands on deck in this critical fight.
President Trump and the GOP think that they can undo our progress and paint Nevada red. That's why it's just so important that we meet this mid-month goal -- our futures are on the line.
Will you pitch in $5 right now to help us meet this crucial goal?

Democrats are fired up about flipping the Senate in November -- because even if we defeat President Trump, we need a Democratic Senate to undo the GOP’s damage and move this country forward. We simply can’t afford two more years of Mitch McConnell’s failed leadership.
That’s why I’m supporting our Democratic Senate candidates across the country -- and I’m asking for you to join me and help these exciting challengers turn red seats blue in this election.

In Iowa, the latest polls show Theresa Greenfield is three points ahead of her Republican opponent. And Rev. Raphael Warnock is running in a competitive race to become the first Democratic Senator from Georgia in decades -- and Georgia’s first Black Senator ever.
Failure is not an option. There is just too much on the line in the fight for control of the Senate for us to come up short. That’s why I’m asking you to stand with me and these fantastic candidates -- because the only way we will flip the Senate is by doing it together.

President Trump’s Postmaster General Louis DeJoy slowed down mail delivery -- and in the Senate, I am doing everything I can to demand answers on behalf of the American people.
All signs point to a partisan sabotage of vote-by-mail to suppress the vote and help elect Republicans in November. These attacks on USPS -- and our elections -- are unacceptable.
President Trump and his allies want to influence the outcome of this election by meddling with the U.S. Postal Service. We need all hands on deck to fight back.
Right now, we’ve only got a few hours left until the midnight fundraising deadline. If we’re going to flip the Senate, we need to ensure our Democratic candidates have the resources to overcome these attempts at voter suppression. Contribute $5 now.
You have my word, : I will continue to fight as hard as I can to protect the U.S. Postal Service and defend the integrity of our elections. And I will keep doing everything in my power to support Democratic candidates across the country in the fight for Senate control.
But here’s the thing: we can’t win these consequential battles unless we’re standing together.
Can I count on your support? Make a $5 contribution before the midnight deadline.

Right now, President Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell are pushing forward with their shameful plan to install Amy Coney Barrett onto the Supreme Court -- and everything from the fate of the Affordable Care Act to our reproductive freedom is at risk if they succeed.
We know we can't count on the Republicans to do the right thing -- they are refusing to even follow their own precedent set in 2016 by confirming a Justice just weeks from Election Day.
We need to fight back by flipping the Senate and removing the McConnell-GOP majority. Jacky Rosen is leading the fight -- but she needs us with her. Will you pitch in $5 to help us meet Jacky's $25,000 end-of-quarter goal before tomorrow's midnight deadline?
In 2018, Nevadans sent Jacky Rosen to the Senate to fight for affordable health care and protections for people with pre-existing conditions. She has continuously fought back against the GOP's attacks on the Affordable Care Act -- but if President Trump and Mitch McConnell get their way and confirm Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court, all of our progress on health care will be on the line.
Now more than ever, we need to double down in our fight to flip the Senate. Jacky is supporting Democratic Senate candidates across the country -- she needs this grassroots team to join her.

DAILY KOS: ""Nevada Democrat Jacky Rosen Destroys DeJoy in Senate Testimony
Did you see this, team?
Jacky Rosen grilled President Trump's politically-motivated Postmaster General Louis DeJoy during his Senate testimony -- and he did NOT have good answers about his USPS sabotage.
Jacky is fighting hard to protect the U.S. Postal Service, but she needs all of us standing with her in the fight. Will you pitch in $5 toward her end-of-month fundraising goal?
It was clear from his responses that DeJoy did not think about our veterans, our senior citizens, our small businesses, or the integrity of our elections before his controversial actions at USPS.
That's why Jacky is doing everything she can to roll back the changes at USPS that could delay the delivery of everything from life-saving medications to mail ballots for the November election.
She's also working to fully fund the U.S. Postal Service so it can't be used as a political football. Too many people are depending on the post office to let these partisan politicians undermine it.
But Jacky needs us standing with her so she can keep up this critical fight -- and win.
Can you donate $5 now to help Jacky meet her August goal before the deadline?

Right now, the Senate should be taking action to end the inhumane policies at our border. We should be securing our future by addressing the threat of climate change. We should be raising the minimum wage so workers in Nevada and across the country can provide for their families and make ends meet.
But none of this can happen as long as Mitch McConnell leads the Senate.
If we want Mitch McConnell to stop blocking our progress, we’ve got to take back the Senate. I’m fighting as hard as I can to make it happen, but I need your support. Will you chip in $5 now?
Team, it seems that not even commonsense, bipartisan legislation can pass in Mitch McConnell’s Senate. Election security is a prime example—we know Russia is attempting to interfere in our presidential elections again in 2020. The Senate has a duty to pass legislation to stop this, but we’re not acting. And who’s standing in the way? Leader McConnell.
In order to fight back and win, we’ve got to make ourselves heard at the ballot box. We must ensure that if Mitch McConnell is in the Senate at all after 2020, he is no longer Majority Leader.
This is a fight I won’t back down from, but I can’t do it on my own. That’s why I need supporters like you to stand with me and help me reach my fundraising goal.
I’m doing everything I can to ensure Democrats take back the Senate from Mitch McConnell and the GOP in 2020—do I have your support? Contribute $5 now.

Senator Rosen said I could reach out, team.
I am humbly asking you to make a contribution to support my campaign against Senator Collins in Maine.
Because here is the truth:
Our race is very likely to determine control of the U.S. Senate.
And everything from our health care to voting rights to reproductive freedom could hinge on who controls the Senate.
And we know that if Susan Collins is reelected, Mitch McConnell will stay in control of the Senate.
That's why he is spending outrageous amounts of money to save this seat for Senator Collins and stay in power in Washington.
So I have to ask:
Can I count on you to split a $5 contribution between my campaign and Jacky Rosen today, before it’s too late to make a difference?
We are funding this campaign the right way, with lots and lots of people chipping in small amounts because they know how important it is that we flip this Senate seat and replace Mitch McConnell as Majority Leader.
I am so proud of that fact. But it does mean we are extraordinarily dependent on grassroots contributions from supporters like you.
That’s why this request is so important -- especially right now, with hundreds of thousands of Mainers already casting ballots early.
So please, split a $5 contribution between my campaign and Jacky Rosen if you can afford it.
It means so much to me to know you have my back in this final stretch before Election Day. Thank you for your support.
All my best,

Team,
Last week -- thanks to folks like you -- I became the official Democratic nominee for Colorado’s U.S. Senate seat. I’m so proud of this team and the movement we’re building together. But, we cannot rest quite yet.
Senator Rosen said I should reach out today to ask you to own a piece of our campaign by making a contribution. But first, I need a moment to explain why your donation is so important.
July is critical for our campaign. We’ve officially kicked off the general election, which means it’s time to lay the groundwork to flip this Senate seat blue in November. Remember: Democrats cannot end Mitch McConnell’s Senate majority without winning this seat.
Since the primary, Republicans have already launched a $9 million negative attack campaign against me. And we expect more to come. If we can’t double down in these critical first days of July, I’m worried we’ll get drowned out in the final stretch of this election.
I know what this incredible grassroots team is capable of. If we can just raise the financial resources we need to stick to our plan, we can fight back against the GOP’s attacks and win this race.
So, I am personally asking you to become a Founding Donor by pitching in any amount to my campaign and Jacky Rosen. Every donation will immediately help us launch a paid media campaign to respond to these misleading, nasty attacks from Republican groups.
This election will be tough. Mitch McConnell won’t let us flip a Senate seat without a fight. But we’re ready to get the job done.
Let’s get to work!

\---Original Message from Jacky Rosen---
Team,
In the Senate, I am helping to lead the fight to demand answers from Postmaster General Louis DeJoy about the dangerous changes he's made that are slowing down postal service delivery.
We are only two months away from Election Day -- and with more voters than ever planning to receive and send their ballots by mail this year, these delays are harmful and unacceptable.
I’m fighting as hard as I can to protect the U.S. Postal Service from the GOP’s partisan attacks, but I need you with me. Add your name to my petition now.
We need answers on critical issues at USPS like delivery delays, overtime policies, and the removal of mail sorting machines and collection boxes around the country. I am pushing for President Trump's Postmaster General to not only explain these changes -- but reverse them.
Our country's future is at stake in this election -- and we simply can't let it be influenced by these politically-motivated attacks on USPS. We all need to keep speaking out and fighting back.
Sign on now: tell DeJoy and Trump to reverse their reckless attacks on USPS right away.

This November, Democrats have a real shot at taking back the Senate from the GOP.
But in order to make that happen, we need to come together and support the candidates who are running to flip the crucial seats we need to win in the fight to elect a Democratic majority.
Are you ready to take back the Senate? Split a $5 donation to Amy McGrath, John Hickenlooper, and my campaign before the end-of-month deadline.
Amy McGrath is taking the fight to Mitch McConnell himself in the Kentucky Senate race because people in her state and across the country need real leaders who put them first.
And in Colorado, John Hickenlooper is currently ahead in the polls against the unpopular GOP incumbent -- this is a prime opportunity for turning a red seat blue in the November election.
Pitch in $5 right now to stand with Amy, John, and me in the fight for the Senate.
Thank you,
Jacky

Team,
Jacky wanted us to reach out right away with some exciting news:
We just got word of a new poll in South Carolina showing Democrat Jaime Harrison is TIED with Republican Lindsey Graham. This race is a toss-up -- and Jaime can flip this seat in November.
Donate $5 right now to support Jaime Harrison in the fight to win South Carolina.
First, a poll showed Jaime just one point down. Now, a new Quinnipiac poll shows him dead even. And if that weren’t enough momentum, President Obama just endorsed his campaign.
This race is neck-and-neck -- and with our help, Jaime Harrison can defeat GOP Senator Lindsey Graham and help us win a Democratic majority in the Senate.
Will you pitch in $5 or any amount now to elect Jaime Harrison and flip the Senate?
Thank you,
Jacky

There are so many exciting Senate races this November -- from defending our Democratic champions in Alabama and New Hampshire to turning red seats blue across the country.
I am supporting all of our Democratic Senate candidates, but I need your help to decide where we should focus our efforts in these final few months. I want to hear directly from you:
Which Democratic Senate campaign are you most excited about? Take my survey now.
John Hickenlooper in Colorado. MJ Hegar in Texas. Barbara Bollier in Kansas. These are just a few of the candidates with a real chance to flip a red seat blue and help us win back the Senate.
New polls show that Senate Democrats are in a strong position as we head into the November elections. But with so much on the line, we need to double down in our support of our strong Democratic candidates across the country. So tell me, which campaigns are on your radar?
Take the survey now to tell me which candidates we should support.
Thank you,
Jacky

On Thursday, the Supreme Court took a major step by upholding the DACA program and validating that for hundreds of thousands of Dreamers, home is here in the United States.
President Trump’s attempts to end this program were cruel and unnecessary -- and I am glad that the Supreme Court stopped him in his tracks. But we know that he only views this decision as a setback. We can’t stop fighting until we pass permanent protections for Dreamers.
That’s why I am calling on the Senate to finally pass the American Dream and Promise Act to permanently protect Dreamers. Will you add your name to my petition now?
Dreamers were brought to this country as children, and this is where they grew up, raised families, started businesses, and built their lives. They deserve dignity and respect -- and the Senate must take action to protect them from deportation and offer them a path to citizenship.
The House has already passed the American Dream and Promise Act to do just that -- but we need to keep the pressure on Mitch McConnell to bring this bill to the Senate floor for a vote.
Tell Senate Republicans it’s time to permanently protect Dreamers. Add your name right now.
Thank you,
Jacky

Team,
Senator Rosen said I could reach out today about my Senate race in New Mexico.
I’m running for Senate because working families deserve a leader who actually cares about their futures -- but Trump and the RNC have had a big red target on this open seat as a potential pickup for Republicans in November, and they're campaigning aggressively to make sure I lose.
Let me be clear: If Republicans win this race, our chances of flipping the Senate could be off the table. Flipping the Senate and ending Mitch McConnell's iron grip on our democracy is possible, but even if Democrats can pull off this upset, it’ll likely be by razor-thin margins.
That’s why I’m asking for your help today. Our party cannot afford to let this Senate seat fall prey to Republicans and their massive fundraising machine -- and a strong Democratic Party is one of the only things standing in the way of that devastating outcome. I’m counting on folks like you to chip in what you can and help me keep this seat blue, because without your help, Mitch McConnell will likely serve another term as Majority Leader.
So if you can, will you split a $5 donation between my campaign and Jacky Rosen today? It’s the best way to ensure that this Senate seat in New Mexico and so many others nationwide remain in play for Democrats.
As president, Joe Biden will move our country forward, but he will need a Senate who will work with him -- not stall and attack his agenda at every turn. For the past several years, Republicans have worked to do little more than win majorities, stymie progress, and give handouts to their wealthy and well-connected friends. That’s all about to change.
With your help, candidates from the school board to the Senate to the White House will be able to compete with Republicans, despite their fundraising machine. We’ve worked for years to build a Democratic Party capable of winning at every level, and all that’s left to do now is execute on the strategies that will help us win.
But we need your help to get there. So I’ll ask once more: If you’re able, will you chip in $5 to my campaign and Jacky Rosen today? Momentum is on our side, and I’m counting on folks like you to help us capitalize on it.
Thanks for your support,

Senator Rosen said I could reach out with a quick ask for your support in my race in Arizona.
If you are able, will you split a $5 donation between my people-powered campaign and Jacky Rosen to help win big in Arizona -- and take back the Senate from the GOP?
Last week, we learned that a Mitch McConnell-aligned outside group will be spending $10.6 million on ads in Arizona. The NRA also announced that they are dropping big money, too.
But here's the thing: it doesn't matter what they throw at us, because supporters like you have always had my back -- and you're the reason we are going to flip Arizona's Senate seat.
If we're going to fight back and beat the GOP in November, we need to make this our biggest month yet, which is why we set a goal of receiving 200,000 new contributions.
This is a monumental task, but I believe it's one that we can achieve if we do it together. We need all hands on deck to meet this ambitious September goal -- can I count on your support?
It's going to take a lot of people like you stepping up and pitching in whatever they can afford to help us defeat the GOP, win this race, and flip the Senate. Will you split a $5 contribution between my campaign and Jacky Rosen right now?
Thank you,
Mark Kelly

In 2018, Democrat Stacey Abrams nearly became the Governor of Georgia.
And in 2020, with hundreds of thousands of newly-registered voters on the rolls, we have the opportunity to elect two Democratic Senators: Jon Ossoff and Rev. Raphael Warnock.
Contribute $5 now to help turn Georgia blue and flip the Senate.
With two Senate seats up in Georgia, we need all hands on deck to win these races:
Three new polls show Jon Ossoff is either ahead or within the margin of error. His candidacy represents a fresh voice in D.C. -- he’d be the youngest Senator in the next Congress. But we need to do our part and ensure that his campaign has the resources it will take to win this race.
And the second Georgia Senate election is also a “statistical dead heat” according to the Hill, but with Republican Kelly Loeffler pledging to spend $20 million of her own money to buy this seat, it’s more urgent than ever that we support Rev. Raphael Warnock’s campaign. Rev. Warnock preaches from the same pulpit where Martin Luther King, Jr., once stood -- and if elected, he’d be the first ever African American Senator to represent the state of Georgia.
In November, we can elect Jon Ossoff and Rev. Raphael Warnock, turn Georgia blue, and win a Democratic majority in the Senate. Contribute $5 now to help make it happen.

AP: In open defiance of state regulations and his own administration’s pandemic health guidelines, President Donald Trump hosted his first indoor rally since June, telling a packed, nearly mask-less Nevada crowd that the nation was “making the last turn” in defeating the virus.
Team,
This past weekend, President Trump flouted Nevada’s authorities and public health guidelines and hosted an indoor campaign rally without social distancing or mask-wearing requirements.
We need to send President Trump a message that his reckless campaign rallies aren’t going to help him win Nevada. Will you pitch in $5 to help us keep Nevada blue?
We beat President Trump here in 2016 -- but he only lost Nevada by two points. This year, the Republicans are pulling out all the stops to defeat Democrats in this crucial battleground state.
Jacky Rosen is leading the fight to keep Nevada blue, flip the Senate, and defeat President Trump -- and there is too much on the line for us to come up short in these fights. That’s why meeting the $20,000 mid-month fundraising goal is non-negotiable. We have to get this done.
Will you join Jacky Rosen in the fight to keep Nevada blue in 2020 and beyond? Make a $5 contribution now to help us meet our mid-September goal.

TAKE OUR CLIMATE CHANGE PRIORITIES SURVEY
Last month, Trump delivered on his threat to pull the U.S. out of the Paris Climate Accord, moving our country backward. But this reckless decision will not stop Nevadans from taking charge and leading the way on combating climate change.

* Democrats now have a 6% advantage among registered voters in Nevada over the GOP.
* During the primary election, Democrats led in overall turnout by more than 16,000 votes.
* 66,000+ more Democrats participated in the election compared to the 2018 election — and over 110,000 more Democrats compared to 2016.

"Donald Trump is holding a rally in my district this weekend.
He announced, canceled, and un-canceled the rally trying to find a venue that will accommodate a dangerous crowd in the middle of a pandemic – and now he's settled on holding the event in my hometown.
Trump will try to rally for my opponent: Nevada’s last Republican in the House, Rep. Mark Amodei. Trump calls Amodei a “warrior” for his agenda.
We won’t let Trump come to Nevada without a fight.
To defeat Trump and Amodei, we need to be ready to counter Trump’s lies and attacks at today’s rally. Rush a $10 donation to my campaign and NV Dems so we can fight back.

Wherever Donald Trump goes, he spews misinformation and hate. And Rep. Mark Amodei is right there with him, voting with Trump 97% of the time.
Trump and Amodei have failed to extend COVID-19 relief families in need. Instead, Trump wants to spread COVID-19 through my community by hosting a rally.
We won’t cower in fear. We will DEFEAT them. Voting starts in just a few weeks, and we need your help NOW:

Poll Alert: New numbers in the presidential race here in Nevada show our battleground state is still in play for Trump
The latest poll in Nevada is bad news. Biden and Trump are locked in a “close race” and the GOP could easily flip Nevada red this November.
We knew we’d be in for a fight this year because of the record-breaking war chest Trump and the GOP have available to pour into our state – this new poll is proof that we need to double down on our organizing efforts this year.
This is going to be a tight race, and there’s no room for error. We’re up against a massive fundraising juggernaut, and we need your support if we’re going to be able to take on Trump.

"Friend,
We know the GOP is determined to flip Nevada red in the upcoming elections.
We’ve already seen the lengths national Republicans will go to suppress turnout: by opposing the expansion of vote-by-mail and forcing people to choose between their own safety and voting.
That’s why I’m proud to stand alongside my fellow Nevada Democrats in the fight to uphold our democracy and protect voters.
We are facing our first end-of-month deadline since the Nevada GOP announced record-breaking fundraising numbers in the first quarter.

Last month, NV Dems joined the Democratic National Committee, Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and Priorities USA in filing a suit to expand voting access in Nevada.
We're committed to making voting safe and accessible to every voter in our state — but unsurprisingly, Trump views any effort to elevate the voice of the voter as a direct threat to his chances of winning in November.
That's why he's attacking Nevada directly, threatening to withhold federal funding during a global health crisis as punishment.

He has downplayed this virus and failed to lead to combat this pandemic since day one.
Since his last visit to Nevada, Trump and at least 22 of his top advisors and inner circle have tested positive for COVID-19 after he held a superspreader event at the White House.
Instead of pulling a campaign stunt by holding another MAGA rally in our state, Trump should focus on getting relief to Nevada families who are suffering because of his failure to lead.

"It’s clear: Trump will stop at nothing to subvert the will of the voters come Election Day – including undermining the U.S. Postal Service, the agency that would allow MILLIONS of Americans to safely cast their vote by mail this November.
If Trump allows USPS to run out of funds, ALL three of these things could happen:
* 600,000 hard working Americans out of a job – when unemployment is at its highest.
* The delivery of critical supplies like medication would be impacted (during a global pandemic no less).
* And voters would be robbed of their right to mail in their ballot during the most consequential election of our lifetime.
Please, add your name to demand that Congress save the USPS and protect our ability to vote by mail.
Allowing USPS to go insolvent would harm Americans everywhere – including right here in our state. Nevadans should be afforded every opportunity to fulfill their civic duty and safely cast their ballot.

Despite historic gains for women in recent decades, the fight for gender equity in pay, housing, health care, and more continues.

"Hi there,
First, I want to thank you for helping us hit our April fundraising goal. With Trump and his GOP allies more determined than ever to suppress voters and spend big to win battleground states like ours, I’m so grateful we can rely on supporters like you to stand with NV Dems when we need you most.
Last month, NV Dems joined the Democratic National Committee, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Priorities USA, and Nevadans across the state in filing a lawsuit to expand voting access for Nevada’s June 9 primary – and with your help, we were successful!
As the Coronavirus outbreak continues to impact our daily lives, though, we need to keep fighting to make sure voters across our state don't lose access to the ballot box ahead of the November election.
It’s critical that we make sure what happened in Wisconsin does not happen in Nevada.
That’s why we’re fighting to:
* Guarantee every registered voter receives a mail-in ballot — not just those deemed “active”
* Increase the number of polling stations available for safe, hygienic in-person voting to prevent the long lines and crowds we witnessed in Wisconsin
* Suspend enforcement of Nevada’s voter assistance ban and ballot rejection rules to allow for voter assistance
NV Dems is committed to prioritizing the safety and security of our upcoming elections while ensuring every voice is heard.

"FIRST it was reported that Russia paid bounties to the Taliban to kill American troops.
THEN Trump feigned ignorance about this massive scandal.
NOW it’s clear that Trump received intel about this threat and did NOTHING.
AND TO DATE Trump has not held Russia accountable for killing US soldiers.
Do you agree that Trump’s unwillingness to take this threat seriously and hold Russia accountable makes him unfit to lead? YES NO

It's hard to imagine a more unconscionable act for a Commander in Chief than to blatantly ignore intelligence that could save the lives of American soldiers.
Hard to imagine for people like [[URL REDACTED]] entirely believable when the so-called Commander in Chief is Donald Trump.
Trump either brushed aside or flat out ignored information about a foreign country paying bounties to the Taliban to kill US troops. This begs the question: is Trump a hazard to our safety?
YES NO

NOW: Trump and RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel are accusing Democrats in our state of trying to “steal” the election and compromise election integrity…by expanding access to the ballot box.
THAT MEANS: Trump and his allies know Nevada is the key battleground for control of the White House and they’ll do ANYTHING to keep Democrats from voting in our state.

Trump’s continued attacks against NV Dems and other groups trying to expand access to the ballot box just prove how scared he is.
Meanwhile, McDaniel and failed GOP gubernatorial candidate Adam Laxalt launched their own assaults on our voting rights, aligning themselves with Trump’s voter suppression efforts.
The GOP’s plan of action is clear: distract voters from Trump’s catastrophic pandemic response and plummeting poll numbers by spreading lies about our election integrity.

"Team, did you see our email about Trump’s EPA? In the midst of COVID-19, a virus that often affects the respiratory system, this administration is giving major polluters a pass and refusing to enforce regulations.
SIGN ON and demand that Trump STOP using the outbreak as an excuse to give polluters free rein over our environment!

Vox: Experts say Trump is exploiting the coronavirus crisis to roll back enforcement of important environmental regulations
This is appalling.
The Trump Administration is using an international public health crisis to give polluters a pass and halt the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) enforcement of environmental regulations.
As we celebrate Earth Day, we’re calling on 10,000 climate activists to DEMAND that Trump’s EPA stop using the Coronavirus outbreak as an excuse to give major polluters a pass. Click here to add your name:
SIGN ON
Nevadans know firsthand that our air and water quality has a direct impact on our health.
For the Trump Administration to turn a blind eye to major polluters in the midst of a pandemic that overwhelmingly affects a person’s respiratory system is, at best, irresponsible.
Tell the Trump Administration: our health and safety — including the health and safety of our environment — is more important than polluters' bottom lines.

Donald Trump and the GOP have been ramping up their voter suppression tactics because they know they cannot win this election fair and square.
Turning out a historic number of Democrats is kind of our specialty here at NV Dems.
We did it earlier this year, smashing 2016 turnout numbers and delivering the most successful First in the West Caucus to date.
With your help, NV Dems mobilized 75% of all caucus-goers to take advantage of early voting locations across the state.
We can match and exceed these turnout levels again. But time is of the essence, and we need your grassroots push.

Trump and the GOP know Nevada is a battleground state — and they’ll say and do anything to win. We simply can’t allow their dishonest and deceitful tactics to sway the election.

He refused to answer.
This comes on the heels of Trump refusing to condemn White Supremacy at the debate last week.
Two simple questions. Two outright refusals to do what’s right.

Mike Pence has been a rubber stamp for Trump’s reckless policies since day one.
He even took a page out of Trump’s playbook and was in Nevada TODAY to hold a MAGA bus tour stop –– spreading more hate and lies, and creating a COVID breeding ground.
As head of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, Pence has played a central role in enabling this administration to ignore science and medicine and put the American people at risk.
And now he’s bringing that harm right here to Nevada.
Less than four weeks to go to ensure the Trump/Pence Administration is a one-term ticket.

Here's why this goal is too important to miss:
* This is the biggest FEC deadline of the election — the last one before most voters cast their ballots.
* We will be reporting these fundraising numbers out to the public — where the media, political analysts, and the GOP will be looking to see where Democrats' grassroots strength stands.
* Trump is already watching us closely, and with the recent ratings shift toward Republicans from The Cook Political Report, we can't miss a beat.
We know we have what it takes to out-organize and out-mobilize the GOP, but missing this goal would be a blow to our efforts.

Donald Trump can’t stop lying — and he can’t stop coming to Nevada to do it.

Last month, NV Dems joined the Democratic National Committee, Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and Priorities USA in filing a suit to expand voting access in Nevada.
We're committed to making voting safe and accessible to every voter in our state — but unsurprisingly, Trump views any effort to elevate the voice of the voter as a direct threat to his chances of winning in November.
That's why he's attacking Nevada directly, threatening to withhold federal funding during a global health crisis as punishment.

Last week, Donald Trump announced intentions to urge the Supreme Court to strike down the Affordable Care Act (ACA).
This is not the first effort by the Trump Administration to dismantle the ACA — but it comes at a time when Americans are facing the worst global pandemic in generations.
We are joining Democrats across the country and calling on Trump to immediately reverse his decision and to ensure everyone has affordable access to health care as we battle a global pandemic — click here to add your name today →

Overturning the ACA could leave millions of Americans without health coverage.

Our efforts and your support are working.
But here’s the thing: the closer we get, the more the GOP is going to fight back. And it’s already started.
Donald Trump just dumped a ton of money into our state, buying up air time to run his re-election ads. He knows our message is resonating with voters so he’s doing everything in his power to drown us out.

Donald Trump filling Nevada airwaves with his campaign ads tells us one thing: he knows he’s losing ground in our battleground state.
But 2016 taught us we cannot be complacent.

Trump makes all the wrong calls: rolling back environmental protections, attacking voting rights and suing to block vote-by-mail, renewing his efforts to dismantle the Affordable Care Act — during a public health crisis, stacking the court with his conservative cronies; and inciting violence instead of supporting peaceful protestors.

Our battleground state will be pivotal this November. After the Democratic Convention last week, it’s clear: Republicans up and down the ballot are not capable of achieving the positive change our country desperately needs.
That’s why I’m running to flip the last red Nevada Congressional district BLUE. Amid a global pandemic, a struggling economy, and a President who relishes in the chaos – we simply can’t afford to lose.

I am so proud that our party has found its footing – from fighting for access to health care, to protecting reproductive rights, to safeguarding the environment – we are pursuing progress and hope at every opportunity.
The GOP convention, on the other hand, painted a darker and more sinister picture for our future. The country needs leaders who will champion progress – not incite fear and anger.

When I spoke at the Democratic Convention four years ago, I said, “When Trump decided to run for president, he probably said to himself: ‘I’m an egomaniac. I don’t believe in science. I think women are inferior. Where would I feel at home?’ ”
Since that day, Trump has proved me right time and again. He has tried to reshape America in his own image – and he has made it clear he will stop at nothing to hold on to power.
The upcoming election is the most important in our lifetime and we must come together to elect Joe Biden and usher in big wins for Democrats up and down the ballot. Click here to join me in supporting NV Dems to make 2020 a change election.

From his failure to respond to COVID-19 to his attacks on healthcare and women’s rights to his systematic dismantling of voting rights – Donald Trump has proven he is unfit to lead this nation for another four years.

The Presidential and Vice Presidential debates reminded me what bold ideas and strong leadership look like (and what they don’t look like). I am so proud of where Democrats stand on critical issues like health care, reproductive rights, and climate change — we are pursuing progress and hope at every opportunity.
Donald Trump and Mike Pence, on the other hand, painted a darker and more sinister picture for our future. The country needs leaders who will champion progress — not incite fear and anger. Can I count on you to support my campaign and join me in the fight for progress?

Taking action has never been more important than it is right now.
Republicans expect us to just sit back as they rip away health care for millions of Americans (including more than 300,000 Nevadans), curtail reproductive rights, and push through an ultra conservative Supreme Court Justice weeks before Election Day.
But we won’t be complacent –– and we know you won’t, either.

On Monday, Senator Catherine Cortez Masto made it clear at the Democratic National Convention: our party — and our state — are ready, willing, and able to take on Trump and the GOP in November.
It's true — all roads to victory move through our battleground state. This isn't insider gossip — it’s conventional wisdom: Nevada is an essential part of the electoral map.
That’s why the Team Trump bus tour made a pit stop in our state, and why Trump attacked Governor Sisolak for securing universal mail-in-voting.
They’re desparately trying to make a play for Nevada.

"Team,
Did you see Emily’s message? She’s rightly concerned about Trump’s blatant indifference towards funding the U.S. Postal Service – even though the agency has been providing critical deliveries throughout the pandemic and would ensure people are able to cast their ballot.
We can’t let Trump win and allow USPS to go insolvent – not with Americans’ health, civil rights, and jobs on the line:
Add your name to demand Congress act to save USPS immediately →
ADD MY NAME
Thank you,
NV Dems
* * *
It’s clear: Trump will stop at nothing to subvert the will of the voters come Election Day – including undermining the U.S. Postal Service, the agency that would allow MILLIONS of Americans to safely cast their vote by mail this November.
If Trump allows USPS to run out of funds, ALL three of these things could happen:
* 600,000 hard working Americans out of a job – when unemployment is at its highest.
* The delivery of critical supplies like medication would be impacted (during a global pandemic no less).
* And voters would be robbed of their right to mail in their ballot during the most consequential election of our lifetime.
Please, add your name to demand that Congress save the USPS and protect our ability to vote by mail.
Allowing USPS to go insolvent would harm Americans everywhere – including right here in our state. Nevadans should be afforded every opportunity to fulfill their civic duty and safely cast their ballot.
SAVE USPS
Trump is scared of losing – especially here in battleground Nevada. If he limits our constitutionally protected right to cast our ballot safely by sabotaging the USPS, there’s no telling what else he’ll do to steal this election.
Don’t let that happen. Add your name NOW.

Quick update:
Tonight is the final night of the Trump Show (aka the GOP convention), and Trump is about to take the stage, giving an explicitly political speech directly from the White House.
Night after night this week, we’ve watched Trump and his allies spread lies about Democrats. Instead of discussing their vision for the country, they’ve taken aim at leaders and activists who are challenging Trump on the most important issues currently facing our country.

Our digital team is working overtime as NV Dems shifts our entire operation online to avoid person-to-person contact.
That means instead of knocking on doors and having in-person one-on-one conversations with voters about the importance of electing Democrats up and down the ballot this year, we’re focusing on remote phone banks and digital outreach.
It’s truly never been more important that we elect Democrats up and down the ballot to make sure Nevada’s hardworking families continue to have the leadership we need during these uncertain times.

Now, with Nevada Republicans breaking all-time online fundraising records, we know they’re intent on flipping our state red and will spend big to do it.

"Friends,
Donald Trump has proven time and again that he is not fit to lead this country.
From his disastrous handling of the coronavirus pandemic, to leaving behind working families in our economy, to his complete disregard for the health and safety of the American people.
But recent polling shows Donald Trump and Joe Biden neck and neck in Nevada — and the GOP is pouring money into our battleground state.

Donald Trump knows the road to the White House runs right through Nevada.
That’s why he’s pouring time and resources into our state, attacking our expansion of voting rights on national television, and has made repeated stops for his MAGA rallies here in Nevada.
But we won’t back down.
We have less than two weeks to get out the vote and ensure Donald Trump is a one term president — and with polling showing him virtually tied with Biden, we cannot take anything for granted.
Early vote is already underway and Nevadans are turning out to make their voices heard in the most crucial election in generations.

Hosting an in-person event with thousands of people, during a global health crisis, is beyond irresponsible. It is negligence on the part of a leader who has known for MONTHS just how dangerous this disease is.

Trump knows how critically important it is to win our state — which is why he takes any and every opportunity to visit (including throwing crowded indoor rallies in the middle of a global health crisis).
There's no doubt about it: Trump will be watching our fundraising numbers to see if he has a chance of turning our state RED. That's why NV Dems needs your help to prove Democrats are fired up to send him packing:

Hey Emma,
I know it’s early, but I just ran the numbers and we’re still behind on our FEC goal by $9,964. Since this is the last public filing most voters will see before casting their ballots, it’s urgent we close the gap. Can you reach out to a few of our top supporters and see if they can chip in?

"Democrats across Nevada are ready to turn the page on this administration and elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in 2020.
But Donald Trump and his army of loyalists won’t make it easy. They’ve resorted to name-calling, misinformation, and underhanded tactics in the past — and that was before they had to contend with a unified, historic Democratic ticket.

Trump Republicans are gearing up, team. They’re hoping Nevada Democrats won’t wake up to their plans until it’s too late.
But their own team spilled the beans – they’ve made it clear that their goal is to wipe the board clean in 2020 and undo all the progress we made in 2018:
“The Dems, they don’t anticipate Nevada going red. But if we can get Nevada to go red, that is going to be a huge boost for President Trump when it comes toward the Electoral College. It’s six extra points in the Electoral College that they were not expecting us to get.”

One thing is clear: Donald Trump’s re-election campaign just isn’t going well, even in battleground states.
The repeated failures of his administration, the hateful rhetoric of his presidency, and the dangerous decisions he’s made since entering office are all finally catching up with him.
But Trump’s getting desperate and he’s going to use the only tool he has left: massive spending.
National Republicans are still raking in cash across the board and now we’re seeing how they intend on spending that money → in battlegrounds like Nevada.
Showing up for our movement has never been so important. This is the most consequential election of our lifetime and Trump is doing everything in his power to drown out our message. We have to fight back.
I know you’ve heard it before, but it’s true: the country can’t afford another four years of Trump’s administration.
Thank you for doing your part to stop that from happening.

You can help our organizers and volunteers through this final push by contributing $10 or more before midnight to support their work in the final weeks before the caucus.
We’re still looking for 13 more supporters from 89002 to chip in with a MATCHED contribution before midnight. Click here to become one of them → If you saved your information, clicking any button below will cause your donation to process instantly:

Over the last year, we recruited more than 2,000 volunteers, held more than 1,800 caucus trainings, and contacted more than 23,000 Nevada Democrats.
But all of our efforts will be for nothing if our organizing team can’t kick things up a notch to reach out to Democrats in the final stretch.
That’s why it’s critical that you contribute now. Click here to rush a $10 contribution before the weekend and your donation will be 100% MATCHED to support our organizers and volunteers!

The team here at NV Dems is fighting tooth and nail to expand access to the ballot box and to break Democratic turnout records across the state. We’re pushing back against Trump and the GOP’s voter suppression operations in battleground states like ours — and we’re winning.
But the National Republican Committee Chair herself said Nevada is absolutely “in play” for Trump — and the GOP is putting its money where its mouth is by investing big in advertising and flooding states like Nevada with staffers.
I know our Democratic grassroots strength can overpower their big spending, but the GOP will jump on any sign of weakness on our upcoming FEC report.
Don’t let that happen — rush a donation of $10 or more immediately!

"It's no secret — the country has been in a state of disarray ever since Trump took office. His conservative nominations for the Supreme Court have led to some problematic rulings that have the potential to set our progress back decades — here in Nevada and across the country.
Your opinion matters — especially now. Let us know what issues are top of mind during this critical moment:
SIGN ON
* * *
In recent months, the Supreme Court has made major decisions relating to immigration, criminal justice, health care, and reproductive justice.
And while some of these decisions delivered important wins for Democrats, others could set us back DECADES. That’s why we wanted to check in with you — given the consequential election coming up and the fate of the court hanging in the balance, what issues are top of mind for you? Let us know here →
SIGN ON
Trump makes all the wrong calls: rolling back environmental protections, attacking voting rights and suing to block vote-by-mail, renewing his efforts to dismantle the Affordable Care Act — during a public health crisis, stacking the court with his conservative cronies; and inciting violence instead of supporting peaceful protestors.
The list goes on and on and on.
But we can put a stop to it. Will you take our survey and let us know what issues are on your mind? We need to be on the same page to combat Trump’s misguided ways effectively.
Thank you for making your voice heard. It matters.

"Friends,
The 2020 election will be the most consequential election of our lifetimes. The future of our country and our democracy are at stake.
Donald Trump and the GOP have systematically attacked voting rights, yanked us backward in the fight to end the climate crisis, and completely failed to protect people’s lives and livelihoods during the COVID-19 pandemic.
We need to fight back – and fast.
That’s why I am personally reaching out to you today to ask if you can support Democrats in four key battleground states – Nevada, Pennsylvania, Arizona, and Florida.

Here’s why this is so important:
National Republicans have been preparing for this election for years – filling their deep pockets with special interest and dark money, and breaking fundraising records across the board.
Now they’re ready to spend big – and they have their sights set on these four critical states.
They know Democrats in Nevada, Pennsylvania, Arizona, and Florida stand between them and another four years of Donald Trump.
Let’s prove them right.
If you can, make a donation today and help make sure these state parties have the resources to deliver big wins up and down the ballot on Election Day – and finally get this country working for working people.
I know these are difficult times for our nation, but we will get through them as we always do: by coming together, as Americans, to fight for a better future.
Thanks for being a part of this,

"Team, it’s clear: Trump has Nevada on the brain. Not only did he recently attack our Governor for securing mail-in-voting, but his bus tour visited Nevada for a campaign stop.
He’s obsessed with holding onto power and that means winning battleground states like ours.
And that’s not all. He also staged in-person campaign events in battleground state Wisconsin, failing once again like he did by holding a huge MAGA rally in Tulsa — leading to a spike in new COVID-19 cases.
He doesn’t care who loses as long as he wins.

For many of us, the 2020 elections will be the most important in our lifetimes. The outcome will have a lasting impact for generations to come.

For months now, Republicans have gone on Fox News and feigned outrage over Democrats' serious response to the COVID-19 pandemic – which has taken hundreds of thousands of American lives already.
And for months now, they’ve been supported and encouraged by their reckless leader in the White House, who proudly ignored health guidelines for months and ultimately tested positive for COVID-19, along with dozens of administration officials and other GOP leaders.
Trump’s actions are dangerous, irresponsible, and a stain on the fabric of this country. Can you help us mobilize Democrats with just DAYS left in the election?

"Folks,
When I spoke at the Democratic Convention four years ago, I said, “When Trump decided to run for president, he probably said to himself: ‘I’m an egomaniac. I don’t believe in science. I think women are inferior. Where would I feel at home?’ ”
Since that day, Trump has proved me right time and again. He has tried to reshape America in his own image – and he has made it clear he will stop at nothing to hold on to power.
The upcoming election is the most important in our lifetime and we must come together to elect Joe Biden and usher in big wins for Democrats up and down the ballot. Click here to join me in supporting NV Dems to make 2020 a change election.

From his failure to respond to COVID-19 to his attacks on healthcare and women’s rights to his systematic dismantling of voting rights – Donald Trump has proven he is unfit to lead this nation for another four years.
As the former Senate Majority Leader, I know firsthand the crucial role Nevada plays in the presidential election – and I am not alone. Even the Nevada GOP has admitted when campaigning in Nevada, Donald Trump is “playing on Biden’s field.”

That’s why I am so appreciative of the work Governor Steve Sisolak, Nevada Assembly Speaker Jason Frierson and Nevada Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro have done to ensure voters can make their voices heard safely and securely in November’s general election.

As much as we wish it were true, Joe and Kamala don’t have this thing in the bag yet. We have to remain vigilant and remember that anything can happen in these final days.
No one knows what these next couple of weeks might bring – but one thing is certain: Trump won’t go down without a fight.
That’s why we’re counting on you to chip in $15.
Trump has even threatened to release an “army” of poll watchers on Election Day – which is ironic since he’s the one who’s used every opportunity at his disposal to compromise the election and disenfranchise voters.
His distraction tactics and tricks worked last weekend – but we can’t allow them to work again. Not in our battleground state.

As Joe likes to say, we are in the battle for the soul of this nation, and I couldn’t agree more.
This is our chance to take our country back and not only return to normal, but build back better. There is no limit to what Democrats can accomplish — but only if we win up and down the ticket in 2020.
And that’s why I’m writing to you. I’ve been working on campaigns for the last 20 years. So believe me, I know that campaigns are won — or lost — by hitting these fundraising goals.
So if Joe and the NV Dems are going to be successful in November, it's imperative they hit their fundraising goals at the end of the month.
It's going to take committed Democrats to do it. So they need your help.

After Nevada’s female-majority State Legislature passed legislation ending antiquated laws and protecting the right to choose, our hard work in 2018 fighting to elect Democrats up and down the ballot paid off big time.
Then, when the Supreme Court struck down Louisiana’s anti-choice legislation and upheld Roe v. Wade, we saw another national victory for families everywhere.
But now, Mississippi passed ANOTHER restrictive reproductive health care bill that could put Roe back in jeopardy if it comes to Trump’s conservative Supreme Court.
Congress can end this constant cycle that puts millions of patients at risk. We need 15,000 pro-choice activists to DEMAND national legislation to protect the right to choose — CLICK HERE to add your name →
ADD YOUR NAME
While Republican-controlled states across the country try to roll back reproductive rights in every way imaginable, Nevada bucked the national trend and repealed restrictive reproductive health requirements that limited the right to choose.
Our state is leading the charge in the fight for reproductive rights in America — but if Brett Kavanaugh and his conservative colleagues on the Supreme Court see the right opportunity to overturn Roe v. Wade, they might take it.

The results of our primary election this month speak for themselves.
* Democrats now have a 6% advantage among registered voters in Nevada over the GOP.
* Statewide, Democrats led in overall turnout by more than 16,000 votes.
* 66,000+ more Democrats participated in the 2020 primary election compared to the 2018 election — and over 110,000 more Democrats compared to 2016.
Bottom line? NV Dems are in the strongest position we've ever been heading into a general election — but all that work will be for nothing if GOP mega-donors and dark money groups find weaknesses in our grassroots network.

Trump lied when he downplayed the risk of the virus in February – and he’s lying now. His only goal is to win by any means necessary, even when it means putting American lives at risk.
Just weeks ago, Trump was here in Nevada for an INDOOR rally of his supporters, where there was very little social distancing and even less mask-wearing, despite state regulations.
We know how the saying goes: politics can be dirty. But it shouldn’t have to be deadly.
In these final weeks, we have no choice but to fight like hell and make sure the pendulum swings in the other direction.

Everyone knows the road to the White House runs through our battleground state. That’s why Trump attacked our vote-by-mail efforts — and it’s why Joe Biden is doubling down on his campaign efforts and running ads across Nevada.
We need to build on Biden’s efforts by DOUBLING our organizing team ahead of the November election.

We simply can’t take another four years of Trump. He’s mishandled the COVID-19 crisis — putting the health and safety of millions of Americans in jeopardy — threatened to cut off access to health care amid a global pandemic, and continues to do nothing as businesses close their doors for good and Americans lose their jobs.
Nevadans are ready to end the Trump chapter. We’re asking you to help us expand our organizing efforts and secure our state for Joe Biden and Democrats up and down the ballot:

"Friends,
Our state was instrumental in generating the blue wave in 2018 — Democrats across Nevada helped flip one of only two Senate seats to go from red to blue and cast hundreds of thousands of votes to protect house seats from Republican control.
But one seat slipped through the cracks.
I’m running to finish the job and flip Nevada’s second district, which would put our state's entire congressional delegation in the blue column.
Can you chip in $10 and be a part of the historic movement to FLIP our entire state BLUE?
My opponent, Mark Amodei, has sided with private interests over Nevadans on far too many occasions — from failing to protect our public lands, to voting in favor of repealing the ACA which could leave millions of Americans and over 300,000 Nevadans without health care, to accepting money from corporate interests and faceless wealthy backers.

There’s a reason Trump is trying to stop votes from being counted in our battleground state — because he knows his best path to victory lies in making sure Americans CAN’T vote.

Hey there, quick update about the work our field team is doing.
You already know we're working harder than ever to register Democrats across Nevada and make sure those voters turn out in our critical 2020 elections — and the hustle is paying off.
But the GOP has a fundraising mega-machine and they're already turning it against us.
If we don't publish strong grassroots numbers on the upcoming Federal Election Commission (FEC) report, they'll double down on their investment to crush our efforts — CLICK HERE to fight back with a contribution of $10 and make sure we raise another $20,691 before the June 30th deadline: If you saved your information, clicking any button below will cause your donation to process instantly:

The results of our primary election this month speak for themselves.
* Democrats now have a 6% advantage among registered voters in Nevada over the GOP.
* Statewide, Democrats led in overall turnout by more than 16,000 votes.
* 66,000+ more Democrats participated in the 2020 primary election compared to the 2018 election — and over 110,000 more Democrats compared to 2016.
Bottom line? NV Dems are in the strongest position we've ever been heading into a general election — but all that work will be for nothing if GOP mega-donors and dark money groups find weaknesses in our grassroots network.
Please rush a donation of $10 or more before midnight on June 30th:

Team, did you see the news last week?
Donald Trump announced he is withdrawing the United States from the World Health Organization (WHO), the specialized agency under the United Nations responsible for international public health.
The United States contributes about $400 million annually and is the World Health Organization's largest contributor.
Withdrawing that funding now, in the middle of a pandemic, puts hundreds of millions of people across the world in jeopardy and will only contribute to our current global humanitarian crisis.
Call on Donald Trump to immediately reverse his decision to pull the United States out of the World Health Organization by clicking here to add your name today →
ADD YOUR NAME
Not only would withdrawing the United States from the WHO have severe repercussions on our fight against COVID-19, but it would also drastically impact resources for countries battling other deadly viruses like Ebola, Polio, and HIV.
This is a reckless move by Donald Trump and sends a dangerous message to the world.
That's why the withdrawal is opposed by the American Medical Association, the nation's largest physician group, which has urged him to reverse course.

"Team,
I’m going to be direct with you: we have to protect our Democratic majority in the House from Republicans determined to roll back the progress we’ve made since 2018.
Republicans like my opponent, Dan Rodimer, who’s been endorsed by none other than President Trump. Rodimer is a staunch conservative who wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act and cause hundreds of thousands of Nevadans (including those with pre-existing conditions) to fend for themselves amid a global health crisis.
We simply cannot allow that to happen. Can you contribute $15 right away and help fund our efforts to defeat dangerous candidates like Dan and elect Democrats up and down the ballot in our battleground state?

The GOP knows how critical my seat is, which is why they’re concentrating their resources on flipping it. Rodimer and Trump make for a dangerous duo, and the thought of them governing together — as allies in Trump’s backwards vision for the country — is beyond terrifying.
We can still put a wedge in their dangerous and distorted vision for Nevada, but we have to act fast. What do you say?
Democrats like myself, Joe, and Kamala are prepared to fight for proactive change — but our opponents are relentless in their attacks.
With just a few weeks left until the election, Nevada Democrats up and down the ballot need your help to fight back, set the record straight, and make sure the GOP doesn’t carry out Trump’s dark plan for the country.

* We will be reporting these fundraising numbers out to the public — where the media, political analysts, and the GOP will be looking to see where Democrats' grassroots strength stands.
* Trump is already watching us closely, and with the recent ratings shift toward Republicans from The Cook Political Report, we can't miss a beat.

Trump: So I said to my people “slow the testing down, please”
Trump’s response to COVID-19 has been one failure after another.
First, he said it wasn’t a big deal and would be over by Easter. Then he failed to get medical professionals the equipment they needed. Now he’s talking about slowing down testing to make it seem like we have fewer cases.

Donald Trump started up his MAGA rallies this weekend and right out the gate he’s showing his true colors.
On Saturday in Tulsa, Trump mocked COVID-19 and said testing is a “double-edged sword” because the more people you test, the more cases you find.

Nevadans know firsthand that our air and water quality has a direct impact on our health.
For the Trump Administration to turn a blind eye to major polluters in the midst of a pandemic that overwhelmingly affects a person’s respiratory system is, at best, irresponsible.
Tell the Trump Administration: our health and safety — including the health and safety of our environment — is more important than polluters' bottom lines.
Thank you for taking a stand!

This is the moment we have been waiting for. Our country is resilient — but people can only take so much, and we can’t afford another four years of Trump.
In the final days of the election, everyone at NV Dems is working around the clock to make sure our state doesn’t fall under the red column.
Trump is a danger to our constitution, our democracy, and to our communities — the thought of another four years under his authoritarian administration is sickening.
Sickening, without a doubt, but preventable.
Join our efforts while you still can. Help prevent another four years of conservative judges, attempts to gut our health care, and attacks on reproductive rights.

Our strategy to win is simple: share Joe and Kamala’s positive vision for the country with voters across our state, and make sure those voters have the information, support, and resources they need to cast their ballots.
Trump, on the other hand? His strategy to win is by counting you OUT.
Trump and the GOP are hedging their bets to win by making sure as many Americans as possible CAN’T vote.

"Trump: So I said to my people “slow the testing down, please”
Trump’s response to COVID-19 has been one failure after another.
First, he said it wasn’t a big deal and would be over by Easter. Then he failed to get medical professionals the equipment they needed. Now he’s talking about slowing down testing to make it seem like we have fewer cases.
Fight back: Denounce Trump’s latest comment and pledge to vote him out this fall.
SIGN ON
Donald Trump started up his MAGA rallies this weekend and right out the gate he’s showing his true colors.
On Saturday in Tulsa, Trump mocked COVID-19 and said testing is a “double-edged sword” because the more people you test, the more cases you find.
This is disgusting, team. He’s trying to downplay the worst public health crisis we’ve faced in generations in an attempt to rally his base ahead of the election.

This isn’t a coincidence: Trump wants to slow down testing as we head into the general election to deceive voters into believing COVID-19 is a thing of the past.
And with recent polling showing Trump’s re-election is not in the bag, he especially doesn’t want any more cases identified in key 2020 battleground states like Nevada!
We know the road to the White House runs right through our state – that’s why it’s crucial we send a strong response denouncing his horrible comments this weekend.

There’s a reason Trump is trying to stop votes from being counted in our battleground state — because he knows his best path to victory lies in making sure Americans CAN’T vote.
Clark County is home to a diverse group of communities — and instead of trying to win their votes fair and square, Trump is trying to sue our state into suppressing them.

Donald Trump announced he is withdrawing the United States from the World Health Organization (WHO), the specialized agency under the United Nations responsible for international public health.
The United States contributes about $400 million annually and is the World Health Organization's largest contributor.
Withdrawing that funding now, in the middle of a pandemic, puts hundreds of millions of people across the world in jeopardy and will only contribute to our current global humanitarian crisis.

Not only would withdrawing the United States from the WHO have severe repercussions on our fight against COVID-19, but it would also drastically impact resources for countries battling other deadly viruses like Ebola, Polio, and HIV.

"Last week, Trump threatened to withhold federal grants from Nevada because we're expanding vote-by-mail and making it safer for voters to participate in our democracy.
Do you agree Trump's attacks directly threaten the integrity of our elections? YES NO
In case you missed it, Trump took to Twitter last week to threaten outrageous (and undemocratic) consequences for Nevada — all because we're on the frontlines of the fight to expand access to the ballot box and make voting as safe as possible in our upcoming elections.
Trump believes that making voting safer and easier is the same as trying to ""cheat in elections"" and he wants to punish Nevadans.
The entire NV Dems team was outraged by Trump's blatant attempt at voter suppression and we need to hear from you about it:
Do you agree that Trump's threat to withhold federal grant funding over Nevada's vote-by-mail program is a direct threat to our voting rights? YES NO
Last month, NV Dems joined the Democratic National Committee, Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and Priorities USA in filing a suit to expand voting access in Nevada.
We're committed to making voting safe and accessible to every voter in our state.
Trump, on the other hand, views any effort to elevate the voice of the voter as a direct threat to his chances of winning in November.

It's true: even contributing just $5 will help with our capacity to reach more than 10 voters.
Our state is a battleground and everyone knows it, including Trump.
On Tuesday the Trump campaign even admitted when campaigning in Nevada, they'll be ""playing on Joe Biden's field"".
That's why his team is pouring all their resources into spreading falsehoods and lies about Joe Biden and the Democratic party.

* Thanks to Democrats’ overwhelming grassroots strength, Nevada ushered in the nation’s first-ever majority-female legislature.

* Now, we’re facing a critical fundraising deadline and we’re asking you to pitch in $10 to help them hit their goal before midnight tomorrow!
Together, we’ve expanded access to affordable health care, made reforms to our criminal justice system, expanded reproductive rights, raised Nevada’s minimum wage, and worked to address our climate crisis by making Nevada a national leader in clean energy.

"Team,
We believe that no Nevada voter should ever have to choose between staying safe and making their voice heard at the ballot box. We're not going to let what happened in Wisconsin happen here.
That's why we've invested in an aggressive Voter Protection Program to make sure every Nevadan is able to vote safely — and I wanted to take a second to introduce Emily Goldman, our new Voter Protection Director.
She's taking the fight to the GOP to make sure every voter can cast their ballot safely, but she needs your help. We need to raise $5,000 in the next 48 hours to have the resources needed for her team to hit the ground running.

"Which issues should lawmakers focus on when it comes to combating climate change?
TAKE OUR CLIMATE CHANGE PRIORITIES SURVEY
Last month, Trump delivered on his threat to pull the U.S. out of the Paris Climate Accord, moving our country backward. But this reckless decision will not stop Nevadans from taking charge and leading the way on combating climate change.
Gov. Sisolak just signed an executive order directing Nevada agencies to evaluate and determine strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Nevadans are already living with the consequences of climate change — so we need to hear from you:
TAKE THE SURVEY
Democrats across the Silver State understand that climate change is too critical to ignore. Temperatures are rising faster in Nevada than anywhere else in the country. As wildfires rage and heat-related deaths increase, we know we can't wait for the GOP to get on board with the science. We need to take action.
Thank you for helping us continue to lead the way.

Our state is a battleground and everyone knows it, including Trump.
On Tuesday the Trump campaign even admitted when campaigning in Nevada, they'll be ""playing on Joe Biden's field"".
That's why his team is pouring all their resources into spreading falsehoods and lies about Joe Biden and the Democratic party.
They will do whatever it takes to paint our state red — and usually, we would have our field staff ready to combat their misinformation campaigns by knocking on doors and talking to voters face to face.

NV Dems is committed to making voting safe and accessible so that everyone’s voice is heard. But Trump sees any effort to elevate the voice of the voter in a battleground state like Nevada as a direct threat to his chances of staying in the White House.

Trump Wants to Pick Off Nevada
“Mr. Trump has continued to fight for Nevada, visiting the state twice since securing the Republican nomination for re-election; on Wednesday, he is planning to hold a rally just across the border in Bullhead City, Ariz.”
Team,
According to the New York Times, President Trump is fighting hard to turn Nevada red this year.
We aren’t going to let that happen. Will you pitch in $5 now to keep Nevada blue?
President Trump has hosted multiple in-person campaign rallies in Nevada -- and today, he’s just across the border in Arizona to avoid Nevada’s cap of 250 people at public gatherings.
Hillary Clinton won Nevada in 2016 -- and we elected Senator Jacky Rosen in 2018. But President Trump and the GOP are trying to roll back all of Democrats’ progress in 2020.
We MUST keep Nevada blue -- and we only have six days left to make sure we win this fight. Rush in your $5 contribution to show your support.
Thank you,

Newsweek: “Amy McGrath Takes Narrow Lead Over Mitch McConnell”
This is huge, team:
According to Newsweek, new polling shows that Democrat Amy McGrath just gained a small lead (41-40) against Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in the Kentucky Senate race.
Amy McGrath can beat Mitch McConnell -- and help Democrats take back the Senate from the GOP. But she needs our support to make it happen. Contribute $5 right now.
It’s clear that people in Kentucky are ready for a change. They’ve had enough of the dysfunction and partisanship of Mitch McConnell’s Senate -- and they’re ready to defeat him this November.
This new poll shows that Amy has incredible momentum in this race -- but we know that the GOP and the special interests will pull out all the stops to hold on to McConnell’s Senate seat.
We’ve got to help Amy keep up the momentum in this race. Rush in a $5 contribution right now to support Amy’s campaign to defeat Mitch McConnell.

BIDEN: 44%
Trump 42%
Team,
There is so much on the line in this election -- and it could all come down to Nevada.
According to the Las Vegas Review-Journal, polls show a tight race, with Joe Biden holding onto a narrow two-point lead. We need all hands on deck to keep Nevada blue this year.
Election Day is three days away. Will you pitch in $5 right now to join the fight?
We worked so hard to secure Nevada as a blue state in 2016 -- and we followed that up by electing Senator Jacky Rosen two years ago. Now, Republicans want to roll back our progress. But if we stand together, we can ensure we win the 2020 fight for our future.
We can’t let President Trump and the GOP paint Nevada red. There is just too much at stake.

Newsweek: Senate Democrats May Unseat GOP Incumbents in Battleground States
“Three Democrats fighting Senate races in key battleground states stand a good chance of unseating Republican opponents, according to new polling data released this week.”
Team,
Did you see the latest from Newsweek? New polls in Arizona, North Carolina, and Georgia show that Democrats are on pace to take back the Senate -- but it’s up to us to make it happen.
Will you pitch in $5 now to support Democrats Mark Kelly, Cal Cunningham, and Jon Ossoff as they fight to flip red seats blue and win a Democratic majority in the Senate?
In Georgia, Jon Ossoff is within the margin of error. In North Carolina, Cal Cunningham is up by four. And in Arizona, Mark Kelly is polling a whopping nine points ahead of the GOP incumbent.
Democrats’ chances of winning a Senate majority are greater than ever -- but we have to do everything we can to win key races like these ones in Arizona, North Carolina, and Georgia.
We can win this fight, but it’s going to take all of us standing together:
Make a $5 contribution now to support Mark Kelly, Cal Cunningham, and Jon Ossoff.
