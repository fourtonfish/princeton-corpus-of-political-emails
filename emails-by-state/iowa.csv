This is SHOCKING, Alex!!
We just saw the latest data on campaign spending in Iowa, and we couldn‚Äôt believe the numbers.
Republican Senator Joni Ernst has been out-spent online by her Democrat challenger by nearly 500% in the past week alone, putting her at a huge disadvantage in during this critical phase of the campaign.
If she keeps getting out-spent like this, she‚Äôs sure to lose -- along with other Republican candidates across our great state. Please, Alex, chip in now to fight back and close this massive spending gap.

Alex -- we‚Äôre going to cut right to the chase: we‚Äôre being massively out-raised by the Democrats.
The latest reports show that nationally, Democrats raised more than $1.5 billion (with a ‚Äúb‚Äù) online in the three months ending on September 30.
That‚Äôs more than twice what Republicans raised during the same period, and the deficit leaves us vulnerable in the campaign‚Äôs final weeks.

Alex \-- we‚Äôre THRILLED.
The latest polls show that Republican Senator Joni Ernst is in the lead against her far-left Democrat opponent!
This is HUGE news in our fight to defend our Republican Senate Majority, which will come down to just four seats.
Democrats are going to use this news to rally their donors in California and New York and fund negative ads to tear Joni down.
That‚Äôs why we need every Grassroots Republican (including you, Alex!) to chip in $5 or more to build on this momentum TODAY. Can we count on you?
If you've saved your payment information with WinRed, your donation will go through immediately.

Nationally, our Republican Senate Majority will come down to just FOUR SEATS.
And experts say that whichever party wins in Iowa will win the whole election.
That‚Äôs why this is such a critical moment, Alex.
We‚Äôve got the momentum, and now we need to build on it to secure our victory. Please, donate $5 or more today.

Hello, Alex! You are receiving this email because you signed up to receive emails in support of our Republican Majority. To update your email preferences, click here.
This is absolutely outrageous, Alex.
FIRST: Barack Obama refused to stay retired, jumping back into the 2020 Election as a leading force on the campaign trail.
THEN: He raised more than $7 MILLION for Joe Biden in a online-only June fundraiser.
NOW: Obama is meddling in Iowa, where he‚Äôs endorsed left-wing Democrat Theresa Greenfield and threatens to DESTROY our Republican Senate Majority.
If Obama brings his full fundraising machine to bear in our Senate race, our chances will be absolutely ruined \--- unless we fight back today.
We have to ask, Alex. Will you step up and send an emergency donation of $25 before midnight tonight to help defend against Barack Obama‚Äôs national donor network?

It‚Äôs really hard to overstate how important this re-electing Senator Ernst is for our Republican Senate Majority.
If we fail to Keep Iowa Red, we‚Äôll almost certainly lose the entire Senate -- and with it any hope of passing President Trump‚Äôs agenda.

Alex \-- this is really bad.
We were so sure that we‚Äôd finish September strong, but the truth is that we fell $4,059.76 short of our Deadline Goal.
But there‚Äôs good news! We asked Chairman Jeff Kaufmann, and he gave us special permission to extend our goal by one day only.
That means we have one more chance to finish September strong, Alex. So, we have to ask you -- will you make a donation of $5 or more today to help us meet our goal?

We know these goals may seem arbitrary, but they aren‚Äôt.
The fact is that if we don‚Äôt raise enough money online each and every day, we won‚Äôt be able to afford the critical campaign work that we need to keep Iowa ‚Äúred‚Äù in November.
That‚Äôs why we‚Äôve been pleading with you to donate, Alex. Your gift of $5 or more is critically important. Can you chip in today?

With so much going on in the news right now, we know it can be hard to keep track of things.
But we can‚Äôt afford to lose sight of how critically important Iowa‚Äôs US Senate campaign is to the future of our nation.

We have a little over two months until the 2020 election. We‚Äôve got a great team of organizers working to elect Democrats up and down the ballot ‚Äì but they can‚Äôt do it without your help!

The most important thing you can do this election year is to become a Vote Lead. Vote Leads will be in charge of talking to their neighbors and making sure people know how to vote safely in this election.
Want to learn more about becoming a Vote Lead? We are having trainings every Sunday and Wednesday. Sign up below and we‚Äôll give you a call with all the information you need to help flip Iowa blue.

"Friends,
We have exciting news to share! We just launched [[URL REDACTED]] \-- a comprehensive look-up tool for Iowa voters like you to check your registration and confirm your precinct caucus location for the most important first-in-the-nation Iowa caucuses ever on Feb. 3 2020!
It‚Äôs never too early to start making your plan to caucus. We are just 8 weeks away from caucus night, and we want to make sure we give you plenty of time to know where you‚Äôll be caucusing. I think I might even add it to one of my favorite locations on my Google Maps!!
Click here to check out [[URL REDACTED]]
Whether you‚Äôre caucusing for the first time, or have been meeting with your fellow Democrats on the first Monday in February for decades, we strongly encourage everyone to take a look at our new look-up tool.
We all know what‚Äôs at stake in this election cycle. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you know who you want to caucus for yet (a lot of folks are still undecided, that‚Äôs okay!) -- but what matters more than anything is that we get out and make our voices heard.
The eyes of the nation will be laser-focused on Iowa‚Äôs caucuses -- so we‚Äôre counting on you to be a part of this process. Click here to check out [[URL REDACTED]] to check your voter registration status and confirm your precinct caucus location!!

"Friends,
It‚Äôs a big week here at the Iowa Democratic Party. Yesterday, we opened the early check-in portal for the 2020 precinct caucuses (remember, you can check-in early at this link!). And today, we‚Äôre excited to release the 2020 satellite caucus locations!
Increasing accessibility for the first-in-the-nation caucuses was one of our primary goals -- and the expansion of the satellite caucuses will do just that. This year, Iowans will be caucusing at 99 satellite caucuses across the state and globe -- click here to check out a full list of our locations!
We are so proud of the hard work that the applicants, Satellite Review Committee, SCC, volunteer leadership, and staff has dedicated to the satellite caucuses. Thanks to all of our hard work, a record number of Iowans will have the opportunity to have their voices heard in the most important Iowa caucuses ever.
Satellite caucuses will work just like precinct caucuses -- Iowans will express their presidential preferences and conduct party business as usual, it just so happens that these caucus sites will be in locations across the country, in order to accommodate Iowa Democrats who can't attend their precinct caucus.
We‚Äôll continue to update you on the satellite caucuses, but with so many additional caucus sites to organize, print materials for, and cover postage (especially for the caucuses happening out-of-state!) I have to make one ask of you:
Can you make a grassroots donation to our First-in-the-Nation Caucus Fund today to help us pay for the additional costs associated with the expanded satellite caucuses?
Thanks so much,
Seth
P.S. Head to our 2020 Caucus Online Hub to learn more about the satellite caucuses, early check-in, how to volunteer, and more!

"BREAKING: Judge Sides with Trump Campaign and Iowa Republicans, Tossing Out Thousands of Iowans‚Äô Ballot Requests
Thousands of Johnson County voters will have to re-submit their requests to vote by mail.
Friend,
A few hours ago, a judge in Johnson County ruled in favor of the Trump Campaign and the Republican Party of Iowa, tossing out thousands of Iowans‚Äô ballot requests. After three of these lawsuits, one thing has become very clear: Iowa Republicans don‚Äôt want you to vote.
Republicans know that their anti-worker policies have left Iowans behind and Trump‚Äôs failure to contain COVID-19 has devastated our economy and cost countless Iowans their lives and livelihoods, and now they‚Äôre desperately trying to change the rules of this election to avoid being held accountable by Iowa‚Äôs voters at all costs.
Iowa Democrats are committed to fighting GOP-led voter suppression at every turn. Working families need high-quality, affordable health care and good jobs that provide a stable future -- and we‚Äôre the only party fighting for a better world for all of us. Will you chip in $25 right now, friend, to help us fight for the Iowans who‚Äôve been left behind?
No matter our differences -- what we look like or where we‚Äôre from -- Iowa Democrats know that when we come together, anything is possible. We can take back the Iowa state legislature, protect our seats and add to our majority in the House of Representatives, flip the Senate, and send Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to the Oval Office.
But we can‚Äôt do this without your help, friend, and every dollar counts as we head into the final 50 days before Election Day. Can you chip in $5, $10, or $25 today?
Let‚Äôs do this.

"If you get a phone call later today, it might be me on the other line
Happy New Year, folks! I hope that you‚Äôve been able to spend some quality time with your loved ones over the last few days. The team here at the Iowa Democratic Party is already back at the office working hard -- because there‚Äôs only about a month before the Iowa caucuses.
Since today is the final day of 2019, I decided I wanted to call our grassroots donors and thank them for their support this year. I‚Äôll be calling some donors who donate to this email all afternoon -- so if you get a call later today, it might just be me on the other end of the line!
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Donate $3 Now
Donate $10 Now
Donate $27 Now
Donate $50 Now
Donate another amount
This year our grassroots supporters stepped up in a huge way. The donations that you and thousands of folks made allowed us to hire more organizing staff, expand our community engagement team, and invest in technology to make the caucus process more accessible for every Iowan.
Truthfully, without your support, we would not have been able to make these critical investments that will undoubtedly make the 2020 Iowa caucuses the most accessible, transparent, and successful in history. And, those investments will be important as we continue building our infrastructure to prepare for the general election.
That‚Äôs why I want to spend the last day of 2019 thanking supporters like you. So please consider making a donation to close out the year -- you might be getting a call from me later!
Thanks so much,
Troy
P.S. Our average online donation this year was just $21. You proved that the IDP is truly funded by the grassroots -- thank you!

"AP News: Judge grants Trump motion to block absentee requests in Iowa
The Trump campaign, the Republican Party of Iowa, and several GOP groups won their voter suppression suit this afternoon, disenfranchising 50,000 Iowans who had already turned in their ballot requests.
Friend,
A few hours ago, a judge ruled that 50,000 absentee ballot requests from Linn County had to be thrown out. 50,000 Iowans now have to scramble to repeat a process they‚Äôve already completed.
The Linn County auditor will be notifying those affected and mailing a new request form to each impacted voter in mid-September. You can also sign up here to be mailed a request form.
Trump and Republicans like Sen. Joni Ernst know that they won‚Äôt win on their broken promises and anti-worker records ‚Äì so they‚Äôre changing the rules and making it more difficult for Iowans to vote safely during a global pandemic.
But while the GOP seeks to disenfranchise Iowans, we are virtually organizing nonstop in every corner of this state to expand access to voting, register new voters, and help with absentee ballot requests.
Iowa Democrats will not stand for this injustice and we will continue to fight for every Iowan‚Äôs right to cast a ballot without jeopardizing their health or the health of their families. Our right to vote is too important to let this cowardly, malicious attack on Iowans go unchecked.
Our nation works better when more voices are heard, not less. Trump and the GOP‚Äôs cowardly lawsuit makes it clear how little they care about everyday Iowans‚Äô ideas ‚Äì and how far they‚Äôll go to stay in power.
In solidarity,
The IDP team

"They all have something in common.
Friends,
Senator Joni Ernst thought she would be able to keep a low profile with so much attention being focused on Iowa‚Äôs first-in-the-nation caucuses. But recent polling from Morning Consult shows her approval rating underwater again -- and sinking.
In fact, she‚Äôs the third most unpopular Senator in the country -- sharing the awful ratings with her D.C. buddies Mitch McConnell and Susan Collins. It‚Äôs clear that Iowans recognize Joni Ernst for who she really is: just another Washington politician.
We know that the caucuses are fast-approaching, but we can‚Äôt miss this opportunity to tell more Iowa voters about Senator Ernst‚Äôs terrible approval ratings. Can you rush a donation to our Defeat Joni Ernst Fund right away?
Mitch McConnell and Susan Collins are already known across the country as being partisan hacks who put their party before the country. But it‚Äôs our job to make sure folks know that Ernst is the exact same as McConnell and Collins.
It‚Äôs clear that voters across the state are ready to hold Senator Ernst accountable this November -- and we have to keep the pressure up.
That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre asking you to rush a donation to our Defeat Joni Ernst fund to help us take advantage of this momentum and flip the U.S. Senate!

Friend,
I am thrilled to share some good news with you. Today, here in Iowa and across the nation, we are celebrating the first-ever National Black Voter Day! (Which means it‚Äôs a great day to check your voter registration and make a plan to vote.)
Today is personal for me -- my parents grew up in the Jim Crow South, and they knew all too well about the use of voter intimidation tactics. As a young Black girl growing up in Iowa, they instilled in me that voting is a right that should never be taken for granted.
This is one of the most important elections that many of us will live to see -- and the GOP is doing everything they can to keep us from holding them accountable.
But they don‚Äôt know the strength of our community‚Äôs political power when we all work together.
Our predecessors marched, bled, and even died so that we could have the opportunity to make our voices heard at the ballot box -- let‚Äôs honor their sacrifice and make a plan to vote in this election.
We have come too far to turn back now. Let today serve as a reminder that there are no off years for voting and that every vote matters, including and especially Black votes.

"Hi Friends --
On February 3rd, Iowa Democrats gathered in every precinct across the state to organize for the upcoming 2020 election and to kick off our party‚Äôs presidential nomination process. It was our party‚Äôs second largest turnout ever, and the first step in Iowa‚Äôs process to elect delegates to the National Convention.
The safety of Iowa Democrats is our top concern. So, this year our Iowa conventions will not meet in person, but will be conducted remotely. The National Convention is currently scheduled to meet in person starting on August 17th.
If you were elected a delegate or alternate at your caucus, you need to register to participate in your remote county convention now through April 17th. If you did not receive an email invitation to register, contact your county chair or the Iowa Democratic Party Convention Team at [[URL REDACTED]] or 1-800-325-8602.
If you were not elected a delegate or alternate on caucus night you can help by reaching out to the delegates and alternates that were elected in your precinct and making sure they know about this registration information.
We know that the landscape looks very different now than when we started this process in February, but completing our convention plan guarantees that Iowa has a voice at the National Convention and puts us one step closer to defeating Donald Trump and electing Democrats up-and-down the ticket in November.
For more convention updates throughout this process, please visit [[URL REDACTED]]

"Senator Ernst promised to make DC squeal - but the only ones squealing are Iowans.
Dear Friends --
Six years ago today, Senator Joni Ernst made us a promise: she would ""make Washington squeal."" But once she got to Washington, she turned her loyalties to Mitch McConnell and her special interest backers ‚Äì and only made it that much tougher for Iowans.
So today, we are launching our first ad campaign of this election to hold Senator Ernst accountable!
###  WATCH: IDP New Ad ‚Äì ""Making Iowans Squeal""
Youtube video of ad
Plain and simple, Senator Ernst has not fought for us.
Ernst put her political career first by giving a leg up to powerful corporations ‚Äì green-lighting tens of billions in special interest handouts that exploded our deficit to over $1 trillion. She led efforts to end the Affordable Care Act and gut coverage protections for pre-existing conditions. And she's working behind closed doors to undermine Iowans' hard-earned retirement.
After Ernst's five failed years, Washington's big spenders aren't squealin'. Iowans are.
Senator Ernst's re-election campaign is more vulnerable than ever ‚Äì she's not going to be easy to defeat, but we can do it together. Help elect a new senator who will fight for us!

It‚Äôs a tall order, but Iowa Democrats have never shied away from a challenge. Too many Iowans have been left behind while Republicans continue to cater to special interest groups and wealthy corporate donors.
Enough is enough, friend -- will you commit right now to volunteering for our Weekend of Action?
Iowans need leaders who represent us in office -- leaders who understand what it‚Äôs like to stay up at night worrying about how to stretch that last dollar until the end of the month.
JOIN OUR WEEKEND OF ACTION
WHEN: This weekend! Saturday, Sept. 19 - Sunday, Sept. 20
WHERE: Virtual Events
A better future is possible -- we just have to fight for it.

"Friends,
The COVID-19 pandemic has changed a lot of things over the last few months, but it hasn‚Äôt dampened our enthusiasm or stifled our commitment to electing Democrats up and down the ticket this November.

"And he's coming to Iowa.
Friends,
Donald Trump is coming to Iowa for another one of his signature MAGA rallies. Usually incumbent presidents don‚Äôt see a need to campaign in Iowa before the caucuses, but it‚Äôs clear that Trump is scared as all hell.
Iowans are energized like never before ahead of Monday‚Äôs caucuses -- and Donald Trump knows it. We won‚Äôt tolerate a president who spews empty promises at us while catering to the demands of a few powerful interests. And Democrats like you are doing something about it -- but we need you to do more.
We need you to make a donation to the Iowa Democrats TODAY to show Donald Trump that his visit to Iowa will only further energize Democrats to defeat him. Please, rush a donation:
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Donate $3 Now
Donate $10 Now
Donate $27 Now
Donate $50 Now
Donate another amount
Donald Trump has made a myriad of promises to Iowans -- and to the country. But he‚Äôs failed to deliver on those promises. And instead of owning his broken promises, he‚Äôs doing everything he can to distract from it.
But no amount of kicking, screaming, or tweeting can change a cemented legacy of failure -- or voters‚Äô desperation for something new.
Let‚Äôs get a surge of grassroots donations as Donald Trump comes to Iowa and prove to him that we won‚Äôt back down. Donate today.
Best,
Troy Price

"BREAKING: Joe Biden is up THREE POINTS against Trump in Iowa
Will you help us expand our lead, friend?
Chip in ‚Üí
Friend,
We don‚Äôt normally get too excited about polls, but we just had to share this one with you: the New York Times released their latest poll this morning showing that Vice President Joe Biden is leading Trump by three points in Iowa.
This poll makes one thing clear: all the hard work Iowa Democrats are doing is paying off. It would have been easy to write off our state after 2016, but supporters like you have shown up and put in the work to flip Iowa blue in November -- and now, Iowa is a true 2020 battleground.
This poll means that we have a real shot at sending Joe Biden to the White House -- but we can‚Äôt afford to slow down now. With only 40 days left before this election, every cent counts. Can you chip in $40 right now to help us expand our lead, friend?
Iowa Democrats are organizing up and down the ballot to ensure victory in November ‚Äì and we won‚Äôt stop until Joe Biden is elected President of the United States, we flip the U.S. Senate blue, maintain our House Democratic majority, and take back the Iowa state legislature.
Imagine it -- a government that invests in working people to grow our economy (and not just those at the top), where our civil rights are respected, where liberty and justice are truly for all of us. That‚Äôs what we‚Äôre fighting for and we can‚Äôt stop now. Will you chip in $5, $20, or $40 right now to help us turn Iowa blue?
Let‚Äôs win this thing.

You can really feel it now -- the caucuses are coming up FAST and Iowans from river to river are starting to decide who they are going to caucus for on February 3rd.

We‚Äôre recommending that everyone check-in early because we‚Äôre preparing the biggest turnout in recent history, and we want to do everything we can to make those check-in lines as short as possible.

But there‚Äôs only one week left for you to take advantage of the early check-in process -- so please, click here to get started -- it only takes about 30 seconds!

But with every new day comes a new to-do list. Today‚Äôs includes receiving a shipment of caucus guidebooks for precinct leaders and a big shipment of pens to go out to precinct leaders.

ORIGINAL MESSAGE FROM SETH COHEN ON JAN. 22
Friends,
Over the last 2 weeks, our team has been working day and night (quite literally) preparing caucus materials for the first-in-nation Iowa caucuses coming up on February 3rd. We built a truly incredible operation here at HQ -- powered by our amazing staff and a team of dedicated volunteers -- to ensure that every precinct caucus location would have exactly what they need to have a successful caucus.
After we finished preparing all the materials, (including things like reporting templates, sign-in sheets, and presidential preference cards) we loaded up a fleet of moving trucks and delivered them to every county in Iowa.
We worked really hard. We‚Äôre proud of the work we did. And we know there‚Äôs more work ahead. But assembling these caucus materials cost a lot of money. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm reaching out -- can you please make a grassroots contribution right away to help us cover the cost of caucus materials?
We‚Äôre confident that we‚Äôre going to be hosting the most accessible, transparent, and successful caucuses ever in just 2 short weeks. We take our role as the first step in the presidential nominating process very seriously -- and it‚Äôs why we worked extra hard to assemble flawless precinct caucus packet materials.
The caucuses are the purest form of democracy in action. And while they‚Äôre technically completely volunteer-run, that doesn‚Äôt mean they don‚Äôt come without a financial burden to our party.
It‚Äôs the final push before the caucus, and we need your financial support now more than ever. If you‚Äôre able, please make a grassroots donation to help keep us on track to have a successful Iowa caucus!!
Thanks,
Seth

"Hi friend!
We haven‚Äôt been properly introduced yet, but I‚Äôm Lauren McElmeel -- the digital director for the IDP -- coming at you with a special Halloween message.
I love Halloween and everything spooky, but I‚Äôm not a fan of the scary future that Republicans have in store for us if we don‚Äôt vote them out. The GOP has worked for years to take away our health care, throw up barriers to exercising our reproductive freedoms, fan the flames of hate and divisiveness, and chip away at our right to vote.
But we can stop this horror show and build a better future for every one of us. Will you chip in $31 today to help us elect compassionate Democratic leadership up and down the ballot, friend?
We only have three days left to turn Iowa blue, elect Theresa Greenfield to the U.S. Senate, and send Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to the White House. It‚Äôs a tall order and every dollar counts to get us across the finish line.
This scary story can still have a happy ending, friend -- can we count on you to chip in $5, $10, or $15?
Have a safe and fun Halloween! (And remember to make a plan to vote!)

"Friends,
It‚Äôs getting to be crunch time ahead of the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucuses. As you know, we worked extremely hard to ensure that these caucuses will be the most accessible ever -- and today I‚Äôm excited to tell you about another step we‚Äôre taking to achieve that goal.
For the first time ever, we're excited to announce we're offering a Request for Accommodation process for the 2020 caucuses! To learn more about the Request for Accommodation Process and to submit a request, click here.
We know that some Iowa Democrats may need additional assistance in order to participate in the caucuses -- and we want to make sure as many Iowans as possible are able to participate in the process and make their voices heard.
And as the Caucus Accessibility Director, it was one of my top priorities to implement a Request for Accommodation process. We are working around the clock reviewing requests from Iowans all across the state, but I wanted to make sure you had a chance to review the accommodation form, too.
If you or someone you know may need an accommodation in order to participate in the Iowa caucuses, please take a minute to review the Request for Accommodation process.
Thanks so much, and see you at the caucuses!

No matter what holiday you celebrate this season -- or if you don‚Äôt celebrate at all -- we wanted to take a minute to say thank you from the bottom of our hearts. The hard work you and so many others did in 2019 has laid the foundation for continued success in 2020.
We hope you find some time to take a break over the next few days, because with only six weeks before the Iowa caucuses, we won‚Äôt have much time to rest in 2020. Together, we‚Äôre going to show the nation -- and world -- that Iowa has some of the hardest-working Democrats ever.
Lastly, this time of year can be difficult for many folks. The national suicide prevention hotline number is 800-273-8255. Please don‚Äôt hesitate to post this on your social media pages -- you never know who might be struggling.
All the best, and cheers to a successful 2020,

"Friends,
Fifteen days ago, just north of our state, an American citizen was murdered in the street, in broad daylight, on video, by officers sworn to protect and serve their community. And fifteen days later, the streets of Iowa communities and cities across America are filled with justifiable anger, anguish, and frustration.
George Floyd was murdered in Minneapolis. But it could have easily have been a man in Mason City. It could have happened in Des Moines, Dubuque, or Davenport - in Council Bluffs or Cedar Falls. It could have happened in Iowa because like too many communities and too many states in America, appropriate legislation does not exist to protect our people.
Last week, Iowa House Democrats introduced three common sense proposals to make our state and our union more perfect and we need your help to make it a reality.
We understand that no one law can end racism or end the inequality that we face overnight. But today, we can begin to respond to this crisis, to bring justice for George Floyd, and work toward a day where no Iowan has to live in fear of becoming another hashtag.
The Plan for a More Perfect Union will:
* Protect Iowa citizens by ensuring that no Iowan is held in a chokehold by law enforcement.
* Make sure Iowa communities stay safe by banning police departments from hiring officers who were previously fired or resigned because of misconduct.
* Bring justice to more Iowans by ensuring that Iowa's Attorney General has the power to investigate misconduct.
This bill can pass but we have to act quickly. Can you take a few moments today to:
* Sign our petition
* Send to 3 friends
* Share on Facebook and Twitter
* Call your State Senator (515-281-3371) and State Representative (515-281-3221) and let them know you support a plan for a more perfect union
This bill won‚Äôt bring back George Floyd, but it‚Äôs something Iowa lawmakers can do right this moment to help establish justice for Black communities. Now is the time to turn the apathy of some into action of many. Now is when we turn our pain into progress and our outrage into organizing. Now, with this plan, is when we turn our organizing into ordinances that make our state and our union fairer, more just, and more perfect.
In solidarity,
State Representative Ras Smith

"Friend,
Thank you for being one of our most dedicated supporters! We appreciate everything you‚Äôre doing to help us flip Iowa blue.
We won‚Äôt lie -- these final days can be stressful. But if we have time to worry, we have time to work. We‚Äôre focusing on what we can do right now to get out the vote.
Can you commit today to take action? Here are some easy ways to get involved:
* Make phone calls! You just need a computer and a phone. We‚Äôll be calling folks that haven‚Äôt returned their ballot yet, or folks that need help finding their polling location, and more! RSVP here! We have shifts every day at multiple times so it‚Äôs easier than ever to help get out the vote!
* Text your friends and family! Let your friends and family know about important voting deadlines and make sure they have a plan to vote. Reaching out to friends can increase turnout by 8.3% -- enough to turn Iowa blue! Download our texting app and watching our training video here!
* Forward this email to your friends. (They‚Äôre more likely to help out if you ask!)
We can turn Iowa blue and elect Democrats up and down the ballot -- we just have to fight for it. Let's do this.

"Hi Friend,
The Republican National Convention is finally over -- and the same day Trump accepted the Republican nomination, Iowa hit a new record of 1,475 new COVID-19 cases in a single day.
But, instead of rolling out their plans to bring us out of the COVID-19 crisis safely or give working families a fair shot, Governor Reynolds, Senator Ernst, and the rest of the GOP just spent four nights hosting a tone-deaf celebration for Trump‚Äôs complete failure on the coronavirus pandemic, the economy, and now even the insufficient derecho response.
Trump and the GOP may be acting like this crisis is over -- but Iowa Democrats know that we need to support working families through this pandemic. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have a plan to save Iowans‚Äô lives and livelihoods, but we‚Äôre counting on you to help us get them to the White House. Will you help us turn Iowa blue by chipping in $15 right now?
Iowa Democrats know that it‚Äôs more important than ever to build up our social safety net so working Iowans can take care of their families when things get tough. Iowans understand the burden and the dangers of climate change, and we‚Äôre ready to take action on projects that bring people together like our proud tradition of renewable energy. Iowa has some of the worst bridges and roads in the country, but Democrats are ready to build up infrastructure like roads, bridges, and broadband across Iowa so we can build back our small-town Main Streets.
If we‚Äôre going to get this done, we need to elect leaders who will put in the work. We‚Äôve seen what Democrats can do without being asked. Imagine the changes they‚Äôll make when they get elected.
But we can‚Äôt get these incredible public servants into office without your help, friend. Iowa is a battleground state, which means we‚Äôre virtually organizing everywhere, and every penny counts. Can you chip in $5, $10, or $20 today to help us elect Democrats up and down the ballot and ensure that Iowa works for everyone?
Joe Biden said in his speech at the DNC last week that he ‚Äúwill draw on the best of us not the worst.‚Äù And even after watching four days of chaos and carnage at the RNC, Iowa Democrats are more prepared than ever to fight for hope and the future of all Iowans.
Let‚Äôs rebuild Iowa together!

"Friends,
Our right to vote safely is under attack again.
Iowa Republicans just revived their voter suppression bill in the Legislature and want to pass it TONIGHT before they adjourn for the year.
Here‚Äôs what you can do:
Call Republican Senator Brad Zaun (515-281-3371) and Republican Representative Bobby Kauffman (515-281-3221) and tell them to STOP their voter suppression sneak attack!
Iowa Democrats believe that every Iowan has the right to vote safely, and in the middle of a global pandemic, it is more vital than ever that Iowans have easier access to vote-by-mail.
Call right now and tell them every Iowan deserves the right to vote!

"Folks,
You might have seen the news already, but we wanted to make sure you heard it from us too: Mike Pence is coming to Iowa (AGAIN) tomorrow -- in the midst of the global pandemic Trump has totally failed to control. This event is just his latest desperate attempt to smooth things over for Trump, but Iowans aren‚Äôt fooled so easily.
After attacks on our farmers, a chaotic and deadly pandemic response, economic devastation, and constant threats to gut health care, Iowans are fed up with Trump and his administration‚Äôs willingness to throw working families under the bus.
Pence‚Äôs visit to Iowa just reminds us how critical it is to send Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to the White House in November. But we‚Äôre counting on you to make sure Iowans in every corner of the state can hear the Democratic Party‚Äôs message of hope and recovery. Can you chip in $5, $10, or $25 right now to help us send Trump and Pence packing?
This is an all-hands-on-deck election and we can‚Äôt do this without you, friend. The stakes are high and the COVID-19 crisis has made it clearer than ever that Iowans can‚Äôt afford another four years of Trump‚Äôs recklessness.
But here‚Äôs the good news: we have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity this November to send Trump packing by electing Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to restore dignity to the Oval Office.
Let‚Äôs show Pence that Iowa Democrats are strong, unified, and ready to win in November. Will you donate $5 or more today to elect Democrats up and down the ballot?

BREAKING FROM THE ASSOCIATED PRESS:
‚Äú‚ÄòDark money‚Äô ties raise questions for GOP Sen. Ernst of Iowa‚Äù
Rush a donation to help us expose Joni‚Äôs illegal conduct ‚Üí
* * *
Folks:
We woke up this morning to a damning report from the Associated Press claiming Iowa Republican Senator Joni Ernst‚Äôs campaign illegally coordinated with a dark money group to fund her reelection campaign. Here‚Äôs an excerpt from the report:
‚ÄúAn outside group founded by top political aides to Sen. Joni Ernst has worked closely with the Iowa Republican to raise money and boost her reelection prospects, a degree of overlap that potentially violates the law, documents obtained by The Associated Press show‚Äù
Senator Ernst first ran in 2014 on the promise that she‚Äôd make Washington squeal -- but this report reveals she‚Äôs just part of the problem. And it‚Äôs exactly why we must defeat her in 2020.
Can you rush an emergency donation to our Defeat Joni Ernst fund right away?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Donate $3 Now
Donate $10 Now
Donate $27 Now
Donate $50 Now
Donate another amount
This isn‚Äôt the first time Joni Ernst has been caught breaking the rules to help herself. She‚Äôs more focused on serving herself than serving her constituents.
This self-serving conduct reinforces why Iowa‚Äôs hardworking families can‚Äôt trust Senator Ernst to fight for them in Washington.
It‚Äôs my job to make sure Iowa voters know just how terrible this behavior from Joni Ernst is -- and in order to do that, we need resources from folks like you. So please, make a donation to our Defeat Joni Ernst fund today to help us expose Joni‚Äôs illegal campaign coordination.

"THE CEDAR RAPIDS GAZETTE: Iowa Schools Forced to Rely on Gov. Reynolds' Unreliable COVID-19 Numbers
It came out recently that Iowa is under-reporting new COVID cases -- yet Governor Reynolds is plowing ahead with school reopenings without a mask mandate in sight. Can you chip in $5 right now to help us fight back for teachers?
DONATE HERE
Friend,
Across our state, students are scheduled to return to school next week, and we want to take a moment to recognize the courage and commitment that teachers in Iowa have shown. Teachers are going above and beyond for their communities -- but they shouldn‚Äôt have to make the kind of sacrifices that Governor Reynolds and GOP leaders are demanding of them.
Reynolds is doing everything possible to follow in lock-step with President Trump and force teachers into classrooms without a mask mandate, even as COVID-19 cases continue to increase. Recently, a whistleblower revealed that the Iowa Department of Public Health is reporting glitching data, so it‚Äôs now not even possible to track outbreaks or get accurate information on coronavirus cases in school districts. But Reynolds is plowing through local school district control and forcing all schools to open anyway.
Trump, Reynolds, and the GOP have proven time and time again they don‚Äôt care about the health and safety of Iowans. But Iowa Democrats stand with teachers, and we‚Äôre committed to ousting Trump at the ballot box on Election Day. Can you pitch in $5, 10, or $25 right now to help us save our teachers?
With Reynolds threatening to punish local school districts that are just trying to put students and teachers‚Äô safety first, it is more important than ever that we fight back and turn the Iowa House blue this November.
It‚Äôs clearer than ever: we can‚Äôt afford four more years of Trump pushing his agenda on Iowans -- and Reynolds following his every move. We need to elect Vice President Biden and Senator Harris and break up the Republican trifecta in Iowa to put a stop to the damaging and dangerous policies of the Reynolds administration.
We‚Äôre going to flip Iowa blue for our students, teachers, and educators -- but we can‚Äôt do it without your help, Friend. Will you donate $5, $10, or $25 today to move Iowa forward?
Iowa Democrats stand with the teachers of this state in demanding a safe education plan. Your donation will help us turn out Democrats to vote in record numbers. For just a few dollars, you can help us put Iowa‚Äôs teachers on the path to success.
Thanks for being an Iowa Democrat.

"Dear Iowa Democrats,
I wanted to send you one final note before I depart as chair of the Iowa Democratic Party.
When I became chair in 2017, I took over at a time when our party was demoralized after the 2016 elections. A lot of people said our party was dead, and that we would never come back. But we did what we always do when we get knocked down - we got right back up and got to work.
Over these last two and a half years, I have watched as this party came back, stronger than ever. I saw the amazing activists and volunteers come together to knock doors and make phone calls. I saw our amazing county parties working to build excitement at the grassroots level - not only through our traditional voter contact, but through innovative programs and events that all show our commitment to the values our party holds dear. I saw the work that so many have done to bring new voices into our party. I saw our outstanding candidates and elected officials working day and night to fight for a better Iowa.
In short, throughout my time as Chair, I had the chance to see up close and personal the spirit that unites our party - that spirit of tireless work and progressive values all to help ensure the voice of the many is heard.
I can tell you, being the Chair of the Iowa Democratic Party has been one of the greatest honors of my life.
The last two weeks have been rough on our party. As Chair, I am deeply sorry for what happened, and bear any responsibility for the Iowa Democratic Party's role in what went wrong. While I love this job and I love working and fighting alongside all of you, I made the decision to leave so that our party could start to turn the page with a new chair and focus on our ultimate goal - electing Democrats up and down the ticket in November. I know that whoever is elected will do a tremendous job.
In spite of what happened last week, our party remains strong and our shared mission remains clear: to win in November. Thousands of new people joined our party through the caucus process. We still have some of the best candidates and elected officials in the country. Our party has the resources we need to win. And our activists and our committed volunteers remain the best in the country.
So, as I say goodbye, I want to simply say thank you. Thank you for your friendship. Thank you for your hard work. Thank you for your support. And thank you for demonstrating day in and day out that Iowa Democrats will never stop fighting for a bright, progressive future.
Now, let's go win this thing.
Sincerely,
Troy Price
Chair, Iowa Democratic Party
Paid for by the Iowa Democratic Party.
