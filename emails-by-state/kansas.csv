Republican Response to State of the State Address
Friend,
Governor Laura Kelly delivered her State of the State address this evening. She once again stood in front of Kansans making quick-fix promises with her 'kick the can down the road' approach to governing.
While the governor and Kansas Democrats continue to force the tab on to our children and grandchildren, Kansas Republicans are working to create a brighter, more stable future.
View the Republican Response by Speaker of the House Ron Ryckman to Kelly's State of the State speech.
Thank you,

"KSGOP transition to digital campaigning...
The Chairman's Update
Friend,
We are in unprecedented times. Our communities, state, and nation are facing challenges responding to the coronavirus. Likewise, our Republican party has adjusted to the inconveniences and difficulties caused by this virus.
Right now, our top priority at the Kansas Republican Party is to ensure the safety and well-being of all Kansans while continuing to march forward to the 2020 elections. Elections will not be detoured by the coronavirus, and therefore, our party cannot be detoured in its work to elect Republicans. In Kansas, this pandemic has illuminated the need for Republican leadership. Elections have consequences and we are seeing those consequences firsthand here in Kansas.
The stakes are very high this year, but we know that when we all come together and work towards the common goal of keeping Kansas red, we will succeed.
The Kansas Republican Party has been extremely busy so far this year.
* In January, we hosted one of the most successful state conventions in recent history, with over 1,100 attendees in Olathe.
* We were the first Republican state party in the country to successfully host virtual district conventions and we elected delegates to the 2020 Republican National Convention.
* We have been hosting multiple trainings for our grassroots activists and have continued to do so as we transition to virtual trainings that you can attend from the comfort of your own home.
We have not allowed this pandemic to slow our momentum in Kansas.
Our KSGOP staff is working remotely. If you need to contact us, you can reach KSGOP staff at [[URL REDACTED]] or you may reach out to Executive Director, Shannon Golden directly at [[URL REDACTED]]
Thank you. May God bless you and may He continue to bless our great state of Kansas.
Sincerely,
Mike Kuckelman, Chair
Kansas Republican Party
Convention Updates
The Kansas Republican Party virtually hosted our four district conventions at the beginning of this month where we elected delegates to the 2020 Republican National Convention. The conventions also bound their delegates to President Trump's re-nomination.
Congratulations to all those elected to represent Kansas at the 2020 Republican National Convention!
KSGOP leadership has not decided whether the state convention to elect at-large delegates will be hosted in-person or virtually. Continue to check your email as we will update you once a decision is made. The state convention will most likely take place at the end of May.

"The public, through our elected officials, must have a voice in protecting women from unsafe and unregulated abortions
Friend,
Today, we heard powerful testimony in committee about the dangers women in Kansas now face from unsafe and unregulated abortion due to the Kansas Supreme Court's ruling declaring that our state constitution protects the right to abortion.
While the left lines up to promote abortion on demand and even infanticide, we must return the power back to the legislative branch, to enact pro-life legislation consistent with the conservative values of our state.
The Value Them Both amendment allows the public, through our elected representatives, to regulate the abortion industry. Our tax dollars should not go towards ending innocent lives, nor should Kansas women be subjected to unsafe and unregulated abortions.
Will you support the Pro-Life Kansas Constitutional Amendment to Value Them Both?

"Stand with President Trump!
Friend,
Today, the United States Senate acquitted President Donald Trump, finally ending the Democrats' impeachment sham.
Friend, will you donate $25, $50, or $100 to turbocharge President Trump's re-election effort in Kansas?
While Democrats attempt to divide America with their partisan games, President Trump unified the nation last night with the best State of the Union address our country has ever heard.
Right after President Trump concluded his remarks, classless Nancy Pelosi ripped up her copy of President Trump's speech. A speech that illustrated the remarkable accomplishments we have seen these past three years that have created a more prosperous America.
Like President Trump said last night, the best is yet to come, but we need your help to make that happen!
Donate now [3X MATCHING] to help educate Kansans about President Trump's accomplishments ahead of the 2020 election!
Your donation will be split between Donald J. Trump for President and the Kansas Republican Party to fund the Presidential re-election effort!

"Your Kansas state house representative needs to hear from you!
Friend,
This week, the Kansas House of Representatives will be voting on the Value Them Both amendment which protects women and the unborn from limitless abortion. We need your help to make sure Kansas does not become an abortion destination.
Friend, call or email your state house representative today!
Due to the Kansas Supreme Court's barbaric ruling, Kansas may soon become a state of taxpayer-funded, dismemberment abortion. A ruling that is so sweeping, it allows for unregulated abortion, cancels out parental consent and waiting periods, and prevents the legislature from requiring health and safety clinic regulations.
We cannot allow this to happen. Please urge your state representative to protect your Kansas values and support the Value Them Both constitutional amendment.
If you don't know who your state house representative is you can look them up by your address using this handy tool!
The Value Them Both amendment protects years of pro-life, pro-woman legislation. Help us keep Kansas a state that respects the sanctity of life, call or email your state representative today.
A call or email from you today can make all the difference.

Friend,
Road trip!
We’re thrilled to announce the Keep Kansas Great Bus Tour, a five-day marathon beginning Saturday, October 3rd at Butler CC Stadium and ending Wednesday, October 7th in Mission Hills.
We'll hear from all of our Republican candidates this year - Roger Marshall, Tracey Mann, Jake LaTurner, Amanda Adkins, and Congressman Ron Estes, who want to spread the word about traditional American values and goals. Together, we hope to get people throughout Kansas excited about conservative leadership.
There are only 10 days left until we get this show on the road. We’re counting on patriots like you to help keep the gas tank full until we reach the very end of the tour. Will you chip in $25 to help us keep going?
FILL THE TANK
November is coming. There’s still time to make a difference in your local, state, and nationwide elections. Thank you for helping us put the pedal to the metal on the Keep Kansas Great Bus Tour!
Thank you,

"There is hope in this time of uncertainty…
Friend,
We are all part of history in the making right now. With the best and worst-case scenarios lined out by President Trump last week, I wanted to send an email of hope and reassurance. This may be the greatest challenge facing Kansas since the Civil War. And though it may seem that we are looking forward to doom, one day we will look back in awe. This is not an easy fight, and there will be many victories and defeats over the next few months. But we are Kansans TOGETHER. The true heart of America will beat louder and faster. We will help each other in ways big and small, and we will do better than anyone expected.
I’ve been on the frontlines combatting the COVID-19 pandemic every day, working with other doctors and researchers in Kansas and around the world. We have been making progress on the treatment, and I’ve been sharing a message of hope in various news interviews with people such as Laura Ingraham, Dr. Oz, Sean Hannity, and local celebrities Pete Mundo and Shawn Wheat to name a few. Many of you have been asking questions, so here are some answers:
Q: Is the curve flattening?
A: Yes. We knew that when more tests became available, we were going to see a rise in confirmed COVID-19 cases, but social distancing is working, and we need to do our part to stay healthy and continue to slow the spread. We likely won’t see a peak in Kansas for a few weeks.
Q: What is the best way to stay healthy?
A: Social distancing and simple hygiene go a long way. Additional methods of staying healthy include:
* avoiding large crowds and interaction with new people
* washing your hands for the recommended 20 seconds
* disinfecting your hands before touching your face or another person after touching objects in public areas
Q: Is there a way to treat COVID-19?
A: Not yet, but there may be some hope. What is most important is if you think you are sick, talk to your doctor. Work with your doctor on what the best treatment options are for you. In a short series of Wall Street Journal articles, I outline new research on treatment that centers around the use of hydroxychloroquine paired with azithromycin. It isn’t a silver bullet, but it MAY BE the best option we currently have made available to us.
Here are the two Wall Street Journal articles:
* An Update on the Coronavirus Treatment (published Mar. 29)
* These Drugs Are Helping Our Coronavirus Patients (published Mar. 22)
In February, President Trump appointed me Chair of the National Advisory Committee on Rural Health and Human Services. In this capacity, I have been advising the President’s administration on how to minimize the blow to our rural healthcare systems.
Here’s a piece of good news and Kansas ingenuity: when this pandemic first started, I brought together a team of healthcare officials in Kansas to put together a solution. I am proud to announce that more than 50 KU Med students will graduate early and be deployed to serve in areas of critical need in rural Kansas, serving as a model for the rest of the nation!
Friend, I encourage you to send your thanks to ALL of the heroes serving on the front lines of this crisis, and to continue to stay healthy and hopeful. We will get through this together.

"Stand with President Trump...
Friend,
Yesterday, Sharice Davids confirmed what we’ve known all along, that she supports the Democrats’ baseless efforts to overturn the 2016 election.
While Davids and House Democrats focus on their politically motivated, partisan witch hunt, President Trump has been delivering on promises made with the passage of the most pro-worker trade deal in history, producing over 266,000 jobs just last month, and record low unemployment rates for women, African-Americans, Hispanics, Asians, and veterans.
Friend, will you donate $25, $50, or $100 to President Trump and the Kansas Republican Party to replace Davids with a Republican who will stand with our president?
With polls showing impeachment backfiring, and the Trump economy booming, Sharice Davids will pay a price next November for placing a political hack-job over the needs and interests of hardworking Kansans.
Support President Trump

We’re down to the final lap.
With just one month to go before Election Day, we’re on the last end-of-quarter deadline, and we need your help.
SUPPORT PRESIDENT TRUMP
This is the last end-of-quarter deadline. This is our last chance to raise the funds we need to get President Trump’s message out to every American before the end of October.
We’ve got a great slate of constitutional conservatives lined up for November, spearheaded by our president. They’re out to spread a message of liberty and self-sufficiency, but it won’t do a bit of good if nobody can hear it.
SPREAD THE WORD
That’s why we need your help! Your donation before the end of the month will help get the conservative message out to every American! Can we count on you to pitch in today?
DONATE NOW
Thank you again for your patriotism, and we’re excited to enter the final lap together!

"Don't Let Them
Friend,
Senator Barbara Bollier asked her liberal friends in California and New York to send her funds because her own constituents won’t give her a penny because they see through her hollow promises.
Dems always play dirty when it comes to fundraising, but this is the worst we’ve seen yet.
Let’s show these cheating Democrats that Kansans support leaders who have earned their trust. Will you donate right now to even the odds?
DONATE
Over $2.7 million of Bollier’s total funds came from out-of-state “sources.” Those sources don’t live in Kansas, don’t work in Kansas, and don’t care about the future of Kansas families. They don’t know anything about our way of life—and we deserve a leader who does.
Friend conservative leaders are counting on us to level the playing field and show liberals what Kansans really want. Will you chip in?
DONATE
Dems will never stop trying to tip the balance in their favor, even if they have to cheat. It’s up to us to beat them.

"It's all on the line
Friend,
Last week was a significant turning point in the election when President Trump made the bold decision to release his list of Supreme Court and federal judge nominees.
Protecting our courts is one of the President’s most important accomplishments to date.
President Trump needs our support now more than ever to ensure pro-life judges take the bench.

The Democrats know what is at stake. That’s why they will do or say anything to win the White House in 2020.
DONATE TODAY TO FIGHT BACK >>
Know this.
If the Democrats win, they will nominate activist judges to advance their extreme agenda. That puts our values, our rights, our freedoms, and everything we stand for at risk.
An impartial court system? No way. The Democrats will do everything they can to prevent constitutionalists who enforce the law, not legislate from the bench, from being appointed.
Re-electing President Trump is the only way to stop them.
DONATE HERE >>
Act now. Protecting our courts is key to preserving the America we know and love

"We are under attack!
Friend,
I’ll be brief.
I just saw the most recent fundraising reports, and Democrats have committed to spending tens of millions of dollars in Kansas toward defeating our Republican ticket next week.
Right now, we don’t have the money to compete.
This is no longer a “politics as usual” situation. It’s personal.
If we don’t fully fund our digital advertising budget by the end of the week, we will not get our message in front of enough voters before Election Day.
Will you chip in right now and fund our DIGITAL DEFENSE FUND?
$10 = REACHES 20 VOTERS
$25 = REACHES 50 VOTERS
$50 = REACHES 100 VOTERS
$100 = REACHES 200 VOTERS
Out-of-state special interest groups have poured millions of dollars into Kansas to try to buy our elections. Are you going to let them?
We need all hands on deck for 7 more days. Can you donate right now?

"They can’t hide the Obama administration’s corruption any longer.
Friend,
The media can’t hide the Obama Administration’s corruption anymore.
They would have you believe that Obama ran a scandal-free Administration, but the disguise is off.
Now we know that Obama was spying on his political opponents in 2016. On their way out the door, Obama Administration officials made over fifty requests to unmask Trump aides, a very sensitive and abnormal practice. All this added to Obama recording Michael Flynn’s conversations with the Russian Ambassador and fraudulently obtaining warrants to spy on American citizens.
The truth is out—Obama spied on his fellow Americans. It’s time to call this out, and it’s time to call out the Democrats for turning a blind eye to Obamagate. We need to clean house, and we need to do it now.
It’s time for us to stand up to the Democrats’ corruption. Will you join us today and help send the Democrats packing?
STAND FOR JUSTICE >>
We have a golden opportunity to expose the Democrats for what they really are, and we need to take advantage of it. Can we count on you to stand with President Trump and add your name to the list of Patriotic Americans that demand answers?
I STAND WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP
I know you’re outraged both by Obamagate and by Democrats’ attempts to try to cover it up. Unmasking Americans for partisan ends should be unimaginable in our country, and we need to stop this NOW.
Will you join us?

First Gov. Kelly passes executive order after executive order, and now she wants to shut our state down again. Since the COVID19 pandemic began, our unemployment system in Kansas has been underwater and if enacted, this shutdown order will bring it the rest of the way down.
You can help keep unemployment from hitting rock bottom in Kansas.
DONATE TODAY
With your help we can elect strong common-sense leaders who understand the needs of our economy. It’s time to put an end to politicians who continually take shots at our economy, without even attempting to fix the problems that they’ve created.
It’s time to elect leaders who will fight for our economy, not destroy it.
DONATE NOW
Together we can see a prosperous Kansas, but we can’t do it without your help.

"Sign your name and show the state of Kansas we won’t stand for radicals taking over our public spaces
Friend,
Radical protestors want to create dangerous “cop-free” zones right here in Kansas, creating lawless spaces in our communities and putting our families at risk.
We cannot allow this to happen.
It’s up to true and patriotic Kansans to take a stand and demand action be taken against these so-called “autonomous” zones. This isn’t about petty politics, this is about protecting law and order and preserving the peace our families deserve.
Friend,  sign your name to keep “cop-free” zones out of Kansas.
SIGN THE PETITION
When we allow radical protestors to take control of spaces, we open the door to rampant crime, violence without consequences, and a lasting suffering our community didn’t ask for.
Will you take a stand for your neighbor? Will you throw your name behind a safer Kansas?
Join the growing number of concerned Kansans just like you and keep “cop-free” zones out of our state.

"Kansas is suffering, and Governor Kelly is to blame.
Friend,
Governor Kelly has lead our state into economic ruin.
Right now, our state is the slowest when it comes to unemployment recovery and it is all thanks to Laura Kelly's disastrous response. We need a leader who won’t keep harming Kansas.
Donate today to elect strong conservative leaders like President Trump who will revive our economy again.
DONATE TODAY
Kansas wasn’t even one of the worst-hit states with COVID, yet we are suffering even more than most.
Kelly's slow response, burdensome shutdowns, and weak economic performance pre-COVID led to this poor ranking. On top of that, Governor Kelly has dragged her feet on following President Trump's executive orders meant to help Kansans who are hurting.
This is not acceptable. By donating today, you can help bring change to Kansas.
DONATE FOR CHANGE
What we need are strong Republican candidates who are committed to a sound and successful COVID-19 recovery. It’s time to bring change to our community and help our neighbors get back to work.
Donate today and help Kansas conservatives win in November to bring strong leadership into all three branches of the Kansas government.
FIGHT FOR CONSERVATIVE LEADERSHIP

"The CIA wiretapped Trump
Friend,
James Comey testified today before the Senate Judiciary Committee and refused to provide answers regarding the FBI falsifying evidence and illegally wiretapping the Trump campaign.
Senator Hawley is right - this was criminal. We need to send a message to the corrupt Democrats in Washington that we won't tolerate this.
SEND A MESSAGE TO THE SWAMP
The scandal should outrage every American. The FBI conducted a politically motivated wiretap on a presidential candidate for the purpose of influencing the outcome of the election. They continued their illegal activity to try and undermine President Trump after he won. They railroaded General Flynn. And then they lied to the American people with a years-long coverup.
We’re sick of the corruption, and we know you are too. It’s time to put real leaders like President Trump in charge, take back the House from Pelosi, and DRAIN THE SWAMP.
STOP THE CORRUPTION
We HAVE TO change the culture in Washington.
Are you going to step up to the plate?
We need to elect candidates in November who will stand up for the rule of law and hold these bad actors accountable.

Friend,
IT’S OFFICIAL. President Trump has chosen Judge Amy Coney Barrett to fill Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s vacant Supreme Court seat.
This is a BIG DEAL for our conservative values. With a majority on the Supreme Court, we can finally roll back the failed liberal policies from the Obama/Biden era.
The Democrats are FURIOUS with Trump for exercising his constitutionally guaranteed right as President, but they’re really taking their irrational anger out on our Republican Senators for pledging to hold a vote.
They already raised over $100M LAST WEEK – at a rate of over $100,000 per minute - to try and upend our Republican-held Senate majority in November.
Are you going to let them?
DONATE NOW
Judge Amy Coney Barrett is the perfect choice for Supreme Court Justice. She has proven experience, conservative values, and will uphold her oath to interpret the Constitution fairly and justly.
Now, it’s up to our Republican Senators to FILL THE SEAT and not be intimidated by the Democrats war chest.
We have to fight back.
Can I count on you to combat the Democrats' growing fundraising advantage?

Over the weekend, the Liberal Mob didn’t waste any time declaring they would shut the country down rather than allow President Trump his constitutional right to nominate the next Justice of the Supreme Court. They showed the country how radical they’ve become.
The Senate Majority is at stake and this will be a confirmation battle, unlike anything we’ve ever seen.
Over the past few days, Democrats raised millions to gear up for this battle – we have to fight back IMMEDIATELY. At one point, they were raising $100,000 a minute.
FIGHT BACK
The future of our country is on the line. We’re talking about the right to life. We’re talking about our God-given right to defend ourselves and our families. We’re talking about the very things that make us American.

The debate in the race for U.S. Senate just wrapped I am more confident than ever in our chances of achieving victory in November.

We’re thrilled to announce the Keep Kansas Great Bus Tour, a five-day marathon beginning Saturday, October 3rd at Butler CC Stadium and ending Wednesday, October 7th in Mission Hills.
We'll hear from all of our Republican candidates this year - Roger Marshall, Tracey Mann, Jake LaTurner, Amanda Adkins, and Congressman Ron Estes, who want to spread the word about traditional American values and goals. Together, we hope to get people throughout Kansas excited about conservative leadership.
There are only 10 days left until we get this show on the road. We’re counting on patriots like you to help keep the gas tank full until we reach the very end of the tour. Will you chip in $25 to help us keep going?
FILL THE TANK
November is coming. There’s still time to make a difference in your local, state, and nationwide elections. Thank you for helping us put the pedal to the metal on the Keep Kansas Great Bus Tour!
Thank you,

"Thanks to President Trump and our strong Republican candidates
Friend,
Last night the Republicans shined a spotlight on America’s courageous heroes.
They also recounted the battle for American women to be granted the right to vote and our brave men and women who fight for our freedom overseas.

Keep America the land of heroes. Our Republican candidates need your help! Donate now and help our Republican candidates win big this November.
DONATE NOW
Republicans are excited about our country’s future because they know America is the land full of heroes. We are on the road to recovery, and our Republican candidates will get us there.
Now, more than ever, we must support our Republican candidates running for Congress and protect our majority in the Senate. But we can’t do it without your support!
With your support, we can work together to get our Republican candidates over the finish line and get Kansas back on track.

"Take a stand against Dems interference
Friend,
The Democrats are up to their dirty tricks once again. Doing all they can to manipulate another Republican primary.
Kansas Democrats are hiding behind Super PACs and Chuck Schumer to do the dirty work for them. Schumer has opened up the playbook that helped get Claire McCaskill elected for one term.
We won’t stand for this.
PROTECT KANSAS
These dark money PACs have one goal in mind: stoke the flames of division.
I’m not falling for their dirty tricks, and neither should you, Friend

"What Is Biden Hiding?
Friend,
Big Tech in Silicon Valley is protecting Joe Biden from a massive scandal.
In the last 48 hours, Facebook and Twitter have silenced the truth. They've been censoring a bombshell report by the New York Post on leaked emails by Hunter Biden’s showing he arranged a meeting between Joe Biden and an executive from Burisma, the Ukrainian oil and gas company that was paying Hunter $50,000 a month for access.
The Trump campaign's account was locked. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany's account was locked. The New York Post's account was locked.
This is ELECTION INTERFERENCE.
Will you help us fight back?
FIGHT BACK
The stakes have never been higher. Big Tech is putting their thumbs on the scale for Joe Biden. We can't let this stand.
Will you donate to our digital defense budget RIGHT NOW and stand up for our right to free speech?
Our Founding Fathers warned us about this,  Friend, – now is not the time to stand on the sidelines.

"Tell Republicans to support Barrett
Friend,
We can’t wait for weeks or months to choose a new Supreme Court Justice. We must fill the seat.
The Democrats will do anything they can to stop President Trump and the Senate from confirming Amy Coney Barrett. They’ve threatened to try and pack the court and have even threatened to try and impeach the president again.
Are you tired of their temper tantrums yet?
We must fill the seat as quickly as possible so we can have a balanced and fair court to review cases – and that starts with supporting Republican candidates so we push this forward.
Will you sign our petition to show them we stand with them?
SIGN THE PETITION
Now is the time to put a conservative voice on the Supreme Court. Amy Coney Barrett will protect our conservative values and defend our God-given rights.
Sign your name on the petition today to show our Kansas delegation like Senators Pat Roberts and Jerry Moran that we’re behind them.

"Friend,
I know you weren’t watching Biden’s townhall last night, but he essentially said that if he wins the election, and if Amy Coney Barrett is confirmed, he would take action to expand the Supreme Court. Instead of following the rules of our constitution, he and Kamala would take matters into their own hands.
Our democracy does not need Biden appointing activist judges to push his radical agenda. Donate today to help us shut him down.
DONATE TODAY
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have shown a complete and utter lack of respect for our democracy. They do not know how to govern and will only kowtow to the radicals and their socialist agenda. We CANNOT let Biden and Harris tear down our country.
Stand up to Biden and Kamala’s radical agenda by donating today.
DONATE HERE
Our way of life as we know it is under attack and the radical left will not relent until it’s unrecognizable. Please donate today to protect our great nation from radicals.

There’s plenty more to look forward to on the Keep Kansas Great Bus Tour with a slate of great speakers like Dr. Roger Marshall, Tracy Mann, Attorney General Derek Schmidt, former Governor Jeff Colyer, and others.

"Onward to November
Friend,
I just got a final briefing from my team and I wanted to send you a quick note.
Let me just say: I am so proud to be a Republican tonight. All of our candidates up and down the ballot fought hard for the chance to represent our conservative values in their respective races all across Kansas.
On top of that, I’m proud of patriots like you who made your voices heard and didn’t waver on casting a vote in the face of adversity.
With all of the Democrats' misinformation and outside spending over the past few weeks, all of it proved to be no match for our Party! We stood strong, we stood proud, and we stood together.
Now is the time to come together as one to win in November, especially as we support Roger Marshall in the race for U.S. Senate, and re-elect President Trump.
If you thought the attacks from the radical left were bad during the primary, it’s only going to get worse.
Will you contribute RIGHT NOW and help build our war chest for November?
DONATE NOW >>
I look forward to hearing from you.
Onward!

"It’s time to return the favor and protect the police from radicals who would defund them
Friend,
As a daughter of a police officer, it's extremely concerning that the future of our law enforcement officers is in danger this November. Radical liberals are calling on politicians to defund law enforcement agencies across the nation. If unopposed, their anti-law enforcement mentality will cause chaos on our nations’ streets and across our neighborhoods.
Now more than ever we need YOUR help. Will you donate to support candidates who back the blue?
DONATE NOW
Without law enforcement officers, America will descend into anarchy but with Democrats fired up and electing more radical liberals the fight is ramping up. This November, we need to send a strong, clear message to radicals and anti-cop politicians. But we need your help.
While the left is calling to defund and demonize the police, they will still call them when danger approaches and if they need help. Without the police, who would they call when they need help or are in danger? This glaring hypocrisy is sowing the seeds of anarchy and violence throughout the nation.
With your help, we can support strong, common sense Republicans who will fight to ensure those that protect us are funded and supported.
Will you donate $5, $10, $20 or more to help us elect strong pro-police Republicans to office?
DONATE NOW

Friend,
After four years of relentless attacks from Democrats and the fake news media, tonight is time for President Trump to prove that he is STILL the right choice for America.
Somehow, the left thinks that Sleepy Joe has what it takes to lead the country, but after this first debate is over, they’ll have to face the facts.
Joe Biden is in WAY over his head. If we band together as Patriots and give $20.20 right now, that message will be made LOUD AND CLEAR.

The left thinks they have this in the bag, but they have no idea what they are up against. We have a responsibility to protect our families and future generations form the destruction that comes with radical policies. That’s why we need all hands on deck TODAY.
Will you donate $20.20 right now?
President Trump has spent four years fighting for us and protecting what makes our nation great. Now it’s OUR TURN to prove that we are in his corner and fighting just like he’s fought for us.

"President Trump just won the debate!
Friend,
President Trump just gave us a glimpse into what he’s done to Make America Great Again over the last 4 years. He’s fought to protect the unborn, put more money in our families’ pockets, and appointed 3 JUDGES to the U.S. Supreme Court.
If you watched the debate, you saw that Sleepy Joe is in WAY over his head. It’s clear he’s looking to continue the Obama-era policies that tanked our economy and damaged our healthcare system.
If we want to continue winning, we need to show up right now and let President Trump know we are behind him 100%!
CHIP IN $10 >>
Sleepy Joe had plenty of opportunities in the debate to prove he’s the right choice for President, and he failed. Do you really want 4 YEARS of that? We have come too far to let Sleepy Joe win in November and dismantle all of the progress that has been gained under President Trump’s leadership.
If you want to keep WINNING, donate $5, $10 or whatever you can RIGHT NOW.
The future of our country depends on Patriots like you!
DONATE TODAY!
Thank you for your support.

"President Trump has what it takes to strengthen our economy, but he needs your support.
Friend,
President Trump created the strongest economy in American history before this pandemic struck, and now he's done it again.
Did you see today's big news? Our economy grew by more than 33% in the third quarter. That's more than double the previous all-time high!
The job isn't done yet, but President Trump has put our nation back on a path to success much sooner than anyone expected. Will you donate today to ensure he has four more years to finish the job?
FOUR MORE YEARS
We can’t let Joe Biden and Kamala Harris ruin all of President Trump’s hard work. We need a businessman who will make commonsense decisions that work for American workers and American families.
We need a President who will put AMERICA FIRST.
Will you help President Trump keep fighting for our economy by donating now?

"Friend,
We deserve to know the truth about Hunter Biden’s emails.
The Director of National Intelligence and the FBI have a federal investigation underway. Big Tech is running interference for the Bidens by censoring the story out of your newsfeed.
President Trump has vowed to question Sleepy Joe on Hunter’s emails during the debate on Thursday night.
We deserve answers.
Will you join Trump’s Truth Squad Team?
DEMAND ANSWERS – SIGN THE PETITION NOW
Joe Biden claims that he had no knowledge of Hunter Biden's business dealings, but the evidence is plain as the eye can see in the emails, recently released by the New York Post. The emails show payments from a Chinese investment firm promised to “The Big Guy,” a.k.a. Joe Biden.
Joe Biden must be held accountable for this corruption. The American people need and deserve to know the truth! We know the media won't give it to us.
Sign your name today to demand these questions be answered. By signing your name now, you will send a clear message to President Trump that we have his back and want to know the truth.
SUPPORT PRESIDENT TRUMP – DEMAND ANSWERS NOW

We’re down to the wire and the left isn’t backing down. Outside special interest groups are doing everything they can to turn Kansas blue. They’ve already raised a record-smashing $24M for Barbara Bollier in the U.S. Senate race.
Barbara Bollier has 90% of her contributors from the coasts buying their influence in Kansas, but that’s no defense against our army of grassroots patriots like you.

"The Writing is On the Wallfor Biden & Harris
Friend,
Joe Biden just announced his controversial VP pick and running mate: Kamala Harris.
Yes, that Kamala Harris—the senator who failed to win the Democratic nomination. The Attorney General who built her career by sending innocent people to jail and kowtowing to the radical left. The far-left politician who won’t hesitate to bring her extreme political agenda to the White House—if we give her the chance.
Dems think they have our backs against the wall, but this fight is far from over.
Will you donate and help mount a strong defense against this radical left threat?
DONATE
Both Sleepy Joe and Harris’ records are covered with red marks that can’t be erased, no matter how progressive they pretend to be. As a Senator, Biden authored and supported crime bills that disproportionately targeted black Americans. Now he wants us to believe he’s a changed man?
Biden might fool his Leftist friends, but he can’t fool us. We won’t let him write his name on America’s history. Can we count on your help?
COUNT ME IN

Friend,
Did you see the email below from Shannon?
Our records indicate your Sustaining Membership is still inactive.
Please, reactivate your official membership card with your contribution to our Kansas Republican Party for $20.20 or more.
Every day is critical for our Kansas Republican Party. Your sustaining membership helps fund the following critical activities:
* Assist Republican campaign's transition to digital campaigning during the coronavirus pandemic.
* Increase the number of pro-GOP voters by reaching out to Independents.
* Recruit top-notch candidates to run against the most vulnerable Democrat officeholders.
* Conduct campaign training classes for candidates, their staff, and grassroots activists across the state.
* Organize election-period get-out-the-vote programs.
Our Kansas Republican Party is spreading the powerful message that Republican policies work.
Official Kansas Republican Party sustaining members provide the Kansas Republican Team with the critical funds we use to elect Republicans who will stand with President Trump and Make America Great Again!
We can't take our foot off the gas. Democrats are advocating for socialist policies that would be laughable if they weren’t so serious and dangerous.
* They want to open the border and issue blanket amnesty to illegals
* They want Big Government Washington to run health care.
* They want to enact the disastrous Green New Deal and raise taxes
* They want to delay critical aid to small businesses to get their special interest ""pork projects.""
* They are using this crisis to further their own agenda. We need to support Republican candidates who will defend our small businesses and American Jobs.
Those ideas aren't just far-fetched; they're un-American and dangerous.
So please, reactivate your 2020 Kansas Republican Party sustaining membership card, with a donation of $20.20 or more.

Friend,
The first night of the Republican National Convention proved to us that our country is headed in the right direction, as long as we have strong Republican leaders guiding the way.
On the second night, we were reminded about what it means to achieve the American Dream, and how President Trump has worked hard to build positive relationships with countries overseas.
Finally, on the third night, light was shone on America’s brave men and women who put their lives on the line for us every day. We gave thanks to our first responders, soldiers, and law enforcement who fight to keep our families safe.
Will you donate today to keep proud Republican leaders in office?
SUPPORT PRESIDENT TRUMP
The Republican National Convention made it clear that President Trump has accomplished so much more in the past four years than the Democrats would ever give him credit for.
Contrary to the doom-and-gloom attitudes of the Democrats, the Republican party is focused on celebrating our wins and continuing on the path of the Great American Comeback.
The future of America depends on us, President Trump’s loyal patriots.
CONTINUE AMERICAN GREATNESS
While the Democrats are busy pointing fingers and trying to drag his name through the dirt, President Trump is rising to the occasion and making things happen for America.
Can we count on you to help us keep the American Dream alive?

"The democrats are at it again and are suggesting policies which are putting the safety of our community at risk.
Friend,
The radical Democrats are at it once again. They’re clamoring to defund our police, sowing chaos throughout our community. This November we need to elect strong Republicans who will defend our community, protect law enforcement officers and prioritize the safety of our great nation.
Sign the petition and show your support for the Kansas Republican Party fighting to protect our future!
SIGN HERE
In 2016, the Democrats, led by Barack Obama and Joe Biden, attempted to close Guantanamo Bay and send all their un-releasable detainees to Kansas. This is a reckless policy which would endanger the safety of our country, and our state.
Make your voice heard and support strong Republican candidates who prioritize the safety and security of our nation.
SIGN THE PETITION
This November, Kansans need to show up and show out for strong Republican candidates that put law and order, and defense of our great nation above the agenda of radical Democrats. However, without YOUR help we cannot do it. Make your voice heard and help send a clear message to Democrats this November that YOU support candidates who prioritize Americans safety. Sign up now!

Tonight, President Trump takes the debate stage for his LAST CHANCE to square off with Sleepy Joe before the election.
To mark the occasion, we are activating TRIPLE-MATCH until midnight tomorrow. That’s TRIPLE the impact.
We’re quickly running out of time to prove just how strong and unwavering President Trump’s Patriots really are. This is our chance to show him once and for all that Kansas is TRUMP COUNTRY.
TRIPLE MY DONATION
Friend, you know the fake news liberal media is going to come out swinging for President Trump tomorrow night in another rigged, biased, unfair debate.
We are TRIPLE-MATCHING donations until midnight to show him that WE WANT FOUR MORE YEARS.
DONATE $5 = $15
DONATE $10 = $30
DONATE $25 = $75
DONATE $50 = $150
DONATE $100 = $300
During the last debate, President Trump proved to America that he will continue to tirelessly fight for us in a no-nonsense, honest, and powerful way. He will always stand up for our shared values, so it’s time to stand up for him.

"The Democrats are trying to avoid the debates
Friend,
Biden’s allies are floating the idea of not having any presidential debates. We knew this would happen.
They know Biden won't stand a chance against President Trump and they're going to make up any excuse to prevent the American people from seeing how clear it is President Trump is the ONLY choice to keep America great.
SUPPORT PRESIDENT TRUMP
Nancy Pelosi says that Joe Biden shouldn’t “legitimize” President Trump by debating him. No surprise, Pelosi, Schiff, and the liberals in Washington have been denying the legitimacy of President Trump since Day One.
The fact is, they're scared because President Trump is the only one on that debate stage who will tell it like it is. He will call out Biden for failing to condemn radical left-wing rioters and cowtowing to the socialists in the Democrat Party (aka the mainstream according to Bernie Sanders).
Join us today to keep strong conservatives who put America First like President Trump in office. Donate to fight for leaders that will confront our most challenging problems.
FIGHT FOR AMERICA FIRST
From floating the idea of not having debates to the lack of willingness to visit Kenosha, Joe Biden has proven that he would rather hide than engage President Trump on the issues.
By donating today, you can elect sound conservatives that are committed to solving issues head-on, not from a basement on the other side of the country.
HELP ELECT COMMITTED LEADERS
Together we can fight for the future of our great nation. We can help elect strong leaders that will stand for us no matter what.
We look forward to your help, and we can’t wait to fight with you.

"Statement from the Kansas Republican Party...
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
April 6, 2019
GOVERNOR KELLY'S EXECUTIVE ORDER CRIMINALIZING RELIGIOUS GATHERINGS
TOPEKA- The Kansas Republican Party’s Chairman, Mike Kuckelman and Executive Director, Shannon Golden today issued the following statements on Governor Laura Kelly’s executive order prohibiting church services.
""We must do what we can to protect one another’s well-being, but an executive order that blatantly violates the United States and Kansas constitutions is not the answer,"" Kansas Republican Party Chairman, Mike Kuckelman said. ""We urge everyone to follow the recommendations of President Trump and the CDC.""
""Governor Kelly’s executive order prohibiting churches from holding services is not only disproportionate, but it is unconstitutional,"" Kansas Republican Party Executive Director, Shannon Golden said. ""Most Kansas churches have been cooperating with suggested guidelines to slow the spread of the Coronavirus, yet Governor Kelly still insists on giving in to her authoritarian impulses.""

Friend,
Will you be watching President Trump tonight in his townhall on NBC?
The election is only 19 days away and we need to stand up as a unified front. The media doesn't want to report on our enthusiasm, but they won't be able to ignore it if we give the President a major ratings boost tonight!
SUPPORT PRESIDENT TRUMP
The very fabric of our nation is at stake this November.
President Trump has a plan to see our families prosper and thrive, but if strong Republicans like you don't show up to vote in November, we can lose it all. The Democrats are trying to steal this election, we can’t stand for this.
By donating now, you can help make a difference in this election.
SUPPORT PRESIDENT TRUMP
Money is pouring in to support Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, they’re trying to buy this election. Instead of providing solutions and results for our families, they’re resorting to the same tactics they always use. Just how they were defeated 4 years ago, we can defeat them again. But President Trump needs YOUR support to ensure OUR families win.
Donate today to show President Trump you support his work!
SUPPORT PRESIDENT TRUMP
The left is ruthless in their campaigning against President Trump and the work he has done for American families.

"It only took one day for our leaders to showcase why republican ideals outshine the democrats’ broken agenda.
Friend,
It was clear to see after the first night of the Republican National Convention that our country is headed in the right direction.
President Donald Trump, Congressman Jim Jordan, and other Republican leaders were quick to remind us that America is the land of opportunity, the home of the brave, and the epicenter of personal liberty.
Now, compare that to the doom-and-gloom attitudes of the Democrats. Does that sound like the America you know? Does that sound like the free and prosperous country President Trump has led these last four years?
We need to keep proud and uplifting Republicans in office. The future of American opportunity depends on it.
DEFEND FREEDOM
Last night, Congressman Jim Jordan listed the many accomplishments of President Trump’s administration the Democrats are too proud to acknowledge. Former Governor Nikki Haley reminded us that the United States’ standing in the world is stronger than ever before. Senator Tim Scott inspired us by echoing our shared belief that America is the bastion of opportunity and promise.
Democrats would rather America fail than admit they are wrong about President Trump. Just think of the stern warning issued by Cuban immigrant Maximo Alvarez who understands personally the dire threat socialism brings to our country. If the Democrats win, it will not end well for our people or our government.
Future Americans will look back at this election and know Republicans were the party who stood for freedom.
PROTECT OPPORTUNITY
This election is the choice between two opposites. If America elects Joe Biden and the Democrats, we will become a country beholden to its government. But if we stand strong and keep proud Republican leaders in office, we will have restored faith in individual liberty, family values, and the strength of local communities working together to keep our country great.
Donate today and help us preserve America as the land of opportunity for each and every one of us.

"Excitement is off the charts on the first day of the RNC.
Friend,
Energy was high at the RNC this morning as the crowd cheered “Four more years! Four more years!” And this is just Day One of the convention—there are still four more days of excitement, optimism, and patriotism to go. It’s clear that America is excited about President Trump’s next term.
In contrast, the DNC was an embarrassing four-day snooze-fest that left even liberals feeling apathetic. True to his name, Sleepy Joe and his friends droned on and on about the “failures” of President Trump’s administration without ever discussing the future—or why they deserve voters’ trust.
This is the kind of low energy a Biden presidency will bring to the White House. Doesn’t America deserve a leader—and a future—we can be excited about? Help keep the momentum going by donating today.
DONATE
When President Trump ran in 2016, he made promises that he kept. Four years later, we’ve seen record employment, more minority homeowners than ever before, and a financially healthy middle class. But the president’s work isn’t done yet — that’s why everyone is cheering for another term.
Democrats want you to vote for Sleepy Joe because he’s “not Trump.” But what has Biden promised: a vulnerable America without protection from police, and higher taxes to make the radical left’s wish list happen.
No one is excited about Biden because Biden isn’t excited about America. President Trump sees a future where our country is safe, prosperous, and great. Help cheer on our president and everyone at the RNC!

We’re down to the wire, and the left isn’t backing down. Outside special interest groups are doing everything they can to turn Kansas blue. They’ve already raised a record-smashing $24M for Barbara Bollier in the U.S. Senate race.
Barbara Bollier has 90% of her contributors from the coasts buying their influence in Kansas, but that’s no defense against our army of grassroots patriots like you.
Friend, I know you’re getting tired of hearing from me. But if every person on our e-mail list gave just $5 right now, we would have the funds to WIN.
Can you help?

This should be an immediate call to action to ALL Conservatives who are still in this fight to protect President Trump and STOP a Liberal takeover by the Dark Money Democrats.
Today is our last chance to make sure that does not happen, but I cannot do this without your support.
I’m authorizing a 400% match to QUADRUPLE YOUR IMPACT. It expires at midnight, so I can’t stress how important it is to have your support right now.

"It was a low-energy day at the Democrat National Convention.
Friend,
The first day of the Democrat National Convention fell flat. It’s obvious that there is no excitement on the Left for Joe Biden.
If they truly believed in their presidential nominee, those speaking would have shown why Joe is the right candidate. Instead, the speakers gave boring, rambling speeches that offered nothing.
It’s clear: Our passionate, conservative leaders and their supportive Republican party have the upper hand. Can you help keep the momentum going by donating today?
MAINTAIN THE MOMENTUM
Last night, there was no clear vision or sound policies that proved that Joe Biden would even remotely qualify to be president. Their reasoning was plain and simple: Vote for Joe because he is not a Republican and he is not Donald Trump.
They’re going to have to do better than that to even attempt to convince us to give up the fight. We can’t stop pushing now. We have the energy and the drive to keep fighting for a win!
With your donation, we can keep up the momentum to elect leaders with sound policies. Will you donate today to keep our energy alive?
DONATE TODAY
A weak endorsement from Governor Kasich and a low-energy speech from Bernie Sanders will not be enough to push Joe Biden ahead of our president. We can keep the energy high with your help.
Let’s work together to build up even more momentum for President Trump. Are you with us? Will you donate today to support the president who has been there for us throughout the past four years?
SUPPORT PRESIDENT TRUMP
We have the excitement. We have the energy. We have the drive. Donate today to help maintain this momentum!
Thank you,

"[[URL REDACTED]] Keep Kansas Great Bus Tour! We’re hitting the road to paint the town RED ahead of the 2020 elections.
Friend,
Road trip!
We’re thrilled to announce the Keep Kansas Great Bus Tour, a five-day marathon beginning Saturday, October 3rd at Butler CC Stadium and ending Wednesday, October 7th in Mission Hills.
We'll hear from all of our Republican candidates this year - Roger Marshall, Tracey Mann, Jake LaTurner, Amanda Adkins, and Congressman Ron Estes, who want to spread the word about traditional American values and goals. Together, we hope to get people throughout Kansas excited about conservative leadership.
There are only 10 days left until we get this show on the road. We’re counting on patriots like you to help keep the gas tank full until we reach the very end of the tour. Will you chip in $25 to help us keep going?

"Alex,
Did you know we are only 50 days away from the most important election of our lifetimes? We have just under two months to campaign for Kansas Democrats up and down the ballot. In commemoration of this 50 days mark, I am personally asking you, Alex, to join our Blue Kansas Club today.
Just five weeks into our BKC drive, Road to Victory 2020, I am proud to say we are halfway to our ambitious goal! When you sign up for the Blue Kansas Club, you will be joining a network of dedicated small dollar donors supporting our 2020 Coordinated Campaign to flip Kansas blue on November 3, 2020.
Plus, as a member of our BKC, you'll receive exclusive benefits such as entrance to KDP events (like our Demofest Welcome Reception, information below!), fewer fundraising emails and discount codes for official KDP gear!
This election will determine the future of our country and our state. KDP's 2020 voter contact program continues to build on our momentum from 2016 and 2018, but we can't do it without your support. Can you help us win in November by chipping in $10 a month, or whatever you can afford, to join our BKC team?

The COVID-19 outbreak is requiring Americans to alter almost everything about our daily life -- and this extends to the Kansas Democratic Party as well. That’s why we’ve decided to stop holding all in-person events, including phone banks, canvasses, fundraising events and trainings until further notice.
However, Democrats cannot afford to sit back during 2020 -- we will continue to run a robust voter contact program to help our candidates up and down the ballot. Canceling all of our fundraising events makes meeting our budget tough, but we are still committed to getting our message out there to elect Democrats come November. That’s why we are turning to our best supporters for help.
Today marks the first day of spring and the beginning of our Blue Kansas Club campaign. The KDP has set an ambitious goal of adding 100 new team members to our Blue Kansas Club over the next six weeks, but I know we can achieve this goal with your help. With a monthly small dollar donation that helps fund our 2020 coordinated campaign, joining our BKC team is the best way to support our mission to flip Kansas blue.

My name is Hannah Marcus and I am the 2020 Coordinated Campaign Director at the Kansas Democratic Party. All eyes are on Kansas this year, and I couldn’t be more excited to be a part of the grassroots effort to finally flip Kansas blue in 2020.
We have 84 days to make history by defeating Donald Trump, sending Barbara Bollier to the U.S. Senate, and electing Democrats up and down the ballot. But it's going to take every single one of us doing all we can between now and November 3rd to get the job done.

The Republican State Leadership Committee just announced they are targeting 14 Kansas House Districts in 2020 to strengthen their GOP supermajority ahead of legislative redistricting.
We won’t sugarcoat it - this news is alarming. If last week’s shenanigans in the Kansas Legislature proved anything, it’s that we cannot let Republicans gerrymander new, advantageous districts and push their dangerous, anti-healthcare agenda for the next two years.
While Republicans may have their eyes set on flipping Kansas Districts, we have something more powerful: a grassroots organization that is built by and working for hardworking Kansans.
We know that if we can get our message out to Kansas voters, we will win! Can you chip in $20, $35, $50, or whatever you can, to make sure we have the resources needed to stop the RSLC and elect Democrats up and down the ballot?
In 2016, we flipped more legislative seats than almost every other state. In 2018, we made history by electing Governor Laura Kelly and Representative Sharice Davids.
Donate today to stand up to the RSLC and elect Democrats who will advocate for hardworking Kansans in 2020.
Onward,

Tonight, Joe Biden will accept the Democratic Nomination for president and it is time for Kansas Democrats to rally behind him!
We know Joe is ready to make waves in November. Just last week he announced his historic choice for vice president, Kamala Harris. In Kansas, we are making history too. For the first time, the Kansas Democratic Party welcomed an all female federal slate of candidates and we couldn't be more thrilled.
Now it is time for you to be part of this historic blue wave. Join us by tuning in to the convention, volunteering at a phone bank, and making a donation. Over the next three months, we need to do everything we can to ensure those in Washington D.C. fight for working Kansans.
Will you support these historic firsts by making a donation to the KDP's 2020 Coordinated Campaign and power our efforts to turn Kansas blue?

This morning marked the end of the 2020 legislative session in Kansas. There was a lot on the line, including a bipartisan Medicaid expansion bill that would have benefited up to 150,000 of Kansas’s most vulnerable residents.
Yesterday, amidst an unprecedented global pandemic, the following 26 GOP Senators voted against expanding Medicaid in 2020:
So, what’s the silver lining? Every Senator listed above will be on the ballot this year, and each will have to answer why they refused to expand Kansans’ access to healthcare during a global health crisis.
We believe healthcare is a human right, and we’re dedicated to electing Democrats up and down the ballot in Kansas who will fight for our access to affordable, lifesaving services during and beyond COVID-19. Healthcare will be on the ballot in 2020 - can you chip in $20, $35, or $50 to elect representatives who will protect our healthcare this election year?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
We know Kansas Democrats will show up on November 3rd to elect pro-healthcare candidates - donate today to make sure they win.

Amidst the worst public health crisis in decades, Donald Trump just halted all funding to the World Health Organization.
For months, Trump ignored warnings, downplayed the severity of this crisis, and failed to prepare the United States for the COVID-19 pandemic -- all allowing the coronavirus to spread rapidly and undetected. Trump wasted crucial time that could have been spent ramping up testing and purchasing lifesaving medical supplies, and now we’re seeing the consequences.
Donald Trump continues to jeopardize public health and safety with his reckless, incompetent decision making. As November 3, 2020 approaches, the stakes couldn’t be higher. If you agree, can you contribute $20, $35, or $50 to defeating Donald Trump in 2020?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Donald Trump has tried to blame Governors, healthcare workers and hospitals and previous administrations for his chaotic and unprepared response to the COVID-19 pandemic, but the writing is on the wall: the COVID-19 crisis is worse because of Trump.
We must elect Donald Trump out of office in 2020, but we need all the help and resources we can get to be successful. Donate today to help us put a Democrat into the White House come November.

Charles Koch. Sheldon Adelson. They're just two of the huge megadonors the GOP has literally returned the favor to with mammoth tax cuts for the ultra-rich.
And since we sent you this petition, they're who we've learned Mike Pompeo has been chatting with as well. After all, they're who Pompeo has consistently put ahead of working Kansans – in Congress, now, and going forward, whether or not he runs for the U.S. Senate.
We already have far too many politicians who put the richest campaign contributors ahead of working families. It's time for a senator who'll actually represent everyday Kansans in Washington.

Right-wing Republicans just unveiled their plan to eliminate abortion rights under the state constitution – and they're moving fast. They're attempting over just the next two weeks to get two-thirds of lawmakers in both the Kansas Senate and House to approve S.C.R. 1613 and H.C.R. 5019.
If they're successful, a statewide vote to overturn the state constitution's right to an abortion will go forward.
But here's the catch: Republicans are trying to sneak their scheme through with a vote in the low-turnout state primary election on August 4, not in the November election. That's on purpose – Republican leaders are outright saying they're timing the vote for what they think is the best opportunity to get the amendment passed.
Republicans have done similarly outrageous actions in other states like Georgia and Alabama – and now it's come home to Kansas.
Now's the time to act: Find your lawmakers' phone numbers at [[URL REDACTED]] and demand they oppose S.C.R. 1613 and H.C.R. 5019!

Republicans have started a ticking timebomb set to go off this upcoming year.
Since the Affordable Care Act became law nearly 10 years ago, Kansas Republicans have fanatically tried to rip health care away from the millions of Americans the law's insured and eliminate pre-existing condition protections for everyone else. But they failed – over and over.
Now, on any day in the coming months, a GOP lawsuit seeking to declare the whole law unconstitutional could finally pull off what they failed to do themselves – repeal the ACA.
Kansas Republicans have proven repeatedly that they couldn't care less about what Kansans – and many times an overwhelming majority of the state – do and don't want them to do. The 2020 election is our opportunity to elect leaders who'll finally put the people of Kansas first. Click here to chip in toward our 2020 Grassroots Campaign!

Yesterday, we emailed you about Republican Kansas Senate President Susan Wagle's political power play to withhold Medicaid expansion for up to 150,000 hardworking Kansans. Since sending that email, Sen. Wagle’s self-motivated political intentions have become even clearer...
From KMBC: “In the spring of 2018… Susan Wagle wanted to leave Kansas politics. She was angling for a job as an ambassador in the Trump administration.”
Yes, you read that right -- Sen. Wagle was ready to ""transition out of Kansas"" altogether in 2018, and now she’s holding up Medicaid expansion that would reduce prescription drug prices and improve access to affordable healthcare services for thousands of families? This just isn’t right.
We need to elect people who are dedicated to improving the lives of hardworking Kansans; people who will keep fighting for us -- especially when the going gets tough. Can you help us achieve this mission by chipping in $20, $35, or $50 to our 2020 Grassroots Campaign?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Let's send a message to Sen. Wagle together: it’s time to start putting Kansans first. Donate today to keep up the fight for everyday Kansans across the state.

Over the last several months, we have built the most robust voter contact campaign in KDP history, but we only have five days left to ensure we elect Democrats up and down the ballot this year.
KDP staff and volunteers are working around the clock to get out the vote -- phone banking, running the Voter Protection Hotline, and firing up our voters statewide. With this final push, we must do everything we can to elect Dr. Barbara Bollier, expand our reach in Kansas' four Congressional districts and break the supermajority in the Kansas Legislature.
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Can you donate $20.20 now to ensure we don't have any regrets on Election Day. Every dollar will help us mobilize more Democratic voters over these final five days.
Let's finish strong.

Our proposal for the 2020 Kansas Democratic Party-Run Presidential Primary was just given final approval from the Democratic National Committee! This clears the way for the historic reforms in transparency and accessibility the KDP has made to the 2020 Kansas Democratic Presidential Primary.
Instead of traveling to caucus somewhere for a few hours, registered Democrats in Kansas will be able to vote by either:
* Advance mail-in ballot between March 30 and April 24
* In-person voting from 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. on May 2 in each of the state's 40 state Senate districts
Unlike other elections, the state of Kansas won't be administering our 2020 presidential primary. That means we're counting on your support. Click here to chip in!
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
We'll also be using ranked-choice voting. Voters will rank their top five candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination. If a candidate receives fewer than a minimum 15% of all first-choice votes, that candidate's votes will be reallocated to the next preferred viable candidate until all candidates remaining receive at least 15%.
We'll have even more details when we send a mailer to registered Democrats in Kansas on March 9, which is also the first day advance ballots can be requested. That mailer will also provide the locations for all the in-person voting centers.
Because the KDP is holding the Kansas primary in May and our proposal is in full compliance, Kansas has been awarded a 20% bonus in delegates for a total of 47 delegates instead of the original 39. The delegates will be assigned to candidates based on the primary results, which will be released as soon as they are available following in-person voting on May 2.
This is going to be an exciting time for Democrats across the country, including here in Kansas. To learn more and read the entire Delegate Selection Plan, go to [[URL REDACTED]]

Yesterday, the Kansas Reflector detailed Roger Marshall's latest deceptive ad that, quite literally, puts words into Dr. Barbara Bollier's mouth to mislead hardworking Kansans.
From the Kansas Reflector: ""The first general election commercial released by Marshall after winning the GOP nomination in August asserted Bollier sought restrictions on firearms and included video of her saying, 'I’ll work to ban them nationwide.' She uttered those six words, but did so while discussing her commitment to working in the Senate to prohibit 'surprise' medical bills. The Bollier nugget relied upon by Marshall had nothing to do with guns.""
From misleading and jeopardizing Kansans safety on COVID-19, voting against funding the USPS and the vital services it provides, and supporting a lawsuit that would strip health care from 94,000 Kansans, Roger Marshall has prioritized spreading disinformation instead of advocating for us. His latest dishonest ad is just another transparent attempt to distract us from his losing record on the issues.
We know hardworking Kansans can see right through Roger Marshall's latest lies. We also know that someone who routinely spreads disinformation to mislead the public should not become our next U.S. Senator. Can you help us send a clear message to Roger Marshall and his Republicans allies that we won't allow this deception by donating to the KDP's 2020 Coordinated Campaign today?

Over the weekend, three former Republican Senate Presidents spoke against Susan Wagle’s “reckless” political agenda and condemned her for holding healthcare for up to 150,000 hardworking Kansans hostage. In their words, “Wagle needs to put people of Kansas first.”
More from former Senate Presidents Dick Bond, Dave Kerrand and Steve Morris:
* ""The Senate president’s reckless decision to pull numerous promising bills after the constitutional amendment failed only showed she was focused more on drawing attention to her U.S. Senate race than doing what’s best for Kansas.”
* ""Recent news of her attempt last year to land an ambassadorship in the Trump administration through questionable means was yet another troubling sign of her focus on herself rather than on Kansas.”
* ""During our time in the Legislature, the duties of Senate president demanded our full attention. The current officeholder seems more focused on personal political gain than governing — and at significant cost to the people and future of our great state.""
Susan Wagle continues to recklessly politicize a bipartisan issue that would help up to 150,000 low-income Kansans, benefit struggling hospitals and boost the resources available for our rural communities. Stand with us and thousands of Kansans: can you chip in $20, $25, or $50 to support Medicaid expansion across Kansas?

BREAKING: Last week, GOP leadership used a one-day, 24-hour-long legislative session to craft a reckless bill that would:
* Damage Kansas’ ability to respond to COVID-19 and all future disasters,
* Weaken local county health officer authority over COVID-19, and
* Add unnecessary layers of bureaucracy to Kansas' emergency response efforts.
Despite the Republican-controlled legislature passing this bill literally under the cover of night, Governor Kelly will continue protecting hardworking Kansans from COVID-19 by vetoing last-week’s shameful attempt to boost the political agendas of GOP leadership. Governor Kelly will now work with both parties in the Kansas legislature to sign a revised, reasonable bill that will continue to protect our communities from this virus.
Despite GOP Leadership attempting to undermine her at every step, Governor Kelly has continuously put the best interests of her constituents ahead of politics. She has shown the nation what real leadership looks like throughout this crisis. Can you chip in $25, $35, or $50 to help elect Democrats in 2020 who will follow her lead of putting Kansans first?
In 2018, Kansans made the correct choice to elect Governor Kelly. There’s a lot at stake in 2020 - help us elect more Democrats across the Sunflower State by donating now.
Onward,
KDP Team
P.S. You can read more about Governor Kelly protecting our communities here.

Days after Dr. Fauci warned reopening prematurely would cause ""needless suffering and death,"" Susan Wagle is playing politics - again - in an attempt to undermine Governor Kelly.
Yesterday, Susan Wagle made a Hail Mary attempt to gain leverage over Governor Kelly, stating “We won’t allow one dictator to determine everything… We will have a check and a balance of power...” Yes, this is the same Susan Wagle who has single-handedly held Medicaid expansion hostage for up to 150,000 Kansans before and during an unprecedented pandemic - the exact circumstances in which people need healthcare to survive.
Governor Kelly has shown the nation what real leadership looks like during this crisis, she made tough decisions early on that mitigated the spread of COVID-19 in our communities, and she developed a comprehensive plan to reopen Kansas safely.
It shouldn’t be a novel concept for our legislators to work together and listen to public health experts to keep Kansans safe during a crisis. That’s why, with your help, we must break the Republican supermajority in the Kansas Legislature by electing commonsense Democrats who will work together to advocate for all of us. We know these are extraordinary times, but the COVID-19 pandemic has only heightened the stakes of the 2020 election. Can you chip in $20, $35, or $50 to help us recruit, train and elect Democrats across the Sunflower State?

While Governor Kelly has worked tirelessly to keep our communities safe from COVID-19 exposure, GOP Leadership in the Kansas Legislature has tried to undermine her every step of the way.
Today, on the same day Kansas reported the highest cases of infection and the most COVID-19 related deaths since tracking began, GOP Leaders voted to blatantly disregard the advice of healthcare professionals for the sake of political games.
Tell GOP Leadership in the Kansas Legislature that Kansas lives come first at all times. Add your name to our petition now and we'll send notice to the members of the Legislative Coordinating Council who voted against Governor Kelly. Please share this email with your network so we can demand better from Republican Legislators.
Now is not the time for our political representatives to be jeopardizing public health and safety to benefit their partisan agendas. Sign our petition now and stand up to Republicans who are trying to manipulate the COVID-19 pandemic into a political opportunity.

"Dear Alex,
We asked, and you answered! Thanks to our amazing supporters, we surpassed our ambitious goal of adding 100 new Blue Kansas Club teammates over the last 6 weeks. We are so thankful for the support and dedication you've shown toward the Kansas Democratic Party!
The Kansas Democratic Party isn't built on the backs of a few corporate friends or high-dollar backroom donors. Instead, we count on everyday Kansans donating $5, $10, or $15 a month to help us fight for working families.
We greatly appreciate everyone who signed up for the BKC over the last month and a half - if you haven't done so already, there's still time to sign up! Joining the BKC today will help us start this month with a bang and ensure we keep growing our Party together.
Remember, the BKC might be a small-dollar program, but it has a huge impact on the Coordinated Campaign we will run during this critical election year.

We know watching the news can be overwhelming right now, but we thought you should see Kris Kobach’s latest attempt to mislead Kansas voters and benefit his own racist agenda.
In Kobach’s own words: “Over 12,000 Chinese nationals snuck across the border into the United States last [[URL REDACTED]] checks. No visas. No health screening. In times of global pandemic, borders matter.”
Really, Kris? Now is not the time to push your unsubstantiated, racist argument about border security. Right now, real hardworking Kansans are worried about their jobs, the viability of their small businesses and their access to affordable and accessible health care resources.
Instead of advocating for our best interests during our time of need, Kris Kobach continues to prove that he is not right for Kansas. Can you chip in $20, $35, or $50 to our 2020 Grassroots Campaign so we DEFEAT KRIS KOBACH?

This Halloween, it's important to remember that a number of frightening things will happen if we don't show up and vote by November 3rd. Because you know what's scarier than ghosts? Donald Trump's agenda in a second term.
That's right, this spooky season could last another four years if Trump and the Republicans aren't thrown out of office; but instead of having fun dressing up in costumes, you'll be losing your health care and facing an increasingly out-of-control pandemic with absolutely no plan.
Can you donate $20.20 or more now to ensure that Donald Trump isn't President next Halloween? Every dollar will help us mobilize more Democratic voters over these final days.

Happy Halloween! Don't be afraid to VOTE, find your early voting location here.

Just a few days ago, every single Kansas Republican in Washington – from Roger Marshall, Steve Watkins, and Ron Estes in the House to Pat Roberts and Jerry Moran in the Senate – asked the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade and criminalize a personal health care right.
Let's be very clear: the Kansas GOP's opposition to a woman's constitutional right to choose is out of touch with most Kansans. Every survey of Kansas in recent years, including the only exit poll of 2018 election voters, reports that a decisive majority of Kansans support abortion rights.
Click here to donate toward our 2020 Grassroots Campaign to vote Kansas Republicans out of office up and down the ballot!
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
The Republican Party often acts like there are no consequences for their fringe ideology – especially in states like Kansas – but like a lot of things Republicans believe, they're wrong.
Whether it's scoring the nation's second highest Democratic state legislative seat gain in 2016 or electing a Democratic governor and coming within a percentage point of flipping half the state's congressional delegation in 2018, Kansas Democrats have the momentum to win in 2020.

Welcome to the KDP's Candidate Corner, an installment where we introduce you to exciting 2020 Democratic candidates!
2020 is shaping up to be a historic year for Kansas Democrats, and your investment in this year's Party infrastructure will be instrumental to materialize Democratic victories up and down the ballot. Can we count on you to end the GOP supermajority in the Kansas Legislature, elect Kansas's first Democratic U.S. Senator since 1932 and expand our reach in Kansas's four congressional districts?
In advance of November's election, the Candidate Corner will introduce some of the many great Democrats running for public office in 2020. In this email, we will be introducing State Senate Candidate Kirk Miller (SD-1; Marshall, Nemaha, Brown, Doniphan, Pottawatomie, Jackson, and Atchison Counties), State Representative Candidate Ryan Holmquist (HD-69, Saline County), and State Representative Candidate James Swim (HD-106; Marshall, Republic, Washington, and Jewell Counties).
Want to support these candidates and more? Donate to our 2020 Coordinated Campaign now to elect Democrats up and down the ballot!

"Alex,
Yesterday, the Washington Post Opinion page issued a scathing review of Mike Pompeo's tenure as Secretary of State, calling him ""the worst Secretary of State in history."" We  already know Mike Pompeo has let his political ambitions get in the way of representing the best interests of hardworking Kansans and all Americans, but here are a few of Mike Pompeo's worst moments from the Washington Post:
* ""Mike Pompeo has presided over the collapse of negotiations with North Korea, the failure of a pressure campaign against Iran and an abortive attempt to oust Venezuela’s authoritarian regime. On his watch, China has carried out genocide in its Xinjiang region and the suppression of Hong Kong’s freedoms without resistance from Washington until it was too late.""
* ""In staff surveys [at the State Department], there has been a 34 percent increase between 2016 and 2019 in those who say the State Department’s senior leaders “did not maintain high levels of honesty and integrity.” Maybe that’s because Pompeo himself has defied legal mandates from Congress, skirted a law restricting arms sales to Saudi Arabia, tasked staffers with carrying out errands for himself and his wife, and fired the inspector general who was investigating his violations.""
* ""Pompeo’s steering of it has led to some of the worst diplomatic damage the United States has suffered in decades — especially in relations with its closest allies.""
Mike Pompeo shouldn't serve four more years as Secretary of State and he certainly shouldn't be able to turn his failed Secretary of State career into a Presidential campaign in the future. Let's send a clear message to Mike Pompeo and Donald Trump by electing Democrats up and down the ballot in Kansas. We know hardworking Kansans are ready for change, can you take a stand against the current administration by donating to the KDP's 2020 Coordinated Campaign?

Gov. Laura Kelly just broke the impasse with a Republican leader in the Kansas Legislature and secured a bipartisan deal on Medicaid expansion! This is the clearest opportunity for our state to finally join the 37 states and Washington, D.C. that have already extended Medicaid coverage to more Americans.
We still have a lot of work to do – the legislation still must pass both chambers of the Kansas Legislature. But this is a major accomplishment – and once again shows that elections matter.

The 2020 election is here. Over 20 million Americans, including thousands of Kansans, have already voted in the most important election of our lifetimes. With Republicans, misinformation bots and even Donald Trump working hard to sabotage and discredit this election, it's more important than ever to have a robust Voter Protection Program to help hardworking Kansans cast their ballots in 2020.
Our Voter Protection Program is already the largest voter protection effort in Kansas history, but we're just getting started to ensure a fair and inclusive 2020 election. We're recruiting volunteers to work as poll agents for early voting and Election Day, as well as running an election protection hotline that voters can reach at 844-KSVOTES (844-578-6837).
Our Voter Protection program is up and running, but we must ensure it is fully staffed and funded to protect the voices of hardworking Kansans. To be successful, we've set an internal goal to raise $7,000 before Election Day - which is only 2 weeks away. Will you help us ensure that every voter's voice is heard in this year's election by rushing a donation to our Voter Protection Program?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
We're counting on you - donate today to fund our Voter Protection Program.

"Dear Alex,
Did you see Kansas Dems on KSNT yesterday? While discussing the Presidential Primary, political analyst Dr. Bob Beatty highlighted the success of our mail-in operation, stating:
“The Democratic Party of Kansas was able to put on an election during a pandemic, that’s remarkable. And what it really shows is how mail-in elections, or mail-in voting, is probably the future for the United States, let alone the future of Kansas.”
We couldn’t have said it better ourselves. Kansas Democrats had a unique opportunity on May 2 to demonstrate how mail-in voting can protect voters and our Democracy during even the most uncertain of times - and they came through, big time. While Donald Trump and his GOP allies across the country are blocking election reforms before November, Kansas Democrats more than tripled their 2016 turnout to unequivocally prove that vote-by-mail during a pandemic is just common sense.
We shattered previous turnout records during the 2020 Primary. Can you help us capitalize on our growing momentum by chipping in $20, $35, or $50? Your donation will help us harness Democratic enthusiasm and build a robust 2020 Coordinated Campaign to materialize victories up and down the ballot in 2020.
Kansas Democrats have a real chance to make historic wins in Kansas this election year, and with your help, we will end the Republican super majority in the Kansas Legislature, win a U.S. Senate Seat, expand our representation in our U.S. Congress, and, last but not least, make Donald Trump a one-term president.
Donate today to help us make history again on November 3, 2020.
Onward,
KDP Team

"Alex,
That first debate was really... something, wasn't it?
Last night, Donald Trump spewed a near-constant stream of racism and deranged conspiracy theories designed to distract from his botched response to COVID-19, the resulting recession, and the general failure that is his presidency. From Donald Trump's refusal to condemn white supremacist groups, to lying about his health care record, to brazenly disrespecting our democracy, last night's debate proved that Donald Trump doesn't deserve another four years.
This year's election is the most important of our lifetimes, and the choice couldn't be more clear. A vote for Donald Trump will ensure four more years of chaos, corruption, and division that our country cannot afford. A vote for Joe Biden is a vote for affordable health care, women's rights, workers' rights, the climate, and unity. Can you rush a donation today to make sure we don't repeat four more years of this mess?

"Dear Alex,
First and foremost, I hope you and your loved ones are safe and healthy -- there is nothing more important during this time. As we move further into this important election year, I want to make sure you are aware of a few exciting strategies the Kansas Democratic Party has adopted for the upcoming 2020 Democratic Presidential Primary:
– VOTE-BY-MAIL: This year, we are conducting the 2020 Presidential Primary completely by mail and are automatically mailing every registered Kansas Democrat a pre-paid mail-in ballot to complete in the comfort and safety of their own home. We are expecting ballots to begin arriving this week. To make sure you are automatically mailed a ballot, please confirm you are a registered Democrat ASAP through [[URL REDACTED]] View a complete vote-by-mail timeline at our website.
– RANKED CHOICE VOTING: Kansas is one of a few states adopting ranked choice voting for the 2020 Primary. Ranked choice voting provides voters the option to rank up to five choices according to preference and proportionally administers delegates based on the percentage of votes each candidate receives to more accurately reflect the voices of Kansas Democrats.
– DEFEATING DONALD TRUMP STARTS NOW. Early involvement, heightened awareness, and increased participation all lead to Democrats winning in November. Right now, it is critical we engage with our existing members, continue to grow our Kansas Democratic team, and make sure we see high turnout in this important Presidential Primary. In 2020, we are dedicated to electing Democrats up and down the ballot and defeating Donald Trump come November - that begins with a successful 2020 Primary election.
Running an election completely by mail costs significantly more than a regular Primary, but anything that will make this election as safe and accessible as possible for our voters is worth it. 2020 is the most important election year of our lives, and with our Primary on the horizon, we need your support now more than ever.
If you believe in our mission to flip Kansas blue, please consider providing a donation to our 2020 Presidential Primary. Your donation will help make this year’s Primary the most successful in Party history and lay the foundation to beat Donald Trump in November.
As always, but especially now, we remain thankful for your support. Amidst the many uncertainties of this moment, we remain certain of this: an election is happening in November and we must collectively do everything we can to ensure Democrats see big wins at every level.

"They're hiding it, Alex.
It's been a week since we emailed you about Kansas Republicans signing a letter to the U.S. Supreme Court asking justices to reverse Roe v. Wade, but not a single member of the Kansas GOP has even mentioned it – not on social media, in a press release, or in any public comments.
Make no mistake: Kansas Republicans aren't telling their constituents what they did because the GOP knows its radical ideology is out of touch with Kansas values.
It's clear what we have to do: vote Republicans out of office.
Donating whatever you can will power our 2020 Grassroots Campaign, put boots on the ground, and make sure we win November. Can we count on you?

Tonight marks the first Presidential debate of 2020. We know Donald Trump is going to use the same playbook as 2016 to spread lies, lies and more lies.
We'll be fact checking Donald Trump's egregious claims tonight on social media, but we need your help to spread our message and continue contacting voters to elect Democrats statewide this year, including Joe Biden and Kamala Harris as our next President and VP.
The stakes couldn't be higher in this year's election. Our access to health care, women's rights, workers' rights, the climate, and civil protections are at risk if Donald Trump is reelected.

Friends - I hope you and your loved ones are staying safe and healthy during this challenging time. I know that COVID-19 has posed many challenges for all of us, but I also know that Kansans are resilient, determined and we will continue to work together to slow the spread of this virus and move our state forward.
We are only six weeks away from Election Day and we have a lot of work to do to ensure we elect leaders who will stand up for hardworking families across Kansas. So today, I am sharing my ""To-Do"" list for all Kansas Democrats:
1\. Register to vote and/or double check your voter registration. Reach out to friends, family members, and neighbors and make sure they are registered. I use [[URL REDACTED]] to confirm my voter registration. Remember the last day to register is October 13, 2020.
2\. Make your voting plan. When will you head to the polls? What mask will you wear? Who will you take with you? If you applied for an advanced ballot, make a plan to fill out your ballot and drop it in the mail - or take it to your nearest dropbox - as soon as you receive it.
3\. If you haven't already, join the Blue Kansas Club today by signing up for a monthly donation. The average BKC donation is just $12.00 a month and will go a long way to electing Democrats up and down the ballot during this crucial election year.
4. Volunteer for the 2020 Coordinated Campaign! We need volunteers to speak to voters and get out the vote. Sign up today for a volunteer shift to make sure Kansas goes blue in 2020.
5\. Join us this weekend for Digital Demofest to hear about Kansas Democrats' roadmap to victory in November. I hope to virtually see you there!
Together, we have the power to build a brighter future for all Kansans.
Thank you for your support,
Laura Kelly
Governor of Kansas

D.C. Republicans for months have begged Mike Pompeo to leave the State Department to run for Senate in 2020. Why? Because the GOP knows that Democrats have the momentum here in Kansas.
Here's the thing: despite his out-of-touch record as a member of Congress and his atrocious time as Secretary of State, Pompeo was never going to be Republicans' white knight. But now we know just how deeply involved Pompeo was in the attempt to bribe Ukraine into announcing fake investigations to help Donald Trump's re-election campaign.
Kansas is home to all kinds of people, but we don’t have patience for politicians in legal jeopardy looking for escape hatches.
Kansans deserve better than Mike Pompeo, whether he runs for Senate or not. Add your name to say you agree!
Whether our opponent is Kris Kobach, Pompeo, or any of the other out-of-touch GOP politicians running to replace Pat Roberts, Kansas Democrats are ready for 2020. Click here to stand against Mike Pompeo >>

Tonight, Mike Pompeo became the first Secretary of State in memory to deliver a politically-motivated speech at a Party's nominating convention - and he's doing so on the American taxpayers' dime.
In Kansas, we already know Mike Pompeo has let his partisan agenda get in the way of representing the best interests of hardworking Kansans and all Americans, but tonight, he proved it to the rest of the world. Here's what else you should know about Mike Pompeo:
* Pompeo repeatedly called the coronavirus the “Wuhan Virus” and pushed an unsubstantiated theory that it had emerged from a Wuhan virology lab.
* Pompeo is under scrutiny for orchestrating the ouster of the State Department inspector general, who was conducting multiple investigations into Pompeo and his wife.
* On Pompeo's participation at the RNC Convention, Joe Biden's campaign stated: ""Even by this administration's abysmally low standards, Secretary Pompeo's decision to serve as an errand boy for the President's re-election on a taxpayer-funded diplomatic mission, and his decision to use one of our closest partners as a political prop in the process, is absolutely disgraceful.""
Mike Pompeo shouldn't serve four more years as Secretary of State, but to make sure he gets demoted, we must elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. We know hardworking Kansans are ready for change, can you take a stand against Mike Pompeo by donating to the KDP's 2020 Coordinated Campaign?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Tell Mike Pompeo the gig is up.

Today marks the start of PRIDE MONTH! We’ve come so far in the fight for LGBTQIA+ rights, but the push for equality is far from over. Especially in the current moment, we are reminded that the fight for equality is intersectional, continuous and required to create a society we all are proud of.
To celebrate PRIDE MONTH, we've added new gear to our website. Be sure to use ""PRIDE2020"" for 10% off all PRIDE themed merchandise during the month of June!
We can't wait to see you in your new gear!

Have you seen the latest news? Republican Kansas Senate President Susan Wagle is holding Medicaid expansion hostage -- putting the livelihood of 150,000 Kansans at risk for her own political gain.
Although legislation passed in the Kansas House earlier this year with bipartisan support to expand Medicaid across the state, Sen. Wagle has made it her mission to block any progress; instead, she has misled voters and refused to work with her peers on a solution that would benefit us all. Last week, Kansans stood up to Sen. Wagle to rally for Medicaid expansion.
Stand with us and thousands of Kansans: can you chip in $20, $25, or $50 to support Medicaid expansion across Kansas?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
We believe healthcare is a human right, and access to affordable, life-saving services should not be held hostage to advance a political agenda.
It's time to stand up to Sen. Wagle and advocate for the wellbeing of all working families. Together, we can make sure our elected officials prioritize our livelihoods over partisan-politics and work together to guarantee medicaid expansion for up to 150,000 Kansans.
Donate today to keep up the fight for everyday Kansans across the state.

"Dear Alex,
Happy Earth Day!
At the Kansas Democratic Party, we believe our elected representatives must take immediate comprehensive action against climate change to protect our planet for generations to come. That's why this Earth Day, we're asking our members to pledge to bring the fight against climate change to the ballot box in November.
Donald Trump has spent his presidency walking back 50 years worth of crucial environmental regulations like withdrawing from the Paris Agreement, rolling back Obama-era fuel efficiency standards, rescinding the Clean Water Act, weakening the Endangered Species Act, loosening regulations put in place to prevent another B.P. oil spill and reducing our public lands to their smallest acreage in U.S. history. Trump's anti-environment record has made it abundantly clear - our planet simply cannot afford another four years of Donald Trump in the White House.
We need a president who will fight to keep our planet healthy, safe and vibrant for the next generation of leaders. Add your name now to support candidates up and down the ballot who will prioritize science and our environment.
Together, we will make sure we can celebrate Earth Day for years to come.

While thousands of Kansans are being forced to take drastic measures to ensure their health and economic well being, Republican Commissioners from Sedgwick County are spending their time attempting to dismantle women’s rights by recommending abortion services be designated as “non-essential” procedures.
Especially when Governor Laura Kelly has already determined that women’s health care centers are essential - because they offer just that, health care - why are Sedgwick County Republicans prioritizing an issue that has no course of action? This is political grandstanding at its worst.
The latest behavior of the Sedgwick County Commissioners showcases the extremes the Republican Party will explore to upend a woman’s constitutional right. The COVID-19 pandemic has already proved how important it is to elect people who will prioritize health care, workers’ rights and an economy that works for all of us -- this is just another egregious example of why we must make big Democratic wins across Kansas in 2020.
If you agree with us on this critical issue, can you chip in $20, $25, or $50 to support our mission to elect Democrats across Kansas who will protect women’s rights, instead of grandstanding for an irrelevant political agenda?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
It's time to stand up to Republicans who are trying to manipulate the COVID-19 pandemic into a political opportunity to attack women’s health care. Donate today to help us elect Democrats who will prioritize our livelihoods over partisan-politics and protect women’s rights from misguided attacks.

"Dear Alex,
Right now, we are facing an unprecedented health and economic crisis in the U.S. and the need for competent, caring and hard-working individuals to serve in our local, state, and federal government is more important than ever. Kansas Democrats are showing the nation how to put American families first during this crisis, and as 2020 approaches, we cannot lose focus on our collective mission to continue electing Democrats across the Sunflower State.
To achieve this goal, I am a proud member of the Kansas Democratic Party’s Blue Kansas Club — Kansans who make a monthly contribution to the party. Democrats cannot afford to sit back in 2020 and with this year’s important election on the horizon, we must make sure they have the resources they need to succeed.
A Blue Kansas Club small dollar contribution plays a direct role to help:
* Elect Democrats into the Kansas State Legislature who will fight for Medicaid Expansion, worker’s rights and a balanced budget.
* Protect Sharice Davids’s congressional seat in CD3, see Democratic victories in Kansas’s other three federal districts and build the early infrastructure to protect my friend, Governor Laura Kelly, who will seek re-election in 2022.
* And last but not least, elect Kansas’s first Democratic U.S. Senator since 1932 and defeat Donald Trump and put a Democrat into the White House in 2020.
While this is an uncertain time, we know the 2020 election is approaching quickly and will be a pivotal moment in our nation’s history. If you are able, I hope you will join me as part of the Kansas Democratic Party’s Blue Kansas Club team. Kansas Democrats made history in 2016 and 2018 and I know we can do it again in 2020 starting with your BKC membership.
Stay well and take care of yourself, your family and your neighbors.

Kathleen Sebelius

"Alex,
The first and only Vice Presidential debate happened last night, and Mike Pence did everything he could to distract from his disastrous record on COVID-19.
Last night, Mike Pence wanted to talk about anything besides his record of failure on the biggest issue facing our country. Since Donald Trump put Pence in charge of managing the COVID-19 pandemic, over 210,000 Americans have died, over 7 million have been infected, 400,000 small business have closed their doors for good, and millions of Americans are out of work. Mike Pence has utterly failed the American people, and last night's debate showed he doesn't regret it or have a plan for our country to recover.
The sooner we get Trump and Pence out of office, the sooner we can start repairing our country. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are the leaders we need to Build Back Better, but they can't do this alone. Can you rush a donation today to make sure Trump and Pence don't get to run our country for another four years?

Alex,
Welcome to the KDP Weekly Rundown – the Kansas Democratic Party’s update of the biggest things going on in the state party and the state government. What are we focused on this week? COVID-19 Precautions, Kansans demand bipartisanship to pass Medicaid Expansion, the KDP aims to end Republican Supermajority, Laura Lombard hopes to unseat Ron Estes in KS-04, proposal would increase funding for top Republicans, Watkins' under investigation for campaign contributions, Super Tuesday II Results and more.
Furthermore, the KDP Team is releasing a 2020 Primary Toolkit for Democrats across Kansas! Please feel free to utilize the included resources to inform others about important dates and deadlines concerning the upcoming primary election. We will update the drive as we produce more graphics and informational content.
COVID-19 PRECAUTIONS
What's happening?
Governor Laura Kelly has issued an emergency declaration for the State of Kansas in response to COVID-19 (coronavirus). The declaration authorizes the use of state resources and personnel to assist with response and recovery operations in affected counties that meet certain criteria.
Governor Laura Kelly: Our state is well prepared. With this emergency declaration we can activate our response and coordinate fully. This is part of the process and will make access to important resources more accessible. We continue to work closely with our local, state and federal partners.
If you have symptoms such as fever, cough or shortness of breath and believe you may have had contact or have had contact with someone with a laboratory confirmed case of COVID-19, stay home and call your healthcare provider.
You may also call the KDHE phone bank at 1-866-534-3463 (1-866-KDHEINF) today Monday – Friday, 8 a.m. – 5 p.m. For more information about COVID-19, visit KDHE’s website and Frequently Asked Questions at [[URL REDACTED]] and [[URL REDACTED]]
(Hawver's Capitol Report Flash #56) - The House this morning, fearing that the COVID-19 disease may shorten the legislative session, passed 116-0 to the Senate a resolution that will give Gov. Laura Kelly extensive authority to deal with the disease outbreak statewide, including assisting local units of government response to the disease and moving money around within the budget for that purpose.

KANSANS DEMAND BIPARTISANSHIP TO PASS MEDICAID EXPANSION
What's happening?
(The Topeka Capital-Journal) - Repeated polling has shown the vast majority of Kansas support expanding the insurance program that covers those with low incomes. Repeated studies show that such coverage improves health outcomes across the board. Some 150,000 Kansans would benefit.
Bipartisanship is not a dirty word. Indeed, it is what the people of Kansas deserve and expect. Working across the aisle shouldn’t be a rare exception. It should be the rule in making a state that does the best for all of its residents, not just voters in the Republican primary.

WHAT KANSAS DEMS WANT? JUST ONE MORE VOTE TO END A DECADE OF REPUBLICAN SUPERMAJORITY
What's happening?
(The Kansas City Star) - After boosting their numbers in the Kansas Legislature over the past four years, Democrats in 2020 want to deliver on their longtime goal of ending Republican supermajorities in the House and Senate.
Democrats need to pick up just one seat in the House to take Republicans under the 84-vote threshold needed to override vetoes. The Senate is a taller order, where Democrats need three additional seats to end the GOP supermajority.

DEMOCRAT LAURA LOMBARD LAUNCHES BID FOR CONGRESS
Laura Lombard
What's happening?
(The Wichita Eagle) - Democrat Laura Lombard announced her campaign for Congress on Saturday, condemning Republican Rep. Ron Estes as a 'yes man' for President Donald Trump.
Lombard is the first Democrat to enter the race for Kansas’s 4th congressional district, which includes Wichita and south central Kansas. Her entry means Democratic women are now running for every U.S. House and Senate seat in the state.
Lombard: We need vocal advocates in Congress who will fight for our families and our democracy, not representatives who will rubber stamp the corrupt, racism and authoritarianism of the cult of Trump.
* Where can I learn more?
* Democrat Laura Lombard, launching bid for Congress, slams Ron Estes as GOP ‘yes man’. The Wichita Eagle, March 7, 2020.
* Progressive Democratic Primary Opponents Looking To Flip Kansas' 4th Congressional District Blue. KMUW Wichita 89.1.
PROPOSAL WOULD INCREASE FUNDING FOR TOP REPUBLICANS
What's happening?
(Wichita Eagle) - Kansas legislative leaders' offices would see an 11% increase in their funding under a proposal that cleared committee Monday, and almost all of the new dollars would go to top Republicans.
Senate Minority Leader Anthony Hensley (D - Topeka): It couldn't come at a worse time, in case we have to spend money on the public health crisis because of the coronavirus.
House Minority Leader Tom Sawyer (D - Wichita): I don't think that's the taxpayers' priority.
* Where can I learn more?
* Plan would boost funding for top Kansas lawmakers' offices. Wichita Eagle, March 10, 2020.
U.S. REP. STEVE WATKINS' DAD ALLEGEDLY MADE ILLEGAL CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION
What's happening?
(Topeka Capital-Journal) - A campaign-finance investigation launched into alleged “straw-man” donations by the father of U.S. Rep. Steve Watkins, of Kansas, continues amid filing of a new complaint regarding possible voter fraud by the congressman for listing a false home address on voting documents.
The news outlet Politico first reported the Federal Election Commission inquiry into whether Steve Watkins Sr., a Topeka physician, broke the law by giving cash to other people so they could donate to Watkins’ successful campaign for Congress in 2018.

"Dear Alex,
I wanted to make sure you saw my message from last week and share the good news that 2020 Primary ballots have started arriving! Right now, the KDP is showing the nation how vote-by-mail makes our elections more accessible, inclusive and safe during this uncertain time -- we all should be proud of this effort.
Throughout the rest of the 2020 cycle, the KDP remains committed to increasing Democratic turnout for candidates up and down the ballot. However, to be successful during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative the KDP has the resources they need to adopt robust digital campaigning strategies.
We cannot afford to sit back over the next few months, and providing a small dollar monthly contribution to the KDP is the best way you can make sure we are victorious in 2020. If you are able and haven’t yet, I hope you will join me by becoming a member of the BKC Team.

Happy 159th birthday, Kansas! Kansas joined the Union on this day in 1861. From John Brown, Dwight D. Eisenhower, and Amelia Earhart to Brown v. Topeka Board of Education, William Allen White, and a progressive history through thick and thin, Kansas has lived up to its motto – Ad astra per aspera, to the stars through difficulties.

28 Republican Senators just voted to eliminate abortion rights from the Kansas Constitution, even in cases of rape, incest, or when the mother’s life is in danger. The GOP is once again proving just how out of step it is with the majority of Kansans.
But this isn't over: the GOP is relying on two-thirds of the House supporting its extremist constitutional amendment, which isn’t a sure bet.
Look up your representative’s phone number and demand they vote No >>
We can't overstate how crazy this amendment is. If Roe v. Wade is overturned, fringe members of the Kansas Legislature would sprint to completely ban access to reproductive services, no matter the circumstance.
If you've been waiting for the right time to call your local member of the Kansas House about this radical amendment, now is the time.
Onward,

I am emailing you today because we can win the U.S. Senate seat in Kansas. Recent polls show us in a dead heat with my opponent. As early voting begins across Kansas, we cannot become complacent.
The last thing Washington needs right now is another hyper-partisan politician like my opponent. It’s time for hardworking Kansans to have a U.S. Senator they can trust to put Kansans' best interests first. I am a proud, pragmatic Democrat and I promise I will listen and lead with empathy while representing you.
The momentum we’re seeing in the polls is thanks to supporters like you who have chipped in along the way to fund the KDP’s 2020 Coordinated Campaign. But in this final stretch we need as many voters as we can to drive our message home. Can you chip in $20.20, or any amount, to ensure we win on Election Day?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
It is time to show the nation how far our state has come by electing the first Democratic United States Senator in Kansas since 1932. Kansans need a voice of reason in Washington who will advocate for hardworking families across our state. It is time to send someone to D.C. who isn't beholden to special interests.
I’m running for Senate for the same reason I became a doctor - to help people. Can you help me win by donating to the KDP’s 2020 Coordinated Campaign?
Onwards,
Dr. Barbara Bollier
U.S. Senate Candidate

Yesterday, billionaire Charles Koch announced he is dropping big money into the Kansas Senate race. As reported by CNBC, ""The Koch network getting involved with the Kansas race comes as Republican leaders prepare for the possibility that they may lose their majority in the Senate.""
We know the Senate majority runs through Kansas and polling has the Kansas Senate race in a dead heat. But unlike our Republican counterparts, we don’t have friends like the Koch's with deep pockets making backroom deals. We are a grassroots organization powered by and fighting for hardworking Kansans just like you.
This year, we have the opportunity to send a voice of reason, instead of a hyperpartisan politician, to Washington to advocate for our best interests. The KDP is committed to running the most robust coordinated campaign in Kansas Democratic history and will work diligently over the coming weeks to materialize Democratic victories up and down the ballot, but we need your help. In the spirit of this critical election year, can we count on you to pledge your support to the Party with a donation of $20.20?

We have some exciting news… Kansas Democrats have more-than tripled 2016’s caucus turnout for the 2020 Presidential Primary! Kansas Democrats have already made history in 2020 and are proving that Democrats are united behind a common cause: making Donald Trump a one-term President.
To help us achieve this goal, one of our munificent donors has agreed to contribute up to $3,000 in matching funds to YOUR donation to our 2020 Presidential Primary operation! Having a matching donor means your money will have double the impact on our work at the Kansas Democratic Party. If you believe in our mission to flip Kansas blue, now is the time to donate to our cause.
2020 is the most important election year of our lives and we need your support now more than ever. Can we count on you to have your donation matched to lay the foundation to beat Donald Trump in November?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Running an election completely by mail costs significantly more than past Party caucuses, but anything that will make this election as safe and accessible as possible for our voters is worth it.
Donate now to help us make history AGAIN on November 3rd!

Last week's reporting from the Kansas City Star makes it clear: Donald Trump intervened behind the scenes in the Kansas Senate race to help Roger Marshall.
Six years with Roger Marshall in the U.S. Senate would be disastrous for hardworking Kansans. From jeopardizing Kansans safety on COVID-19, voting against funding the USPS and the vital services it provides, and supporting a lawsuit that would strip health care from 94,000 Kansans, Roger Marshall will be in lockstep with Donald Trump - after all, he owes him.
Kansans need a voice of reason in the U.S. Senate. We need someone who will listen, lead with empathy and work tirelessly to advocate for our best interests. The path to the Senate majority runs through Kansas, can you make sure we send Dr. Barbara Bollier to Washington in 52 days with a donation to the KDP's 2020 Coordinated Campaign?

My name is Hannah Marcus and I am the 2020 Coordinated Campaign Director at the Kansas Democratic Party. All eyes are on Kansas this year, and I couldn’t be more excited to be a part of the grassroots effort to finally flip Kansas blue in 2020.
We have 84 days to make history by defeating Donald Trump, sending Barbara Bollier to the U.S. Senate, and electing Democrats up and down the ballot. But it's going to take every single one of us doing all we can between now and November 3rd to get the job done.
Today marks the beginning of our Blue Kansas Club campaign, Road to Victory 2020. The KDP has set an ambitious goal of adding 100 new team members to our Blue Kansas Club over the next six weeks, but I know we can achieve this goal with your help. With a monthly small dollar donation that helps fund our 2020 coordinated campaign, joining our BKC team is the best way to support our mission to flip Kansas blue.
Every new BKC member helps us to deliver our message in new and accessible ways: virtual voter contact, at-home text banks, and webinars focusing on empowering Kansans to mobilize their personal networks. November 3, 2020 is less than three months away. Can we count on you to chip in $25 a month, or whatever you can afford, to join our BKC team and help the Kansas Dems deliver victory in November?
With the support of hardworking Kansans like you, we will execute the most robust coordinated campaign in KDP history to flip Kansas Blue on Election Day.
Thank you for your support,
Hannah Marcus, KDP Coordinated Campaign Director

This week, Bloomberg News published an article outlining the incredibly high stakes in the upcoming election for the Kansas Legislature.
In their words: ""The flip of a single state House seat in Kansas could block GOP dominance over the state’s congressional districts for the next decade. If Republicans retain two-thirds supermajorities in the state House and Senate in the Nov. 3 general election, they’ll have veto-proof power to pass bills redrawing the state’s four congressional districts following the 2020 Census.""
By flipping just one seat in the State House, Democrats will be one step closer to ensuring fair redistricting, Medicaid expansion, and fully funded public schools. But if Republicans are able to hold their super majority and veto-proof power, they will be able to gerrymander Kansas' Congressional districts and make it nearly impossible for us to keep Rep. Sharice Davids in Congress and elect Democrats up and down the ballot for years to come.
The stakes in this election couldn't be higher. Can we count on you to give Governor Kelly a legislature that will work with her to pass critical legislation, along with preventing Republicans from gerrymandering Rep. Sharice Davids out of Congress by donating to our 2020 Coordinated Campaign today?

What's happening?
The Kansas Democratic Party began printing ballots for the 2020 Presidential Primary on March [[URL REDACTED]] year, the KDP will administer a primary including ranked choice voting and a vote-by-mail option.
KDP Chair, Vicki Hiatt: In a competitive primary election where a candidate’s road to success continually fluctuates, we believe that ranked choice voting is an ideal process to determine Kansas’s delegate distribution at the 2020 Democratic National Convention.
Furthermore, the KDP Team is releasing a 2020 Primary Toolkit for Democrats across Kansas!

We will update the drive as we produce more graphics and informational content.
THREE FORMER REPUBLICAN SENATE PRESIDENT'S CONDEMN SUSAN WAGLE
What's happening?
Dick Bond, Dave Kerr, and Steve Morris: This bipartisan compromise warrants open discussion, debate and a vote in the full Senate. Instead, this important bill and others may fall prey to the political whims of a Senate president seeking to boost her campaign for higher office. Recent news of her attempt last year to land an ambassadorship in the Trump administration through questionable means was yet another troubling sign of her focus on herself rather than on Kansas.
During our time in the Legislature, the duties of Senate president demanded our full attention. The current officeholder seems more focused on personal political gain than governing — and at significant cost to the people and future of our great state.
Kansans deserve better.

GOP SENATE LEADERSHIP BLASTS BIPARTISAN COOPERATION ON MEDICAID EXPANSION
What's happening?
(The Wichita Eagle) - Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly, a Democrat, and Senate Republican Leader Jim Denning ramped up a pressure campaign Monday to break Senate President Susan Wagle’s blockade of their Medicaid expansion compromise, which Kelly called “immoral.”
Governor Laura Kelly: We all know we have an issue with the Senate president, who is tying this issue to the constitutional amendment and not allowing debate on either this issue or any other healthcare issues right now. Talk about an immoral thing to do – that is one of them, because the lives of the people of Kansas are really on the line here.
Kansas Senate Republicans lashed out at their own leader, Sen. Jim Denning, on Thursday for campaigning in favor of Medicaid expansion with Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly earlier this week.
The confrontation came after Denning and Kelly addressed hospital administrators and clergy in Wichita on Monday and asked them to urge their lawmakers to support expansion. Their efforts have been stymied by Wagle, of Wichita, who has vowed to block the proposal until an anti-abortion amendment to the state constitution passes the Legislature.
Sen. Susan Wagle (R-Wichita) - It puts us all in a bind when you’re carrying the governor’s bill and I believe the majority of our caucus is not for that bill... our biggest voting bloc in a primary is the pro-life community and we cannot be asked to step on that community and get re-elected. So you’re putting us in a very difficult spot. Very, very difficult.

SENATE PASSES BILL FOCUSING ON FOSTER CHILDREN'S EDUCATION
What's happening?
(Hutchinson News) - The Kansas Senate unanimously approved legislation Thursday requiring compilation of an annual academic report card on thousands of children in foster care.
Kansas would be the second state to initiate this type of tracking mandate. If passed into law, the Kansas State Department of Education and the Kansas Department for Children and Families would report on high school graduations, standardized test scores, suspensions or expulsions and enrollment in at-risk programs of foster children in accredited public and private schools.

KANSAS MOVES TO GET SUSPENDED DRIVERS BACK ON THE ROAD
(KCUR) - Together, the bills would make it cheaper for suspended drivers with multiple unpaid fines to get back their full license once their suspension is up. The changes would also qualify more suspended drivers for a restricted driver’s license, which allows them to get to work, church and/or school.
Democratic Rep. Gail Finney said current Kansas law unfairly affects the working class and former inmates trying to re-enter society. About half of the 6,000 inmates released each year in Kansas either have a suspended driver’s license or no license at all, according to the Kansas Criminal Justice Reform Commission’s 2019 report.
Gail Finney (D-Wichita): Without a driver’s license, it’s very difficult to look for a job. It’s very difficult to look for a home...I mean, you can’t get your children to and from school. The list goes on and on.

Republicans have held supermajorities in both chambers of the Kansas Legislature for decades – at least 84 seats in the Kansas House and 27 seats in the Kansas Senate. That means the GOP's right-wing leadership can override the governor's vetoes if all members of their party stick together.
But check this out: Republicans are barely hanging on. Just three state Senate districts and one state House district stand between GOP supermajority control and a better Kansas.
We're working to break the GOP supermajority to make sure priorities like Medicaid expansion, full funding for public schools, and an end to Brownback-style tax experiments can be a reality. Can you chip in $20, $35, or $50 to our 2020 Grassroots Campaign?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Last year, Gov. Laura Kelly won a majority or plurality of the vote in 24 House districts and 8 Senate districts currently held by Republicans. Breaking this supermajority is within our reach.
We can finally have a government that puts all Kansans first – not wealthy multinational corporations and the richest families in the state.
Donate today to keep up the fight for everyday Kansans across the state.
Onward,
KDP Team

We've been warning you against thinking any Republican running against Kris Kobach in the U.S. Senate primary is automatically ""moderate"" or ""centrist,"" and guess what? GOP Senate Candidate Roger Marshall keeps making that point for us.
Roger Marshall just said he's ""a national spokesperson for the right to life issue, working hand-in-glove with the NRA."" In fact, Marshall says, ""I just think you cannot get to the right of me on any type of social issue.""
We have to make sure voters around the state know just how out of touch Roger Marshall is with Kansas values, but we can't do that without the successful grassroots operation we had in 2018. Can we count on you to power our 2020 Grassroots Campaign?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Kris Kobach is charging through the Republican primary, but we can't be caught by surprise if he falls short – and neither can the voters deciding the Senate race in November.
No matter how much of an uphill climb people outside Kansas say we have, we know as Kansans that when we work together, we can win.

In case you haven't heard, last week Susan Wagle got caught saying the quiet part out loud. In a private speech to a conservative group, Wagle promised that if the Republicans maintain their supermajority in the Kansas Legislature, they will draw maps that rig our elections in favor of Republicans for the next decade.
WATCH HERE: The Kansas GOP doesn't want to earn your vote - instead, they would rather cheat.
Luckily, we know how to stop Susan Wagle and her Republican colleagues. All we need to do is flip one house seat and three Senate seats and we will break the GOP supermajority. Once we do this, Republicans won't be able to deny political representation to thousands across this state - but we can't do it without your help. Can you help us break the GOP supermajority by donating to elect Democrats up and down the ballot?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Kansas deserves representatives who will focus on the issues facing our state, but Republicans have proved time and again that they're just not interested in doing that.
Donate today to stand against Susan Wagle's political games.

We know health care is a priority for you and your loved ones, which is why we had to point out U.S. Senate Candidate Roger Marshall’s latest tone-deaf comment on Medicaid expansion in Kansas.
When asked if Medicaid expansion would have made it easier for low-income Kansans to receive affordable health care services during the COVID-19 pandemic, Roger Marshall said: “Medicaid expansion would never have helped.”
In reality, Medicaid expansion would benefit over 130,000 of Kansas’s most vulnerable in addition to boosting our rural health care facilities and providing overall financial stability to our state during this public health crisis. Will you stand with Kansas Democrats on this critical issue?
But that isn’t all - we compiled a few other stand-outs from Marshall’s out-of-touch health care agenda to showcase Marshall’s priorities when it comes to Kansans and their health care:
* Marshall previously prioritized profit over human lives by arguing that hospitals stood to benefit from the [COVID-19] pandemic due to an increased number of patients.
* Marshall has claimed that poor people “just don’t want health care and aren’t going to take care of themselves” to argue against Medicaid expansion.
* Marshall voted against the Affordable Care Act, attempting to rip health insurance from nearly 90,000 Kansans and eliminate pre-existing condition protections for 460,000+ Kansans.
Roger Marshall’s health care record is atrocious and it just keeps getting worse. Kansas needs a U.S. Senator who will fight for affordable and reliable health care services - can you chip in $20, $35, or $50 to help us elect a commonsense Democrat into office in November who will prioritize expanding our access to reliable health care?

One of our pillars at the Kansas Democratic Party is ensuring our children have the quality public education they need to succeed. The basic principle of providing our children with the best educational opportunities possible should not be hindered by the COVID-19 pandemic; but unfortunately, with Education Secretary Betsy DeVos in charge, it is.
Betsy DeVos has been against public schools since day one, and now, DeVos and Trump are using the COVID-19 crisis to push their disastrous anti-public school agenda by providing additional coronavirus relief funds to private schools.
In Kansas, we’re fortunate to have a Governor who has strengthened public education across our state. In 2020, we’re fighting for Democratic candidates up and down the ballot who will prioritize public education funding and build a future we all can be proud of - we also need a President who will fight for the same. Can you make sure we elect education champions across the Sunflower State and into the White House by chipping in $20, $35, or $50 today?

The COVID-19 pandemic has changed all of our daily lives - but it should not change the hopes and dreams of the next generation of leaders educated in our public classrooms.

"Dear Alex,
Four weeks ago, our team at the KDP set an ambitious goal to increase our Blue Kansas Club club by 100 members. Thanks to supporters like you, we only need 20 new sign ups to complete our goal!
The COVID-19 pandemic has proven how high the stakes are to both elect a Democrat into the White House and replace Kansas Legislators who have tried to manipulate the current public health crisis to score cheap political points. We cannot afford to sit back over the next few months, and providing a reoccuring monthly contribution to the KDP is one of the best ways you can help us succeed in 2020.
Our Party is growing because Kansans can feel an undeniable momentum. Hardworking Kansans are sick and tired of the backwards agenda of Donald Trump and his Republican allies, and the KDP is prepared to work tirelessly to elect Democrats up and down the ballot come November.
We’re so close to the finish line - can you help us achieve our goal by joining our Blue Kansas Club team today?
Onward,
KDP Team

Kris Kobach’s proof of citizenship law disenfranchised 30,000 hardworking Kansans and was declared unconstitutional by district and appeals courts.
Now, during a time when our society is demanding real, institutional change, Kansas Attorney General Derek Schmidt wants to make it harder for us to advocate for ourselves at the ballot box by appealing Kobach’s failed voter suppression law to the Supreme Court.
Now more than ever, we must secure and safeguard the right to vote. Sign and share our petition to stand against voter suppression and Kris Kobach’s dangerous agenda.
2020 will be the most important election of our lifetimes. To steward real, institutional change, we must be able to vote for representatives who will advocate for our best interests.

Today is the 10 year anniversary of the Affordable Care Act being signed into law! Over the last decade, the ACA has saved thousands of lives by expanding access to affordable and reliable healthcare services for all Americans, protecting coverage for our neighbors with preexisting conditions and improving healthcare access and services within our rural communities.
However, despite its proven benefits and overwhelming public approval of the ACA, President Trump and his GOP allies have continued to put millions of American lives on the line by trying to dismantle the ACA through a Supreme Court lawsuit.
Health care is on the ballot in 2020 – and the American people know that when it comes to protecting their health care, the Democratic Party is the only party that has their back. Will you sign our petition in support of the ACA so the Kansas Democratic Party can continue to defend the ACA and advocate for Medicaid Expansion across Kansas?
If President Trump’s lawsuit succeeds, 21 million Americans could lose their health insurance, up to 133 million Americans with preexisting conditions could be denied coverage and out-of-pocket costs for premiums and prescription drugs could rise. After 10 years, the stakes couldn’t be higher. If you agree, sign our petition now - no fundraising, no solicitation - just standing up for what is right.
At the Kansas Democratic Party, we believe healthcare is a human right. During this pivotal time for millions of Americans, we’re proud to fight for the ACA and Medicaid Expansion in Kansas. We hope you will join us in pledging your support and sharing this petition to advance our cause.
Onward,
KDP Team

It’s official! Joe Biden just named his running mate: Kamala Harris. We couldn’t be more excited for her to join the ticket -- and make history as America’s first female Vice President.
Over the next three months, we need to do everything we can to replace Trump and Pence with Biden and Harris. That means organizing volunteers, protecting voting rights, and expanding our efforts to get out the vote for Democrats up and down the ballot in Kansas.
With Joe Biden and Kamala Harris leading the ticket, I know we can do this. But it’s going to take all of us to win in November. This is a historic moment, and Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are counting on us to help send them to the White House. Can you rush a donation to the KDP's 2020 Coordinated Campaign to power our efforts to turn Kansas blue?

Did you see us on MSNBC? Following the shocking video released today of Senator Wagle promising to gerrymander Kansas' federal and state districts to advantage Republicans for the next ten years, we're getting national attention. Watch our segment on MSNBC here.
From Chris Hayes: ""But for every local State Legislature, whatever Party wins their State Legislature, they get to draw the Congressional maps that will last for the next ten years.""
We know we've said this before, but this election will be the most consequential of our lifetimes. To ensure all Kansans, regardless of their political affiliation, are represented equally over the next decade, it is critical we end the Republican supermajority ahead of redistricting.

Did you see Susan Wagle's comments on redistricting? In a shocking video, Senator Wagle admits that Republican leadership in the Kansas Legislature is planning to gerrymander Kansas' federal and state districts to advantage Republicans for the next ten years. Watch her words for yourself here.
Susan Wagle just said the quiet part of Republicans’ strategy to manipulate our districts out loud. By promising to gerrymander districts in the Kansas Legislature and write Rep. Sharice Davids out of office, Republican leadership just made it clear they intend to undermine the voices of hardworking Kansans.

This weekend, the Topeka Capital-Journal released a report outlining the Brownback Administration’s failure to protect children in foster care. This scathing exposé is the latest example of how Brownback’s failed tax experiment devastated our communities and made life more difficult for hardworking Kansans.
In 2018, Kansas voters united behind a better future by electing Governor Laura Kelly. In 2020, we must build on our momentum to continue electing Democrats up and down the ballot.
There’s a lot on the line in Kansas this year, including breaking the GOP supermajority in the state legislature, protecting and expanding our reach in Kansas’s four Congressional districts, and electing a Democrat to the U.S. Senate for the first time since 1932. These Democratic gains are within our reach, but they will require heavy investment in digital organizing, voter registration and Democrat mobilization across the state. In 2018 we made history - can you help us do it again this year by chipping in $20, $35 or $50 to our 2020 Coordinated Campaign?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
The latest from the Topeka Capital-Journal is a reminder of how important it is to elect Democrats in 2020. Donate today to help us elect legislators who will champion affordable healthcare, public education and safe communities for Kansas’s most vulnerable children.

Today, the KC Star Editorial Board condemned Roger Marshall’s “profoundly foolish” refusal to protect hardworking Kansans while he travels across the state. By refusing to wear a mask and follow the basic public health guidance, Roger Marshall is proving to Kansans he has no regard for the public safety of our state or our ability to mitigate this virus.
If Roger Marshall won't protect us in Kansas, how can we trust him to advocate for our best interests in the U.S. Senate? Short answer: we can't, because he won't.
The Kansas Senate race is neck and neck. But while Roger ""Unmasked Again"" Marshall shows time and time again he is unwilling to put hardworking Kansans above the hyperpartisanship of Washington, Dr. Barbara Bollier is proving she will be an independent, voice of reason for our state. Hardworking Kansans need someone who is up for the task as their next U.S. Senator. Can you take a stand against Roger Marshall's negligence and help us elect Dr. Barbara Bollier along with Democrats up and down the ballot by donating to the KDP's 2020 Coordinated Campaign?

Earlier this week, Donald Trump touted his use of hydroxychloroquine to fight COVID-19 - a drug public health experts have warned against. Shortly after Trump made his brazen claim, U.S. Senate Candidate Roger Marshall praised the use of hydroxychloroquine, stating he was “relieved President Trump is taking it.”
Thankfully, the Kansas City Star Editorial Board called Marshall’s rhetoric out for what it is - a shameful political move to curry favor with Trump. In their words: “If Trump jumped off a cliff, would Kansas Rep. Roger ‘Doc’ Marshall copy that, too?”
Donald Trump and Roger Marshall’s latest disregard for the truth and public safety is a reminder of how important it is to elect Democrats in 2020. Now more than ever, it is clear we must elect representatives who will listen to the public health experts and put hard working Americans above their political agendas. Can you help us elect Democratic candidates up and down the ballot who will lead with competence and compassion by chipping in $20, $35 or $50 to our 2020 Coordinated Campaign?

Donate today to elect commonsense Democrats in Kansas who will solve the COVID-19 crisis by listening to the experts.

As Governor Kelly takes the appropriate measures to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus in our communities, Republican legislators downplay the gravity of the COVID-19 and play political football with the Governor’s executive responsibility to keep hardworking Kansans safe from COVID-19 exposure.
Thankfully, the Editorial Board at the Topeka Capital-Journal is calling the behavior of these Republican Senators exactly what it is -- “an unnecessary distraction” from Governor Kelly’s “sensible” decision making. In their words, “It was disappointing to watch the Kansas Senate recoil at her [Kelly’s] leadership and attempt to restrict her emergency [[URL REDACTED]] needs the full powers of her office.”
At the KDP, we recognize this is an unprecedented and challenging time for many of you. The last thing we need right now is for our state legislators to undercut our Governor as she makes the tough decisions necessary to keep Kansans safe.
If you agree and are able to, please consider donating to our cause. Your donation will go towards electing Democrats statewide, breaking the Republican supermajority and ending this dangerous partisan behavior.

Let Governor Kelly Do Her Job to Protect Kansans
By The Topeka Capital-Journal Editorial Advisory Board
If the past week of action to battle the novel coronavirus has taught us anything, it’s that circumstances change quickly. Actions that once seemed unthinkable — closing school buildings for the rest of the term, for instance — become yesterday’s news.
Kansas has been lucky during this outbreak to have Gov. Laura Kelly at the helm, because she has sensibly but flexibly led, taking aggressive action when the science warranted it.
And that’s why it was disappointing to watch the Kansas Senate recoil at her leadership and attempt to restrict her emergency powers. As of Thursday, the Senate and House compromised on a bill that would allow for legislative oversight of those powers and require monthly extensions of her emergency declarations. While the compromise is better than the original Senate measure (which would have prevented her from limiting movement, a possibly critical action in battling the virus), it’s still an unnecessary distraction.
Look, we get it. Kelly is a Democrat and many Republicans in the Legislature are reluctant to give her any credit or power whatsoever. But they’re heading home now, having passed a bare-bones budget. She remains governor and continues to navigate our state through turbulent waters.
Kelly needs the full powers of her office.
What was most disturbing, perhaps, was watching select Republicans downplay the threat of the virus on and off the floor. We get it. Understanding the peril posed by COVID-19 is an uncomfortable exercise.
But we’re all in uncharted waters, here. This is no hoax. A serious pathogen is spreading around the world, and until we are able to fend it off with a vaccine, medical treatment or hard-won herd immunity, we need to take all the precautions we can.
Think of it this way. We don’t believe our homes are going to burn down in a fire. But we’ve seen it happen to other houses, so we’re cautious. We buy smoke detectors. We pay for fire departments. We understand that protecting ourselves means taking individual and collective action, and empowering the state to protect the general welfare.
In the case of this virus, the Senate was actively trying to keep the governor from putting in a smoke alarm. They were trying to tell her we don’t need fire trucks.
No town of any size would dream of going without a fire department. Likewise, the Kansas governor has emergency powers for a reason. She should be able to protect the people of this state without needless red tape.

"Poor people ""don't want health care."" ""Every day, over 10 terrorists and criminals try to cross [the U.S.-Mexico] border."" Who said these blatant lies? Hint: not Kris Kobach!
Roger Marshall. He's running to be our GOP opponent in the U.S. Senate race this November, but Kobach's over-the-top extremism has overshadowed him and the other equally extreme Republicans trying to win the nomination.
Make no mistake: Roger Marshall might not get all the attention Kris Kobach does, but he'd vote the exact same way in the U.S. Senate – to gut our health care to pay for more tax cuts for the rich. Click here to fight back against the out-of-touch Republicans we're up against >>

""Democrats elected a Governor and captured one of the state's...Congressional seats in normally Republican Kansas.""
We've heard it for decades: Kansas is a solidly red Republican state that Democrats have no business competing in. But for just as long, Kansas Democrats have beat the odds – in fact, the above quote is from a post-election [[URL REDACTED]] 1956.
And you know what? The next sentence reflects the conditions we've always dealt with – even if the Republican at the very top of ticket runs away with the presidential election, Kansas Democrats should never be counted out.
We won big in 2018, and we can do it again in November. Please make a contribution to our 2020 Grassroots Campaign!

We've seen over the last two weeks in the Kansas Legislature just how important each election is. While Gov. Laura Kelly announced a bipartisan Medicaid expansion deal right before the legislative session started and everyday Kansans have tons of issues that need to be addressed, right-wing Republicans have sprinted to eliminate abortion rights from the state constitution with an insane, out-of-touch constitutional amendment.
Gov. Kelly alone can't accomplish what the vast majority of Kansans want – not when Republicans pushing Brownback-style tax experiments and fringe pet projects are in charge. Kansans are demanding change, both in Topeka and in Washington.
You're going to hear a lot from naysayers over the next several months. With your help, we can prove them wrong. After all, that's kind of what we do.

2020 is a big year for Kansas Democrats. With a U.S. Senate seat, four Congressional seats (mine included!) and the future of the Kansas Legislature on the line, it’s on all of us to get the job done.
The Kansas Democratic Party is running full steam ahead to November 3rd, making sure candidates up and down the ballot have the training and resources they need to be successful. Additionally, they’re building one of the most robust Coordinated Campaigns in Party history to elect Democrats statewide.
As a nation, we are facing an unprecedented health and economic crisis and the need for competent, caring and hard-working individuals to serve in our local, state, and federal government is more important than ever. Kansas must elect Democrats up and down the ballot in 2020 who will fight for affordable healthcare, anti-corruption policies and an economy that works for all of us.
If you are able, I hope you will join me in supporting the Kansas Democratic Party’s 2020 Coordinated Campaign to elect Democrats across Kansas. We made history in 2016 and 2018, and I know we can do it again in 2020 starting with your contribution. In the spirit of this year’s critical election cycle, can I count on you to donate $20.20 to the KDP today?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
We cannot afford to sit back over the next few months. Together, I know we can make a real difference across Kansas.
With gratitude,
Representative Sharice Davids

Kris Kobach's pile of special interest money for his U.S. Senate campaign is growing - just a few days ago, it was reported billionaire tech mogul and Trump backer Peter Thiel poured another quarter million dollars into a super PAC dedicated to electing Kris Kobach in 2020.
It's no surprise that Kris Kobach is already beholden to his dark money interest groups - but if he's elected, you can be sure he will do more to advocate for his big donors than everyday, hardworking Kansans.
Although Kris Kobach has billionaire donors backing his campaign, we have something stronger - our network of dedicated supporters willing to put in the work to defeat Kris Kobach again in 2020. Can you chip in $20, $35, or $50 to our 2020 Grassroots Campaign so we can DEFEAT KRIS KOBACH once and for all?

In November, we have a real opportunity to elect Kansas' first Democratic U.S. Senator since the 1930s, but to be successful we will need to overcome the special interest groups dedicated to electing Kris Kobach. Donate today to stand up for real Kansans, right now.

Yesterday, Governor Kelly signed a bipartisan agreement to continue protecting our communities from COVID-19 exposure.
Despite the continuous attempts of GOP Legislators to undermine her leadership, jeopardize the health and wellbeing of hardworking Kansans and put Kansas's federal COVID-19 aid at risk, Governor Kelly never stopped putting our best interests first. Since day one of this crisis, Governor Kelly has shown the nation what strong, bipartisan leadership looks like.
At the KDP, we are immensely proud to have Governor Kelly as our leader - but we know that in 2020, we must elect Democrats into office who will follow her lead of putting hardworking Kansans first. We know these are extraordinary times, but the COVID-19 pandemic has only proven the importance of breaking the Republican supermajority in the Kansas Legislature and electing more Democrats into local and federal offices. Can you chip in $25, $35, or $50 to help elect Democrats across the Sunflower State?

Today is Martin Luther King, Jr. Day. More than half a century since Dr. King's death, his dreams of freedom, justice, and equality resonate across our national character as resolutely as they were delivered from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial.
In January 1968, Dr. King made his only public appearance in Kansas. After meeting with community leaders in Wyandotte County, the civil rights icon spoke at Kansas State University. It was the last speech he would deliver on a university campus.

Alex,
Welcome to the KDP Weekly Rundown – the Kansas Democratic Party’s update of the biggest things going on in the state party and the state government. What are we focused on this week? 2020 Washington Days featured speakers announced, State GOP continues to block Medicaid expansion despite wide support, Wagle votes in billionaire's interest before asking for job reference, Governor's KPERS plan rejected, House approves bill to address missing indigenous people, Dodge City election official faulted, Johnson County election commissioner appointed, the Nevada caucus, and more!
KANSAS DEMS ANNOUNCE 2020 WASHINGTON DAYS SPEAKERS
What's happening?
This year's slate of speakers will include: State Auditor and candidate for Governor of Missouri Nicole Galloway, former KS-02 Representative Jim Slattery, Lieutenant Governor Lynn Rogers and Governor Laura Kelly! You don't want to miss this year’s Washington Days lineup; reserve your spot now to make sure you’re present at Kansas’ largest gathering of Democrats, March 6-8!
STATE GOP CONTINUES TO BLOCK MEDICAID EXPANSION DESPITE WIDE SUPPORT
What's happening?
(The Wichita Eagle) - As the Legislature heads into a critical week full of votes on possibly dozens of bills, there’s no sign Medicaid expansion will be among them. Early hopes among supporters that they could pass the proposal in the first few weeks of session are quickly fading.
Senate President Susan Wagle, a Wichita Republican, has vowed to continue a blockade of expansion until the House advances an amendment asserting that the Kansas Constitution doesn’t guarantee the right to an abortion. The continuing standoff means two expansion proposals – including the Kelly-Denning compromise – will remain stuck in a Senate committee.
Sen. Gene Suellentrop, R-Wichita: ""WE WILL kick a Medicaid Expansion Bill out of this Committee” when the amendment passes the House.

KANSAS NUNS URGE LEGISLATURE TO PASS MEDICAID EXPANSION
What's happening?
(The Topeka Capital-Journal) - Seventy-six Kansas Catholic nuns have signed a letter to legislators urging them to pass Medicaid expansion as a desperately needed life-saving benefit for suffering Kansans.
The nuns wrote: Expansion increases access to high-quality care for those who would otherwise go without health care. We implore you to approve Medicaid expansion because we cannot wait any longer to give Kansans the care they so desperately need.
* Where can I learn more?
* Kansas nuns urge Legislature to pass Medicaid expansion. The Topeka Capital-Journal, February 25, 2020.
KANSAS RECORDS SHOW 4 MEDICAID ABORTIONS IN 7 YEARS
What's happening?
(KCUR-NPR) - Republican legislative leaders blocking a push to give Medicaid coverage to about 130,000 more Kansans say they fear the expansion’s impact on publicly funded abortions. Other Republicans and Democrats reject that argument as a red herring.
The Kansas News Service has learned that Medicaid has paid for a total of four abortions in the state between Jan. 1, 2013, and this month.
The federal Medicaid program relies on a mix of state and federal money. Federal law prohibits Medicaid spending on abortions with three exceptions: If the woman was a victim of rape, a victim of incest, or the pregnancy could kill the mother.
Kansas law prevents that by banning state spending on abortions “except to the extent required by federal law.”

WAGLE VOTES IN BILLIONAIRE'S INTEREST, THEN ASKS FOR JOB REFERENCE
Billionaire Phil Ruffin
What's happening?
(The Wichita Eagle) - Kansas Senate President Susan Wagle, a Wichita Republican, seeking a White House appointment to a diplomatic post in 2018, listed billionaire Phil Ruffin, a close friend of President Donald Trump, as a reference days after she voted for a bill beneficial to Ruffin’s business interests in Kansas.
Wagle outlined her aspirations to get out of Kansas politics to serve as an ambassador in the Trump administration in a May 7, 2018 email to a political operative. The request came 10 days after Wagle cast a vote to ease the way for racetrack casinos in Kansas, a longtime goal of Ruffin, a Las Vegas-based casino mogul who owns both the Wichita Greyhound Park and the Woodlands racing track in Kansas City, Kansas.
In a recent interview about the vote and Wagle's aspirations, Ruffin became combative with the reporter and hung up the phone.

KANSAS SENATE PASSES SPORTS GAMBLING PLAN DESPITE CONCERNS
What's happening?
(Topeka Capital-Journal) - The Kansas Senate on Wednesday moved to legalize sports gambling over objections from Democrats who complained that a deal brokered after two years of haggling too heavily favors casino managers.
Senate Minority Leader Anthony Hensley, D-Topeka: This bill is of the casinos, by the casinos and for the casinos.

HOUSE REPULSES GOVERNOR'S KPERS PLAN
What's happening?
(Topeka Capital-Journal) - Kansas House Republicans rejected Gov. Laura Kelly’s strategy of refinancing state pension system liabilities and deflected a bid to advance the Democratic governor’s bipartisan plan to expand Medicaid to at least 130,000 low-income adults and children.
Rep. Tim Hodge, D-North Newton: I have a hard time with one side of the aisle claiming they’re the saviors of KPERS when just a few years ago they were raiding. I hope the body can understand and see what could arguably be called hypocrisy of this debate right now.

(The Associated Press) - Kansas lawmakers are looking to encourage training for law enforcement agencies to help address the high rates of murdered and missing indigenous people.
The House approved a bill unanimously Wednesday that calls for closer collaboration between Native American tribes, the Kansas Bureau of Investigation and other agencies.

CONGRESSIONAL REPORT FAULTS ELECTION OFFICIALS IN DODGE CITY POLLING CHANGE
What's happening?
(Topeka Capital-Journal) - Three weeks before the November 2018 election, Ford County Clerk Debbie Cox unilaterally decided to move the town’s only polling site in anticipation of a construction project she feared could interfere with Election Day traffic. The American Civil Liberties Union of Kansas expressed concerns that the new location, located outside city limits and lacking public transportation, would disenfranchise a predominantly Latino community.
The congressional investigation determined Cox moved the polling site “without conducting appropriate due diligence, without consulting with the local community, and without taking simple steps to reduce the impact of the move on thousands of voters until after a public outcry.”
Lauren Bonds, legal director for ACLU of Kansas: It’s a logical outcome that was disregarded, that this would have a disparate impact on the Hispanic community and communities of color in Dodge City.

BREAKING NEWS: Mike Pence will continue to travel and campaign despite having contact with an aide who tested positive for COVID-19.
Over 220,000 Americans have died from COVID-19 and more than 8.5 million Americans have been infected, yet Donald Trump and Mike Pence continue to flout public health guidelines and recklessly expose Americans for their political gain. Now more than ever, it is obvious we must elect new leadership to steward our country out of this virus. There are only 9 days left until November 3rd, can you rush a donation today to help us mobilize voters and get out the vote?

If you saw our last email, you know about the latest attempt from Susan Wagle and GOP leadership in the Kansas Legislature to score cheap political points while putting Kansans in harm's way. The actions of these legislators are alarming, concerning, and most of all, dangerous - but, that’s not why I’m writing today.
When GOP leadership tried to pigeonhole Governor Kelly into getting what they want - stating that it was in her ""best interest"" to sign their bill - Governor Kelly took the high road:
At the KDP, we are immensely proud to have Governor Kelly as our leader - but we know that in 2020, we must elect Democrats into office who will follow her lead of putting hardworking Kansans first. We know these are extraordinary times, but the COVID-19 pandemic has only proven how important it is to break the Republican supermajority in the Kansas Legislature and elect Democrats into local and federal offices. Can you chip in $25, $35, or $50 to help elect Democrats across the Sunflower State?
This year, we need to elect Democrats up and down the ballot who lead with the same empathy, principle and perseverance as our Governor. Donate today so we are successful.
Onward,
Vicki Hiatt
KDP Chair
\--- FORWARDED MESSAGE ---
Alex,
Days after Dr. Fauci warned reopening prematurely would cause ""needless suffering and death,"" Susan Wagle is playing politics - again - in an attempt to undermine Governor Kelly.
Yesterday, Susan Wagle made a Hail Mary attempt to gain leverage over Governor Kelly, stating “We won’t allow one dictator to determine everything… We will have a check and a balance of power...” Yes, this is the same Susan Wagle who has single-handedly held Medicaid expansion hostage for up to 150,000 Kansans before and during an unprecedented pandemic - the exact circumstances in which people need healthcare to survive.
Governor Kelly has shown the nation what real leadership looks like during this crisis, she made tough decisions early on that mitigated the spread of COVID-19 in our communities, and she developed a comprehensive plan to reopen Kansas safely.
It shouldn’t be a novel concept for our legislators to work together and listen to public health experts to keep Kansans safe during a crisis. That’s why, with your help, we must break the Republican supermajority in the Kansas Legislature by electing commonsense Democrats who will work together to advocate for all of us. We know these are extraordinary times, but the COVID-19 pandemic has only heightened the stakes of the 2020 election. Can you chip in $20, $35, or $50 to help us recruit, train and elect Democrats across the Sunflower State?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Now is the time for all of us to follow the prescribed guidelines to keep our neighbors, loved ones and communities safe. Donate today to elect legislators who will do the same.
Onward,

Last week, the Chair of the Kansas Republican Party publicly asked Susan Wagle and Dave Lindstrom to drop out of Kansas’ U.S. Senate race, sparking outrage and division among the Party.
The latest move by Kansas Republicans proves the Republican State Party is worried about their electoral prospects in 2020. And why shouldn’t they be? With Donald Trump’s unprepared, chaotic COVID-19 response failing to keep Americans safe, coupled with Republican U.S. Senate candidates who don’t have the interests of hardworking Kansans at heart, Kansas voters are getting tired of the GOP’s backwards agenda.
Kansas Democrats, on the other hand, are working together to make key investments in digital organizing and a robust 2020 coordinated campaign to materialize Democratic victories up and down the ballot. To contrast Democratic unity against the GOP’s disorganization, can you contribute $20, $25, or $50 to improve our campaign infrastructure and Flip Kansas Blue in 2020?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
In 2020, we know hardworking Kansans will continue to vote for representatives who fight for health care reform, worker’s rights and an economy that works for all of us – all of which will be on the ballot in November.
Donate today to help us elect Democrats across Kansas and put a Democrat into the White House come November.
Onward,

The race to November 3rd starts today. Before things really pick up, we wanted to take a moment to say thank you! The Kansas Democratic Party is as strong as we are today because of you, and we are so grateful.
After yesterday's primary, we finally know our 2020 candidates - it's official, Democratic women are the nominees in every federal race in Kansas! We're already making history in 2020, and you can help us continue our momentum!
This year, we have the opportunity to end the Republican supermajority in the Kansas Legislature to pass Medicaid expansion and protect our districts from unfair, partisan gerrymandering, along with expanding our reach in Kansas' four congressional districts and sending a Democrat to the U.S. Senate for the first time since 1932. 2020 is shaping up to be a big year for Kansas Democrats - but we need your help. Can you chip in now to kick start our general election fundraising goal?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
The next 90 days will shape the future of our state and entire country, and a donation of $25, $50, or $100 will make all the difference. In the spirit of this critical election year, can we count on you to pledge your support to the Party with a donation of $20.20?
Donate today to stand up for all hardworking Kansans in 2020.

"Dear Alex,
Eight weeks ago, our team at the KDP set an ambitious goal to increase our Blue Kansas Club by 100 members. Thanks to supporters like you, we only need 13 new sign ups before midnight tonight to complete our goal!
As we enter the final stretch of this year's election cycle, providing a reoccuring monthly contribution to the KDP is one of the best ways you can help us succeed on Election Day.
Thanks to big wins in 2018 and our hardworking 2020 campaigns, our Party is growing because Kansans can feel an undeniable momentum. Hardworking Kansans are sick and tired of the backwards agenda of Donald Trump and his Republican allies, and the KDP is working tirelessly to elect Democrats up and down the ballot.
We’re so close to the finish line - can you help us achieve our goal by joining our Blue Kansas Club team today?

Hello,
The LPKS Executive Committee has just finished a called meeting. I am writing to update you on our new plans for the 2020 State Convention.
Due to the current orders in the State of Kansas which prohibit group meetings, and for the safety and well-being of our members, we are taking the following actions.
1. The convention has been changed from a physical in-person meeting to a remote convention.
2. The afternoon session, silent auction, speakers, and banquet are canceled for now. (We will attempt to reschedule those activities later this year.) We will have a mixer on Friday, April 17th and the business portion of the convention on Saturday, April 18th. Both will be held via an online platform to allow members to attend from home.
3. We're finalizing plans for the means by which to conduct voting and party business. Members will be able to participate by computer OR phone.
4. As would be true for an in-person convention, only registered Kansas Libertarians will be able to vote. But the business meeting will be open to all to observe.
5. There will be no charge for either the Friday night mixer or the Saturday business meeting.
6. Those who have already purchased tickets for the afternoon session and banquet will receive a separate email from Treasurer Ric Koehn about your refund.
7. If you plan to participate as a voting member you will need to email Mike Kerner at [[URL REDACTED]] by April 15th with your name, email, phone, and address so we can confirm you are an LPKS member.
8. If you are seeking to nominate yourself or another member for office (LPKS Executive Committee, Libertarian nomination running in the state of Kansas, or delegate to the national LP convention) please also include this information in your email to Mike Kerner (see item #7).
9. Confirmed participants will receive needed links and/or dial-in information via email.
10. Confirmed participants will also be invited to a “practice convention” on Saturday, April 11th at 10 am. This will be an opportunity to familiarize ourselves with the voting platform and procedures for having a distance meeting.
If you have any questions about registration please contact Mike Kerner at [[URL REDACTED]]
Otherwise please feel free to reach out to me personally. Thank you for your flexibility. Stay safe and I hope to see you soon!

Hello Friends,
I hope you and your loved ones are safe and keeping your spirits up during these uncertain days.
As you know we have been planning and promoting our LPKS 2020 State Convention. As of now, that is still scheduled for Saturday, April 18th in Gardner, KS. Of course, we are concerned about the spread of Covid-19 and we are exploring many questions. Will we be banned from gathering at that point? And if not, would it be wise to do so? Will the venue and speakers be available? How many people would actually show up? And so on.
The Executive Committee plans to make a decision by the end of March. We are gathering information, researching what would be needed for a safe and prudent meeting, and preparing contingency plans in case we need to meet remotely. In which case we would be conducting the business of the party via email or some other form of electronic voting. To help us prepare for that we could really use your help. Especially if you are considering running for office or becoming a delegate to the national Libertarian Party convention. If you are, or if you plan to nominate someone please let us know! Normally nominations can be made in person at the convention. But in the event of a ""virtual convention"" we will want to get those names out to people.
LPKS Leadership positions: There are three District Coordinator seats (First, Second, and Fourth) as well as the Treasurer position open for election this year. You can nominate yourself or another member of the LPKS, but we will need to verify their membership and that they are willing to serve.
Running for office: You may seek to be the Libertarian candidate for one of the 125 State House seats, 40 State Senate seats, four U.S. Congressional seats, one U.S. Senate seat, or any other county-level seat if it is a partisan race.
Delegates to National: This year we have ten delegate slots (and ten alternates) to fill. Keep in mind the National LP convention is scheduled for May 21-25 in Austin, and that it too may need to be modified in some way.
If you intend to run for, or nominate someone else, please send the name, city, email, phone, specific office and district number if applicable to our Secretary Mike Kerner.
[[URL REDACTED]]
Also please note that based on feedback and the desire to streamline our procedural time there will not be any by-laws changes voted on this year.
If you have any questions or input please let me know. Take care of yourselves and each other. We shall be following up soon.
