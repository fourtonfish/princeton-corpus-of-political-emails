"Get Paid to Support GOP candidates!
## GET PAID TO SUPPORT TRUMP & CONSERVATIVES!
Good morning!
Every day we see that college-aged Republicans and conservatives are under attack and their freedom of speech is being suppressed by liberal academic elites. It seems the Liberal Left only believe in freedom of speech when you say something THEY agree with. This is unacceptable, but Mission 1791 is ready to take action!
Let me tell you about Mission 1791
Mission 1791 hearkens back to the year when the United States ratified the Bill of Rights. Many young conservatives on college campuses feel under attack and that their right of free speech is being overlooked or even suppressed by liberal academic elites. Mission 1791 is funding the fight to help these young voices rise up, especially in races where liberals are pouring in millions of dollars to buy seats in Congress.
With so many students limited to online classes, this is the perfect time for them to get involved this election cycle and make a difference in some of the most competitive races! Mission 1791 is funding 1,791 young people, college students, and recent grads to travel to 30+ states and earn real political campaign experience while still continuing their online coursework.
Do you know a young person that you think would be a good fit?
Details:
* Positions pay up to $3500 per month + bonuses
* Eligible for college credit
* Travel expenses covered, including food stipends
* Time for online classes allotted in the morning
* Campaign work includes communications, media management, event coordinating, canvassing, and phone banking.
To learn more about Mission 1791, visit our website: [[URL REDACTED]] Please pass it this info along to anyone that might be interested!
Warmest Regards,
Caitlin
Political Director

Dear Alex,
I hope this letter finds you and your family well, and that you enjoyed your weekend despite the heat. I’m glad to be back in Nebraska after a quick trip to an equally hot Washington D.C.
This weekend, on a rare Saturday vote, the House passed the bipartisan Emergency Stopgap Stabilization Act. This initiative will help fix funding for the US Citizenship and Immigration Services, which employs hundreds of people in Lincoln and throughout Nebraska. I’m pleased that after months of hard work, we are able to provide some peace of mind for all those whose service is essential to our country. Now it’s the Senate’s turn to get things done.
Supporting the essential work of Nebraskans is important for the success and strength of a community. I’ll let Pat Ohmberger speak to this. I appreciate the kind words in her letter published over the weekend in the Lincoln Journal Star: [[URL REDACTED]]

I would like to be able to continue serving you and getting things done for our communities. Campaigns are tough, and while it pains me to ask for donations in such a difficult time, I would truly appreciate your support. Let’s get things done and let’s get them done together. If you’ve donated before, or put out a yard sign, or shown your support in any way, I’m humbled and grateful. If not—now would be great!

Thank you, as always, for your support and friendship.

In other news, last week my opponent hosted a fundraising event with Rep. Eric Swalwell from California. Some of you may recognize his name— he ran for president this year as a candidate in the Democratic primary. Here are three things you should know about him:
1. He supports Medicare for all.
2. He supports universal access to abortion— with no limits.
3. He supports restrictions on responsible gun ownership.
These may be popular positions in California, but they don’t work in Nebraska. Even Joe Biden doesn’t support Medicare for all (given the harm it could cause), and he made sure it was out of the Democratic party platform. Kate Bolz has aligned herself with political leaders like Swalwell. I guess it’s one way we can find out where “present not voting” Kate Bolz stands.
Please know that I’m here to help, especially during this pandemic. The issues that are important to you are important to me. So many of you have given money, put signs in your yards, and done things for me that I may never be aware of— and I can never thank you enough for that. Campaigns take up resources, so if you can help me, now would be great!

Your friendship is important to me. I am proud of the company I keep.

Dear Alex,
Do you remember some years ago when former Senator Bob Kerrey came back to Nebraska from New York to try and reclaim a Senate seat--while making fun of us in the national media? It didn't work out for him.
Now he is back again, trying to help my opponent in her congressional campaign. Here are some hard facts.
The national political divide is sad and nasty. By calling out for help from Bob Kerrey, my opponent is appealing to national activists and the wealthiest political class to quietly fund her campaign.
We are a state filled with good opportunity, stable communities, and a respect for just governing authority. We rightly recoil at turmoil in the streets and extremist calls to defund the police. We appropriately discuss our nation's wounds and how we can do better in Nebraska. We can't take these good things for granted---look at what's happened across America.
My opponent has a record of hiding from hard issues, not taking positions--all the while appealing for money from the timed out New York political class.
I've worked very hard to be a good representative for you. I talk to people constantly, those who agree, those who disagree, and those who want solutions.
I want you--and everyone-- to know that I'm here to help.
Can I ask for your help again? Campaigns are expensive and messages need to be delivered.
Tomorrow is a critical fundraising deadline. Can you consider a gift of $100, $250, or $500 (the max is $2,800), or whatever you can afford, to help?
PLEASE STAND WITH ME
Asking for money in such a difficult time in our country pains me. Please know that every dollar truly does help me to continue to protect Nebraska, and protect America.
Right now, we’re just $12,872 shy of our fundraising goal. As a trusted supporter and friend, thank you for reading this--help if you can.
I DEPEND ON YOU
Thank you for your consideration, your continued trust in me, and most of all, for your friendship.
Best,

Alternate text
Dear Alex,
I’m sure for many of you August is the time when your family, like mine, begins the countdown to the start of school! This year, that countdown is looking a little different. Already there’s been lots of discussion on how we can achieve a safe and successful opening that is workable for everyone- students, parents, and teachers alike. I’ve been able to participate in a number of district wide conversations on this subject, and I’ve been struck by the thoughtfulness and determination our educational leaders have put into finding solutions.
Success is achieved by our ability to take action. I am optimistic that everyone involved will work hard to give our children the school year they need and deserve.
But as we’re still enjoying summer, I have an important announcement to share with you. This week the President signed the Great American Outdoors Act, a signature piece of legislation I helped lead. This initiative will enhance our national parks, help maintain the beauty and quality of our outdoor spaces, and protect our land and water.
Here in Nebraska, we love our outdoor spaces, from the Pine Ridge to the Platte River, and are privileged with easy access to some of the most beautiful spots in our country. The Great American Outdoors Act means that you and your family can enjoy hiking, camping, and exploring in these special places for years to come.
The protection and preservation of our natural spaces has been an American ideal for centuries, and I am pleased Congress came together in support of it.
If you’ve been able to support my campaign throughout this summer, I truly thank you! These have been challenging times and your generosity and friendship is humbling. Ahead of us is a new challenge; we’ve got less than one hundred days until the election. Your continued support is much appreciated! If you’ve considered contributing, now is a great time to jump in. It’s like climbing a mountain. We can make it to the summit by being determined, harnessing some grit, and working together.
Thank you, as always, for your friendship.

Dear Alex,
I write to you on the plane heading to Nebraska from Washington, DC. I hope you and your family are well.
This week the House of Representatives finished what are called appropriations bills. (I serve on the House Appropriations Committee.) We have spent the balance of the month working on next year’s budgeted expenditures. While significant philosophical differences prevented unity between Republicans and Democrats, I want to highlight a significant area of agreement, a portion of our work on the Agriculture bill.
The pandemic has caused many of us to make a digital leap into telework, tele-education, and telemedicine. However, our country lacks full broadband infrastructure and we are fixing that with a significant new investment for America. Second, the pandemic has shown us how vulnerable we are to China. Many drugs are made there. I would like to see ""Made in America"" on every prescription bottle. We've taken steps to stop China's unfair practices.
On another note, I think I can make it in time tonight for my daughters’ dance recitals. It will be good to be home in Nebraska.
If you supported the campaign over the last few weeks, a big THANK YOU! We met our fundraising goals, but now we start over again as we race through the next 100 days to the election. If you can contribute again, excellent. If you've been thinking about it, now would be a great time. If you simply can't, I understand.
Please know I’m here to help— to help as we fight our way through Covid, recover our nation’s health, and rebuild opportunity in America.
If you can help right now with a $25, $50, or $100 contribution ($2800 max), that would be great!
Thank you,
Jeff

Dear Alex,
I hope this letter finds you and your family well. Life is picking back up again with school, the return of football, and, with less than fifty days until the election, everyone here is hard at work.
Last week, we released a new television story featuring Wendy and her family. I’m very grateful to Wendy for her courage and heart in speaking out. If you haven’t seen it, watch below:
Alternate text
With the continued unrest in our country, Wendy’s message is a powerful reminder that your safety is the first responsibility of government.
We have a clear choice this November: to defund and destroy, or to rebuild and renew. A country that is safe: Safe from Covid, Safe from destruction, Safe from discrimination, and Safe from foreign adversaries like China.
It’s about recreating an environment where disagreements can be met with tolerance and our children can grow and learn without fear of repercussion for their beliefs. “Defunding and destruction” isn’t purely physical- it’s ideological. It’s our job to uplift the values we hold close and renew our commitment to them.
Please help me.
It’s a tough fight. Our opponents have lots of money and reach. To keep Wendy’s story on the air and the right message in the face of intense opposition, can you consider a gift of $50, $100, or $250, or whatever you can afford?
I truly appreciate all the support you have shown me. Thank you, as always, for your friendship and your trust.

Dear Alex,
I hope this letter finds you and your family well.
It’s a busy time. Each day we get closer and closer to the election, and, each day, our team is working harder and harder to get to that finish line. Here’s a good example: our great team of young interns knocked on 3500 doors in neighborhoods last week!
Ernie had this to say to me.
“I just wanted to say thank you for all you do supporting small business people”.
Alternate text
That’s what this is about. Hard work. Honest work. Getting things done for you.
A major fundraising deadline is tomorrow. After September 30th, our financial data becomes public. You will see how much money will pour into my opponent’s race from all over the country-- money from California to New York.
CAN I COUNT ON YOU?
It takes grit and determination to win— values I know you hold. Can you consider a gift of $50, $100, or $250, or whatever you can afford, to help in our reelection?
I truly appreciate all the support.

Alternate text
Dear Alex,
I hope you and your family are well. Last week, the President invited me to the White House for his speech on the south lawn. It was a lovely evening and there was a great deal of enthusiasm. The earlier speeches from an amazing cross section of Americans were inspiring and represented our unique diversity in our country. I made particular note of the poignant remarks by the Mueller family, who lost their daughter in Syria. I also had a great conversation with Heisman Trophy winner Herschel Walker, who’ll be coming to Nebraska next year.
After the President’s speech, I said to my wife, “Let’s just walk back”. She suggested that maybe wasn’t a good idea, so we boarded a bus instead. Initially, we weren’t able to move, as there was a clear danger nearby. Riot police emerged in order in front of the bus, helping clear the way to exit. I read later about what happened to my colleague Senator Rand Paul and to Herschel Walker as they walked out of the White House.
These harrowing events have become the reality of our country. Each night we watch on the news what’s happening on the streets– riots and fires, violence and destruction. Comparing this chaos with the uplifting messages of all those who spoke last week is like looking at two worlds. I think it is the clearest and most overt example of the choice we have this November. Which America do we want to see— one of defunding and destruction, or one of hope and togetherness?
I’m here to help you. In order to reclaim that America we want to see, I’ll need your help too. If you’ve donated before, or put out a yard sign, or knocked on doors, I truly and humbly thank you. If not, now would be great!

Thank you, as always, for your support and friendship.

Dear Alex,
While we fight back this pandemic for the health of America, I am happy to report some good news that you may not hear.
A while back I met the master filmmaker Ken Burns at the Library of Congress. He taught me something that I had never considered. When we think of defining moments of our country, we think of the Revolution, the Constitution, the Civil War, World War II, and the Civil Rights Movement--all moments in time marked by conflict or leaps of righteous understanding.
But Burns made the case that the creation of the National Park system last century defines America in a way not previously considered. The beauty, the grandeur, and the vastness of our country--and the value of stewardship to preserve and protect special places--found its form in this public act of setting aside unique ecosystems for the lasting enjoyment of all.
This morning the White House informed me that they would like to have me alongside the President as he signs the Great American Outdoors Act into law. I am proud to have helped lead this bipartisan bill passed by the House of Representatives and the Senate. The new law will enhance our National Park System and makes permanent the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which furthers the ideals of conservation and community recreation through projects across America.
Interestingly, when I told Ken Burns I was from Nebraska, he immediately said: ""Where?"" I said ""Lincoln."" Apparently an avid quilter, he was eager to find out if I had seen his collection in the International Quilt Museum at the University of Nebraska!
It's about getting things done.

Dear Alex,
Election day is almost here! Each year I usually walk to my local polling place and vote there. But, of course, this year is different, and I considered mail-in voting. But I decided I’d still like to vote in person. My wife and I will go to the nearby elementary school to vote.
Even that will be different this year, with precautions for the pandemic in place, but our civic duty remains the same! The gift of America is that we all have an equal say in determining our future.
I think our election officials here have done everything possible to make sure voting is safe and that your ballot is secure. That’s also the gift of Nebraska.
I hope I’ve earned your support!
Thanks, as always, for your friendship and trust.

Dear Alex,
I hope this email finds you and your family well.
Earlier this week, my opponent and I had our second debate, right here in Lincoln. It was thoughtful and spirited, and it highlighted some important differences.
For instance, our differences in showing up for work, and making hard decisions: Kate Bolz didn't vote 30% of the time in the legislature over the last two years. That’s nearly five hundred votes. For over three hundred of those, my opponent stood on the sidelines and watched others make decisions for Nebraska—on some of the most important issues for our state, like
* protecting children from sexual predators;
* healthcare;
* and prohibiting dismemberment abortion.
Her explanation for not voting: “It’s not about punching a clock.”
You know, and I know, that governing is about showing up, working hard, and making tough decisions. It’s about your trust. And you can trust me to always be here for you. I punch the clock for you, every day, for Nebraska, and for America. That is my commitment to you.
Let’s get this job done, together. If you can help me, I would greatly appreciate it. We have 18 days until the election. It’s closing in fast, and we need all the support we can get.
CAN I COUNT ON YOU?
Can you consider giving $50, $100, $150, or whatever you can afford, to support my reelection?
I truly appreciate all of you who have already supported me. Your enthusiasm and energy—the yard signs you’ve put out, phone calls you’ve made, the kind words you’ve said—that keeps me going when things get tough. If you can help again, and get us over that finish line, please do.
Thank you, as always, for your friendship and your trust.

I’m all about getting things done for Nebraska and for America.
Today we launched a television commercial set in one of our great rural communities. Mark Nemec is the proprietor of a small business, the Kolac Korner Café in Prague, Nebraska. And like many of you, and many more across the nation, the coronavirus pandemic put a strain on his ability to provide for himself and his employees.

This is what getting things done is about--coming together as a community and supporting one another. It’s important work and it's work we do best together.

Today’s the day. Our final push to finish the quarter strong.

Think of it like this: there’s two minutes left in the fourth quarter. We started the drive on our own 10-yard line. We’ve been running the ball but now it’s time for the final push.

Dear Alex,
I hope this letter finds you and your family well.
Last week, my opponent Democrat state senator Kate Bolz tried to defend her voting record in the Nebraska Unicameral.
Over the past two years, Kate Bolz didn’t vote 30% of the time. Over 400 votes missed.
Here’s a few of the bills she missed: on LB814, prohibiting dismemberment abortion—she sat by and watched, not voting, as other leaders made decisions; on over two dozen Appropriations Bill votes, she was missing in action—the committee of which she is vice chair.
Nebraskans show up, work hard, and get the job done. Imagine not coming to work a couple of days a week. Bolz has been far too busy campaigning for a promotion to Washington DC.
Trust is an important part of governance. Those in power have to be able to make responsible decisions.

I will stand for you. I am here to help, work hard, and get things done.

Dear Alex,
I hope you are well and weathering the COVID-19 crisis. I don’t have to tell you that the pandemic, the senseless death of George Floyd, and the divisive political moment are taking their toll on our country.
Your votes in Nebraska’s primary election May 12 made for a strong election result and I want to thank you for your many years of support and friendship.
Now it’s general election season, and my opponent has been chosen.
In today’s hyper-partisan political environment, candidates need to be taken seriously.
We are prepared to win and to win well. My opponent will be aggressive—possibly hostile—and well-funded.
My opponent will hide her core beliefs (because most voters in Nebraska’s first district don’t share them) and run a campaign full of attacks, while claiming to be kind and caring.
It’s already started.
She’s ready to receive big money from billionaire activists and ideologues, many of whom mock our Nebraska values and the way we and our families choose to live.
Will she get that funding? It’s unclear at the moment. But if she does, I want to be ready.
PLEASE STAND WITH ME
Can you consider a gift of $100, $250, or $500 (the max is $2,800), or whatever you can afford, to help in my reelection?
Asking you for money in such a difficult moment for our country pains me. But I need the resources to give you good representation, to be in a position to continue to help others during this time, and to ensure that your representative brings thoughtfulness and unity to Washington, rather than slander and hate.
I DEPEND ON YOU
Know I will continue to work tirelessly for Nebraska. As we fight our way back from COVID- 19, please know that I am here for you—here to help, person by person, farmer by farmer—until we restore our health system and economic well-being.
Thank you for your consideration, your continued trust in me, and most of all, for your friendship.

Dear Alex,
I hope this letter finds you and your family well.
This weekend, my opponent and I will be having a series of two debates on KETV and NET. This is a good opportunity for you to see the real contrast between the two of us.
You know me, I like to tell stories. The timed debate format doesn’t always allow for me to do that, so I’ll tell one now.
This year I’ve received about 50,000 pieces of mail—emails and letters—from constituents like you. I review every one of them. Recently, I received a letter from a man about his local post office. He was concerned that the flag outside the office hadn’t been flying for sometime. So I called the postmaster myself and she knew right away why. “It’s about the flag, isn’t it?” She wanted to get it fixed but she just didn’t have the help. I called our local electric company and they lent a helping hand to fix it.
It’s about getting the job done. and doing things together. It may be a small thing, but seeing that flag flying—it's a meaningful thing. Being able to help you is meaningful to me. Helping one another in the big things and in the small.
It’s a tough race and we’re inside the last thirty days. I’m here to help you and, if you can help me, I would greatly appreciate it.
Can you consider a gift of $50, $100, $150 to my campaign?

Dear Alex,
I hope this email finds you and your family well.
This week we released a new television story about Matt’s Act, a bill I wrote to help lower prescription drug prices. The story features single father Ron Regalado, whose determination to help his son after a diagnosis with diabetes is really inspirational.
Alternate text
We all want better healthcare, at better prices, with better options. If approached thoughtfully and creatively, healthcare policy could be unifying for our country. Matt’s Act could fundamentally change our approach to prescription drug pricing, starting with a reduction in insulin prices by as much as 70 percent.
You may have seen my opponent and I debate healthcare. Kate Bolz has a five-sentence plan in favor of a public option, which is another step toward further centralizing healthcare in Washington leading to Medicare for All.
My goal is to lower costs, improve outcomes, and protect vulnerable persons. I will always support caring for those with preexisting conditions while:
1) Expanding access to affordable insurance
2) Expanding Coordinated Care
3) Promoting Prevention and Wellness
There is so much more to say on the topic—but rest assured these are top priorities.
I need your help to get this race wrapped up well.

Dear Alex,
Do you remember some years ago when former Senator Bob Kerrey came back to Nebraska from New York to try and reclaim a Senate seat--while making fun of us in the national media? It didn't work out for him.
Now he is back again, trying to help my opponent in her congressional campaign. Here are some hard facts.
The national political divide is sad and nasty. By calling out for help from Bob Kerrey, my opponent is appealing to national activists and the wealthiest political class to quietly fund her campaign.
We are a state filled with good opportunity, stable communities, and a respect for just governing authority. We rightly recoil at turmoil in the streets and extremist calls to defund the police. We appropriately discuss our nation's wounds and how we can do better in Nebraska. We can't take these good things for granted---look at what's happened across America.
My opponent has a record of hiding from hard issues, not taking positions--all the while appealing for money from the timed out New York political class.
I've worked very hard to be a good representative for you. I talk to people constantly, those who agree, those who disagree, and those who want solutions.
I want you--and everyone-- to know that I'm here to help.
Can I ask for your help again? Campaigns are expensive and messages need to be delivered.
Tomorrow is a critical fundraising deadline. Can you consider a gift of $100, $250, or $500 (the max is $2,800), or whatever you can afford, to help?
PLEASE STAND WITH ME
Asking for money in such a difficult time in our country pains me. Please know that every dollar truly does help me to continue to protect Nebraska, and protect America.
Right now, we’re just $12,872 shy of our fundraising goal. As a trusted supporter and friend, thank you for reading this--help if you can.
I DEPEND ON YOU
Thank you for your consideration, your continued trust in me, and most of all, for your friendship.

"Secretary of State sends cease and desist letter to Eastman campaign, orders them to preserve evidence
# Republican Party of Nebraska Statement on Eastman Campaign’s Alleged Election Law Violations
10-30-2020
Media Contact: Ryan Hamilton | [[URL REDACTED]]
LINCOLN, NE – The Nebraska Republican Party released the following statement from Executive Director Ryan Hamilton after revelations of the Eastman for Congress campaign’s alleged illegal ballot harvesting scheme:
“The Eastman campaign’s scheme to illegally act as ‘agents’ and request ballots in voters’ names raises serious election integrity questions. Kara Eastman must immediately order her campaign to cease all activity and cooperate with the investigation into the alleged criminal activity being conducted on her behalf.
“Eastman must answer whether she knew her staff was engaging in this illegal activity and whether she ordered them to do so. If the answer to either question is yes, she must immediately withdraw from the race and turn herself in to the proper authorities.
“The integrity and security of our elections is of paramount importance. If a candidate is willing to so blatantly violate the law in order to win an election, she is unfit to hold the office she seeks.”
Background:
Nebraska Secretary of State Release
Cease & Desist from Nebraska Secretary of State to Kara Eastman Campaign
Ne. Rev. Stat. § 32-943(2): “A candidate for office at such election and any person serving on a campaign committee for such candidate shall not act as an agent for any registered voter requesting a ballot pursuant to this section unless such person is a member of the registered voter’s family.”

“We selected Kearney because of its central location in the state and because it is located in the heavily Republican third district,” said Chairman of the Republican Party of Nebraska Dan Welch. It has been eight years since our last convention in the Third District, and we couldn’t be more excited to head back to the heartland of Nebraska,” he continued. “This convention will be a reflection of the unprecedented unity and enthusiasm in our party for this President and Republicans up and down the ticket.”
To attend the state convention as a delegate, delegates must be elected at their county convention. Guest tickets are available at a cost and include breakfast and lunch. More information about the convention, including how to register as a delegate to a county convention or as a guest to the state convention, is available at [[URL REDACTED]]
The event will be open to credentialed media only. Media seeking access may apply today through May 29, 2020 to receive a valid credential for the convention floor. Media registration is available at [[URL REDACTED]]

"Pro-life measure, tax relief legislation make final passage in the unicameral.
Friend,
2020 has been full of major success for Republicans and the causes we champion. Just today, Nebraska passed major legislation that will impact our state for generations to come.
* Thanks to the leadership shown by Republican Senator Suzanne Geist and her fellow GOP colleagues, a measure that will put an end to dismemberment abortion overcame procedural obstruction in the Judiciary Committee, surviving the an extraordinary motion to pull it to consideration before the full body and passed final reading today. This is a significant victory for the pro-life cause in our state and our country!
* Thanks to Republican Senator Lou Ann Linehan, major property tax relief will be implemented for the first time in more than a decade. Senator Linehan's bill is a step in the right direction toward delivering long term, even more substantial tax relief to Nebraskans. You can read more about it here.

If that weren't enough, today is the Ernie Chambers last day in the legislature. Chambers will no doubt enter Nebraska's Hall of Shame for his disrespectful remarks toward our country, his colleagues in the legislature and his extreme, divisive political beliefs and rhetoric.
Goodbye, Ernie! You will not be missed!
All of this after the exoneration of President Trump and the continued exposure of the Russian collusion HOAX and Obamagate, his vindication at the impeachment trials and many other victories. Speaking for myself: I am not yet tired of winning!
Chip in to help us keep up the good work!
In Liberty,
Ryan

It is clear today that if Joe Biden wins, he will not be - he cannot be - in charge. He will delegate out important presidential functions to the partisan aides that surround him and direct his actions.

"Plus: Sign our Thank You Card for Governor Ricketts!
Democrats are chomping at the bit as their efforts to use the global pandemic caused by COVID-19 to enact sweeping social change fail.
In the last two days, their attempts at petty politics during a time of national crisis have crashed—and they're still burning.
We need your help to make sure that stays true.
The Democrat Governor of Wisconsin attempted to cancel that state's election after the GOP-controlled legislature insisted that polls ought to remain open on Election Day in addition to the major efforts to get mail ballots returned.
A judge agreed with the GOP, and Democrats' attempts to rework an election with rules more favorable to them has been laid bare for the whole nation to see.
Here in Nebraska, leftists attempted to make hay out of the response to COVID-19 being handled by Governor Ricketts, one that has been previously praised on the national stage.
See for yourself what liberals in the Democrat Party wanted you to think was happening in Nebraska, to gin up fear in an attempt to influence policy:
This particularly short-sighted liberal didn't have to wait long before being corrected about the efforts in Nebraska to combat the spread of COVID-19. You can see the egg splitting on Senator Morfeld's face as each word flows out of Dr. Fauci's mouth.
In this time of crisis, our leaders, from Governor Ricketts to our delegation in Congress, are doing intrepid work to ensure the people of America are safe. Why does Senator Morfeld want others to believe so badly that our effort is failing?
Help us make sure people like Senator Morfeld never get access to the power of the majority. He and his friends in the Democrat Party prove time and again: they just can't be trusted with power.
## Let Governor Ricketts know you are with him and grateful for his nationally recognized, round-the-clock work to keep our state safe.
# Sign our Thank You Card here.

"You won't believe what he said yesterday.
Friend,
Senator Ernie Chambers has a history of the most divisive, repulsive rhetoric in the history of Nebraska's legislature.
Yesterday, he launched into a disgusting rant that tops all the rest, viciously attacking Senator Slama and indulging in a disgusting inference about what he might do, supposing he ""enslaved Senator Slama.""
Don't take my word for it - listen for yourself.
“Suppose I had raped White women? Suppose I enslaved Sen. Slama, and used her the way that I wanted to.”
Help us defend Senator Slama
It doesn't end there. Chambers went on to suggest that Senator Slama, a graduate of Yale University, occupied her position as a nature of ""favors of a fleshy nature.""
On the floor of the legislature!
""She was given favors [[URL REDACTED]] of a fleshy nature were expected in return.""
I wish that I could say this was shocking to hear, but Chambers has been disgracing the legislature with hateful vitriol for decades. The time to hold him accountable has long passed: his colleagues need to censure him for his remarks from the floor.
Contact your state legislator today to let them know they need to hold their colleague, Senator Chambers, accountable for his rhetoric on the floor of the legislature.
Sincerely,
Ryan Hamilton
Executive Director, NEGOP
P.S. - if you can, please chip in to help us push back against this disgusting vitriol. Your contribution helps us spread this message and defend our conservative principles.

## RNC RECOGNIZES NEGOP AS STATE PARTY OF EXCELLENCE
Donate Today!
Friend,
Great news! Our state party has been recognized by the Republican National Committee for core competencies related to fundraising, communications and political planning and campaigning.
The RNC's program works to ensure state parties are meeting high standards of performance through three stages: getting started, Chairman's Circle and President's Circle.
Only 50% of state parties have made the cut to President's Circle. The process started more than a year ago, and the final results just came in yesterday. It comes with a critical boost to our campaign efforts!
I'm writing to see if you'll help chip in to celebrate this big recognition from the RNC to help us continue our efforts of excellence in campaigning and party management.
We need two major things right now:
1) Make a donation of any amount to help us fund our mail, door knocks, live calls, and digital ads into battleground districts
2) Sign up to volunteer to contact your friends and neighbors to help get President Trump re-elected.
Can we count on you to help us bring this thing home for President Trump, Congressman Bacon and our down ballot candidates? I hope so!
Best regards,
Ryan Hamilton
Executive Director

Friend,
This afternoon, a skeleton crew in the NEGOP to check the mail and inspect the building was subject to (another) attack: a vandal threw a rock through our alley-facing window while staff were inside opening mail.
This is the fourth such attack that our headquarters has endured in the last two years. This latest attack is in addition to a brick being hurled through our front window, a BB being shot at it several months later, the word ""RESIST"" being spray painted on our building.
Help us fight back!

Alex,
You know Rep. Don Bacon fully backs our police officers and they’re working together on meaningful reforms. Don will STOP any attempt to defund our law enforcement. He knows that a huge majority of Nebraskans STRONGLY OPPOSE the radical defund the police movements and the violence overtaking communities across the country, so we wanted to make sure you had a way to show exactly what you believe.

Alex, we’re almost there -- there are only 10 days left until Election Day.
In 10 days, Nebraskans will head to the polls and select the next candidate who will represent us in Washington. Make no mistake: if Kara Eastman wins, she’ll entirely dismantle the Affordable Care Act and replace it with Medicare-for-All. This plan is so radical that even Joe Biden said he would veto it.
In Washington, Don Bacon has worked to protect pre-existing conditions, make healthcare affordable, and fix our broken system. Unlike Kara, Don doesn’t work for special interests groups or Hollywood donors . . . he fights for Nebraskans.
Alex, we’re in the fight of our lives and every dollar counts. Don needs your urgent help to fight back in these final days of our campaign. Can you rush in any amount to fight for the future of our district?

Alex,
Radical socialists are flooding our district in support of Kara Eastman, who will vote with them to establish their radical agenda. The latest piece of their radical agenda includes the BREATHE ACT, which seeks to defund the police . . . and that’s just for starters.
The BREATHE ACT defunds local and federal police while giving the money to welfare programs. It even bans ankle monitors and dramatically reduces the Department of Defense’s budget, which incentivizes states to get rid of gang databases and shuts down jails and prisons.
Alex, this bill is incredibly dangerous. It encourages socialism and anarchy in our nation while defunding those who protect us.
Remember, the ones supporting this bill are the same people
who campaigned for Kara in Omaha.
You know that Don Bacon stands with our police. In fact, Don was just endorsed by the Omaha Police Officers Association’s more than 900 members, and they voted UNANIMOUSLY to support Don’s re-election.
Can you join me in supporting Don TODAY and
strongly oppose The Squad’s latest stunt?

Katie Porter launches new PAC to elect more people like her
Alex,
Kara Eastman has proven too radical for even Democrats in Nebraska. So now she’s getting support from Bernie Sanders and Rep. Katie Porter, who is also known as “Batgirl” for wearing a batman costume around Capitol Hill. They are doing everything they can to hijack our district.
We can’t let this happen.
They know how important Nebraska is to the fight in the House and in Washington, D.C. to keep America from becoming a socialist country.

Alex,
It’s clear to me that the radical Democrats in Washington are pushing the socialist agenda, and our opponent Kara Eastman will join right alongside them.
The socialist agenda means:
* No longer having a choice in your family’s healthcare decisions
* Stripping millions of families off their independent health insurance
* Raising taxes on hard-working American families to pass radical legislation like the Green New Deal
That’s exactly what Kara will work to accomplish in Congress.
This agenda will never pass while I’m in Congress. The last thing we need is another big government program led by Kara Eastman that harms the very people it claims to help. Alex, Pelosi’s big government socialist agenda puts all Nebraskan values at risk.
That’s why I’m launching the Stop Kara Money Bomb \-- we have less than 50 days before the election and less than 48 hours to meet our mid-month fundraising deadline. Will you help me fight back by working to take back the House and fight for our Nebraskan values?

We need all hands on deck fighting back against this dangerous threat. Our deadline ends in 48 hours so chip in NOW. HURRY!

Joe Biden and Kamala Harris admitted that they’ll raise taxes, defund the police, and open our borders. There’s nothing even CLOSE to moderate in the Biden-Harris plan, in fact their plan is even more liberal than Bernie Sanders’ agenda. And Kara couldn’t be happier.
Alex, our August fundraising deadline is TONIGHT at MIDNIGHT, and we need your urgent support. Don is pushing back against the rise of socialism, the far-left mob, fighting for the safety and security of our communities, and putting Nebraskans over some radical agenda.

Alex,
Kara Eastman’s agenda is so radical that even Joe Biden said he’d veto it. There’s nothing remotely moderate about stripping 180 million Americans off their health insurance and forcing Nebraskan families to rely on government-run healthcare.
Kara may claim that she’ll fight for Nebraska, but the truth is that she’s too obsessed with pushing the socialist agenda to learn what Nebraskans really want. The last thing that Omaha needs is another mini AOC who parrots socialist talking points instead of fighting for our district and country.
There’s nothing moderate about raising taxes on working families to secure a radical agenda. Alex, there are less than 50 days before Election Day. Don Bacon sent you an email yesterday introducing our Stop Kara Money Bomb. Our mid-month deadline ends tonight, and we’re incredibly short of reaching our goal. Can you chip in now?

Alex,
With left-wing radicals rioting in our cities, pushing job-destroying socialism in Congress, and threatening to defund police departments nationwide, the LAST thing we should do is let them take power here.
That’s why it is CRITICAL for us to re-elect Don Bacon and defeat Kara Eastman, who is more left-wing than any Democrat who has served Nebraska in Congress during my lifetime. Kara Eastman is endorsed by all kinds of socialist groups, she supports AOC’s “Green New Deal” (and its $80 trillion price tag), and never saw a tax she didn’t want to raise.
The good news is that because of Kara Eastman’s radicalism, lots of level-headed Nebraska Democrats are coming over to Don’s team. They know Kara’s D.C.-style radicalism is not a good fit for Omaha.
But while Kara Eastman’s socialist agenda may be out of touch with local voters, it is very much in touch with left-wing all over the country. So she is raking in TONS of money.
To fight back, we are counting on you to help reach our July fundraising goal, and the deadline is Friday night. We still need donations from another **137** patriots, so please make one important gift today, Alex.

Now that the primary election is over, it’s time to take on Kara Eastman and the rest of her fan club. Don Bacon is dedicated to keeping socialism out of Nebraska, but it is not going to be an easy fight. The radical socialist Democrats have made NE-02 their NUMBER ONE TARGET because they know that the road to socialism goes right through our district.
Don Bacon is standing up to make sure socialism stays OUT of Nebraska and America. Our campaign created the DEFUND KARA EASTMAN’S FAN CLUB FUND to make sure Don has the resources he needs to defend Nebraska from their billionaire out-of-state allies.

We’re reaching out to you today with a request. We’re facing an uphill battle to take on Kara Eastman and her radical agenda. I know I don’t have to remind you of what’s on the line this November.
Kara Eastman’s radical agenda will affect all of us. She wants to pass the full socialist agenda, which includes raising prescription costs, and effectively removing any freedom of choice from healthcare decisions.
You’re an incredible supporter of Don Bacon, and I wanted to ask if you would record a short video explaining why you’re supporting Don Bacon for Congress. Check out examples and record a video of your own here >
I know that Don would greatly appreciate your efforts to push us over the edge with so little time left before Election Day.

My opponent Kara Eastman is so extreme that she’s willing to trash our entire healthcare system in favor of ultimate government control over Nebraskan families. She’s willing to throw 150 MILLION PEOPLE OFF their current healthcare plan and throw another 30 MILLION PEOPLE OFF Medicare Advantage.
Alex -- that’s not only radical, it’s dangerous.
Do you really want the government running your healthcare? Imagine a world where have to wait in long lines to see a doctor you’re not already comfortable with. This is the kind of socialized healthcare Kara Eastman wants to bring to Nebraska.
I’m fighting back against Kara’s government-controlled healthcare plan and working to lower prescription costs and increase vaccine development because I want to do what’s best for your family.
Universal healthcare is a socialist dream program that will cost taxpayers billions of dollars and strip healthcare decisions away from American families. Will you help me STOP Kara and her radical agenda? >>>

The August fundraising deadline is almost here and I’ll be honest -- we’re behind on our goal. We’ve raised 72% of our fundraising goal so far, but I need the help of my grassroots supporters TODAY to make this goal and stop the socialist agenda from taking over our district.

I hope this email finds you well.
It’s been a hot July in Omaha and our election is heating up as well, which is why you’ve heard from my campaign team a few times, asking for help with our July fundraising goal.
As of this morning, we still need donations from an additional *87* supporters, so I urge you to chip in your best donation today.
Despite the heat, Team Bacon has been out in the community talking with voters, with more than 350 local volunteers helping to spread our message and expose the truth about Kara Eastman’s ultra-liberal agenda:
• I stand with our men & women in blue, while she supports actions that will defund the police (though she lacks the courage to say the words)
• I am bringing pro-growth and pro-jobs leadership to D.C. to help get America back on her feet after the pandemic, while Kara embraces socialism and wants to enact destructive policies like the absurd “Green New Deal”
• I spent three decades in uniform protecting our freedoms, while she wants our kids and grandkids to inherit a country that is less secure, less prosperous, and less free!
If you could offer one contribution of our campaign today, it would be a huge show of support and help me spread that message during the crucial weeks ahead.
Thank you,
Don Bacon
P.S. This race is considered a “toss up,” and a lot of out-of-state liberals are pouring huge money into my opponent’s campaign, so your gift today will make a big difference. Thanks again!

This is big:
The respected, non-partisan Cook Political Report just moved our race from “Leans Republican,” to “Tossup.”
This means that the D.C.-based liberal campaign groups will increase their spending here in Nebraska’s 2nd District, hoping to give ultra-liberal Kara Eastman a crucial advantage over Don Bacon in the home-stretch of this election.
She’s already taken money from far-left groups, and she has been personally endorsed by the most famous of all the D.C. socialists – Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
But now, Kara Eastman is going to enjoy a surge of fundraising support from the liberal establishment in Washington.
To keep pace – to ensure the left-wing money machine doesn’t overwhelm our campaign and drown Don’s message in negative ads – we are increasing our fundraising goal for July. Will you help make sure we get there?

We only have LESS THAN 24 HOURS LEFT until our FEC fundraising deadline. I wouldn’t ask if it wasn’t important, Alex, but this could be the BIGGEST fundraising deadline of the election.
Kara has the support of her socialist fundraising machine -- she is receiving funding from socialist groups like The Justice Democrats (the same group that got AOC elected), Bernie Sanders and his radical group have openly backed Eastman, and recently, Rep. Katie Porter launched a SUPER PAC to specifically help radicals like Kara.
Alex, the fight for the future of our district could come down to this deadline.
I’m working hard to keep conservative values in Nebraska and keep socialism out of our district, despite Kara Eastman’s efforts to do otherwise. I understand the importance of bipartisanship during times like these, and I have made it a priority to put the people of Nebraska’s best interests first -- not some radical political agenda.
But to keep fighting I need the URGENT support from people like you, Alex.

Just now: Roll Call called it. Don Bacon was named the most vulnerable member of Congress. Alex, this is it: we’re literally in the fight of our lives.
We have less than 4 weeks until Election Day and we’re not just the DCCC’s TOP TARGET \-- the Justice Democrats and Kara’s far-left liberal allies have their eyes on NE-02 as well.
They’re all sending Kara endless funding from their bottomless pockets in an attempt to take Don down and convert our district into a socialist wasteland.
Our district is GROUND ZERO, and while we’ve made incredible momentum so far, the fight is far from over. Will you rush in an emergency donation RIGHT NOW to stand with Don and fight back?

Alex,
Don Bacon has taken a strong stance against radical socialist policies because he understands that we must stop the rise of socialism in our country NOW. Kara Eastman’s policies include a full embrace of socialism endorsed by Bernie Sanders, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC) and other members of the squad. These policies would destroy the America we know and love.
Here’s a look into what Kara Eastman would bring to Nebraska:
* TAXPAYER-FUNDED healthcare for illegal aliens
* NO RESTRICTIONS on abortion up until the moment of birth
* Stripping private health insurance away from 180 MILLION Americans
Alex -- that’s just the beginning.
Unlike our opponent, Don’s campaign is not funded primarily by out-of-state Coastal elites. Our state cannot afford dangerous socialist policies and our own version of AOC. Kara is so far left that she’s losing endorsements from her own party.
Our deadline is up at MIDNIGHT TONIGHT. We’re only $2,823 short of reaching our fundraising goal. Help us reach it:
Rush in $25
Rush in $50
Rush in $100
Rush in $250

Alex,
We’re getting ready to take on our opponent in November... and this election will be crucial to defending our nation from socialism.
We’re fighting the fight against the Green New Deal, socialized healthcare, defunding the police, and countless other liberal policies. The future of America will hinge on this election.
Every voter in our district will receive an early ballot request form for the upcoming election. It’s crucial that you get out and cast your ballot to protect the American dream. I’m reaching out to you today to ask if we can count on you to vote >>>
I’d love to see all Nebraskans get out and make a plan to vote to secure the future of our great American experiment. Can I count on you to vote, Alex?
Count on me!
I can’t wait to hear from you, Alex!
Thank you,
Don

This is it.
We are at the finish line.
In just ONE WEEK, Nebraskans will head to the polls and vote for the future of Omaha. Alex, you get a say in our future -- so make it count!
Our opponent is a far-left progressive who will vote with “The Squad” every single time. She’ll vote to pass Medicare-For-All, the Green New Deal, and a slew of other progressive policies.
Here’s the truth: the choice to stop socialism from invading Nebraska comes down to you, Alex. We have less than a week to get Don’s message of freedom out and fight to protect Nebraskan values. Make a difference NOW!
Can you join me in fighting for Don and protecting freedom by chipping in today? Your support goes directly towards protecting Nebraskan values and stopping the socialist left.
Chip in >>>>
Alex, I know that I don’t have to tell you how urgent this is. If we don’t re-elect Don, we risk giving socialists a foothold in our state for decades. Join our team and stop the socialists >

Alex,
Who’s going to be making healthcare decisions for you and your family? Nebraska doctors or D.C. bureaucrats?
With our country moving through an unprecedented pandemic, the issue of healthcare is emerging as a central part of the 2020 campaign.
That’s why we’re checking in with you and some other concerned Nebraskans to get a sense of where you stand.
Please take just one minute of your time to register your views and tell us who you trust on the issue of healthcare:
TAKE THE SURVEY
While Kara Eastman claims to be a moderate, her “Medicare-for-All” socialist healthcare plan seems like it’s ripped off from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (which wouldn’t be shocking, since AOC endorsed Kara Eastman).
Kara goes so far as to say we should provide FREE HEALTHCARE FOR ILLEGALS.
Even liberal JOE BIDEN says her government healthcare takeover is too radical for America.
That’s why we want to know where you stand!
TAKE THE SURVEY
During the past four years in Congress, Don Bacon has worked with President Trump to:
\- Defend pre-existing condition coverage
\- Lower prescription drug prices
\- Speed up vaccine development
\- Find bipartisan solutions to expand affordable coverage
But he needs to know where Nebraskans like you come down on this key issue, which could be decisive on Election Day.
Alex, whatever you think of Socialist Kara Eastman and her scheme for a government healthcare takeover, please let us know ASAP.
TAKE THE SURVEY

Election Day is now less than three weeks away, and Don needs to know exactly what you expect him to stand up for in Congress. This election will determine the future of our nation, and Don believes we can do what it takes to stop socialism from taking over. Don has always fought hard for what he believes in \-- that’s why he’s voting this November, Alex.
But he wants to know what will bring you to the polls this year! It will only take ten seconds to let Don know why you’re voting!
WHY ARE YOU VOTING?
Affordable Healthcare

Abortion
Immigration
The Economy

Did you hear? We have more great news for Don Bacon and our shared values!
Democrats are ABANDONING Kara Eastman, the radical leftist supported by Bernie Sanders and AOC, and joining Don’s campaign.
The latest endorsement is from former Senator and Democratic Vice Presidential nominee Joe Lieberman. He wrote:
“During my time in public service, it became clear to me who the real leaders were. They worked across the aisle and made progress toward a goal; they rose above petty politics and focused on their job working for the people. Don Bacon is one of those leaders… Nebraska needs him, and so does Congress and our country.”
Our way of life is under attack, Alex. Even moderate Democrats refuse to allow this radical socialism to take root in our country.
Will you stand with Don Bacon to defend our nation against socialism?

⚠️ National Democrat groups and far-left special interests are SMASHING fundraising records! ⚠️
Soon, Nancy Pelosi will direct them to send HUGE checks to her hand-picked candidates across America like Kara Eastman.
And the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) already has Don on their Top Target List, while the Democratic Socialists of America and Justice Democrats (the far-left group that elected Socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez) are also pouring huge money into the Eastman campaign.
That’s why we’re launching the Congress is Better with Bacon Fund today!

Your most generous gift to the Congress is Better with Bacon Fund today will help reach our LAST END-OF-QUARTER FEC FUNDRAISING GOAL and spread the truth to Nebraska voters about just how radical and dangerous the Democrats’ agenda truly is.
So please help us meet the $20,000 goal we need to launch the Congress is Better with Bacon Fund! We’re still $14,375 short!

****15 Days Remain until Election Day****
This is it, Alex.
We only have 15 days left until Election Day. You’ve helped us build momentum and keep our race on track over the past few months. And Alex, I can’t tell you how much I appreciate it. But we cannot give up now.
Election Day is right around the corner, and Kara Eastman continues to push her progressive agenda. If elected, she’ll undo all the progress we’ve made. That means stripping Nebraskan families of their health insurance, passing the Green New Deal, and giving free insurance to illegal immigrants -- all funded by our taxpayer dollars.
Alex, this is what we’re fighting back against. If re-elected, I’ll continue to fight for our district and I’ll work to rebuild our economy.

My opponent is quickly working to abolish the Electoral College . . . and make no mistake -- she’ll vote to do it if she’s elected to Congress. That means allowing large liberal states to control our national elections. It also means our voices here in Nebraska are SILENCED.
Alex -- I’m strongly opposed to getting rid of the Electoral College. Nebraskans’ voices deserve to be heard, and every American gets to vote for our President. Abolishing our Electoral College means destroying our electoral system that our founding fathers created and giving control of the future of our nation to a couple states on the coasts.

Alex,
We only have LESS THAN 24 HOURS LEFT until our FEC fundraising deadline. I wouldn’t ask if it wasn’t important, Alex, but this could be the BIGGEST fundraising deadline of the election.
Kara has the support of her socialist fundraising machine - she is receiving funding from socialist groups like The Justice Democrats (the same group that got AOC elected), Bernie Sanders and his radical group have openly backed Eastman, and recently, Rep. Katie Porter launched a SUPER PAC to specifically help radicals like Kara.
Alex, the fight for the future of our district could come down to this deadline.
I’m working hard to keep conservative values in Nebraska and keep socialism out of our district, despite Kara Eastman’s efforts to do otherwise. I understand the importance of bipartisanship during times like these, and I have made it a priority to put the people of Nebraska’s best interests first -- not some radical political agenda.
But to keep fighting I need the URGENT support from people like you, Alex.
Will you take a minute and chip in whatever you can using this secure link? >>> [[URL REDACTED]]

The Justice Democrats said it themselves -- they’re dumping hundreds of thousands of dollars into NE-02 to get Kara Eastman elected. Check it out:
In case you need a reminder: the Justice Democrats are the same radical group that got socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez elected to Congress. Now they’re using that same dark money to get Kara Eastman into the House.
Alex, this group does NOT have Nebraska’s best interests in mind. They support radical policies that would DESTROY life in Nebraska as we know it, and they’ll stop at NOTHING to push their agenda.
They also know how important this race is to taking back the House majority, which is why they’ve made a $350k investment into OUR race!

Multiple organizations are reporting that our district has moved from a toss-up to lean Republican since Kara Eastman became the Democratic nominee. Kara is so radical that Democrats from her own party are endorsing Don Bacon.

Alex,
Last week, Roll Call named me the most vulnerable Republican member of Congress. Do you know what this means? It means the race between me and my opponent is more important than EVER.
Kara claims to be a moderate, but the facts speak for themselves. To give you an idea of what a Kara Eastman victory would look like, consider the following:
✔️ Kara wants to raise taxes, socialize healthcare, and pass the Green New Deal
✔️ Nebraskan Democrats are leaving their own party because of Kara’s radical policies
✔️ My former rival, Democrat Brad Ashford, endorsed me over Kara
✔️ Joe Biden himself said he’d veto Kara’s ideas
Kara's policies are risky, out-of-touch, and and too RADICAL for Nebraska! Not even Joe Biden wants her in charge in NE-02.
So we need all the help we can get this November! This means we need everyone who believes keeping America free from radical socialism -- Republican, Democrat, and everyone in between \-- to support my campaign to protect our freedoms, just like I did for three decades in the Air Force.

Hey Kara,
We know that you and your team are reading our emails and posting them on your social media, so we wanted to send you a message. There’s nothing remotely moderate about your plans, and even Joe Biden said your plans are so radical, he’d have to veto them.
Kara, these dangerous policies that you embrace would destroy the America we know and love. That includes defunding the police, pushing socialized healthcare, and passing the job-killing Green New Deal. These are far from the ideals that Nebraskan values embrace.
Kara, the evidence is in, and it shows that you’re completely out of touch with our Nebraskan values.
To help us battle Kara’s radical policies, Don is asking his top supporters to help us out and chip in $5 right now.
Chip in $5 and send a message directly to Kara Eastman.
Stand up for NE
We cannot allow a socialist who would destroy our economy, defund our police, and put American families at risk to “represent” our district.

“. . . one of the worst Republicans ever to get re-elected.”
Alex,
You won’t believe this.
Kara Eastman recently put out a fundraising email hitting Don Bacon by calling him “one of the worst Republicans ever.” Alex, Don’s career and time in Congress have proven that he is a dedicated public servant who holds Nebraskan values and fights for the future of our state.
Don’s career includes:
* Serving in the Air Force for 30 years with 16 assignments and 4 combat deployments
* Defending against liberal attempts to cut funding to Offutt AFB, Nebraska’s second largest economic driver
* Supporting Government Transparency
* Passing USMCA
* Strengthening our foster care system
* Leading Nebraska's rebuilding efforts after the devastating 2019 floods
* Fighting Back against the rise of socialism
* Working to secure jobs in NE-02
* Building up our national and cyber security to keep families and businesses safe
That’s what Kara considers to be “the worst.” Can you join me in re-electing Don and show Kara that her NY values are not welcome here?
Donate $25
Donate $50
Donate $100

Don Bacon is exactly the right candidate for NE-02. He’ll continue to fight for our district, keep socialism out, and push for Nebraskan values.

Socialism is here . . . in our district. You already know that we’re being targeted by Kara Eastman and the radical left. Kara just released a poll claiming that she’s leading our race by 1% . . . well within the margin of error. She’s using this small lead to raise massive support from California and New York.
This support from the coastal elites, as well as the Justice Democrats and the DCCC, ensured that Kara barely out-raised us last quarter. We need to keep our momentum up to keep socialism out of Nebraska. We’ve made INCREDIBLE progress so far, but we need your help to stand strong and prepare for November.

Alex,
General Don Bacon is the right leader at the right time for this district and our nation.
In this time of confusion and crisis, protests and pandemics, Don is a uniting force bringing people together for good.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, Don and his team have spent countless hours serving the community and helping first responders. He passed legislation to get PPE to those in need. He voted to help families and small businesses to stay afloat.
In trying times, the true measure of someone’s character becomes known.
Democrats are taking note of Don’s leadership, and he’s earned endorsements from former Executive Director of the Nebraska Democratic Party Barry Rubin, former State Senator and Democratic candidate for Nebraska Governor Bob Krist, former Rep. Jim Moran, Valley Mayor Carroll Smith, and now former Senator and Democratic Vice Presidential nominee Joe Lieberman.

Alex,
We’re less than three months out from Election Day, and our race has been moved to one of the most vulnerable races in the nation. Alex -- I hate to say it, but we are in the fight of our lives.
Don has been warning us for months that we’re a TOP TARGET for the far left. Our opponent Kara Eastman has received the full backing of the DCCC this year, as well as the support of hundreds of out-of-state socialist liberals like Kamala Harris, AOC, and the rest of the Squad. They know Kara will vote alongside them and bring Medicare-for-All, as well as the rest of their agenda, to right here to Omaha.
We’ve had great momentum, but the future of Omaha depends on this election. Don Bacon is fighting for the future of our district right now. Will you join him by chipping in $25? >>>
There’s no other way to say it, Alex. There’s a target on our backs, and without your support, we can’t win. Will you step up and support Don Bacon today?

Hey Alex --
Healthcare is shaping up to be a HUGE factor in this election -- and for good reason.
Don knows a global public health crisis is NOT the time to be playing games with Nebraskans’ healthcare coverage, and he’s committed to never putting government bureaucrats between you and your doctor. He will always protect coverage for pre-existing conditions, so Americans who are dependent on medications or treatments to maintain quality of life will never have to worry that it will be taken away.
We’re coming up on the most important campaign deadline of the election on Wednesday, so if you can, please chip in to keep Don as our voice in Washington and stop socialism >>>
We’re asking because far-left radical Kara Eastman has other plans for our healthcare. Kara wants a socialist-styled healthcare system in America with ‘improvements’ such as:
X Eliminating Medicare as we know it
X DMV-style lines at the doctor’s office
X Forcing Americans to provide free healthcare for illegal immigrants
X Faraway bureaucrats deciding which doctor you can see or what treatments and medications you may receive
Healthcare is personal, and Don Bacon will keep the conversation between you and your doctors, not between government bureaucrats.
Your generous contribution to the Don Bacon for Congress campaign today will help Don stand up to Kara Eastman’s socialist radicalism and WIN re-election on November 3rd!
HELP US CRUSH OUR GOAL!
Sincerely,
Kyle

Alex,
Did you hear? Kara Eastman is too radical even for her own party. If Nebraska voted Kara into office, she would turn our state into an unrecognizable playground for Democratic socialists. Alex, Don Bacon is here to stop that. He works hard to bring conservative values to our district, and Nebraskans aren’t the only ones who have noticed.
President Trump recognized how hard Don works for
Nebraska and has given him his full endorsement.
Can you make sure that Don stays as our voice in Congress by supporting him today? Our end-of-month fundraising deadline is right around the corner. Can you make sure we reach our goal?

We are down to the line and almost OUT OF TIME to keep the far left out of Nebraska! I need you NOW more than ever, Alex. You’ve been such a great supporter -- now we need every conservative in NE-02 to chip in to make sure we have the resources we need for Election Day.
Make a Difference
This Election Day is about more than just Trump vs. Biden. This Election Day is about keeping Kara Eastman and her radical, socialist agenda out of Nebraska. I know you feel the same way I do, Alex -- OMAHA IS NO PLACE FOR MOB RULE, GOVERNMENT-RUN HEALTHCARE, HIGHER TAXES, AND RADICAL LEGISLATION LIKE THE GREEN NEW DEAL.
This could be your LAST CHANCE to set the record straight and proclaim your conservative values for Kara to see. Chip in now to make a difference in the upcoming election:

ROLL CALL JUST SHIFTED OUR RACE FROM
TOSSUP TO TILT BLUE.
Alex, this is bad news.
We’re only 5 days out from Election Day and it’s clearer than ever that everything is on the line. Don Bacon is holding the line to protect Nebraskan values \-- and he needs you to join him.
Over the past few weeks, we’ve seen exactly how radical Kara Eastman really is. In Washington, she’ll fall in right alongside “The Squad,” many of whom campaigned for Kara. And Alex, their latest idea is downright scary . . . they’re pushing to defund the Pentagon and our military.
If elected -- which is more and more likely \-- will Kara do this same? Here’s the truth -- we don’t know. Kara’s too busy hiding behind her socialist allies to tell Nebraskans her real plan.
Alex, we cannot afford that and with 5 days left WE MUST HOLD THE LINE AND STOP NE-02 FROM FLIPPING BLUE! Can you chip in today to fight for Don?
HOLD THE LINE
FIGHT WITH DON
This is it, Alex. This is our last chance to stand up for Nebraskan values, will you join the fight and hold the line? [[URL REDACTED]]

Just In: Cook Political moves NE-02 from Likely Red to Toss Up
Alex,
Just this morning, Cook Political declared our race a toss-up. That means it’s possible for Kara Eastman’s socialist agenda to take over our district in just a few months.
Kara’s been fully funded and backed by outside groups like the Progressive Turnout Project, Justice Democrats, the DCCC, her Hollywood donors, and the Squad. If there’s ever been a time to fight back against socialism, Alex -- it’s here.
We’ve made great progress so far, but the fight is far from over. Kara’s dangerous ideology would tear Nebraska apart and turn our district into a socialist haven. Can you chip in $25 RIGHT NOW? >>>
Electing Kara Eastman means stripping away all private health insurance, killing jobs and the economy with the Green New Deal, and defunding our police.
Can you stand with Don today by chipping in?
Donate $25
Donate $50
Donate $100
Donate $250
We need your support to take on Kara’s coastal elite, the DCCC, and the socialist agenda. Join Don >>>

Alex,
Kara Eastman CLAIMS that she’s advocating for Nebraskan families and values, but her fan club shows exactly where her real loyalties lie.
In her rise to the top of her ivory tower, Kara was willing to remain a paid consultant to socialist Nebraskan Senate Candidate Chris Janicek -- who has recently made headlines for sending sexually explicit texts about a female staffer.
Alternate text
While Kara Eastman has called for Janicek to resign, she has yet to comment on the THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS she received from him. She may lecture about her virtues, but in the end, she is more concerned about building up her war chest than about doing what is best for our state.
Kara’s far-left values show that she’s not the leader Nebraska needs.
Stand strong against Kara Eastman’s radical values and liberal friends.
Fight for NE's Future

Alex,
Don Bacon wants to restore peace and security and push back against the radical socialist agenda that’s taking over the far left. Our nation is still seeing violent protests disrupting the peace in Portland and Seattle . . . and that’s just to name a few of the cities that have been impacted.
Don is working to keep this mob rule far out of Omaha. Unfortunately, Kara Eastman cannot say the same. This chaos is exactly what Kara’s radical socialist agenda would bring to Omaha. Stand with Don Bacon by adding your name to our Restore Law and Order Petition >>>
We sent you this petition last week, and your response is still pending. Is this correct?

Alex,
I know my campaign has emailed you a few times over the past couple of days. Our first general fundraising deadline ends at MIDNIGHT TOMORROW NIGHT, and I want to make sure we’re prepared.
As you already know, our campaign is being targeted by the D.C. Democrats who think they can flip the seat and elect Kara Eastman. We’re the TOP TARGET of the 2020 election cycle, and we must be prepared to fight back. Can you donate $25 to keep us on top?
The road to socialism runs right through our district, and we have to make sure we keep socialists like Nancy Pelosi and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC) far away from NE-02.
