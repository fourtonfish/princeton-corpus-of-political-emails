Dear Friend,
For over six and a half years, I have stood watch over Utah ensuring you and your children are safe and protected from sex predators, human traffickers and abusers, and protecting your teens from street drugs, vaping and suicide, and guarding your personal private data and identify from hackers and cyber criminals.
As ballots arrive this week, I hope you will take the time to watch this short video and learn more about me, my accomplishments, and my vision for the Utah AG office for the next four years.
If re-elected in November, my priorities will continue to be: 1) to maintain the highest standards of integrity and legal excellence; 2) keep all Utahns safe from violent criminals, including drug cartels, human traffickers, and elder abusers; 3) protect our families and economy from white collar and cyber criminals; 4) defend Utah from federal overreach and threats such as the opioid epidemic and suicide; 5) preserve civil liberties, public lands, and empower veterans with the critical resources they often lack.
It has been an honor to serve as Utah’s Attorney General along so many highly accomplished prosecutors and legal staff.
Please make sure to vote, as this is one of the most important civic duties you will be tasked with in your lifetime. No matter whether you decide to mail your ballot, drop your ballot off in a drop-off box, or show up to a voter center on November 3, I hope you will cast your ballot.
Lastly, please tune in to your favorite TV news station on Wednesday, October 21 to watch the Attorney General debate, another way to learn more about both AG candidates and make an informed decision.
With respect and gratitude,
Sean D. Reyes
Utah Attorney General

Chairman Derek Brown- Utah Republican Party,info@utgop.org,UTGOP Virtual Convention Opening Day,"View this email in your browser
Fellow Republican:
This has been a fantastic week for the Utah Republican Party! We have transformed the party’s website ([[URL REDACTED]]) into “2020 Convention Central,” where we have information about the candidates, the races, and the convention. It is a “one-stop shop” for all the information that our delegates need to participate in the convention. I invite you to visit the website by clicking here.
Every candidate has prepared a pre-taped “convention speech,” and yesterday morning all of the speeches were released at the same time. It’s clear that delegates are taking their responsibilities seriously, as they have collectively spent over 12,000 hours watching the speeches. I highly recommend that each of you--even if you aren’t a delegate--take time to watch the speeches here.
This morning, voting officially began for the 2020 convention. You can watch the kickoff convention video below. The national anthem was sung by Utah artist Ryan Shupe, Governor Herbert welcomed the delegates, and then I gave a brief introduction kicking things off.
In just the first day of voting alone, an unbelievable 37% of all delegates cast their ballot! It has been a long time since we have seen this much interest and involvement by our state delegates. Many delegates who have served previously remarked that--with everything so accessible--they actually spent more time getting to know the candidates than in the past.
One of our state delegates, who is blind, sent us this heartwarming message:
“This is the perfect convention for me … because I didn’t have to go anywhere, I didn’t have to find someone to drive me to cottage meetings. I didn’t have to get my wife to take the whole day off of work to take me to the convention. I was able to do everything at home. The voting app was perfect. It was very accessible, and utilized the voiceover on my phone … It was a great experience.”
I am excited about how things are progressing, and look forward to seeing who our delegates will select to be our nominees. We anticipate that the results will be announced late Saturday evening, so stay tuned!

Chairman Derek Brown,info@utgop.org,Election Day Is Finally Here!,"View this email in your browser
Hello Friends,
Today is the day!
As a party, we have spent the last 18 months working literally around the clock preparing for today. Our staff, our candidates, and volunteers have all given it everything. Truly, as football coaches are fond of saying, we have “left it all on the field.”
Regardless of what happens nationally, I look forward to Utahns electing Spencer Cox as our next Governor, and Deidre Henderson as our next Lieutenant Governor. I also look forward to rolling back many of the losses we suffered two years ago.
If you haven’t voted yet, it is too late to put your ballot in the mail. However, If you still have your mail-in ballot, you can drop it off at a drop box in your county. You can find ballot drop box locations by visiting [[URL REDACTED]]
You can also still vote in person if you have not voted, by going to [[URL REDACTED]] to find available polling locations.
Exactly 40 years ago today, Ronald Reagan gave his historic address in which he referred to America as a “shining city on a hill.” I believe that today’s election is not a referendum on personalities. It is a referendum on how well we can communicate those principles which made America that shining city, and whether we will keep it. After all, as Reagan also said, “Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction.”
My hope is that, as your party chair, I have helped elevate the discussion during this intense election cycle, and regardless of the outcome, we can all wake up tomorrow and continue to work towards an America with a bright future.
Unfortunately, we will not be gathering tonight as we normally would as a party on Election Night. We hope that you will follow along on the party’s Facebook Page as some of our candidates talk about the election with you throughout the evening.
So, make sure you’ve voted, get comfortable, and together -- let’s watch the red tide roll across our country!

Senator Mike Lee,info@utgop.org,Turn Utah (all the way) Red!,"We need your help View this email in your browser
Fellow Utahns,
After watching the Vice Presidential Debate this week, it is clear the election this November presents two stark choices. We can choose a path that favors freedom, a strong economy with low taxes and reasonable regulation, and a preservation of the Constitution. Or, we can choose a radical path to increase taxes on American families, enact the Green New Deal, use the Coronavirus outbreak to transform our system of federalism into a command-and-control all-powerful central government, fundamentally change our country by stacking the Supreme Court, nuke the filibuster, and eliminate the Electoral College. This should be an easy choice!
In a few days, county clerks around our state will be sending ballots to those who have registered to vote by mail. This means, the election in Utah essentially starts on October 13. If you haven’t registered to vote already, you should reach out to your county clerk to find the best way to cast your vote for the general election.
In Utah, there are two races that I am watching very closely right now. The first race is the for the open seat in Congressional District 1. Blake Moore is the Republican candidate for this seat, and I encourage you to vote for Blake Moore.
Republicans have also nominated Burgess Owens to run against Congressman Ben McAdams in Congressional District 4. This will be one of the closest races in the country, and we need to rally behind Burgess Owens.
In order to help these candidates with their effort to get out the vote in these crucial upcoming weeks, we need to help them with their fundraising efforts. I have set up a fundraising page to help support us in these efforts to get out the vote. These down-ballot races will be one of the most important factors in ensuring that Utah delivers a solid win for President Trump in November.
Democrats are running on their plans to stack the Supreme Court, add new states, get rid of the Electoral College, and enact the Green New Deal. When it comes to radically transforming America, it appears they've finally decided all bets are off.
We can’t afford to sit this election out.
We need to work together to turn Utah back to being a Red State. The best way to do this right now, is to vote for these strong Republican candidates when you get your ballot. Most importantly, we need to get these candidates the resources they need to get through the grueling weeks ahead. I hope you will join me in providing crucial assistance to these campaigns.
Yours in liberty,
Mike Lee

Chairman Derek Brown,info@utgop.org,Utah Deserves Better,"Burgess Owens is a Good Man View this email in your browser
Friends:
Burgess Owens has been sharing his heart-wrenching and incredible life story with Utah. He pulled himself out of bankruptcy, working as a chimney sweep to provide for his young family, creating success out of failures.
In his nationally-televised speech at the Republican National Convention, he said “I’m running for Congress because we don’t need more career politicians. We need a few more chimney sweeps.”
Burgess’s life story showcases everything good about America: an African American man who had nothing, struggled against the odds, and created the American Dream.
Now … do you understand why Ben McAdams and his party are spending millions of dollars flooding the airwaves trying to tear Burgess down?
McAdams is now flooding the airwaves, criticizing Burgess for his failures -- all the while failing to tell you how the Burgess story even ends. Yes, he failed, as we all do. But more importantly, he refused to believe he was a victim, picked himself up, and eventually succeeded.
Unfortunately, McAdams “forgets” to tell us the rest of the Burgess story.
In that light, it’s also easy to see why Burgess is a threat--not only to McAdams--but to the person who has helped him raise those millions, the one McAdams votes with 89% of the time: Nancy Pelosi.
You see, McAdams is about to spend literally millions of dollars in the next two months defaming a hardworking man whose story epitomizes everything good about America.
And after everything Utahns have endured in 2020, they will now watch McAdams’ unrelenting attacks on Burgess for the next two months for simply doing the one thing Democrats fear most: succeed.
However, our party is committed to Burgess’s success, and we need your help.
Please donate TODAY to help us elect Burgess to Congress--a man who, through his failures, has succeeded in creating the American Dream.
After all, when a good man like Burgess succeeds, we all succeed.

The Utah Republican Party,info@utgop.org,Is Bernie Sanders Mainstream?,"View this email in your browser
Well friends, the Democrats have nominated Joe Biden and Kamala Harris for President and Vice President of the United States. This is an historic event because never before in our country’s history have we had a political party openly nominate their Vice President with the stated, specific intent to have that person take over the presidency as soon as possible. Joe Biden even referred to himself as a Bridge to the new generation of Democrats. That new generation includes, not only his running mate, but the likes of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, the rest of the squad and Bernie Sanders.
In Sanders’s Convention Speech Monday, he declared that his campaign moved American in a “Bold New Direction” and that his ideas that were once considered radical just a couple of years ago are now “Mainstream” in the Democrat Party.
You can hear him in his own words here:
In the meantime, “Joe Biden” has proposed a radical left-wing agenda that includes:
* $4 trillion in tax hikes. 82% of Americans would see a tax increase under a Biden Administration.
* A radical immigration agenda that includes open borders, health care for illegals, and citizenship for 11 million migrants.
* Defunding, dismantling, and dissolving police departments.
* Destroying America’s energy sector which would crush more than 10 million jobs.
We deserve better than that. Joe Biden is definitely a bridge, but he’s not a bridge to prosperity. He’s a bridge to nowhere.
Can you contribute today to help us defeat this radical agenda?

Chairman Derek Brown,info@utgop.org,Without Fear or Favor,"View this email in your browser
My Friends,
Last night we witnessed history as Justice Amy Coney Barrett was sworn in as the newest member of the Supreme Court. For several days, the Senate grilled her on every legal and political topic imaginable. And for over 20 hours, she skillfully answered question after question, showcasing a startling breadth of legal understanding, without relying on a single note! It is hard to imagine anyone more qualified or prepared for this critical role.
It was 1993 when Ruth Bader Ginsburg was confirmed by the Judiciary Committee, chaired at the time by then-Senator Joe Biden. Senator Biden set this clear ground rule at the beginning of her hearings: Ginsburg had no obligation to answer any questions about her own political views or about any issue that could come before the Court. This has since become known as “the Ginsburg Rule.”
In what will one day be remembered as a moment of supreme historical irony, during these hearings to replace Justice Ginsburg, Democrats repeatedly attempted to coerce Barrett into violating the very “Ginsburg Rule” that Biden himself established. Of course, she did not fall for the trap. Instead she showcased a cool temperament and level of intellectual brilliance that was, in a word, judicial.
There's one thing I can say with certainty: the Court is in good hands.
In her swearing in speech, Justice Barrett stated: “The oath I have solemnly taken tonight means at its core that I will do my job without any fear or favor and that I will do so independently of both the political branches and of my own preferences. I love the Constitution and the Democratic Republic it establishes, and I will devote myself to preserving it.”
Her commitment to act “without any fear or favor” is breathtakingly powerful. There is, perhaps, no greater qualification we could ever ask for of a member of the highest court in the land than one who can truly act “without fear or favor.”
On a personal note, it is becoming increasingly rare in American political discourse to hear someone utter the words with which she concluded her speech: “I love the Constitution.”
Like Justice Barrett, I too love our Constitution, and celebrate the swearing in of one who feels likewise. It is truly my hope that this coming week Americans will elect public officials that share that sentiment. My friends, yesterday was a good day for our country, and a great day for our Constitution.
With hope for our future,
Derek Brown

Chairman Derek Brown,info@utgop.org,Media Bias Against Burgess Owens,"Help Us Support This Good Man View this email in your browser
Friends,
Burgess Owens, as we are realizing, is the real deal. A black man raised in the segregated south, Owens’ high school experience was like a real-life version of the Disney film “Remember the Titans.” Forced to fight, all while dealing with prejudice and bigotry of his white counterparts, Burgess eventually earned their respect. He later played with the NFL, where some of his most ardent opponents are now his biggest allies.
But, Owens’ journey didn’t stop there. His life has since been an incredible journey of successes and failures that have helped those around him, taught him valuable lessons, and made him the success that he is. McAdams’ story -- Ivy League school, white-shoe law firm, election victory after election victory while climbing the political ladder of success -- well, it simply couldn’t be more different from Owens’s story.
And Owens is still fighting an uphill battle, even today. He is still fighting an onslaught of attacks, not in the segregated south, but right here in Utah, funded by Nancy Pelosi. And while he fights, his opponent receives the privilege of what we call media “puff pieces.”
In fact, a report released yesterday by the Media Research Center (MRC) followed the local coverage of the Owens/McAdams race during the last 10 weeks, and shows us a textbook example of what it looks like for a media outlet to try to subtly “tilt” the election in favor of their preferred candidate.
MRC analyzed all of its stories about the 4th Congressional District during the last 10 weeks, and found that McAdams essentially enjoyed “10 weeks of one-sided favorable coverage.” It also found that while there it had “essentially no negative topics” about the Democrat, there were many stories referencing negative topics about the Republican, Burgess Owens.
More disturbing, not only were there no negative stories about McAdams, they found “an assortment of positive stories which reinforced his campaign themes of independence and service on behalf of Utahns.”
If that statement doesn’t make you angry, perhaps you didn’t read it carefully. Let me repeat it: MRC said that the coverage of McAdams consisted of “positive stories which reinforced his campaign themes.”
This makes my job even more difficult. But as conservatives, we are used to this battle. And here in Utah, it’s the same battle.
Owens’ life is frightening to Democrats like Pelosi, because he has done the one thing Democrats fear most from someone like him: succeed.
And yesterday’s new report simply tells us what we already know: we simply cannot rely on the media to help Utahns get to know the real Burgess Owens. They are more than happy to highlight his failures. But they will never tell us about his successes.
In short, we need your help. Please donate so we can counter these nonstop attacks on a good man--a man whose life is truly the American dream, and who is exactly the kind of person we need in Congress.

Good News Everyone!
Do you know what is the most common question we get at the Utah Republican Party Headquarters? “Where can I pick up Trump Campaign signs?”
Many of you have already purchased campaign signs online or elsewhere, and placed them in your yards. And most of those signs have, strangely … disappeared.
So, to combat the mysterious disappearance of Trump signs all across Utah, we have decided as a party to purchase more Trump Campaign signs … which you can have for FREE!
This Saturday, October 24, 2020, we will have 1,000 Trump signs that we will hand out, for free, on a first come, first served basis (we will limit the number of signs per person).
The UTGOP Team will be at South Valley Specialties in Sandy starting at noon, and going until 4:00 p.m. (or until we are out of signs).
So, come by and pick up a Trump Campaign sign for free! And, when you pick it up, any donation you could make to offset our costs would also be appreciated!
Here is the address for South Valley Specialties (right off the 90th South offramp):
547 West 9320 South

Fellow Republicans,
Today is the primary election day in Utah! As a party, we are thrilled to see the growth of the Utah Republican Party, with over 40,000 new registered voters just this year who have never voted in Utah, and for their first election have chosen to affiliate with the Utah Republican Party.
If you have not mailed in your ballot yet, remember that it must be post-marked by today! And if you would prefer to drop it off in person, rather than mailing it in, simply go to one of the drop off locations in your county before 8:00 p.m. this evening. For more information regarding drop off locations in your county, contact your county clerk at this link.
If you are interested in tracking your mail-in ballot, you can go to this link.
Finally, after today, the real work of the Republican Party begins as we prepare for the elections this Fall. There is so much work to do, and much of it requires resources that will all be used to ensure that the candidates who emerge from the primary today are victorious this November. Please consider making a donation to the Utah Republican Party. A small donation of $5, $10 or even $15 will go a long way in helping to ensure Republican victories in November.
Make this primary election count. Get your ballot turned in and show the Democrats that we are ready to win in November.

On 9/11 I was in Philadelphia, serving as a law clerk for a federal judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. I had spent weeks preparing my judge for hearings that would occur in the federal courthouse.
Ironically, one of our cases involved a man convicted for his role in the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center. The appeal would be heard in the United States Courthouse, which sits just around the corner from one of our most powerful symbols of American liberty: Independence Hall.
After those horrifying events unfolded, the courthouse and all of Philadelphia shut down in a way that we haven’t seen again--at least until 2020.
2020 is the first major election where some of those who are now voting not only have no memory of 9/11, but were not alive when it happened. While these young voters fortunately did not experience the horrors and emotions of that morning, they unfortunately also have no memory of the unity we experienced in America during the days after. It was a time when American flags spontaneously appeared on homes and cars, and--though hard to believe now--members of Congress came together to sing “God Bless America” on the steps of the United States Capitol.
Such unity seems almost unthinkable today. Yet, in many ways, it is even more important now than ever. We can conquer any enemy, as long as we are unified as a country. And to be unified, we need to treat each other with dignity, respect, and love. This does not mean that we do not disagree--after all, productive disagreements are the hallmark of intelligent people.
As one of my favorite political writers, Arthur Brooks, has said: we need to “disagree better, not less.”
While we should always be agreeable in our disagreeing, this does not mean that we stop fighting to maintain principles that make America strong, even if they are temporarily “out of favor.” One of our core First Amendment freedoms--the freedom of speech--has been a hallmark of American liberty for over 200 years. Now, in 2020, some segments of America appear to be perfectly content throwing it out entirely, forcibly silencing those who have opinions that differ from their own.
In 1906 Evelyn Beatrice Hall reportedly coined this famous phrase: “I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.” In 2020, many in the political sphere are now saying, in effect, “I will defend your right to say it, but only if I agree with it.”
Our core First Amendment freedoms not only are synonymous with what it means to be American, but their existence were some of the reasons that extremists killed over 4,000 of our brothers and sisters 19 years ago this morning.
Let us always remember that our core freedoms are not theoretical; not “nice to haves”. They are the essence of what it means to be an American. And as we see those in 2020 actively attempting to undermine those freedoms, we need to remember what Reagan stated decades ago: “Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction.”
It is my hope that we will always remember not only what we lost 19 years ago this morning, but what we learned, and to pass it on to the next generation.
God Bless you all,
Chairman Derek Brown

Utah Victory Team,info@utgop.org,The American Promise,"Help Us Help Burgess Owens View this email in your browser
My Friends,
We hope you all had the opportunity to listen to Utah’s 4th Congressional District nominee, Burgess Owens last night during the Republican National Convention.
We were blessed to hear a true American patriot share the story of how his family has a history of overcoming and becoming. This great, great grandson of Silas Burgess, a former slave, who grew up in the segregated society of Tallahassee, Florida where he lived through the difficulties of integrating schools, went on to be a Super Bowl Champion and who will be the next Congressman elected from Utah’s 4th district.
We hope many of you will have the opportunity to meet Burgess. And, when you do, you will learn one of his proudest accomplishments doesn’t have anything to do with football or championships. If you heard his speech, you heard him talk about experiencing a terrible business failure resulting in losing everything he had worked so hard to earn. During that time, he once again put the American promise to the test and through hard work and determination he climbed back to the top. You can watch his full speech below:
Burgess will be a powerful voice in Congress because he represents the everyday American who has experienced success and failure. The Democrats know this about him and have been preparing to attempt to damage his name in order to win an election.
We have to admit, even we are surprised and disappointed to see how vehemently Ben McAdams and the Democrats are attacking his character. They have thrown out every conceivable falsehood, innuendo and outright lie they can think of to defame this good man.
They use these distasteful tactics in an effort to keep people from getting to know the real Burgess Owens. We need your help to counter their efforts and help Burgess get his message out. Will you contribute today to help the Utah Republican Party help win the 4th Congressional Seat back?
We need you.

Joe Biden has officially picked Kamala Harris as his running mate. While it is easy to see this for what it is — an attempt to pander to the Bernie Sanders’ wing of the Democratic party — they will try to use this pick to re-energize their voters who gave up on Biden long ago.
We need to quickly counter this new enthusiasm for Harris, who as the Democratic Vice Presidential nominee, will continue to push for a Green New Deal, a resolution that she sponsored in the Senate. She will also continue to advocate for policies like defunding law enforcement.
We need resources and funds to help us counter these messages. Will you help us?

Chairman Derek Brown,info@utgop.org,Primary election season is over!,"View this email in your browser
Dear Fellow Republicans:
The 2020 Primary Elections are now over, and one thing is clear: this election was historic!
After working with county parties around the state to contact new move-ins and young voters, over 40,000 new Republicans registered to vote in 2020. These are all Utahns who have never cast a vote in Utah before this year.
We have never seen such a huge expansion of the “Republican Tent” here in Utah, and with over 500,000 people voting in this election, it was truly the largest primary election turnout in Utah history!
As a party, we would like to congratulate Spencer Cox and Deidre Henderson. Not only did they win the 2020 Primary Election, but they also finished first place in the 2020 Republican State Convention. It is not always the case that the same candidates sweep both the primary election and the convention, but the Cox/Henderson Team did it.
As a party, we are 100% committed to supporting them, helping Utahns get to know them, and ensuring that they are victorious in November.
As I have mentioned so many times in press interviews this last month, I could not have been more thrilled by the caliber of our gubernatorial candidates. Each was truly outstanding in their own right. I am proud of Jon Huntsman, Jr., Thomas Wright, and Greg Hughes. They each ran a fantastic race and represented our party well.
This last week, the results of the First Congressional District were also finalized, with Blake Moore winning the primary. We would like to congratulate Blake on his victory and thank the other candidates -- Bob Stevenson, Kerry Gibson, and Katie Witt -- for their hard work and for running fantastic campaigns.
Yesterday, the Salt Lake Tribune did a profile piece on Blake Moore. You can access that story here to learn more about him.
One of our top priorities this year will be helping Burgess Owens defeat Democrat Ben McAdams in the Fourth Congressional District. We intend to take that seat back and will need help from each of you to make this happen. You can start by donating $10, $15 or $20 today that will be earmarked specifically for this race. Whether it is volunteering with a campaign, or making a donation to the party, your help will make all the difference this November.
Sincerely,
Chairman Derek Brown

Chairman Derek Brown,info@utgop.org,Stand United,"Utah works together View this email in your browser
Friends,
Have you seen the Public Service Announcement about unity and civility that our next Governor, Spencer Cox, just released with his Democratic opponent? In the last two days, it has been viewed over 3 million times!
Their ad went viral immediately, and was even featured on national shows like Good Morning America. The BBC also featured the spot, interviewing both of the candidates live, and asking them questions about our “curious” way of doing things here in Utah.
On a personal note, I appreciate that these candidates are showing the world that Utahns can engage in crucial conversations, and do so in a way that leaves our state a better place. Last year, I gifted every member of our state central committee a copy of the book “Love Your Enemies,” written by my favorite conservative author, Arthur Brooks. In this video, Spencer Cox is doing exactly what Brooks advocates in his must-read book.
Though our national politics has become unfortunately toxic, it is so refreshing to see Utah candidates not just talking about civility, but leading by example. Cox and his opponent have shown us that while they certainly do not always agree on policy, they agree on the things that matter most.
Please take a moment to watch this video as we near election day, and take its message to heart when you interact with your friends, family, or anyone with whom you disagree. Above all, remember that while robust debates over policies are essential, the way that we disagree with each other can often be even more important than the substance of our disagreement.
Yours,
Chairman Derek Brown

Chairman Derek Brown,info@utgop.org,Caucus Night postponed,"View this email in your browser
Dear Republican Friends,
Earlier today, Governor Herbert announced that public gatherings in Utah should be limited to 100 people. He also recommended that for individuals who are either immunocompromised or over the age of 60, gatherings should be limited to 20 people. Many of the schools—where our caucus night gatherings are scheduled to occur—have also announced that they will not allow facilities to be used for any event that would violate the Governor’s request.
For the Utah Republican Party, the safety of our members is our paramount concern. In light of the recommendations by state health officials and our Governor, the Utah Republican Party will comply with this directive and postpone our March 24 caucus night meetings.
As we announced last night, we will also be restructuring our state convention format, and will not host an in-person convention on April 25. The vetting and candidate voting traditionally associated with the Republican State Nominating Convention will still occur, but it will operate primarily in an online format. While candidates and delegates may still meet during this time, we would encourage them to be cautious, and do so in a format that complies with the Governor’s request.
In 2018, the caucus attendees for the Utah Republican Party selected 4000 delegates state-wide, with their election continuing until they were replaced in a subsequent caucus meeting election. As the terms of those delegates have not yet expired, those state delegates will continue to serve as state delegates for our 2020 convention election process. We thank them, in advance, for their service, and will immediately begin reaching out to those delegates to notify them. We will also work with our county parties to assist them in making similar accommodations that comply with the Governor’s request.
As a party, we are excited about the opportunity to incorporate the latest technology in the candidate vetting and selection process. This is something we have been working on for a while, and while the timing is not what we had planned, we are confident that our delegates will find the process both enjoyable and rewarding.
Sincerely,
Derek Brown

Chairman Derek Brown,info@utgop.org,Super Tuesday presidential primary March 3,"View this email in your browser
Dear Fellow Republican,
For the first time ever, Utah will be participating in the presidential Super Tuesday primary elections this year, which will take place on March 3! This presents an exciting opportunity for our state to be one of the earliest in the country to vote in the presidential primary.
If you are affiliated with the Republican Party, you have likely already received your primary ballot in the mail. If you are not affiliated with the Republican Party, or have not registered to vote, there is still time.
If you wish to participate in the Republican presidential primary election on March 3, you must register to vote, and affiliate as a Republican. The voter registration deadline for the presidential primary is February 25. The following is a link from the Lieutenant Governor’s office that provides important details about the March 3 election. You can view the link here.
As we begin the 2020 election season, it is my hope that you will take the time to participate in the presidential primary election, and also join our party in supporting the President. Under his leadership, our country has seen unprecedented growth and prosperity, record low unemployment, and historic economic opportunity for all Americans.
Sincerely,
Chairman, Derek Brown

Chairman Derek Brown,info@utgop.org,Recent 4th District Poll,"View this email in your browser
Dear Friend,
Did you see the new poll just released in the 4th Congressional District? It was conducted by one of the most well-known pollsters in the country, Scott Rasmussen, for the Deseret News and the University of Utah Hinckley Institute of Politics. It shows that the race for Congress between Republican Burgess Owens and Democrat Ben McAdams is already tied!
This is exciting because Burgess Owens won the primary only a few weeks ago, and voters are just starting to get to know him, his amazing life journey, and what an incredible member of Congress he will be.
Winning the 4th Congressional District race is my #1 priority as Chairman of the Utah Republican Party this year, and it is going to take a strong and expensive ground game. As you know, keeping this seat is one of Pelosi’s top priorities, which is why she has already helped McAdams raise over $2 million.
Your support would mean so much in helping us be successful in sending Republican Burgess Owens to Washington.
Democrats know that McAdams is one of the most vulnerable House members in the country, which is why he claims to be an “independent” voice for Utah. However, his voting record shows anything but that: he votes with Washington Democrats 85% of the time.
Can you please donate $15, $20 or even $50 to help us ensure that we win this race and successfully return this Congressional seat back to Republican hands?
The Republican National Committee has made it clear that if we are going to win back the House of Representatives in Washington, winning this seat in Utah is critical!
This will be a very close race, as it was in 2018, but voters in the 4th District deserve someone who actually represents them, and not the far left in Washington.
As your Chairman, I am committed to ensuring that Republicans win back this seat in Congress.
Will you join me?

Utah Victory Team,info@utgop.org,Re-Elect Attorney General Sean Reyes,"View this email in your browser
Friends,
Have you had the chance to see this 30-second ad for Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes?
It’s rare that a political ad captures someone so perfectly. Attorney General Reyes has a passion for helping the less fortunate. If you ever have the chance to spend a few minutes with him and get him to talk about his childhood, you will learn of a disadvantaged kid who had a family that taught them to always, always look out for the “little guy”. That’s just what he does. He is tireless in that effort.
Sometimes that “little guy” is a Gold Star Family, sometimes, it’s the young kid on the street that didn’t have the benefit of a strong mother to teach him right from wrong like Sean did. Most importantly, Sean Reyes knows the victim of crime is always the “little guy” and deserving of protection and justice.
He has a deep understanding that the law, equally applied to all regardless of any demographic, is the single, greatest attribute of America. He is passionate about equal justice under the law. We have been blessed to have him as Utah’s chief law enforcement officer and we look forward to his re-election.
Tune in next Wednesday, October 21 at 6pm for the Attorney General debate and you will see exactly what we are talking about. For more information, visit the Utah Debate Commission website.

Chairman Derek Brown,info@utgop.org,UTGOP 2020 Nominating Convention Update,"View this email in your browser
Dear Republican friend,
What an eventful week we have had, including the unexpected “wake up call” many of us received yesterday.
With all of the uncertainty this past week, I am writing to let you know that one thing is still certain: the Utah Republican Party is organized, unified, and looking forward to our 2020 Nominating Convention which will take place on April 25th.
While we will not have an in-person convention as in past years, we are moving full-steam ahead with our convention preparations. I am excited to announce that our 2020 Convention Committee is incorporating technology into this year’s convention process that will encourage a higher level of participation by our delegates than we have ever seen before.
In preparation for our convention, I would like to briefly answer some of the most common questions I have received.
1. With caucus night postponed, who will serve as delegates? Our state delegates serve until they are replaced by newly-elected delegates. Because delegates elected in 2018 have not been replaced, they will continue to serve, and will be given an opportunity to participate in the upcoming convention.
2. What if a delegate can no longer serve? Each county party has a simple process for replacing a state delegate who cannot serve. It is not the job of a candidate to replace the delegate—it is the job of the county party to manage the replacement of delegates.
3. Will the nominating convention be canceled? Definitely not! Our convention will still take place next month, though it will look different than our past conventions. It will involve candidates reaching out electronically to delegates, and utilizing technology in new and innovative ways. In fact, I am convinced that we will see human ingenuity and creativity at its finest, providing our delegates more actual opportunities for interaction with candidates than in any previous year.
4. Will this online convention process be fair to the candidates? Absolutely! Just as our party has had to adapt to changing conditions, our candidates are also showing us how well they can adapt—a skill they will certainly need if elected. We are committed to supporting our candidates in reaching out to the delegates, helping to provide the tools they need to do so, and making sure the process is fair and even more accessible than our traditional, in-person convention.
5. How will voting take place? I have finalized an agreement with a reputable, well-known, and secure online voting company. There are government entities here in Utah that already use this company to manage the electronic voting of Utah residents who are overseas serving in the military. As a party, we will provide technical support and assistance to our delegates to help them use the voting software.
6. Do you need volunteers? Yes! Instead of volunteers to help us with logistics at a large convention center, we will need volunteers to help with our virtual/online operations. Please email [[URL REDACTED]] if you are willing to help.
7. Can I donate to help with the costs of an online convention? As a party, we spent over $30,000 preparing for a caucus night next week, and now we have tens of thousands dollars of new costs associated with the new convention plans. If you are willing to help defray these costs, please contact the party, or contact me directly.
John Adams once said that “every problem is an opportunity in disguise.” I view these challenges as the Utah Republican Party’s opportunity in disguise. It is a chance to reevaluate the way voters interact with us, reinvigorate our caucus/convention system, and explain to a rising generation what it means to be conservative.
Our 2020 Utah Republican Party Convention will not only be memorable, but it will also be an amazing experience for our delegates who have the opportunity to participate. I am committed to making sure that the overall level of participation by our delegates between now and April 25th exceeds that of any prior convention.
With so many uncertainties today, conservative principles like advocating for limited government, promoting free-market solutions, and creating a society where our sisters and brothers can truly flourish, are principles that we will need more than ever before.
My fellow party officers and I are grateful for your service and commitment to the Utah Republican Party, and we are excited about the opportunities that lie ahead.
Sincerely,
Derek Brown

Chairman Derek Brown,info@utgop.org,Amy Coney Barrett is Amazing!,"Biden would to dilute her influence and pack the courts View this email in your browser
Friends,
This week, the Senate Judiciary Committee is holding hearings to confirm Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court. She has shown a knowledge of the law that is truly breathtaking.
Democratic senators have hurled vitriol and venom her way. Judge Barrett has simply smiled and responded with class and dignity, while politely and humbly dancing intellectual legal circles around them.
Precisely the temperament we want in a judge sitting on the highest court in the land.
One of the President’s most important constitutional duties is to appoint judges. As Senator Mike Lee explained in the hearings this week, the role of a judge is to apply the law as it is actually written, and not read into it things the judge wishes it said.
Unfortunately, Joe Biden has made it clear he will not do that. He will select judges who would act as his personal policymakers. Worse, he will “pack the court” by increasing its number of judges and then appointing judges who will apply the law the way HE wants it applied.
Biden has consistently refused to admit whether he will pack the court. He was recently asked whether the American people deserve to know his opinion. His response: “No, they don’t.
You read that correctly. “No, they don’t.”
He then stated that the American people will “know my opinion on court-packing when the election is over.”
These are stunning admissions--or perhaps simply rare moments of lucidness.
Folks, we don’t need to wait until the election is over to know where Biden stands. We know.
I agree with Judge Barrett, who once stated that “we shouldn’t be putting people on the court that share our policy preferences. We should be putting people on the court who want to apply the Constitution.
Will you please donate $25, $50 or $100 to help us ensure that we have more judges like Amy Barrett, and help us defeat a candidate who is intent on packing the court if he wins?
Sincerely,
Chairman Derek Brown

Chairman Derek Brown,info@utgop.org,Which Office Do I Go To To Get My Reputation Back?,"View this email in your browser
Fellow Utahns,
Earlier this week, the Utah Democratic Party sent out over 100,000 mailers, all over Utah, each attacking a different Republican candidate. Cleverly, they timed the ads to arrive the same day as your ballot. Each attack stated (in very small letters) that it was “Paid for by the Utah Democratic Party.”
What made these attacks particularly craven is that they are false – and the Democrats know it. Each mailer implied that the Republican in that grainy, black-and-white photo voted for a bill that they DID NOT ACTUALLY VOTE FOR.
Democrats mailed them out, and waited … silently … hoping that by the time you discovered the deception, your ballot would be cast, and it would be too late.
Before I could expose the plot, I was beat to the punch by Salt Lake Tribune columnist Robert Gehrke who called it “one of the stupidest hit pieces” he’s ever seen.
Deseret News columnist Lavar Webb also lamented that Utah Democrats are going to have to “scrub hard to clean the stuff off of their boots.”
Even elected Democrats were forced to concede that their party's attacks were duplicitous and Machiavellian.
“I’m disappointed that the Utah Democrats would stoop this low.""
Rep. Angela Romero (Democrat – Salt Lake City)
“Ugly untrue negativity.”
Rep. Karen Kwan (Democrat – Salt Lake City)
“Really sad to see my party do this.”
Rep. Andrew Stoddard (Democrat – Midvale)
Though the Democrats’ malicious actions have been exposed, the intent was clear: damage a hard working legislator’s reputation right before ballots are filled out.
This morning, one disappointed candidate asked me the same question asked by Reagan’s first Secretary of Labor after he was acquitted on bogus charges: “Derek, which office do I go to to get my reputation back?”
Friends, there is no Office of Reputation. There is just you. Decent, hardworking Republican and Democratic Utahns who hate to see Washington-style tactics slime their way into Utah.
Now … I have work to do. I need your help.
First, help me expose these attacks for what they are. Let your friends know. After all, these Democratic attacks are so deceitful that even elected Democrats were embarrassed.
Second, please donate to those candidates they attacked. As you know, it will now take more resources for them to clean up the mud thrown at them.
Finally, any donation we receive today will be used entirely for what I’m calling “Project Muddy Boots” – to help the candidates whose reputations have been damaged by this sludge.
Above all, vote! Actions like this show us why every vote matters.
Sincerely,
Derek E. Brown

Chairman Derek Brown,info@utgop.org,Happy Pioneer Day!,"View this email in your browser
Happy Pioneer Day!
Today we commemorate the 173rd anniversary of pioneers entering the Salt Lake Valley. In virtually every year since 1847, Utah has marked this day with parades, picnics, and large family gatherings. However, once again, 2020 has given us an opportunity to do things differently--to pioneer in our own way.
I am proud of the way the Utah Republican Party has met the challenges of 2020 head-on, and overcome. After having to cancel our in-person state convention, we pioneered a completely new convention model. That convention model was so successful that 87% of our delegates polled requested that we continue to use this model next year, not reverting to the “old fashioned” way of doing business.
Faced with the inability to meet face-to-face with potential voters, we pioneered an effort to expand the “Republican tent” by contacting new move-ins, young voters, and unaffiliated voters. In the end, almost 40,000 people registered to vote in Utah for the first time ever and affiliated with the Republican Party.
Finally, the Utah Republican Party had over a half a million Republicans vote in our primary--the most successful primary, with the highest participation, in Utah’s history!
I am thrilled with the caliber of the nominees that emerged from the primary. They are some of the highest caliber women and men we have ever had running for office, and as your chair, I am 100% committed to making sure that each one is elected this November.
The way that we will do this is through a principle integral to the pioneer story: Unity. The pioneers were unified in both purpose and mission. As a party, we are likewise unified in ensuring that our nominees are victorious this Fall.
I am honored to chair the Utah Republican Party, and firmly believe that there is no obstacle 2020 can throw at us to divert us from our objectives.
I ask you to lock arms with me and help educate our fellow Utahns on the unifying, freedom-enhancing principles of the Republican Party. Together, we will win.

Chairman Derek Brown,info@utgop.org,Burgess Owens Needs Our Help,"Burgess Owens Embodies the American Dream View this email in your browser
My Friends,
I think, sometimes in Utah politics, we like to see “perfect candidates.” It makes us feel good.
We see political ads portraying the perfect candidate, the perfect family, seated at the perfect dinner table, hoping you’ll think he is “practically perfect in every way.” But “perfect people” also have one thing in common: they are all imperfect people and they’re hoping you don’t find out.
A “perfect” candidate who has never made mistakes has also never taken risks, hasn’t grown, and hasn’t developed depth. Much like the pine trees that blew over several weeks ago--tall, beautiful, and practically perfect. However, One stiff wind … they were all gone.
Our Republican candidate, Burgess Owens, has experienced it all -- the highest of highs, lowest of lows, and has struggled to overcome it. He personifies the American Dream and his roots are deep.
In fact, he just published an op-ed in the Deseret News about that American Dream. Please take a moment to read it. We are fortunate to have someone like Burgess who is willing to run, knowing that the Democrats would attack his life journey of living through segregation, winning a Super Bowl Championship, losing everything and climbing back up again.
Sometimes he failed and sometimes he succeeded, but he always learned, grew and developed deep roots that help him stand firm against adversity.
While it must be nice to have never stumbled, when the winds of adversity hit, as they always do, we need a candidate with depth who will stand firm, NOT one who will pretend to stand firm and then blow over and vote with Nancy Pelosi 89% of the time.
And we certainly don't need a Congressman who will brutally attack someone for having the audacity to keep getting up when they’ve been knocked down.
You can understand why Nancy Pelosi has raised millions of dollars to help McAdams. They are trying to shame and shun Burgess for his life’s journey. They are afraid of him.
We need help getting this message out. We need help making sure that people get to know the real Burgess. Ballots arrive less than two weeks from today! Please donate to help us get this message out as quickly as we can.

Utah Republican Party- Chairman Derek Brown,info@utgop.org,Primary Election is next week- Have you voted?,"View this email in your browser
Dear Fellow Republicans,
Today marks exactly one week until Utah’s primary election!
We are excited to see who you will choose to represent us this November. This year, we have many high-profile races and have seen more interest in our primary than I can ever remember.
As your chairman, I am thrilled at the growth of the party. Just this year, we have registered 32,000 new Republican voters! These are not voters who have changed affiliation, but Utahns who have never voted before here in Utah. Much of this growth is due to the hard work of our county parties, with whom we have worked to help contact new Utah “move-ins” and encourage them to affiliate with the Republican Party.
After our state convention in April, over half of the delegates reported spending over ten hours preparing to cast their vote at the convention. I would encourage you also to take the time to really get to know our candidates. Review their websites, watch their materials, ask them questions in the online forums. As a party, we have also sponsored numerous debates that you can watch online to help you “do your homework.”
Unlike any prior year, our candidates have truly gone out of their way to be accessible and provide everyone an opportunity to really get to know them.
And, like all past years, we still see the perennial out-of-state special interest groups attempting to influence the outcome of our election. Many of these groups are spending large amounts of money, apparently with the hope that you will not take the time to either get to know our candidates or analyze all the issues carefully. Some appear to be hoping that you will base your vote on a single issue, some have made representations about candidate positions that are arguably misleading, and others appear to simply be hoping that you will “take their word for it” when it comes to a candidate’s strengths or weaknesses. In short, they are banking on you not doing your homework.
While we see this dynamic every election cycle (and this year is no exception), the antidote is for you to simply do your homework, really getting to know each candidate.
We have what I believe is the strongest collective slate of candidates the Utah Republican Party has seen in a generation and getting to know them has never been easier, or more important!
Lastly, if you are able, please consider making a donation to the Utah Republican Party to help us as we organize our grassroots efforts and ground game for the election this Fall. We need resources to help execute our plans, and your support would be greatly appreciated! You can donate here.
Sincerely,
Derek Brown

Chairman Derek Brown,info@utgop.org,Republican Party Statement on COVID-19,"View this email in your browser
Dear Republican Friends,
The Utah Republican Party has, as one of its core objectives, ensuring that as many of our party members as possible participate in the caucus and convention process. Everything we do ultimately facilitates our members in nominating their preferred candidates, and then helping those candidates through the elections process.
I have been carefully monitoring the impact of COVID-19 on the residents of Utah during this past month, with an eye towards how this will impact caucus night on March 24th, and also county and state conventions that will follow. We have been developing a contingency plan in the event that the impact of the virus makes it impractical to have large gatherings, thus impeding the normal operations of our party. More details about this contingency plan will be discussed shortly.
In the most recent meeting of the Republican State Central Committee, the members showed great foresight by unanimously passing a motion to give the Chairman authority to make necessary accommodations to our caucus and convention process in response to COVID-19.
In light of the countless organizations in Utah that have already cancelled large events, such as churches and universities, we are carefully considering the possibility of restructuring our state convention on April 25th. I have appointed a committee to work on executing the convention contingency plan and will soon provide details to all party members and candidates as to what this restructuring will look like.
In less than two weeks, on March 24, our members will participate in our biennial caucus night. Thousands of hours of preparation, and hundreds of volunteers, have worked tirelessly to prepare for this important night.
Unlike the state convention, where roughly 4000 state delegates and candidates congregate in one location for many hours, caucus meetings are much smaller in nature and are conducted at the local neighborhood level. At these meetings, neighborhoods (or “precincts”) select county delegates to represent them at the county convention, and also select state delegates to represent them at the state convention.
That being said, I would strongly encourage county parties and precinct leaders to make the preparations necessary to ensure that our local attendees are safe and have a positive experience. Some of these precautions include the following:
* Placing hand sanitizer in the entrances to the caucus location.
* Moving scheduled locations, where possible, to ensure that meetings may occur at the precinct level and not in larger buildings.
* Having attendees, after check-in, go directly to their individual precinct rooms, rather than waiting in a central location such as a school auditorium.
* Encouraging attendees to not attend if they are sick, exhibiting flu-like symptoms, or are considered high-risk.
* Encouraging those who cannot attend, for whatever reason, to exercise their right to vote by absentee ballot. The instructions are located below and can also be found by contacting your county party.
I deeply appreciate the thousands of hours of sacrifice and work by volunteers in all 29 counties who have been preparing for caucus night, and I will continue to work with the county parties to ensure that our caucus night is both safe and successful. If anything changes in our plans as a party, we will inform you immediately.
It is an honor to serve as your Chairman, and I deeply appreciate the incredible Utah Republican Party staff and volunteers who are working with me around the clock on this important issue. I appreciate your understanding and patience during this unique and challenging time.
Sincerely,
Derek Brown
Republican Caucus 2020
Instructions for using Absentee Ballots
If you are unable to attend Caucus on March 24, 2020, in person any registered Republican can participate in Caucus using an Absentee Ballot. You should write down your wishes/instructions on a piece of paper and be as explicit as possible. For example - ""I nominate John Smith for Precinct Chair and I vote for John Smith for Precinct Chair"". Instructions should only be directed toward the elections to be held at Caucus: Precinct Chair, Precinct Vice-Chair, Precinct Secretary, Precinct Treasurer, State Delegates and County Delegates.
Put your written instructions in an envelope and seal it. You must sign the envelope across the seal. If you know your precinct, write it on the outside of the envelope as well. You can send the absentee ballot with a courier/ friend to be delivered to your Caucus location, but you must include a photocopy of both sides of a valid ID (such as a driver’s license) outside the envelope.
When a courier comes to Caucus with your Absentee ballot, they should go to the check-In desk. Check-In volunteers will look up the absentee voter using your ID and if appropriate “check you in” giving the courier a credential and directing them to the proper classroom for your precinct.
YOUR ID WILL BE RETURNED TO THE COURIER! WE WILL NOT KEEP OR BE RESPONSIBLE FOR A PERSON'S ID OR PHOTOCOPY.
The courier brings your envelope and credential to the Caucus meeting and they should immediately hand it to the person running the meeting - showing them the ID and credential. The Precinct Host will verify the signature on the envelope against the signature on the copy of the government-issued ID, but will not take possession of the copy of the ID. Once the signature is verified the ballot will be certified. The Precinct Host will open the envelope and follow your instructions to the greatest extent possible. The ballot instructions in the envelope will be used in all rounds of voting as appropriate.
A courier may bring no more than three (3) ballots to caucus on behalf of
others. The person to whom the voter’s envelope and copy of the ID are entrusted to (courier) shall be responsible to deliver the envelope to the Precinct Host and to destroy the copy of the ID or to return it to the voter. The Utah Republican Party will assume no liability for the information on the copy of the voter’s ID.

Dear Republican Friend:
With all the depressing media stories we are seeing, your Utah Republican Party leadership would like to share “some good news” (inspired by the name of John Krasinski’s clever YouTube show).
During the last few weeks, county parties all over Utah held online conventions with incredible results! Utah County’s convention had close to 90% participation, Beaver County’s convention saw 93% participation, and Washington County likewise had 93% participation. While those numbers would be fantastic even in a regular election year, considering that we are in a pandemic year where we cannot meet, those levels are unbelievable!

This Saturday we will hold our first-ever online state convention. Many of the candidates have prepared pre-recorded convention speeches, all of which were released publicly this morning along with a welcome video from Governor Herbert.
As a party, we have spent countless hours the last six weeks reinventing the way the party operates, creating new media to educate delegates, and reaching out to them by phone, email, text, and even “snail mail.” We have also created a massive online clearinghouse of information about the candidates, searchable by precinct, designed a full-color 80-page Convention Voter Guide that was sent to each delegate’s home and produced educational videos about the new processes, all of which are available on [[URL REDACTED]]
Our amazing candidates have also reinvented how they campaign, interacting intensely with thousands of delegates via social media, Zoom, FaceTime, and other new creative methods. The delegates, in turn, have responded by having more involvement in this process than in any year we can remember. Just yesterday, over 1,500 state delegates downloaded the voting software and were credentialed to vote--on the first day it was available!
Watch Chairman Brown speak to Glen Mills about our first ever virtual convention
We could not be more grateful to the countless volunteers who have spent the last six weeks completely reinventing how the Utah Republican Party operates. We were recently asked if shifting the convention online made our job simpler. We all had a good laugh, because, as one volunteer phrased it, it’s like “rebuilding an airplane mid-flight.”
While all of us feel like we have all been “enrolled” in a post-graduate course in creative problem solving, we are excited about the results and want you to know that your party is strong and organized. We appreciate the opportunity to serve alongside so many committed Republicans all over Utah and look forward to an amazing convention this week.

Chairman Derek Brown,info@utgop.org,Deseret News Op-ed from Chairman Derek Brown,"View this email in your browser
Dear Republican Friend,
This morning, the Deseret News published an article I wrote describing COVID-19’s impact on political parties and elections. In this article I highlight why the Utah Republican Party continues to remain vibrant, and why we are looking forward to a memorable state convention on April 25th.
I would invite you to view the Deseret News article here.
Colin Powell once said that “leadership is solving problems.” As a former elected official, I can assure you that every day in public office is an exercise in creative problem-solving. And, if he is right, today’s circumstances give us a rare, birds-eye view of how our current Republican candidates solve real-life problems.
As your Chairman, I am thrilled with the caliber of the Republican candidates running in every federal, state, and county race in Utah. When each began their campaigns, not a single one had probably ever heard the phrase “social distancing.” And now, as social distancing becomes the new norm, posing unforeseen challenges to candidates, those challenges provide us with a golden opportunity: an opportunity for us to witness their problem-solving skills in action.
Personally, I am impressed with how many of these candidates have seamlessly adapted, shifting campaign strategies virtually overnight. I am grateful to them for their hard work, and for showcasing truly impressive problem-solving skills.
I am grateful for an amazing state party leadership team that has worked, quite literally, around the clock this last month ensuring that our party adapts to these changes, and continues to boldly move forward. We are still fundraising, conducting candidate training, helping candidates prepare for the convention, and even mailing a comprehensive 2020 Republican Convention Voter Guide to all 4000 state delegates next week.
I am grateful to our incredible county party leadership teams who have also been working nonstop to adapt as well. Many of these counties, in fact, will be conducting online conventions as early as next week!
Finally, I am grateful to those of you who have stepped up to donate to our party, helping us shoulder some of the financial impact of these changes. Thank you! If you have not taken the opportunity to donate, please do so now.
Know that your party is strong. We are optimistic for the future, excited for our 2020 convention this month, and look forward to amazing successes on election day this November.
Yours truly,
Derek E. Brown

Chairman Derek Brown,info@utgop.org,"Remembering September 11, 2001","American Unity View this email in your browser
I will never forget what I saw, but more importantly, what I felt 19 years ago today.
On 9/11 I was in Philadelphia, serving as a law clerk for a federal judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. I had spent weeks preparing my judge for hearings that would occur in the federal courthouse.
Ironically, one of our cases involved a man convicted for his role in the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center. The appeal would be heard in the United States Courthouse, which sits just around the corner from one of our most powerful symbols of American liberty: Independence Hall.
After those horrifying events unfolded, the courthouse and all of Philadelphia shut down in a way that we haven’t seen again--at least until 2020.
2020 is the first major election where some of those who are now voting not only have no memory of 9/11, but were not alive when it happened. While these young voters fortunately did not experience the horrors and emotions of that morning, they unfortunately also have no memory of the unity we experienced in America during the days after. It was a time when American flags spontaneously appeared on homes and cars, and--though hard to believe now--members of Congress came together to sing “God Bless America” on the steps of the United States Capitol.
Such unity seems almost unthinkable today. Yet, in many ways, it is even more important now than ever. We can conquer any enemy, as long as we are unified as a country. And to be unified, we need to treat each other with dignity, respect, and love. This does not mean that we do not disagree--after all, productive disagreements are the hallmark of intelligent people.
As one of my favorite political writers, Arthur Brooks, has said: we need to “disagree better, not less.”
While we should always be agreeable in our disagreeing, this does not mean that we stop fighting to maintain principles that make America strong, even if they are temporarily “out of favor.” One of our core First Amendment freedoms--the freedom of speech--has been a hallmark of American liberty for over 200 years. Now, in 2020, some segments of America appear to be perfectly content throwing it out entirely, forcibly silencing those who have opinions that differ from their own.
In 1906 Evelyn Beatrice Hall reportedly coined this famous phrase: “I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.” In 2020, many in the political sphere are now saying, in effect, “I will defend your right to say it, but only if I agree with it.”
Our core First Amendment freedoms not only are synonymous with what it means to be American, but their existence were some of the reasons that extremists killed over 4,000 of our brothers and sisters 19 years ago this morning.
Let us always remember that our core freedoms are not theoretical; not “nice to haves”. They are the essence of what it means to be an American. And as we see those in 2020 actively attempting to undermine those freedoms, we need to remember what Reagan stated decades ago: “Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction.”
It is my hope that we will always remember not only what we lost 19 years ago this morning, but what we learned, and to pass it on to the next generation.
God Bless you all,
Chairman Derek Brown

Chairman Derek Brown- Utah Republican Party,info@utgop.org,UTGOP State Convention Victory!,"View this email in your browser
Victory!
Last weekend, the Utah Republican Party held its 2020 Nominating Convention, and we couldn’t be more thrilled with the results!
This morning, both Forbes Magazine and Politico published in-depth articles highlighting the Utah GOP success, while focusing on our pioneering use of new technology.
Delegate feedback has been incredible. Over 93% of our credentialed delegates voted. In fact, more delegates actually voted this year than in either the 2018 or 2019 conventions!
In a delegate survey, almost 1000 delegates provided us this information:
* 90% reported being “satisfied” or “very satisfied” with the convention
* 87% reported being more likely to serve as a delegate if future conventions are online
* 89% reported that their experience with our voting software was “positive” or “very positive”
* Only 13% prefer to return to a traditional, in-person convention
Most interesting is that over half of the delegates reported spending over 10 hours preparing to cast their vote. This confirms what our own experience told us—they took their job seriously! There was more meaningful delegate engagement in online town halls, one-on-one FaceTime calls with candidates, reviewing of materials created by the party, and watching candidate speeches than in any year in memory.
Candidate feedback was also amazing. Our candidates rose to meet these new challenges and found new, meaningful ways to engage with delegates. The party involved the candidates as “partners,” provided national experts to train them, and was more transparent in providing them data than ever before. Many candidates who have run in the past stated that they spent less money and less time traveling this year while spending more time in meaningful communication with delegates.
For the first time, any of us can remember our convention actually made money! These excess funds will now be used to do what the party should be doing – helping our candidates get elected in November.
This past Monday I certified our final list of Utah Republican nominees to the Lieutenant Governor’s office. You can view the list here.
I wish all of our candidates the best as we enter the primary election cycle, and look forward to robust debates showcasing how Utah is a model of civility. Finally, I commit all of my energies to one thing: helping our candidates win this November.
With gratitude,
Derek Brown

Jeff Merchant,mail@utdem.org,"Meet a Dem Candidate: Kael Weston, Devin Thorpe, and Congressman Ben
 McAdams","Dear Alex,
We all know Congressman Ben McAdams, Utah’s Democrat in Congress, but today we want to also introduce you to two outstanding candidates hoping to join him.
Kael Weston and Devin Thorpe are working to represent Utah’s 2nd and 3rd congressional districts. Like Congressman McAdams, Kael and Devin are both Utah natives and share Congressman McAdams’ commitment to working for bipartisan solutions that will make life better for all Utahns.
Kael served for over a decade in the U.S. State Department, including time in both Iraq and Afghanistan. He wrote a book about his seven years in two wars and has also written numerous opinion pieces for the New York Times on national security issues. Now as an author and college-level instructor, he serves on the Salt Lake County Open Space Advisory Board. In seeking to replace a vulnerable Chris Stewart, Kael has a focus on listening and learning from CD2 constituents—frequently traveling to all 14 counties where they live—to address issues like public lands, a living wage, and access for all to affordable healthcare. (Visit [[URL REDACTED]] for more info).
Devin is a former small business owner with more than 25 years of business leadership expertise and has spent a decade working with world leaders on global health issues. These experiences have uniquely prepared him to lead during the current health and economic crisis. Focused on reversing climate change, ensuring access to affordable healthcare, and eradicating poverty, Devin is committed to putting people over politics and representing all of the diverse voices of Utah’s 3rd District (Visit [[URL REDACTED]] for more info).
Congressman Ben McAdams is seeking re-election to represent Utah’s 4th Congressional District. Congressman McAdams has fought to lower the cost of prescription drugs, supported measures to prevent suicide, and made sure that small Utah businesses were benefiting from the CARES Act. Special interests and Super PACS want to take this seat back, but with Dems like you behind him, we know that we’ll defend CD4 and send Congressman McAdams back to Washington. (Visit [[URL REDACTED]] for more info).
If you live in Kael’s, Devin’s, or Ben’s district, I encourage you to reach out and support their campaigns. I also hope you'll consider a donation to UDP to help us support them. We need Democrats like these three men in Congress fighting for Utahns like us.
As always, thank you for your support and all you do for Utah Dems.
Sincerely,
Jeff Merchant

Jeff Merchant,mail@utdem.org,Taylor & Mayne,"Dear Alex,
Tonight would have been UDP’s Taylor & Mayne Dinner, and I’m going to be candid: Taylor & Mayne is one of our biggest fundraisers of the year. The money we raise at Taylor & Mayne and over Convention weekend helps us support our slate of candidates leading up to November - money we need to hire field organizers, carry out a coordinated campaign, and get out the vote.
Some people have said we are lucky because we haven’t had to spend any money on Convention. That isn’t quite true. Between new websites, technical support, electronic voting, and many other things we have had to integrate and innovate, we have spent nearly $10,000.
Since we are not all gathering together tonight to celebrate our Democratic candidates, would you consider making a donation? Can you donate $5, the $50 you would have spent on a ticket to the event, or even $500?
Your donations will go a long way in helping us fill the gap left by canceling Taylor & Mayne and in making sure we can support Democrats across the state.
Since the beginning of March, all of us have had to rearrange many aspects of our daily lives. At UDP we have had to cancel in-person events, figure out how to hold conventions remotely, and adapt to working at home. But we are all doing it for a very important reason - to keep ourselves, our friends and family, and our community safe and healthy.
We appreciate your support as we have made these changes, and we appreciate your support as we try to make-up from the loss of one of our biggest fundraisers of the year. Team Democrat is lucky to have you.
In Gratitude,
Jeff

Matthew Patterson,mail@utdem.org,FW: When leadership matters,"Dear Alex,
Over the last couple of weeks, our staff and volunteers have been working remotely to plan for upcoming County and State Conventions. While we all wish we were gathering in person over the next several weeks, we have never lost sight of why we do the work we do.
This is why I wanted to make sure you saw Jeff’s email from last week, and I’m hoping you can help us inch a little closer to our end of quarter goal.
We have Democratic candidates on the ballot in every corner of the state. They are willing to step up and run, and they have elections to win in November. We need their voices of compassion, justice, and equality at the table as we pick up the pieces when things start to return to normal.
If you are in a position to do so, please chip in today to make sure we have Democratic values represented in our cities, our state, and our nation.
Sincerely,
Matthew Patterson

Subject Line: When leadership matters
Date: Thursday, March 26, 2020
Dear Matthew,
Our lives look very different right now than they did two weeks ago.
We’ve weathered an earthquake and we’re living through a pandemic. And while many things have changed over the last few weeks, one thing hasn’t. There is still an election in November, and it’s more important than ever that we elect good leaders.
The last few weeks have shown us the importance of decisive and compassionate leadership, and what happens when it is lacking. People need to have their everyday needs met, whether that is through housing, food, or healthcare. And they need elected leaders willing to advocate for those needs whether it is business as usual or time of crisis, which is why I am writing to you today.
The leaders we elect in November will be key players in rebuilding our cities, state, and nation as we recover. We’ll need Democrats at all levels of government advocating for those hardest hit by impacts of COVID-19 - everyday working Utahns. And issues like climate change, education funding, and access to healthcare will still need to be solved.
I know that this is a hard time to ask for money. I also understand that many Americans are struggling, but that is exactly why we need to prepare now to win in November.
The Utah Democratic party still has ambitious plans, and we’re hoping to get as close to our end of quarter financial goal if possible. If you are able to chip in $15, $50, or even $250 it will go a long way in helping us to elect Democrats at all levels of government.
There would be no Democratic Party without you. Right now, your support means more than ever, and we appreciate that you are willing to ensure that candidates have the resources they need to run for office.
Stay safe and healthy, and we’ll get through this together.
Sincerely,
Jeff Merchant

Jeff Merchant,mail@utdem.org,Introducing Ingela,"Dear Alex,
Thanks to you and your donations, the Utah Democratic Party is growing!
We hope you’ll join us in welcoming Ingela Rundquist, our newest Deputy Director.
A Utah native and graduate of Southern Utah University, Ingela majored in history and political science. After graduating, Ingela went to work for Hillary Clinton's campaign in Iowa, and has been working hard to elect Democrats across the country ever since - including Tim Kaine and Pete Buttigieg. She's also worked locally in Utah politics and interned at the Utah State Legislature.
She’s excited to bring this experience home and help the UDP build a lasting infrastructure so we can compete in 2020 and every election going forward. As a Democrat from rural southwest Utah, she knows it's important for Democrats to compete everywhere - because when we do, we can bring about real change.
You helped us hire Ingela, and you can continue to help Ingela and UDP bring about real change by making an additional donation today. Can we count on you to donate $35, $75, $150, or even $500 today? By doing so, you’ll ensure that we’re able to support candidates that will transform our country and our state.
As always, thanks for all you do, and for all the ways you show up for Democrats and Democratic values.
Best,
Jeff

Jeff Merchant,mail@utdem.org,The Real Work Starts Now,"Dear Alex,
While the results from last Tuesday’s primary won’t be official for a few weeks, it is time for Utah Democrats to get to work, because the real election is in November.
If the preliminary results tell us anything, it is that Utah’s GOP is deeply divided and voters are disenchanted. Utahns see how Republicans have held us back, and Utah Democrats are poised to take advantage of this division and disenchantment.
We voted to expand healthcare, we voted to legalize medical cannabis, and we voted for fair representation - all things that many thought were impossible for Utah. But, Utahns care about fairness, our families, and our neighbors, so we came together to make it happen. This November, we’ll come together again, and move Utah forward.
But, we can’t do it without you. Will you chip in $35, $75, $150, $250, or whatever you can afford today to help us support the Democrats running for office and help us break the Republican stranglehold on our state?
This November, we’re voting for our future, and I appreciate your support.
Sincerely,
Jeff

Jeff Merchant,mail@utdem.org,This Mother's Day Weekend,"Dear Alex,
With Mother’s Day this weekend, I wanted to be the first to wish a Happy Mother’s Day to all of the mothers out there. I also wanted to take a few minutes to talk about the importance of women and mothers running for office.
Across our country and state, women are stepping up in record numbers and running for office. Here in Utah, 75 percent of the House Democratic Caucus is made up of women and 66 percent of the Senate Democratic Caucus is women. At least half of our Democratic candidates on the ballot this November are women, and many of them are also mothers.
We all know that representation matters - when our governing bodies are made up of a diverse group of people we end up with better laws and policies that work for everyone. Study after study has shown that women in elected office get things done, and we need more women, and mothers, in office in Utah.
Our women candidates need us behind them because we need their voices and their leadership. In honor of Mother’s Day, will you make a donation to support our women candidates?
Every woman that runs paves the way for the next. This Mother’s Day and every day we are grateful for our women candidates and appreciate your support as we work to elect them.
Thank you for all you do, and I hope that you have a wonderful weekend.
Sincerely,
Jeff

Jeff Merchant,mail@utdem.org,Not the Status Quo,"Dear Alex,
As a long time Democrat, you know that our candidates are different from your run of the mill Republican.
Our candidates embrace the pioneering spirit and love of our families that is at the heart of Utah values. Our candidates and elected officials vote for funding our public schools, expanding access to healthcare, and fair redistricting.
On the other hand, Republicans have consistently failed us by upholding the status quo and putting special interests above the interests of everyday Utah families. The pinnacle of their failure has been their inadequate and flawed response to the COVID-19 crisis. And that is why I am writing to you today.
It is time for change, and Utah voters are ready for leaders that will move us forward instead of holding us back. We have candidates up and down that ticket that are ready to go to work for you in November.
Will you chip in $25, $75, $150, $250, or whatever you can afford today to help us break the Republican stronghold in Utah?
Utah is ready for real leaders, and with your support, we’ll elect them in November.

Jeff Merchant,mail@utdem.org,Pioneer Day and Hope for the Future,"Dear Alex,
Pioneer Day marks the day in 1847 when Mormon pioneers entered the Salt Lake Valley and declared “this is the place.” They were fleeing persecution and looking for a home where they could follow their religion and create a better life for their families.
As we celebrate the industrious spirit of those pioneers and the challenges they endured, we should not forget about the people who made Utah home for centuries--five Native American nations. They lost their land and often their lives, pushed onto reservations. But they persevered, they are still here, leading the way in the fight for environmental justice and social and economic equality.
The pioneers were followed by waves of immigrants in search of opportunity--my father among them. They’ve added to the richness of Utah’s history and successes despite hardship and discrimination, and they are integral to our future.
Part of what I love about the Utah Democratic Party is that we embrace and represent the diversity that makes up our State. We really are the big tent party. Whether our ancestors have been here for many centuries, crossed the prairies in a covered wagon back in 1847, or immigrated from far off countries a few short years ago, we all want a better life for our families and a bright future for our children. We want a voice, we want to be treated with respect, we want to be equal.
So, what does Pioneer Day mean for me? It means hope. It means that no matter how we ended up in Utah, we can have hope that tomorrow will be better and brighter than yesterday. As Democrats, let’s take that hope and fight together for a better Utah.
Sincerely,
Jeff

Nadia Mahallati,mail@utdem.org,Women Changemakers,"Dear Alex,
Utah is frequently ranked worst in the nation when it comes to women’s equality. News like that can make it easy to forget that we have a long history of women changemakers.
Today is a day to remember! February 14th marks the 150th anniversary of the first vote cast by a woman in the modern United States. And that historic vote occurred here in Utah when Seraph Young stopped to vote on her way to work.
As Utah Democrats, you and I are lucky to have Democratic women changemakers serving in all levels of government across the state.
They are inspiring other women to run for office and providing an example for future generations. Women throughout our state have expressed interest in running for office this year, and they need a strong Utah Democratic Party behind them. Will you take a stand with us?
Women running for office face a slew of challenges not faced by their male counterparts. For example, women are viewed as less electable despite the fact that women win elections at the same rate as men.
The Utah Democratic Party works hard to support women candidates, both through resources and training. Will you donate $15, $150, or even $1500—in honor of 150 years since the first woman voted—to help us support today’s changemakers?
You and I know that representation matters, and that when women are in leadership roles, we all benefit. Thank you for helping us support women running for office.
Sincerely,
Nadia Mahallati

Jeff Merchant,mail@utdem.org,Happy President’s Day!,"Dear Alex,
Happy President’s Day!
On this day, I’ve been thinking about what it means to be presidential. Our current president is anything but, and we’re on the cusp of choosing a Democratic nominee to replace him.
None of our past presidents were perfect--they were human and all had their flaws. The best of them had certain qualities in common--empathy, honesty, humility, and integrity. And these are qualities I hope for in our future president.
I want a president that has a vision and the leadership skills necessary to work towards that vision. I want our next president to seek out those with a wide range of opinions and actually listen to them. And I want a president that will seek to bring our country together in the face of some of the largest challenges of our time - climate change, healthcare, affordable housing, and education.
While the presidential election is important and on all of our minds, we need Democrats who embody these qualities at all levels of leadership--from city hall to our nation’s capital.
So today, on President’s Day, I am asking you to make a donation to the Utah Democratic Party - a donation in support of candidates seeking to make a change in our state and in our country. Your donation of $10, $50, $150, $250, or even $500 will help us to victory in November.
Thank you for helping us to support candidates that value empathy, honesty, humility, and integrity, and that seek to change Utah for the better.
Sincerely,
Jeff Merchant

Jeff Merchant,mail@utdem.org,Change is Coming,"Dear Alex,
August has been a big month for Utah Democrats.
Joe Biden announced his historic VP pick. We held a fun and successful virtual Taylor & Mayne with former Attorney General Eric Holder. We watched and were inspired by the Democratic National Convention, including when Mayor Wilson cast our votes.
Our candidates have been safely interacting with constituents and laying the groundwork for November. And voters are fired up for this election. They are taking the words of Michelle Obama to heart: we have to vote like our lives depend on it.
Despite this big month of fundraisers and hard work, we’re not on track to hit our fundraising goals for this month. We’re $2,500 short, and we need your help to make sure we are able to support candidates in these crucial days leading up to November. Will you donate $25, $75, $150, or even $250 to help us make up the difference?
With all that is wrong in our world right now, I feel an incredible sense of hope. I see it all around me in our elected Democrats, our candidates, our volunteers, and our communities. Change is coming. Will you help us elect more Democrats and be part of that change?
Thanks for all you do,
Jeff

Alex, will you be one of those donors?
With the primaries over and with opponents locked in, we know that the real election is in November. There are voters to register and candidates to support, and we need your help.
Your donation of $20, $50, $100, $200, or whatever you can afford will go a long way. You’ll help us provide candidates with the tools they need to win, like field organizers and the best data and targeting.
Utah Democrats stand for Utah values. They listen to data and science. They fight for small businesses struggling to stay afloat. They make hard decisions that keep us safe and save lives.
With your help, we’ll take back the White House and flip seats up and down the ticket and keep Utah moving forward.
Thanks in advance, and thanks for all you do support UDP and our candidates.

We’ve been hard at work, but we won’t stop until we’ve reached out to every voter we can to make sure that they know Utah Democrats are the best choice for the future of our state. Will you help us get the word out by helping us hit our end of the quarter goal of raising $10,000 from grassroots donors?
We need to raise $1,825 by midnight tonight to stay on track and make sure that we reach every voter we need and get out the vote.

If your inbox looks anything like mine, it has been flooded with emails reminding you to vote. As the Utah Democratic Party, we wouldn’t be doing our job if we didn’t do the same!
But as you are one of our best supporters, we also know that you may have already voted. Thank you! So rather than reminding you to vote, we’re hoping that you will donate $35 today so that we can reach out to half a million Utahns who have yet to vote early or return their ballots.
We have a real shot at flipping seats and moving closer to breaking the Republican supermajority here in Utah. We’re going to do everything we can to take back the White House. Our candidates, field organizers, and volunteers are all hard at work calling and texting voters across the state, and they won’t stop until the polls close on November 3rd.

Date: August 31, 2020
Dear Jeff,
August is almost over, which means we are 64 days away from election day. Ballots will be in our mailboxes before we know it.
Here at UDP, we’re still $1,135 away from hitting our end of the month fundraising goals. Will you help us make up the difference by pitching in $10, $25, $75, $150, or whatever you can afford today?
I’ve been working on political campaigns for nearly 20 years, and I don’t know that I have ever seen as much energy around an election. I also don’t know that I have ever seen candidates work as hard as our Democratic candidates are working this year.
They are facing unique challenges posed by campaigning in the middle of a pandemic, but it hasn’t slowed them down. They know what is at stake for our families and our communities this November. But they need your help to keep up the momentum and make it to election day.
I want to thank you in advance for donating today and helping us reach our end of the month goal. You make it possible for UDP to support the candidates up and down the ticket that will flip seats and make Utah a better place for everyone.
Sincerely,
Matthew Patterson

Jeff Merchant,mail@utdem.org,We're Taking Names,"Dear Alex,
Congratulations! We have made it to week three of the legislature! If you are like me, it is about this time that I wish I had planned a 45-day vacation. Regardless of whether you do leave Utah for a legislative break or not, one thing none of us can say about the Utah State Legislature is that it’s boring!
Thanks to the efforts of countless Democrats, the Legislature was forced to repeal the regressive tax reform bill passed in December. Sadly, that didn’t stop the craziness. Republican Senator Lyle Hilyard compared low-wage jobs to hobbies. Republican Representative Phil Lyman wants to censure Mitt Romney for voting his conscience. And Speaker Brad Wilson and Senate President Stuart Adams filed a citation honoring the president.
All of this goes to show how out of touch the Republican majority is with everyday Utahns. That’s why we need people like you.
In contrast to our GOP counterparts, our Democrats on the hill are working on legislation to create a better Utah for everyone.
Democrats are addressing clean air and the cost of prescription drugs. They are working to expand access to birth control under Medicaid and to improve access and quality of healthcare for American Indian-Alaska Natives in Utah.
And they are fighting to make our election system more equitable through repealing single-mark straight-ticket voting, enacting campaign contribution limits, and protecting independent redistricting.
Democrats are addressing pressing issues that affect our daily lives, not playing political games--and voters are paying attention. This year, Utah Democrats are taking legislators’ names and will be coming for their seats in November.
Will you donate $25, $50, $150, or even $250 today so that we can elect more hardworking Democrats like them in November?
As always thank you for all you do and for supporting the Utah Democratic Party.
Sincerely,
Jeff Merchant

Jeff Merchant,mail@utdem.org,Leading the Way,"Dear Alex,
I’ve said it before, and I will say it again, Democrats have proved that they have the skills necessary to lead our cities, states, and country through a crisis. Whether implementing stay at home orders, calling out bad policy, or fighting for financial relief - they’ve been standing up for Utahns and keeping us safe.
Meanwhile, our Republican counterparts are busy working for the interests of corporate America and spreading misinformation.
The Utah Legislature voted to spend tax-payer money on unproven and potential harmful COVID-19 treatments and used the emergency as a power grab. Trump has suggested injecting disinfectant to fight COVID-19. And across the state and the country, Republicans are rushing to re-open the economy.
We have a long road of rebuilding ahead of us, and as Democrats, we know who we want at the helm. We want elected representatives that put people above profit, look out for the interests of working Utahns, and work to correct the inequities in our society.
We have a ticket full of Democrats that will do just that. Can you donate today and help us elect these leaders to shepherd us through the months and years to come?
November's elections are vital, and Utahns want a change. Thank you for supporting us so that we can support candidates who will make that change happen. Stay safe and healthy, and don’t forget to wash your hands.
Best,
Jeff

As we head into the holiday season, many of us will be gathering with family and friends. We may share a meal and exchange gifts, we will hopefully laugh, and we may have to call out a relative or two when they praise the current President.
We also know that many in our community, our state, and our country are not able to spend the day with loved ones, put a meal on their table, or afford gifts for their kids. They may be serving our country in the military, they may be experiencing homelessness or food insecurity, or they may be recent immigrants to the United States, far from all that is familiar.
As Democrats, we do what we do for our families, our neighbors and our community—that is why we spend our spare-time volunteering to elect leaders that will fight to move us forward and create a world where all people have the opportunity to thrive.
So today, I wanted to reach out to you with my thanks for all that you have given to the Utah Democratic Party and our community over the last year. You have given your time and your resources all year long, and I want you to know that I appreciate your efforts.

Jeff Merchant,mail@utdem.org,Meet a Dem Candidate: Jamie Cheek and Darren Parry,"Dear Alex,
Our candidates for Congressional District 1 -- Jamie Cheek and Darren Parry -- are headed to a primary at the end of the month. They’re running to replace Rob Bishop in a district that covers northwestern Utah.
Jamie Cheek has made Utah home for the last decade. The first in her family to go to college, she is a District Director and works with some of the most vulnerable members of our community to find meaningful and gainful work.
Jamie grew up in a rural area where access to resources was limited. Jamie understands the challenges and struggles unique to rural Utah. Her campaign is focused on issues that can improve lives - issues like clean air, affordable healthcare, quality education, and restoring the American dream for working Utahns. Jamie believes that the government should work for the people not for donors.
You can learn more about Jamie at [[URL REDACTED]]
Darren Parry lives in Logan and is a Councilman for the Northwestern Band of the Shoshone Nation. He teaches Native American history at Utah State University and is passionate about preserving the history of his tribe.
Darren decided to run for office because he was dismayed by the lack of civility in our current political climate. Darren seeks to build bridges and make sure the American dream is a possibility for everyone, especially those in marginalized communities. Darren’s priorities include closing the gap between rural and urban Utah, addressing climate change, protecting LGBTQ rights, keeping public lands in public hands, and improving our immigration system.
More information about Darren can be found at [[URL REDACTED]]
I don’t envy our CD1 Democrats because both Jamie and Darren are great candidates and we’d be lucky to have either of them representing the district in Washington. This is going to be a hard vote to cast!
If you live in CD1, don’t forget about the upcoming primary on June 30th. Ballots should be hitting your mailboxes soon and more info on how to vote can be found here.

* 93 days until neighborhood caucuses

Dear Ingela,
When primary elections fall on the same day as the end of the quarter, it seems like a message from the universe reminding us that it is time to get serious about November.
We need to raise $880 by the end of the day to meet our end of quarter goal. Will you chip in today?
There’s a lot on the line. In Washington, we have a president that repeatedly demonstrates how unfit he is to lead. Our Republican dominated legislature is threatening to cut funding to social services and education exactly when Utahns need those services most.
Utahns see this. They are hungry for change. And the Utah Democratic Party has the answer in the 83 Democrats running for office.
They’re ready to go to work for you, so let’s get to work for them.
Thanks in advance, and if you have a primary, I hope you’ve voted. If you haven’t it is not too late to drop your ballot at a ballot drop box.
Best,

Jeff Merchant,mail@utdem.org,Making a Statement,"Dear Alex,
I wanted to reach out to you one last time before 2019 moves into the history books, because what a year it has been!
When the Party’s debt became apparent early last year, many people started to write us off, but I’ve always known that the Utah Democratic Party was more than numbers in a ledger. In 2019:
* We pulled together and did the hard work necessary to bring the party back into the black.
* We saw Democratic municipal candidates elected in all corners of the state.
* Our Democratic legislators have been hard at work creating legislation to be introduced in the 2020 legislative session that will support families.
* Our caucuses and committees have been laying the important groundwork of organizing, fundraising, and recruiting candidates.
And, as we did this work, we never lost sight of our mission - to ELECT DEMOCRATS.
I’m excited about the slate of candidates that are going to be running for office next year, and we need to be here to support them so that we can fulfill that mission.
If you are able, please make a year-end donation today. We’re so close to reaching our goal of $5000 by the end of the year.
Help us send a message to our naysayers - The Utah Democratic Party is strong and we have the resources to support candidates and flip seats.
You - our grassroots supporters - are the backbone of the party, and we wouldn’t be where we are today without you. So, thank you for your support, and I hope you have a very happy New Year.

Utah Democrats have a history of leading and fighting hard to move Utah forward. Our elected leaders stand up for public schools and healthcare. They have been leading the way during the pandemic calling for common-sense measures that will keep us safe.
Meanwhile, their Republican counterparts not only fight tooth and nail against policies that make life better for Utahns, but actively work against us. 2020 is the year to break this partisan super-majority that has been holding us back.
Will you donate today and help us elect more Democrats willing to stand up for you? Whether you can contribute $20 or $200, your dollars will help us ensure victory in 2020.
Thanks for all you do to support our candidates and the party. We’re excited about the progress we are making together.
Sincerely,
Matthew Patterson
Executive Director

Dear Matthew,
November is coming, and Utah Democrats have work to do. Our candidates are in the trenches reaching out to voters and they need our help, so we’re kicking off a $2020 for Victory in 2020 campaign.
We need to raise $2020 by July 20th. Will you help us make sure we can support our candidates as they reach out to voters?
We know that Utahns are tired of the same old Republican shenanigans that undermine their voices and their wellbeing. We know that we have top-notch candidates that will vote to fund our schools, make sure we have access to healthcare, and know how to lead in a crisis.
Whether you donate $20, $200, or something in between, you’ll help us provide candidates with field support, data and targeting, and training.
Together we can make sure their message of change for a better future reaches the voters that need to hear it. Together we’ll ensure that they win in November.
As always, thanks for your support. Stay healthy and stay safe!
Sincerely,
Jeff

We are so close to reaching our mid-quarter fundraising goal! Thank you so much to all of you who have participated so far. And if you haven’t had a chance to help yet, you can donate until midnight tonight and help us raise $5,000 towards electing Democrats all across the state.
We need 15 more donors by midnight to push us over the finish line.
The Utah Democratic Party is committed to helping Democrats get elected no matter what. Running for office is always hard, and campaigning during social distancing presents new challenges. As we are facing new challenges, our efforts to reach voters will depend on grassroots donations more than ever before.
We’ve seen it before, and we’re seeing it again - when everyone pitches in, we can accomplish great things. Our candidates need us. Will you donate today and help us reach our goal?
We need Democratic leaders in office now more than ever to make sure that the government is working for everyday people. Thank you again for your donations and your support as we work to make this happen. We’re lucky to have people like you standing by our side!
Best,
Jeff Merchant

Matthew Patterson,mail@utdem.org,We Need You,"Dear Alex,
I don’t know about you, but to me, this election feels different.
We’ve just experienced four years of an amoral and corrupt presidency. We’ve watched the local Republican establishment bungle the pandemic response, prioritizing the economy over lives. And across the state and the country, voters clamor for change.
As Democrats, we have an opportunity like never before to bring that change to Utah. We have the candidates. They’ve been hard at work reaching out to voters in unusual and challenging circumstances. Now, we just need you.
To turn out the vote in the coming weeks, we need this quarter to be our strongest fundraising quarter ever. We’ve raised $5,345 towards our goal of $10,000 from grassroots donors, and we only have four days left to make up the difference.
Will you help us out by chipping in $25, $75, $150, $250, or even $500?
UDP and all of our candidates appreciate everything you are doing to elect Democrats this November. We can’t wait to see the progress and change we are creating together. Thank you!
Sincerely,
Matthew

Jeff Merchant,mail@utdem.org,Introducing our new Executive Director!,"Dear Alex,
I wanted to take this opportunity to introduce you to our new Executive Director, Matthew Patterson.
Throughout his entire career, Matthew has fought and worked for the Democratic Party and its principles. He has worked on campaigns, served as an executive director of a county party in a largely Republican area, recruited and trained candidates and volunteers and also led a progressive state coalition of unions and community groups that worked on issues like Medicaid Expansion, reproductive rights, environmental protection, LGBTQ rights, early voting and payday loan reform.
More personally, Matthew grew up on a farm in the heart of red, rural Missouri (having to put up with folks like John Ashcroft and Roy Blunt). With his work and upbringing, Matthew knows that whether you live in Salt Lake County or Juab County, we care about the same things - quality education, access to health care, and the opportunity to make a better future for our children.
Matthew’s top priority is to work to elect Democrats up and down the ticket. That’s what brings him to Utah. His broad experience in progressive politics has given him many skills that will serve the Utah Democratic Party well. He is a coalition builder and has the experience that we need to further the Party. I, and the rest of the Executive Committee, look forward to working with Matthew as we flip seats, build our party structure, and support our county parties in 2020 and beyond.
I would be remiss if I did not sincerely thank Ann Dent for her willingness to serve as Interim Executive Director. I do not know what I would have done over the last six months without her guidance and support. If you see Ann please thank her for all the work she has put towards pulling us out of debt, organizing the Eleanor Roosevelt Luncheon, and keeping the office running during this time of transition.
If you are as excited as I am to have hired an executive director with Matthew’s experience, please consider donating today so that we can work towards hiring a staff to help Matthew turn Utah purple, and someday blue!
Sincerely,
Jeff Merchant

Jeff Merchant,mail@utdem.org,Taking a Stand,"Dear Alex,
I don’t know if you’ve seen the news, but earlier this afternoon, Congressman Ben McAdams announced that he will vote to impeach. The national GOP and Trump campaign have put a target on him for doing the right thing and putting our country first.
Special interests and out-of-state super PACs are already airing ads attacking McAdams, and they are going to ramp up their efforts. Ben put his constitutional duty first and now we need to have his back.
Let’s send a message to Donald Trump and his super PAC cronies that Utah Democrats are standing behind Ben McAdams, and will defend - and win - the Fourth Congressional District in 2020. Will you donate today?
We need Congressman McAdams’ voice in Washington, and he needs our support. By donating today, you’ll be helping us to build the structure necessary to hold onto the Fourth Congressional District and elect Democrats up and down the ticket as we gear up for 2020.
Republicans are saying they’ve got CD-04 in the bag. Let’s show them how wrong they are. When one of us takes a stand on the side of justice, we stand together, and I appreciate your willingness to show your support financially.

Jeff Merchant,mail@utdem.org,Meet a Dem Candidate: Chris Peterson & Karina Brown,"Dear Alex,
We have some amazing Democrats running to represent you.
Over the coming weeks, we’re kicking off a series of emails featuring the candidates at the top of Utah’s Democratic ticket. Up first, meet our candidates for governor and lieutenant governor, Chris Peterson and Karina Brown.
Chris Peterson is a law professor at the University of Utah and lives in Salt Lake City, with his wife and three kids. Chris is a leading authority in the field of consumer protection and has a long history of advocating for working families.
As governor, Chris is committed to creating a government focused on the interests of working families by prioritizing affordable healthcare, quality education, and cracking down on unfair predatory practices and scams.
Karina Brown lives in Cache Valley with her husband and their four children. Karina came to public service through her involvement in passing Proposition 3. Her experiences during that process made her passionate about public service and the power of voting.
Like Chris, Karina Brown is an advocate for Utah families. Her passion for educating Utahns about the power of their vote, her work to improve the business environment in Northern Utah, and her skills as bridge builder will be assets in the Lieutenant Governor’s office.
Democratic values are at the heart of Chris and Karina’s campaign and we’re excited to have them representing us on that ballot.
You can learn more about Chris and Karina at [[URL REDACTED]] And any donations to the Utah Democratic Party will be part of powering them to victory in November.
DONATE NOW
As always, thanks for your support of the Party and all of our candidates.

Jeff, Matthew, and I just sat down to look at our fundraising numbers for the quarter. We are so close to hitting our goal of raising $10,000 from grassroots donors by the end of the day tomorrow, but it is going to take all of us.
Can you chip in $15, $35, $75, or even $150 before the end of the day tomorrow?
This election is so important. We need to hold onto CD-04, we need to take back the White House, and we need to flip seats here in Utah. Our candidates are hard at work reaching out to voters, but ballots are going to be hitting mailboxes in two weeks and we need to double our efforts. Will you help?
This election is the most important election of our lives. We’re voting for the leaders who are going to rebuild our country and our state as we recover from the pandemic. Democrats are the leaders who will create a more equitable society, who will ensure that everyone has access to healthcare, and who will fight for safe and quality education for our children.
We appreciate all that you are doing to help us elect these leaders in November. Thank you for your support.

Jeff Merchant,mail@utdem.org,Making History,"Dear Alex,
We all waited anxiously for Joe Biden's VP pick, and now our wait is over, as last night Senator Kamala Harris accepted our Party’s nomination for Vice President.
Last week, when Biden announced that his running mate would be Senator Kamala Harris, she became the first Black woman and Asian American on a major party ticket.
Representation matters, and I am proud it’s our Party’s ticket that my three girls—all of South Asian descent—can look to to see a vice-presidential candidate that looks like them.
Last night, the nation watched Senator Harris address the Democratic National Convention. It was a historic moment, and one of hope and excitement for our future, when so much around us seems grim.
Harris brings deep experience to the ticket. From her tenacity and hard-hitting questions during Senate trials to her sponsoring and co-sponsoring legislation to make life better for all Americans, I am confident that Senator Harris will continue to be a force for change.
Together Biden and Harris will take back the White House, and Utah Democrats will be here supporting them and candidates up and down the ticket.
We hope you’ll join us in celebrating this historic moment. Together, as Utah Democrats, we can take the excitement around this choice to defeat Trump and flip seats.
And, on a personal note, I cannot wait to see Senator Harris destroy Mike Pence during the VP Debate here in Salt Lake City in October.

Jeff Merchant

Jeff Merchant,mail@utdem.org,We Need Your Voice Now,"Dear Alex,
Today, Senate Republicans abdicated their constitutional duty to hold the President of the United States accountable by voting no on impeachment. Yes, the writing has been on the wall, but today’s vote is beyond disappointing and seriously damages the separation of powers and systems of checks and balances established by our Founders.
Even more disappointing is that many Republicans acknowledged that the president’s actions were wrong. Yet, they chose to do what was in their best interest instead of the people’s best interest. At this critical time, we cannot allow fear to dictate our actions, and we cannot allow our country to be run by people who care so little for the institutions that we have long held sacred.
Now, because Senate Republicans were unwilling to take a stand, our job as voters is more important than ever.
We must get to work and win in November. You can start that work by voting on Super Tuesday. You can get behind the nominee. Locally, you can volunteer for a candidate you support.
There are so many ways for you to use your voice, and your voice is necessary if we are going to change things come November.
You can also donate to the UDP and know that you are providing others with the training and the tools necessary to use their voice.
Whether you can donate $5, $25, $100, $500 or more, you will be showing Senate Republicans that Utah Democrats are not afraid of doing what is right.
So, despite today’s dismal news, remember that you are a voter, and you are powerful. Stay strong and thank you for all that you do.
Sincerely,
Jeff Merchant
Chair, Utah Democratic Party
P.S. Don’t forget to check a buck on your tax return. You can opt to donate $2 to the Utah Democratic Party and your county party with no cost to you through the Utah Election Campaign Fund.

Jeff Merchant,mail@utdem.org,November is coming,"Dear Alex,
While we have all been practicing social distancing, we at UDP have also been strategizing how best to help the 107 Democratic candidates running for office in Utah.
The COVID-19 pandemic has changed much in our lives, including the ways in which candidates will campaign. Campaigning during social distancing presents new challenges, and our candidates are going to need our support more than ever.
Today is the last day of the first quarter of 2020. The resources we are able to muster by midnight will play an important role in the support we are able to give candidates in the coming months.
As we are facing new challenges, our efforts to reach voters will depend on grassroots donations more than ever before. We know that many of us are tightening our belts, which goes straight to the heart of grassroots fundraising. When lots of people give a little, it really adds up.
Can you donate $15, $35, or $150 today to help us elect Democrats in November?
We want you to know how much we appreciate you and the ways you show up for UDP both in good and bad times. Whether it is with your donations, the hours you volunteer, or the many ways you advocate for Democratic values, thank you.

Super Tuesday is just days away and our candidates are passionate and determined to take back the White House. Are you in?
As Democrats throughout Utah are casting their ballots we at UDP thought it would be fun to conduct an informal, virtual straw poll to see which candidate can raise the most. You’ll vote with your donations, and every dollar you give will go to electing Democrats up and down the ballot right here in Utah.
Just click on your candidate below and make a donation of $5, $25, $50, $100, or whatever you can afford to cast your “vote.”
We’ll keep it open until Tuesday night, and on Wednesday, once we know the winner, we’ll share the results.
When all is said and done, even though we all have our favorites, Democrats are going to unite behind the nominee. We know that there is too much at stake, and we cannot afford four more years of a Trump presidency.
Thanks for your support and for participating in our straw poll.

I wanted to make sure you saw Jeff’s email about Taylor & Mayne. As he mentioned, typically the money we raise over this weekend helps fund our efforts to elect Democrats in November.
We have also had unexpected costs in holding a virtual convention. Our Virtual Convention is costing the Party close to $10,000, and we haven’t been able to hold the fundraising event that would have paid for it.
We’re hoping that you might be able to make a donation today to help us out. You’ll help us cover the cost of our Virtual Convention and you’ll be helping Democrats up and down the ticket to victory come election day.
Can you donate $5, $25, $75, or even $150 today?

Subject: Taylor & Mayne
Dear Matthew,
Tonight would have been UDP’s Taylor & Mayne Dinner, and I’m going to be candid: Taylor & Mayne is one of our biggest fundraisers of the year. The money we raise at Taylor & Mayne and over Convention weekend helps us support our slate of candidates leading up to November - money we need to hire field organizers, carry out a coordinated campaign, and get out the vote.
Some people have said we are lucky because we haven’t had to spend any money on Convention. That isn’t quite true. Between new websites, technical support, electronic voting, and many other things we have had to integrate and innovate, we have spent nearly $10,000.
Since we are not all gathering together tonight to celebrate our Democratic candidates, would you consider making a donation? Can you donate $5, the $50 you would have spent on a ticket to the event, or even $500?
Your donations will go a long way in helping us fill the gap left by canceling Taylor & Mayne and in making sure we can support Democrats across the state.
Since the beginning of March, all of us have had to rearrange many aspects of our daily lives. At UDP we have had to cancel in-person events, figure out how to hold conventions remotely, and adapt to working at home. But we are all doing it for a very important reason - to keep ourselves, our friends and family, and our community safe and healthy.
We appreciate your support as we have made these changes, and we appreciate your support as we try to make-up from the loss of one of our biggest fundraisers of the year. Team Democrat is lucky to have you.
In Gratitude,
Jeff

* Chris Peterson - Governor
* Greg Skordas - Attorney General
* Kael Weston - Congressional District 2
* Devin Thorpe - Congressional District 3
* Ben McAdams - Congressional District 4
In Congressional District 1, Jamie Cheek and Darren Parry are headed to a primary in June.
After the whirlwind over the last several weeks, I think we all took a break yesterday to catch our breath, but now it is time to get back in the game and get to work. Election day is just six months away, and these candidates and all of our down-ticket races need your support more than ever.
In November, we will be voting on the type of future we want. Do we want a future where we take care of working families? Do we want a future where healthcare is affordable and accessible to everyone? Or do we want a future where we leave people behind?
As Democrats, we know that we cannot afford to keep leaving people behind, and we’re dedicated to electing leaders who will fight for a better future for everyone. If you are able, can you donate $10, $20, $50, $100 or even $200 today to help us do so?

Join us this Thursday, July 9th, at 6:30 p.m. with a Facebook Live Interview with Karina Brown.
This will be an approximately 30-minute discussion of topics with our Democratic nominee for Lieutenant Governor. Feel free to ask questions on UDP Facebook feed. Click HERE to go to our Facebook page.
Most recently, Karina was sworn in as a planning commissioner for the City of Nibley following her efforts on the Cache Valley Chamber of Commerce Board of Directors and as co-chair of the Cache Chamber Legislative Affairs Committee.
Karina is president of the Cache County Friends of the Children’s Justice Center Board and was a founding sponsor of the Medicaid Expansion ballot initiative adopted by Utah voters in 2018.
She has spent a significant amount of the past year working as co-chair of Cache Celebration of Women’s Suffrage 2020, an organization working to celebrate the centennial of the 19th Amendment banning sex-based denial of the right to vote.
Thursdays with the Chair is a new program we are implementing this year. It is a weekly, online event with our various candidates. These meetings will include me (Jeff Merchant), as the host, individual candidates, and members of our party.

Do you want to be part of the change that is coming to Utah?
We have big plans to flip seats up and down the ballot this November, but we couldn’t do it without a committed group of folks that believe in the power of Utah Democrats to change our state.
Our Chair’s Circle members commit to donating $100 a month to the Utah Democratic Party. Their consistent financial donations underwrite the basic operational costs of running the Party. They make sure we can pay our rent, provide healthcare for our employees, keep the lights on, and put toilet paper in the bathrooms.
While none of these are big and exciting expenditures, they make it possible for us to build coordinated campaigns, support county parties, recruit candidates, and get Democrats out to vote. Our Chair’s Circle members know this, and by consistently donating to UDP, they help build the backbone of the Party.
Will you join them?
Apart from knowing that you are contributing to the financial well-being of UDP, you’ll get some pretty amazing perks. All Chair’s Circle members receive:
* Invitation to special breakfasts or receptions with VIP speakers.
* Complimentary ticket to the Legislative Gala, Taylor & Mayne Dinner, and Eleanor Roosevelt Awards Luncheon (single ticket for individual / two tickets for couples).
* Access to VIP Receptions at the Legislative Gala, Taylor & Mayne Dinner, and Election Night.
To be ready for this fall’s election, we need at least 26 new Chair Circle members. We hope you’ll consider joining today and becoming an integral part of powering Utah Democrats to victory in 2020 and far into the future.

Jeff Merchant,mail@utdem.org,Labor Values are Dem Values,"Dear Alex,
Today marks the unofficial end of summer, and what a summer it has been.
Normally, we’d all be celebrating with our Labor brothers and sisters at the Labor Day Picnic and Car Show. Since we won’t be gathering in person, I wanted to take a moment to thank the Labor Movement for their efforts to make our state and country a better place for everyone.
The values of our Utah labor organizations are Utah values -- which are Democratic values. They are the values of working hard and doing your part to make things better. We all believe that everyone deserves fair pay and economic security, that you should be safe at work, and that when you work hard you should have benefits like healthcare and retirement.
Utah labor unions are fighting for these values day in and day out. In doing so, they not only make life better for their members, but for all Utahns. Their example shows us time and again that we are so much stronger when we stand together.
So to all of our labor leaders and members, I want you to know how much I appreciate your service and contributions to our Party and our state. Thank you for all of the ways you support our candidates and for your advocacy among our legislators on both sides of the aisle.
I hope that you too can take a moment to reflect on what Utah might look like without a labor movement and send a message of thanks to a labor member or leader in your life.
Thanks for all you do, and happy Labor Day.
Best,
Jeff

Matthew Patterson,mail@utdem.org,August is Almost Over,"Dear Alex,
August is almost over, which means we are 64 days away from election day. Ballots will be in our mailboxes before we know it.
Here at UDP, we’re still $1,135 away from hitting our end of the month fundraising goals. Will you help us make up the difference by pitching in $10, $25, $75, $150, or whatever you can afford today?
I’ve been working on political campaigns for nearly 20 years, and I don’t know that I have ever seen as much energy around an election. I also don’t know that I have ever seen candidates work as hard as our Democratic candidates are working this year.
They are facing unique challenges posed by campaigning in the middle of a pandemic, but it hasn’t slowed them down. They know what is at stake for our families and our communities this November. But they need your help to keep up the momentum and make it to election day.
I want to thank you in advance for donating today and helping us reach our end of the month goal. You make it possible for UDP to support the candidates up and down the ticket that will flip seats and make Utah a better place for everyone.

Matthew Patterson

Ingela Rundquist,mail@utdem.org,"""I'm Speaking""","Dear Alex,
Last night, here in Salt Lake City, Utah, and for the first time in the history of our country, a Black and South Asian woman took the stage to participate in the Vice Presidential debate.
In an election cycle that has been dominated by the failed and downright dangerous leadership of the Trump administration, last night gave me the hope and inspiration I needed to power me through the next 26 days.
Senator Harris outlined the Biden/Harris plan to build back better, and her care and concern for the American people were evident. Pence, on the other hand, didn’t actually answer any questions and showed a lack of compassion in the face of widespread suffering caused by a pandemic.
Senator Harris was right when she said “the American people have witnessed what is the greatest failure of any presidential administration in the history of our country.” It is time for a change and with ballots dropping next week we need to get out the vote. We need your help.
Will you donate $35 today to help our get out the vote efforts? Together we’re going to flip seats and create a Utah and a country that works for everyone, not just special interests and the ultra-rich.
I hope that like me, you found inspiration last night to keep fighting. Thanks for all you are doing and don’t forget to make a plan to vote.
Sincerely,
Ingela

Jeff Merchant,mail@utdem.org,UDP Update on Caucus & Conventions,"FARMINGTON, UT- Today the Utah Democratic Party (UDP) State Central Committee, comprised of Democratic state, county, and elected leaders, passed measures to address upcoming the caucus night on March 24 and conventions.
The State Central Committee has granted the UDP leadership authority to do the following:
1\. Cancel caucus nights in each of the 29 counties and allow delegates previously elected in 2018 to continue their service if they so choose. Counties will also be given authorization to make available to the public applications from individuals who are not delegates but interested in becoming delegates. Maximum flexibility under the law and UDP rules will be given to County Executive Committees to implement these changes.
2\. Shift County and State Conventions from in-person events to mobile events by instituting a “drive-by balloting” mechanism. This will ensure only credentialed delegates participate in voting. The annual Taylor and Mayne event will be rescheduled for a later date.
3\. Allow national delegate selection to also be done by “drive-by balloting.” The UDP will continue working with the Democratic National Committee, as it has been for the last several days, to ensure this process is as transparent, equitable and efficient as possible. We are also pleased to have the support of this aspect of the plan by local leaders of the Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden campaigns.
4\. Inform, upon the conclusion of the filing period on March 19, 2020, properly filed candidates about how counties and the UDP intend to help them reach delegates and voters over the rest of the campaign season.
Given the ever-changing situation, the UDP leadership has been given authority to adjust, modify, change or rescind aspects of this plan as dictated by federal, state or local law, or as circumstances dictate.
Jeff Merchant, Utah Democratic Party Chair.

Jeff Merchant,mail@utdem.org,Stand with Ben,"Dear Alex,
I don’t know about you, but I tuned into the impeachment hearings whenever I got a spare moment.
Our president abused his office and invited a foreign power to interfere in US elections - no one disputes the facts. Even worse, this is a pattern of behavior and sets an alarming precedent for our democracy.
But yesterday, while the rest of Utah’s far right delegation put their Party before their Country, I felt proud as I saw Congressman Ben McAdams put people before politics.
Congressman McAdams looked at the facts and voted with his conscience. His vote to impeach undoubtedly means GOP special interests will pour MILLIONS into defeating him. It will mean he will be the target of increasing attack ads from out-of-state shadowy groups.
Ben stood up for our country, for Utah, and for us. Now will you stand up for him? Help us build our war chest to protect the 4th Congressional District by making a donation today.
McAdams is the lone Utah Democrat in Washington making sure we have a voice, and he needs us behind him. I hope that you are as proud as I am to have Ben representing us and Utah values in our nation’s capital, and I also hope that you’ll chip in today to ensure that we can hold onto Ben’s seat.

Jeff Merchant,mail@utdem.org,Our Super Heroes on the Hill,"Dear Alex,
You and I know that as Democrats, we may be a little outnumbered at the Utah State Capitol, but that won’t stop our elected Democratic legislators.
In the House and the Senate, they’ll be running bills that go to the heart of what it means to be a Utah Democrat - equality, justice, and compassion. They see a problem and then find solutions through legislation aimed at improving the lives of all Utahns.
Here are just a few examples of the bills they’ll be sponsoring:
* Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls and LGBTQ+
* Universal Background Checks
* Employer Tax Credit for Childcare
* Repealing Straight Ticket Voting
* Expungement
* Worker Safety
* Mental Health Insurance
* Renewable Energy
* Juvenile Justice
These issues are not just important to individual voters, they are vital to the long-term well being of our state. Part of why I’m a democrat is that I believe we need to plan for today and for tomorrow—and that is exactly what our Democratic legislators are doing.
If you are as inspired as I am by the work our amazing legislators are doing, I hope you’ll make a donation to our Super Heroes on the Hill campaign. $5, $25, $100, $250, or even $500 will go a long way in making sure we can increase their numbers on election day in November.
And today, as our legislators head to work at the Capitol, let them know that we are behind them. Call or email and thank them for standing up for you.

As always, thanks for all you do.

Jeff Merchant,mail@utdem.org,"Tax Bill, Bad for Utah","Dear Alex,
Last night, our Democratic legislators stood together and bravely opposed one of the worst rushed and short-sighted tax reform bills ever to move through the Utah Legislature.
The goal of tax reform was to create a stable and sustainable tax base, but instead, Republican legislators pushed forward a tax bill that cuts taxes for special interests while increasing the tax burden on people like you.
This tax bill is a complete disregard for Utah families—from passing a fiscally irresponsible tax cut based on a one year surplus to not planning for public education funding. Most egregiously, the tax bill increases the tax on groceries and gasoline. Not only is the Utah GOP betraying its own so-called beliefs by creating such a complex tax system, it is abandoning thousands of Utahns who struggle to make ends meet everyday.
Utahns are compassionate, we care about our neighbors and the future of our children, and our tax code should reflect that. If you agree, will you take action by making a donation today?
Our brave Democrats fought hard for your values. They stood up and voted against this tax bill, and have fought throughout this process for reforms that will move us forward. These changes include a state Earned Income Tax Credit and exempting menstrual products from sales tax.
Say thanks to your Utah Democrats and help build a warchest so we can elect more Democrats like them in 2020, by making a donation today. With your support, we can flip seats and support candidates that want to see all Utahns succeed, not just wealthy Utahns that can afford lobbyists to advocate on their behalf.

Jeff Merchant,mail@utdem.org,Call Your Senators,"Dear Alex,
Impeachment proceedings are in the U.S. Senate. And I am wondering, will Republican Senators uphold their Constitutional duty? Will they vote to admit the testimony and evidence they need to make a fact-based decision on the president’s abuses of power?
Senate Republicans - including Utah’s Mitt Romney and Mike Lee - have voted to approve Senator McConnell’s rules that provide no guarantee for the calling of witnesses, giving McConnell the framework for the sham trial he wants to conduct.
We stand at an important moment in our history, and Republicans in Washington are not taking it seriously.
As citizens in this democracy, we have a role to play. We can call Senators Lee and Romney and ask them to vote for the Senate to subpoena documents and hear testimony from witnesses. This is a trial after all - and a trial this important deserves witnesses!
Senator Romney has already indicated that he is willing to vote in favor of hearing from witnesses. Will you help give him a nudge?
Please pick up your phone today and make two phone calls. Remind Senator Lee and Senator Romney that this is not about party. This is not about politics. This is about protecting our democracy from abuses of power.
Senator Romney - (202) 224-5251 or (801) 524-4380 - Contact Form
Senator Lee - (202) 224-5444 or (801) 524-5933 - Contact Form
Kindly ask them to uphold the oath they took to defend the Constitution by voting for a fair and open trial in the Senate.
Thank you for taking the time to make your voice heard.

Today is going to be a long day. If you are like me, you feel cautiously optimistic, but you are not taking anything for granted.
To that end, our volunteers, staff, and candidates will be reaching out to voters all day long and reminding them that today is their last chance to vote in the most important election of our lives. And we’ll all be anxiously waiting for returns to start coming in when the polls close.
But no matter what happens when all of the votes are counted, I am so proud of the Utah Democratic Party and the ways we came together this year.
When the year began, none of us could have imagined we’d be campaigning in the middle of the pandemic, yet we remained a voice for progress, unity, and equality. I believe that Utah voters see this. It will be reflected in the seats we flip and when Joe Biden and Kamala Harris declare victory.
I look forward to celebrating with you tonight and hope you can join us and our co-hosts for our Virtual Election Night Party, tonight at 8:00 pm. Thank you so much for all that you have done in these challenging times to fight for democratic values. We’re lucky to have you as part of the Utah Democratic Party.

Jeff Merchant,mail@utdem.org,Seriously?,"Dear Alex,
Another Presidential Debate, another embarrassment.
Just like the last debate, Trump bullied his way through the evening. The fact that he has access to health care that is far out of reach for most Americans was lost on him as he downplayed his COVID-19 diagnosis. And he failed to give the American people any idea of how he plans to rebuild our country or protect us from the continuing pandemic.
In contrast, my admiration for Joe Biden continues to grow as I watch him stand up to Trump’s attacks and articulate plans for building back better. Utah and America desperately need the change represented by the Biden/Harris ticket and their promise to bring us together.
Here in Utah, our candidates are fighting for that change too. They know that Utah values are not represented by the Republicans in power, and they’ve seen that Utah voters agree. Now we need to make sure that voters return their ballots.
If you are in a position to do so, please chip in $5, $35, $75, $150, or even $250 today to help us remind Utah voters to vote their whole ballot over the next 10 days.
The end is in sight, and we appreciate your support as we work to flip seats and take back the White House. Stay strong, and if you have not already returned your ballot, make sure you do, and don't stop at the top!

I know you are probably getting a lot of emails these days, but this is important, and I promise to keep it short.
This election is set to break voter turnout records, we’ve seen a 54% increase in the number of registered Democrats, and Utahns have their ballots in hand. Now we, as Utah Democrats, need to reach out and make sure those ballots don’t get ignored in piles of mail.
We’ve already far exceeded the number of voter contacts we made in 2016 - reaching out to voters over 2 million times, compared to 77,000 times in 2016. But we’re not stopping yet.
Our candidates, staff, and volunteers will be spending the next week focusing on encouraging Utahns to return their ballots. We all know that while voters are motivated, we can’t take a single vote for granted. We’ve seen Democrats lose by just a few votes in years past, and we’re determined to not let that happen this year. That’s why we are calling on you today.
By donating $35 today, you’ll help us contact voters in the final days of this election and remind them to make their voice heard.
Voting is integral to our democracy, and reminding voters to return their ballots is critical to bringing progress to Utah. Thank you in advance for helping us to bring about real change.

Subject: Cast Your Vote!
Date: Friday, February 28, 2020
Dear Matthew,
Super Tuesday is just days away and our candidates are passionate and determined to take back the White House. Are you in?
As Democrats throughout Utah are casting their ballots we at UDP thought it would be fun to conduct an informal, virtual straw poll to see which candidate can raise the most. You’ll vote with your donations, and every dollar you give will go to electing Democrats up and down the ballot right here in Utah.
Just click on your candidate below and make a donation of $5, $25, $50, $100, or whatever you can afford to cast your “vote.”
We’ll keep it open until Tuesday night, and on Wednesday, once we know the winner, we’ll share the results.
When all is said and done, even though we all have our favorites, Democrats are going to unite behind the nominee. We know that there is too much at stake, and we cannot afford four more years of a Trump presidency.
Thanks for your support and for participating in our straw poll.
Sincerely,

This is Emily, Jeff’s wife, and I am taking over Jeff’s email duties for the day to wish him a very happy Father’s Day (and maybe to embarrass him, just a little bit).
I want to thank Jeff for his love and dedication to making Utah and our country a better place for not only our daughters, but for all of us. He works long hours, makes sacrifices, and never complains, all because he believes so strongly in the importance of electing Democrats here in Utah.
I know that Jeff isn’t the only father that wants to make Utah a better place for his children. So many of our candidates, volunteers, and donors are fathers as well.
If you have a father in your life, with a dedication to Democratic values, will you make a donation to UDP this Father’s Day in their honor?
Your gift to the Party will be an important part of UDP flipping seats in 2020 and in creating a brighter future for us all. I hope that you are able to spend some quality time with your families this weekend and that you have a wonderful Father’s Day.

Jeff Merchant,mail@utdem.org,Team Democrat,"Dear Alex,
You might be missing your favorite sport these days. But there’s one team sport that hasn’t been canceled - politics. “What?” you might be saying. “Politics isn’t a sport.” But when you think about it politics and team sports have a lot in common.
When you play a team sport, you do so because you have a passion for the game and your teammates. In politics, we don’t run for office for ourselves. We do so because we care about the people on our team - those in our communities, state, and country. And you need to work together if you want to win.
So, over the next several weeks, we at UDP want to highlight some of the ways that we can build a stronger Team Democrat.
However, the stakes in politics are a little higher. In November, we’re not just hoping to win a championship. We’ll be electing the leaders responsible for rebuilding as we recover from the impact of the coronavirus. It is vital that Democrats are on that playing field, fighting for Democratic values.
And there is one big difference. Politics is not a spectator sport. We need people like you who care deeply about improving peoples’ lives to get involved and join Team Democrat.
Whether you are able to chip in with a donation, volunteer, or talk to your friends and family about Democratic candidates and all they have to offer - you are an important member of our team.
We know many in our community are facing challenges and hardships, and we appreciate you whether you are able to participate right now or not.
As always, thanks for all you do. Stay safe and stay healthy.

Jeff Merchant

Ingela Rundquist,mail@utdem.org,From Davis to Daggett,"Dear Alex,
All across Utah, Democrats are running for office. They are running for everything from State House and Senate to Congress to the county clerk. It just goes to show that whether you live in Daggett County or Davis County, Utah values are Democratic values.
Growing up in rural southwest Utah, I know first hand how true this is and how important it is that we elect Democrats across the state.
Utah is a big state, but no matter where you live, you care about providing for your family, quality education for your children, and the ability to access healthcare when you need it. You want to feel heard and you want to know that your elected representatives are listening.
This is why it is important that we support Democrats statewide.
We’re stronger when we work together, and by electing Democrats to office at all levels of government all across the state, we’ll move Utah forward. Will you help support ALL Utah Democrats by donating $15, $35, $75, $150, or whatever you can afford today?
We’ll make progress in creating economic opportunity in both rural and urban areas, we’ll ensure students in rural Utah have the same opportunities as students along the Wasatch front, and that when Utahns need medical attention, they are able to access it.
Thanks for all you do.
Best,

Jeff Merchant,mail@utdem.org,Democrats Believe,"Dear Alex,
I have to admit, I got pretty excited as I watched Senators Mayne, Escamilla, and Iwamoto along with Representatives King, Romero, and Spackman-Moss respond to Governor Herbert’s State of the State address. They all spoke eloquently, offered a contrast to an extreme GOP agenda, and clearly articulated a statement on our Democratic values and beliefs. That is what I love about Democrats--we are about getting things done, not just partisan rancor.
Our Democratic leaders pointed out the failures of the majority to listen to the voice of the people.
They lauded the citizens of Utah in demanding to be heard on tax reform.
And they vowed to move forward with legislation that addresses the challenges facing our state - the gender wage gap, education funding, air quality, and homelessness - just to name a few.
It's time to start electing legislators who will actually legislate - not based on their own small ideas, but for the greater good of our communities, our counties, and our state.
If this message resonates with you, if these are the beliefs you hold dear - I urge you to donate today. We are the party of the people, we are fighting alongside our legislators, and we need your help to elect more Democrats to the State House and Senate.
Every $10, $25, $100, $250, or whatever you can afford is a donation in support of these core beliefs.
With your donation, you are reaffirming our shared belief that power lies with the people, and you are fighting for fairness and equal opportunity.
And as Senator Mayne reminded us in her closing remarks - make your voice heard, do not back down, and stay engaged. Thank you for all you do.
Sincerely,
Jeff Merchant

Super Tuesday has come and gone. Now it is time to start thinking about Convention and Taylor & Mayne 2020.
We want you to be the first to know our plan for this exciting weekend. We’ll be taking Taylor & Mayne and Convention on the road!
While Salt Lake County is known as a Democratic stronghold, we’ve been making inroads in Northern Utah. To celebrate this progress in traditionally Republican areas, we’ll be holding Taylor & Mayne at the Davis Convention Center in Layton on April 24th. On Saturday, April 25th, we’ll be taking over Utah State University in Logan for Convention.
We have big plans to make our Convention & TayMay road trip fun for all, so stay tuned. And we can’t wait to see you there!

Jeff Merchant,mail@utdem.org,"We've Got Your Back, Ben","Dear Alex,
A little over a week ago, I wrote to you about our need as a party to rally behind Congressman McAdams. Before he voted for impeachment, Congressman McAdams was considered one of the most vulnerable Democrats in the country. Now, the target Republicans painted on his back has doubled in size - all because he followed his conscience and stood up for our democracy.
Congressman McAdams is taking heat from out-of-state special interests from the extreme right. These faceless super PACs are unrelenting in their efforts to defeat him—I’m sure you’ve already seen the attack ads. The Republicans think that his seat is up for grabs—we need to send a message it’s not.
Let’s stand together and show them that the 4th Congressional District is not for the taking. Ben had our back, now we have his.
As Utah Democrats, we know that Congressman McAdams has been in Washington, DC focusing on issues important to us. He’s fought to secure Social Security and Medicare and to lower the cost of prescription drugs. After years without a voice like Congressman McAdams', it’s been nice to know that there is one Utahn in the nation’s capital that is advocating for our values.
Donate $5, $25, $100, $250 or whatever you can afford today. Let’s make sure that when November 2020 rolls around, Ben will be headed back to Washington.
Sincerely,
Jeff Merchant

Jeff Merchant,mail@utdem.org,Meet the Team,"Dear Alex,
We’ve been talking about field organizers for months, and the wait is finally over. Thanks to your support we have been able to hire a talented group of field organizers with a combined 25 years worth of campaign experience.
We’re excited to have them on board, and I wanted to take a minute and introduce you to Margie Benson, Mary Covey, Jon O’Brien, and Hunter Davies.
Margie worked with UDP in 2018 and is thrilled to be back for 2020. Mary has worked on 10 campaigns in 10 years starting as a field intern on an Ohio congressional race and including the re-election of Senator Tim Kaine in 2020. Jon started his campaign life when he was a junior in high school and volunteered for Senator Elizabeth Warren and most recently worked on Senator Warren’s presidential run. And like Jon, Hunter began his career in campaigning in high school, working on multiple state legislative races before moving to Utah for college.
Margie, Mary, Jon, and Hunter are excited to be part of our UDP team and are committed to turning Utah bluer this year. Will you help them?
You helped us hire them, and we’re hoping you’ll step up once again and make a donation of $35 today to ensure that they can continue to support candidates in the field.
Margie, Mary, Hunter, and Jon all agree that this is the most important election of their lives, and we appreciate your support as we work to flip seats in November.
Best,
Jeff

Jeff Merchant,mail@utdem.org,“Until Everyone Is Free”,"Dear Alex,
I wanted to take a minute and wish you a happy Independence Day as we celebrate the birth of our country.
I also want to remind you of these words from President Obama’s second inaugural address:
* * *
“What makes us exceptional—what makes us American—is our allegiance to an idea articulated in a declaration made more than two centuries ago: ‘We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.’ Today we continue a never-ending journey to bridge the meaning of those words with the realities of our time.""
To me, as I have watched Americans protest oppression and racism over the last six weeks, these words could not be more appropriate. The freedom and independence that was declared in 1776 did not apply to everyone. Still today, basic freedoms and liberties are denied to too many in our cities, states, and country.
As Democrats, we have a duty to dismantle the systemic racism that is still so prevalent. We must listen, learn, and amplify. And we must commit to voting for leaders that will do the same.
So, this weekend, let’s celebrate our independence while recognizing the work we still need to do because in the words of civil rights leader Fannie Lou Hamer, “No one is free until everyone is free.”

Sincerely,
Jeff

Jeff Merchant,mail@utdem.org,Who Will It Be?,"Dear Alex,
While Democrats across the country anxiously await Joe Biden’s VP pick, we at UDP thought it would be fun to conduct an informal, virtual straw poll to see which candidate Utahns want to see on the ballot (and raise a little money for UDP too ).
You’ll vote with your donations, and every dollar you give will go to electing Democrats up and down the ballot right here in Utah.
Just click on your candidate below and make a donation of $5, $25, $50, $100, or whatever you can afford to cast your “vote.”
We’ll keep it open until June 15th, and once we know the winner, we’ll share the results.
Any one of these powerhouse women is a fantastic choice, and we look forward to supporting Joe, his VP, and all the Democrats on the ticket this November.
Thanks for your support and for participating in our straw poll.

When primary elections fall on the same day as the end of the quarter, it seems like a message from the universe reminding us that it is time to get serious about November.
We need to raise $880 by the end of the day to meet our end of quarter goal. Will you chip in today?
There’s a lot on the line. In Washington, we have a president that repeatedly demonstrates how unfit he is to lead. Our Republican dominated legislature is threatening to cut funding to social services and education exactly when Utahns need those services most.
Utahns see this. They are hungry for change. And the Utah Democratic Party has the answer in the 83 Democrats running for office.
They’re ready to go to work for you, so let’s get to work for them.
Thanks in advance, and if you have a primary, I hope you’ve voted. If you haven’t it is not too late to drop your ballot at a ballot drop box.
Best,
Jeff

Jeff Merchant,mail@utdem.org,Statement on  COVID-19 & Democratic Caucus & Conventions,"Contact: Jeff Merchant
Utah Democratic Party Chair
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE ----
Statement on COVID-19 & Democratic Caucus & Conventions
There is nothing that the Utah Democratic Party values more than the people's health and wellbeing. As a result of the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States, and the Governor’s recent statement limiting meeting sizes to slow the spread of the virus, the Utah Democratic Party will be restructuring its upcoming state convention. Although we are unable to release details at this time, all in-person events originally scheduled for April 24 and April 25 will be cancelled.
County Party Chairs have been instructed to restructure caucus meetings and county conventions as they see fit with a focus on protecting the public health. While the UDP is not mandating cancellation of caucus meetings on March 24, given the continued spread of illness, the UDP is strongly advising counties to find alternatives to mass gatherings at schools, libraries, or other locations as is customary.
County Party Chairs will also receive dispensation from county constitutional provisions that require specific procedures for county conventions. County conventions, which often involve hundreds to thousands of people, will not be held in-person. Counties may conduct conventions in other formats, and the UDP will aid counties in this process.
Although we recognize that many want specifics, with the fast-changing situation, it is impossible for us to provide specific details currently. The UDP will continue to work with state and local officials, county party leadership, and party members to do everything possible to protect the public health while meeting legal requirements for nominating candidates.

One Year!
It’s hard to believe, but today marks the first full year of my election as the Chair of the Utah Democratic Party. It has been a long, but productive year. We have pulled the party out of debt, we have hired two new staff members, we elected numerous Democrats to local office, we have held our first entirely virtual state convention (which resulted in one of the most diverse teams of Executive Officers ever in UDP history), and we have an amazing slate of candidates running for state and federal office.
Despite months at home due to the pandemic, and the vital work being done to provide justice to Black Americans and people of color throughout the world, we have not taken our eye off the ball. Winning in 2020 is crucial to ensure that we as Americans find peace in the world, justice in society, and safety in our homes.
But things are moving fast! We are now less than five months away from Election Day and less than a week away from the end of the quarter. We have a lot of work to do.
Our biggest fundraiser of the year was cancelled in April, and we’re working our hardest to make up the difference this quarter. We’re hoping to raise $5,000 from grassroots donors like you in the next week to keep our budget on track.
Will you help us meet our end of quarter goal and support the 83 Democrats running for office across the state?
We are challenging the status quo, and we have a slate of candidates that will watch out for the interests of people like you. They’re ready to go to fight for you, are you ready to go to fight for them?
Can you donate $15, $25, $75, $150, $250, or whatever you can afford today to ensure that the UDP is able to fight for our candidates?
Supporters like you are the life-blood of UDP, and we need you more than ever. Thanks for all you do to support the Party and our candidates.

Here in Utah, we’ve been successfully voting by mail for 6 years and know that it is easy, safe, and secure. Trump’s comments about mail-in voting being insecure are ridiculous, but his misinformation has emboldened his supporters.
Now, we have to be vigilant and do everything we can to protect our free and fair elections here in Utah.
As a result, we have spent the last month building a robust voter protection plan, unlike anything we have ever done before.
We are actively recruiting attorneys, law students, and paralegals and training them to be poll watchers. Our first-ever, statewide voter protection hotline will be a resource for voters to not only ask questions about how to vote but to also report incidents of intimidation, harassment, and officials not following the law.
And our voter protection efforts won’t end on election day, we’ll work up until the final canvas to make sure every vote is counted.
Will you donate today to our voter protection efforts? Your donation of $500, $250, $150, $75, or $25 will allow us to provide PPE for our election day poll watchers and help cover the cost of any litigation necessary to protect voters’ rights after election day.
Thank you so much for all that you do from supporting candidates to being part of this voter protection effort.

Jeff Merchant,mail@utdem.org,A Future Built on Hope,"Dear Alex,
There are only two months until election day - two months until we take back the White House and two months until we flip seats in Utah. We have work to do.
I don’t know about you, but I tried to stomach the Republican National Convention last week. What I saw was speaker after speaker spouting lies and hate. In contrast to the vision presented by Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, it was devoid of hope and optimism and focused on the things that tear us apart rather than the things that bring us together.
It presented an image of an America that is not who we are. If we want to change this, we need to do everything we can to elect Democratic leaders in November. Our candidates are compassionate bridge builders and problem solvers. They will create a better future as we recover from the lack of leadership that has plagued us for the last four years.
At UDP, thanks to supporters like you, we’ve invested in the tools our candidates need to win, but with ballots hitting mailboxes in October, we need to help them reach out to undecided voters. Will you donate $35 today to ensure that they have the resources they need?
Together we can build a state and country built on progress and the values that bind us together rather than a future built on hate.

Jeff

Jeff Merchant,mail@utdem.org,When leadership matters,"Dear Alex,
Our lives look very different right now than they did two weeks ago.
We’ve weathered an earthquake and we’re living through a pandemic. And while many things have changed over the last few weeks, one thing hasn’t. There is still an election in November, and it’s more important than ever that we elect good leaders.
The last few weeks have shown us the importance of decisive and compassionate leadership, and what happens when it is lacking. People need to have their everyday needs met, whether that is through housing, food, or healthcare. And they need elected leaders willing to advocate for those needs whether it is business as usual or time of crisis, which is why I am writing to you today.
The leaders we elect in November will be key players in rebuilding our cities, state, and nation as we recover. We’ll need Democrats at all levels of government advocating for those hardest hit by impacts of COVID-19 - everyday working Utahns. And issues like climate change, education funding, and access to healthcare will still need to be solved.
I know that this is a hard time to ask for money. I also understand that many Americans are struggling, but that is exactly why we need to prepare now to win in November.
The Utah Democratic party still has ambitious plans, and we’re hoping to get as close to our end of quarter financial goal if possible. If you are able to chip in $15, $50, or even $250 it will go a long way in helping us to elect Democrats at all levels of government.
There would be no Democratic Party without you. Right now, your support means more than ever, and we appreciate that you are willing to ensure that candidates have the resources they need to run for office.
Stay safe and healthy, and we’ll get through this together.
Sincerely,
Jeff Merchant

Jeff Merchant,mail@utdem.org,Meet a Dem Candidate: Greg Skordas,"Dear Alex,
The office of the Attorney General has been plagued by controversy, pay to play, and politically motivated lawsuits under Republican leadership. Utah’s last three Attorneys General forgot that their duty was to represent the people of Utah, not themselves, not their donors, and not their party.
So, I’m proud to introduce at the top of Utah’s Democratic ticket, Attorney General candidate, Greg Skordas.
As an attorney of 38 years, Greg has practiced law as a legal defender, a prosecutor, and currently has his own law practice at a small law firm. Greg will bring a depth of experience and perspective to the role of Attorney General that has been sorely lacking for the last 20 years.
Greg is running for Attorney General because he wants to bring leadership, integrity, and independence back to the Office. Greg wants to be the people’s lawyer, ensuring that everyday Utahns have someone looking out for their interests. Democratic values of justice, fairness, and equality are at the heart of Greg’s campaign, and Utah needs his thoughtful and experienced leadership.
You can learn more about Greg at [[URL REDACTED]] And any donations to the Utah Democratic Party will be part of powering Greg to victory in November.
As always, thanks for your support of the Party and all of our candidates.
Sincerely,
Jeff Merchant

Jeff Merchant,mail@utdem.org,The Results Are In...Almost,"Dear Alex,
Like you, I feel deeply invested in defeating Trump in November. So, last night I was a little disappointed by the delay in the returns from the Iowa Caucus. As chair, I was also grateful that in Utah we will be voting in the Presidential Primary on March 3rd rather than on caucus night.
This is the first major contest on the road to selecting a Democratic nominee and is the first step in taking back our country.
This afternoon, as preliminary results are being released, it looks like Pete Buttigieg has the lead with 26.9% followed closely by Bernie Sanders with 25.1%. They are trailed by Warren, Biden, and Klobuchar. (Keep in mind, these numbers may change as remaining precincts report their results).
You might have a favorite, and you might not like where they finish in Iowa. But of this I am confident - all of the potential nominees have Democratic values at the heart of their message. They also have a vision for our country that is far superior to that of our current president.
I am also confident that at the end of the day we, Utah Democrats, will unite behind the nominee and help take back the White House.
Voter turnout is always higher in a presidential election year, and we have an opportunity to flip seats locally. Help us make this happen.
Please donate today to help us win in November both federally and locally. Your donation of $5, $25, $100, or even $250 today will help us lay the groundwork for changing the political landscape of Utah and the country.
United behind a common cause, we are powerful. I appreciate your willingness to chip in and help us make a change for the better.
Sincerely,
Jeff Merchant

Nothing about this election has been normal, but we couldn’t imagine not sharing the anticipation and camaraderie of watching the results roll in with a group of like-minded folks on Election Night.
Since we won’t be hanging out at a hotel or standing in line for drinks, we will be joining Alliance for a Better Utah, CD4 Coalition, the Sierra Club, and many others to host a virtual election night. You’re invited to our Election Night 2020 Virtual Party, November 3rd beginning at 8 p.m.
Together we can watch the results come in, both nationally and locally, chat with candidates, safely hang out with friends, and learn some new cocktail/mocktail recipes. And since you’re staying home, the drinks are free and you can wear your pajamas.
We hope you’ll join us as we celebrate our wins up and down the ticket and as we usher in a brighter future for Utah and the country.
Stay strong, and don’t forget to vote.

Jeff Merchant,mail@utdem.org,Who won the awards?,"Hello Alex,
This Friday we’ll be celebrating Democratic values at the 2020 Taylor & Mayne. It might look a little different than in years past, but we’ll be holding true to the namesakes of this special event.
Ed Mayne was a champion of labor who was elected to four terms in the Utah State Senate, while Todd Taylor was the longest-serving Democratic state party director in the country. The Taylor & Mayne Dinner allows us to celebrate these stalwarts of Utah Democratic Politics.
This year we are honoring Nichole Dunn with the Todd Taylor Democratic Gains Award and Brad Asay with the Ed Mayne Labor Champion Award.
Nichole currently serves as Chief of Staff to Congressman Ben McAdams. She has been shaping Utah Democratic politics for over 20 years having served as Chair of the Salt Lake County Democratic Party from 2001-2005. She relaunched the Young Democrats of Utah in 2001 and served as Deputy Mayor for both Mayor Ben McAdams and Mayor Peter Corroon. She has had a lasting impact on the Party, not only through her leadership roles, but also through the countless interns, campaign managers, and candidates she has mentored.
Brad is a unionist to the core, and under his leadership as President of the Utah American Federation of Teachers, AFT Utah has emerged as a strong voice for public and higher education employees. Brad began his career as a classified employee in the Davis County School District before becoming a full-time art teacher in the Ogden City Schools. He serves on the executive board of the Utah AFL-CIO and as vice-chair of the Utah One Coalition. His tenacity and hard work benefit countless public employees statewide.
We hope you’ll get your tickets today as we celebrate Nichole's and Brad’s countless contributions to the Utah Democratic Party.
We hope to “see” you on August 14th.
Sincerely,
Jeff

I wanted you to be one of the first to know. A pandemic is not going to stop the Utah Democratic Party from celebrating the hard work of our volunteers and labor community. While we can’t gather in person, we’re moving online for a virtual and re-imagined Taylor and Mayne.
Join us on Friday, August 14, 2020, as we heard from some of the biggest names in Democratic politics - including Pete Buttigieg and former Attorney General Eric Holder! We’ll also be honoring Nichole Dunn with the Todd Taylor Democratic Gains Award and Brad Asay with the Ed Mayne Labor Champion Award.
We’re excited for the opportunity to celebrate Democratic values and Democratic leadership as we build momentum towards election day when we’ll take back the White House and flip seats up and down the ballot.

Jeff Merchant,mail@utdem.org,40 Days,"Dear Alex,
Last week we lost Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. The news of her death shook me to my core. RBG dedicated her life to the fight for equality, and I can’t imagine what our country would look like without her advocacy, intelligence, and kindness.
Her absence will be deeply felt, and I mourn her loss. The example of her life has encouraged me to work even harder. It has also raised the stakes for November 3rd.
This is it. We are in the final push and the voter contacts we make over the next 40 days are critical. We need this quarter to be our strongest and best fundraising quarter ever. We’ve set the ambitious goal of raising $10,000 from our best supporters — our grassroots donors — to ensure that we are able to turn out the vote for our candidates.
Ballots will be hitting mailboxes in three weeks, which means people will be voting. We don’t have time to spare — and we MUST show Republicans that we will not stand idly by as they destroy the vision of RBG and ignore her dying wishes.
Please donate $15, $35, $75, $150, or even $250 today to ensure that we have the resources we need to support our candidates in the coming weeks because they too will be fighting for the legacy of the Notorious RBG.
Thank you in advance for stepping up once again to elect Democrats and make Utah a better place for all of us.
Best,
Jeff

I hope you saw Jeff’s email on Friday announcing that we’ve moved our biggest fundraiser of the year online. We’ll be holding a virtual Taylor & Mayne on August 14th, and we want you to join us.
We’re beyond excited about the powerhouse Democrats who will be joining us - Pete Buttigieg and former Attorney General Eric Holder. And we just heard that we’ll be hearing from everyone’s favorite Presidential candidate - Joe Biden.
We know how busy Vice-President Biden’s schedule is - he’s hard at work taking back the White House - and we cannot wait to hear what he has to say to Utah Democrats.
And, in honor of Vice President Biden, we’ll be sending every Taylor & Mayne ticket purchaser their very own “Go Joe” UDP face mask.
While we can’t gather in person, we decided that the work of our volunteers and candidates was worth celebrating. Plus November’s election is too important. We need to make sure we are able to support the hard work our volunteers and candidates are putting in as they run for office.

Jeff Merchant,mail@utdem.org,An Impossible Situation,"Dear Alex,
So, today is the first day of school for my kids. We have a tradition (which my teenagers now hate) of me taking everyone’s picture on the front stoop before they leave. This year’s picture is different though. Two of the kids aren’t going to school at all--they aren’t dressed up in a new outfit--they didn’t even get new outfits--and the third is only going out today because her mom is the principal.
All across the state, kids and teachers are starting to go back to school. For those of you with children in school, if you are like me, you’re feeling some combination of relief, anxiousness, fear, and frustration.
As we watch outbreaks of COVID-19 occurring in school districts across the nation, parents are making hard choices about whether to send their kids to school in person or online. We are worried about lost opportunities, balancing work, educating our children, and keeping loved ones safe.
There are no easy answers, and as the spouse of an educator and parent myself, I share their frustrations and concerns. Frankly what is so infuriating about this whole situation is that it was largely avoidable.
Republicans at the Federal and State level failed to lead during this pandemic. While we all scrambled to keep our families safe, to save jobs and to keep our favorite stores and restaurants open, they claimed it was a hoax. They disregarded science, they endangered lives, and they put Utah parents in an impossible situation.
We must elect leaders that support our educators, our families, and our children, and to do that, we’re going to need your help.
Utah Democrats have always fought to fund our schools and protect our educators. They are the only leaders listening to experts and calling for accountability. We need to flip seats and break the supermajority so we can move Utah forward. Will you help by donating $25, $75, $150, $250, or whatever you can afford today?
Thanks for all you do,
Jeff

Almost a year ago, we rolled out our $20 for 2020 campaign to start preparing for this election season. As Treasurer, I felt it was important to put my money where my mouth was, so I was proud to be the first donor to commit to giving $20 for 20 months, leading up to November 3, 2020.
I am proud to say we entered 2020 a debt-free party prepared to fight for the greater good, support our candidates, and make sure Utah seats turn blue in 2020!
We are now almost 8 months away from Election Day, and it is not too late to be part of this campaign. Will you chip in, and give $20 a month for the next 8 months? Or give $20 today, on 02/20/2020?
The Utah Democratic Party’s mission is to find qualified candidates, get them on the ballot, and support them to a win on election day.
We’re fighting for a brighter future for all Utahns.
We’re the party that listens to the people.
We’re the party that is fighting for fairness and equal opportunity.
We value working families over special interests.
We’re fighting for our children's future by prioritizing education, and we know that that future will be bleak if we don’t protect our environment.
Utahns see this, and we are going to win in November.
I hope you’ll join me in donating to support our candidates. They will be knocking on doors, walking in parades, and talking to voters across the state. They’ll be showing Utahns that Democratic values are Utah values, but they can’t do it without you.
Thank you for chipping in and for all you do.

Jeff Merchant,mail@utdem.org,My Three Positive Things,"Dear Alex,
I wanted to reach out after a long week. Between COVID-19 and an earthquake, we’re all dealing with a lot. Something my family is doing in the midst of disruption and uncertainty is to find three positive things that happened during the day. So, I thought that I would share with you three positive things that happened for the Utah Democratic Party this week.
1. During the filing window, despite pandemics and earthquakes, 107 Democrats filed to run for state offices. There will still be an election in November, and I’m thrilled that so many Democrats are willing to be candidates.
2. The DNC announced that the Bloomberg campaign transferred $18 million to allow the DNC to quickly ramp up efforts aimed at defeating Trump in November. They’re now expediting hiring and are looking for resumes. If you're interested, you can submit your resume here.
3. People within our Party are taking care of each other and their neighbors. You’re practicing social distancing. You’re going to the grocery store for those who can’t. And you’re donating to organizations in need.
And one more positive thing to come out of this week, for good measure:
Central Committee and leadership at all levels came together to create a great plan for holding remote County and State Conventions. While we'd all much rather gather in person, I’m proud of the way we’ve come together to find a solution.
As always, thanks for all you do. Stay safe, stay healthy, and hang in there.
Best,
Jeff

Jeff Merchant,mail@utdem.org,Honoring the Legacy of Dr. King,"Dear Alex,
Today we celebrate the life and legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Fifty-two years after his assassination, his work and legacy seem as important today as it was then. We cannot let ourselves become comfortable with the idea that the fight for civil rights was resolved in the past.
We are still faced with inequality in all corners of our society - in income, education, housing, and justice.
In light of the current state of our nation, the words of Dr. King ring true: “injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.” The current presidency is the very example today of the threats we are facing to democracy and to justice.
As Democrats, it is clear that Dr. King’s work is not done, and as we remember his life and all he accomplished, we have a duty to continue to work towards his vision of a diverse America where everyone enjoys the benefits of equality.
In the words of Congressman John Lewis, we’ll make “good trouble” when we see injustice. We will continue to work towards the election of leaders that will fight against inequality.
And most importantly, we will embrace the optimism and love that Dr. King embodied in the face of opposition and violence. We will work “with an abiding faith in America and an audacious faith in the future of mankind,” because like Dr. King we “believe that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word in reality.”
Let us not just remember Dr. King today, but let us honor his legacy by fighting for equality everyday and in all we do.

Jeff Merchant

# SIGN THE PETITION!
Dear Alex
Gov. Gary Herbert and Lt. Gov. Spencer Cox are refusing money Congress set aside to help hungry children in Utah during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Pandemic-EBT program provided more than a billion dollars in grants for states to provide prepaid food benefit cards to hungry families to buy food from grocery stores for their children. Similar to the SNAP program, the Families First Coronavirus Response Act passed by Congress in March, was meant to replace school lunches that provide critical nutrition for millions of at-risk kids while schools close.
Herbert and Cox decided to forgo the Pandemic-Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) program, making Utah the only state in the union taking steps to reject roughly $50 million for Utah children who would typically receive school meals, according to the New York Times.
I am calling for state leaders to immediately apply for the Pandemic-EBT benefits early Wednesday. The campaign also launched a petition to demand that Gov. Herbert and Lt. Gov. Cox immediately apply for and administer the Pandemic-EBT program so Utah parents can feed hungry children.
Please click here to view and sign the petition.

Jeff Merchant,mail@utdem.org,Real Change,"Dear Alex,
Wednesday, Senator Bernie Sanders suspended his campaign for President. I wanted to send my sincere thanks to Senator Sanders--not for suspending his campaign--but because of the way he has transformed the Democratic Party for the better.
Senator Sanders captured the hearts, minds, and vision of the American people, and energized a new generation of Democratic advocates. He put people before profit and politics. He spoke with honesty and called out injustice when he saw it. And he made us all think about the type of country we want to live in.
Together we can make real progress on the issues Senator Sanders brought to the forefront of our conversations--income inequality, the cost of college education, and climate change just to name a few. But this can only happen if we continue to fight the fight.
Senator Sanders said, “Real change never occurs from the top on down, always from the bottom on up.” As we move forward in this election cycle, I’m keeping these words in mind. We need to unite together to elect Democrats at all levels of government--from school board to president.
We have the real possibility to flip seats in Utah and change the balance of power--to start that bottom-up change Senator Sanders is referencing.
I hope that you’ll join us today as we recommit to taking back the White House, holding on to the Fourth Congressional District, and breaking the supermajority in the Utah Legislature.
There is too much at stake not to because the leaders we elect in November will play a huge role in the way our country recovers from the impacts of coronavirus.
These are challenging times, and your support is greatly appreciated.
Sincerely,
Jeff

Dear Matthew,
One Year!
It’s hard to believe, but today marks the first full year of my election as the Chair of the Utah Democratic Party. It has been a long, but productive year. We have pulled the party out of debt, we have hired two new staff members, we elected numerous Democrats to local office, we have held our first entirely virtual state convention (which resulted in one of the most diverse teams of Executive Officers ever in UDP history), and we have an amazing slate of candidates running for state and federal office.
Despite months at home due to the pandemic, and the vital work being done to provide justice to Black Americans and people of color throughout the world, we have not taken our eye off the ball. Winning in 2020 is crucial to ensure that we as Americans find peace in the world, justice in society, and safety in our homes.
But things are moving fast! We are now less than five months away from Election Day and less than a week away from the end of the quarter. We have a lot of work to do.
Our biggest fundraiser of the year was cancelled in April, and we’re working our hardest to make up the difference this quarter. We’re hoping to raise $5,000 from grassroots donors like you in the next week to keep our budget on track.
Will you help us meet our end of quarter goal and support the 83 Democrats running for office across the state?
We are challenging the status quo, and we have a slate of candidates that will watch out for the interests of people like you. They’re ready to go to fight for you, are you ready to go to fight for them?
Can you donate $15, $25, $75, $150, $250, or whatever you can afford today to ensure that the UDP is able to fight for our candidates?
Supporters like you are the life-blood of UDP, and we need you more than ever. Thanks for all you do to support the Party and our candidates.
Sincerely,
Jeff Merchant

Jeff Merchant,mail@utdem.org,Our Vision for 2020,"Dear Alex,
We have a vision for 2020 - a vision of Utah Democrats working together to empower voters to create change in the halls of power from Utah to Washington, D.C.
Our vision comes from our belief that:
* everyone deserves the opportunity to thrive and to provide for their families,
* quality healthcare and education are rights; and
* we have a duty to protect our environment for future generations.
We’re willing to put in the hard work to make that vision a reality, because 2020 is OUR year. We are going to flip seats across the State, protect the Fourth Congressional District, and take back the White House.
There are vulnerable Republicans across the State - Republicans who voted to gut Props 2 and 3, Republicans that voted for a tax bill that favors the rich and special interests over everyday Utahns - and in the coming weeks and months, we are going to be telling the stories of voters in those districts and our candidates running to represent them.
We don’t know who the Democratic candidate for president will be, but I know that Utah Democrats will come together to support the nominee. We’ll use the energy behind a presidential election to turn-out the vote and elect Democrats up and down the ticket.
Will you donate today so that we have the resources to translate our vision into action?
We have to stick together. We have to hold onto hope. We have to do the work. And we can’t do it without you.
Thank you for being part of our vision, and I look forward to all we are going to accomplish in 2020.
Sincerely,
Jeff Merchant

Matthew Patterson,mail@utdem.org,How to Super Tuesday,"Dear Alex,
Super Tuesday is just two weeks away, and it is our opportunity to vote for the Democratic nominee for President. The good news is you won’t be standing in line for hours in the cold like you did in 2016. Here is everything you need to know to participate in the Democratic Presidential Primary in Utah.
The first thing you need to know, you do not need to be a registered Democrat to vote in the Democratic Presidential Primary.
If you are not sure if you are a registered Democrat:
* Go to [[URL REDACTED]]
* Click on “find my voter registration info.”
* Fill out the form and click “submit.”
* You should now see all your voter info, including party affiliation.
If you are a registered Democrat:
* Your ballot will be mailed to you between February 11 and 18.
* You can then fill out your ballot and return it by mail or in a Ballot Drop Box. Ballots must be postmarked on or before March 2nd. If you live in a rural area, consider mailing your ballot a few days early--the county clerk will not consider your ballot timely if it is not postmarked by March 2nd.
* You can vote early and in-person starting February 18th.
* You can vote in person on Super Tuesday, March 3rd.
* Go to [[URL REDACTED]] to find your polling locations and ballot drop boxes.
If you are not a registered Democrat you an still vote in the Democratic Presidential Primary:
* Your ballot will not be mailed to you automatically. Depending on your county you may receive a letter asking you which ballot you would like, Democratic or Republican.
* You can request a mailed ballot from your County Clerk until February 25th.
* You can vote early and in-person starting February 18th.
* You can vote in-person on Super Tuesday, March 3rd.
* Go to [[URL REDACTED]] to find your polling locations and ballot drop boxes.
Not registered to vote? You can register to vote online until February 25, and Utah has same-day voter registration at all polling locations. If you do vote in person, you must have ID.
While this all might be a little complicated, Super Tuesday is being administered by the office of the lieutenant governor, which means we should have preliminary results that evening.
Please feel free to reach out to us or to your County Clerk if you have any further questions.
Best,
Matthew Patterson
Executive Director, Utah Democratic Party
P.S. Don’t forget to check a buck on your tax return. You can opt to donate $2 to the Utah Democratic Party and your county party with no cost to you through the Utah Election Campaign Fund.

"Jeff Merchant, Chair UDP",mail@utdem.org,Utah Democratic Party Primary Convention Results,"Dear Alex,
On behalf of the Utah Democratic Party, I want to thank everyone who has been involved in making this State Convention one of the best we have ever had. It was, of course, nothing like we planned it to be, but with a lot of hard work from a lot of people, we have successfully held candidate forums, interviews, and caucus meetings. We have had the chance to hear from Colorado Senator Michael Bennet, from Democratic National Committee Chair Tom Perez, and our presumptive nominee for the United States Presidency, Vice President Joe Biden. And today, we voted.I can say without a doubt that this has been the fastest and most efficient election we have had in the Democratic Party. I can also say it has been the most well attended by delegates and had the highest participant rate for which we have records. In recent years, participation in our state primary convention, we have had anywhere from the low 50 percent to high 50 percent range of participation with approximately 2000 to 2200 delegates.
This year we had 2203 delegates. Of those 2203 delegates 1866 voted for a voting rate of 85%. This is perhaps the highest voting rate we have ever had—certainly the highest in the past 50 years. The Utah Democratic Party is convinced that this is both because of the methods we have chosen for balloting, but also because Democrats in Utah are hungry for change, and today they spoke. We are very pleased at this time to announce the winners of each of our races.
Offices with an * must receive 60 percent or more of the votes in order to avoid a primary.

Jeff Merchant,mail@utdem.org,The Results Are In,"Dear Alex,
Super Tuesday has come and gone, and it was an exciting day in Utah. Utah saw record-breaking voter turnout, which is good news for Democrats. You probably know the results, but just in case, with 73% of precincts reporting, here’s the breakdown:
* Bernie Sanders - 34.6%
* Mike Bloomberg - 16.9%
* Joe Biden - 17.1%
* Elizabeth Warren - 15.4%
* Tulsi Gabbard - .8%
And while Buttigieg & Klobuchar withdrew from the race before Super Tuesday, they pulled in 9.9% and 3.9% of the vote.
We also have the results of our straw poll, and among our participants, the breakdown looked a little different:
* Elizabeth Warren - 31.6%
* Bernie Sanders - 26.3%
* Mike Bloomberg - 18.4%
* Joe Biden - 13.2%
* Pete Buttigieg - 5.3%
* Amy Klobuchar - 2.6%
* Tulsi Gabbard - 2.6%
No matter where your candidate finished, we know that Utah Democrats are going to get behind the nominee and take back the White House while flipping seats statewide.
Thanks for participating and for helping us elect Democrats up and down the ticket here in Utah.

Jeff Merchant

Our apologies for the second email, our last had an unfortunate typo. Please disregard the previous.
We wrote you earlier this week, asking you to join us in taking action following Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's death. Today, the news was leaked that Donald Trumps nominee may be Amy Coney Barrett. Her presence on the court would directly threaten Roe V. Wade, the Affordable Care Act, and much more.
We were disappointed by Senator Romney's statement earlier this week, we hasn't indicated how he will vote. Can we count on you to join us in sending him a message that he needs to vote no?

If you're wondering what else you can do to make change and honor RBGs legacy - sign up to volunteer! Local elections matter and we have a number of incredible candidates running this year; in seats that were decided by as little as 118 votes. Help us send Democrats to Capitol Hill that will represent YOU and your ideals (and not work to over turn measures we voted on!)

Utah Democratic Party,irundquist@utdem.org,*TAKE ACTION* TELL ROMNEY TO VOTE NO,"Alex,
Like you, we were heartbroken when we heard the news of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's passing. She was an incredible woman and justice, who deserves the honor of our grief and the time to remember her. However, we were robbed of that. Knotted in my gut was a feeling of dread, akin to the one I felt on election night 2016.
The loss of RBG's seat is not only idealogical. It threatens ROE V WADE and the rights of millions of women to chose what happens to their body, it threatens the Affordable Care Act and access to healthcare, it threatens our ability to respond to climate change for decades to come.
Democrats in the Senate only need four Republicans to join them in voting no on any nominee Trump and McConnell put forth. As Utahns we have a Senator who has, at times, voted with his conscience and not on party line. Despite his statement earlier today we must have our voices heard.
Join me in asking Senator Romney to vote NO on any confirmation before inauguration.
Then, sign the petition.
With Gratitude,
The Utah Democratic Party

View this email in your browser
Message from the Chair
It's been much too long since the last newsletter, and there's a lot to talk about, so let's get right to it!
First of all, as those who participated in our successful first-ever online convention in April, Amber Christiansen Beltran has moved to Idaho, and I will be fulfilling the role of chair for the remainder of the term. Thanks to Amber for her service to the Utah Libertarian Party, and best wishes in bringing liberty to Idaho!
The UTLP nominated candidates for a number of state and legislative offices, as well:
* Governor & Lieutenant Governor: Dr. Daniel Cottam/Barry Short
* Attorney General: Rudy Bautista
* Treasurer: Joe Speciale
* Congress, District 2: J. Rob Latham
* Congress, District 4: John Molnar
* UT House 16: Brent Zimmerman
* UT House 46: Lee Anne Walker
Over Memorial Day weekend, the delegates of the national Libertarian Party met in online session to nominate our presidential ticket. In a spirited competition, the party nominated Dr. Jo Jorgensen for president, and Jeremy ""Spike"" Cohen for vice president. Longtime party members may remember Jo as our 1996 vice presidential candidate.
I want to give a special tip of my hat to Jeremy Baker, who has taken on the job of being state coordinator for the Jorgensen campaign. If you're interested in helping Jeremy help Jo, you can connect on the Utah for Jorgensen Facebook page, or through the national campaign. We here in the intermountain west ought to be one of the strongest areas for Jo, but it's not going to happen without a lot of people pitching in!
In July, in an eventually effective but complex ""hybrid"" convention, the national LP elected its officers. Utah is particularly happy to congratulate our new national chair, Joe Bishop-Henchman, and our former regional representative Richard Longstreth on his election to an at large seat on the LNC. We are looking forward to great things in the coming term!
And now, fellow Libertarians, it's time for us to get to work. These last two months are a sprint to the finish. Spike will be here next Tuesday, September 1, to help us kick this campaign into high gear, and several of our candidates will be speaking as well. Be there!
Oh yeah, one more thing about the rally. Wear a mask if you want to, don't wear a mask if you don't want to. You're an adult, you can and should make the decisions about what is right for you - and respect the decisions that others make for themselves. I believe that you're smart enough to do that. That's the Libertarian Way!
\-- Barry Short
These digital billboards are already appearing across Utah, with more to come both for Dr. Cottam and for other UTLP candidates! It costs just pennies each time one of these signs flashes on a billboard - but there are a lot of digital billboards and a lot of state to cover! Every $5 displays a billboard to approximately 1500 people - it is a great cost-effective way to reach out to all Utahns! If we could get enough donations to budget at least $25 per day - $50 would be better - 2020 will be a record year for Utah Libertarians.
Donate here to help us take the message of liberty to Utah!

Spike looks forward to the opportunity to meet with you and discuss your concerns about life in Salt Lake City going forward. If you want to hear a message about real change that is brought about by smaller government and more personal freedom, join us on Tuesday, September 1 and bring a friend!

Message from the Chair
First and foremost, I want to again thank all of you who elected me Chair of the Utah Libertarian Party at the 2019 Convention. I am also grateful to Barry, Taylor and Susan for stepping up and being part of the Executive Committee. You are constant professionals and your advice and encouragement means so much.
2019 has been a good year for the Utah Libertarian Party. Though numbers are not the whole picture it has been rewarding to see that our National Membership grew enough to allocate an additional delegate seat to the state of Utah. Thanks to all of you who renewed your national and state memberships or joined for the first time.
Thank you to the members who have volunteered at the various outreach events and booths. Thank you to those of you who attended your local town hall meetings and spoke out against the proposed food and service taxes Thanks to those who joined me at the Tax Hearing at the State Capital. Looking over 2019 there were many wonderful opportunities. One specific interaction that stands out was shared by Justin Bake. While volunteering at the Halloween in Summer event a gentleman completed a voter registration card and changed his party registration on the spot.
Congratulations to all the candidates who ran for municipal elections in 2019. Thank you for giving voters a choice. Congratulations to Tessa Stitzer on her Copperton Metro Council victory.
Looking forward to 2020, let’s make it a great year for liberty here in Utah. Please if you are interested in running for an office reach out. As part of the Libertarian Frontier, we have Cara Schultz and Apollo Pazell, from the National Libertarian Party, assisting with candidate recruitment and training. Utah will have greater resources available to help our candidates run effective campaigns.
I am looking forward to our party growing in numbers and influence. We are going to challenge the status quo.
Wishing you all a Happy Christmas-Hanukah-Kwanza-Festivus and a Happy New Year!!!

Governor Herbert Wastes Our Money Again
On Tuesday, December 10, Governor Herbert called the legislature into a special session that starts today (Thursday December 12) to address tax reform. You probably, like us, have strong reservations about the bill as proposed – it has both positive and negative aspects, with some taxes decreased and others increased – but perhaps the most pertinent issue at the moment is that this special session is completely unnecessary.
In the current proposal, none of the provisions of the tax reform would go into effect on January 1. That being the case, there is no good reason for the legislature to meet in this special session. Holding decisions off until the regular session that begins at the end of January would make no difference whatsoever in the amount of taxes collected, or the impact on Utahns. What it would mean is that members of the legislature wouldn't be getting a taxpayer-funded Christmas bonus check.
There is no need to rush to make decisions as quickly as possible. Utah has a surplus, the state is not in any kind of budget crisis. Regardless of its outcome, the UTLP condemns the unnecessary haste and wastefulness which this special session represents.

The Utah Libertarian Party has announced that its 2020 nominating convention will be held Friday and Saturday April 24-25 in Ogden, at the Comfort Suites Ogden Conference Center.
The main convention session is on Saturday, where we will be hearing from and nominating our candidates for offices including Governor, Attorney General, and seats in the state legislature. We will also be hearing from candidates seeking national office, including several candidates seeking the Libertarian nomination for president - those who have confirmed their intent to attend as of now are Keenan Dunham, Souraya Fass, 1996 VP nominee Jo Jorgensen, and Vermin Supreme! Candidates seeking positions on the Libertarian National committee are also expected to attend and speak.
There will be an opening reception on Friday evening from 7-10 PM, offering an excellent opportunity to talk to both other Utah Libertarians and the various candidates in a more informal setting. We have a great rate of $99 at the Comfort Suites - you'll get a reservation link when you register for the convention. Join us for the weekend!
If you are registered to vote in Utah as a Libertarian, you are qualified to be a delegate! Registration is open as of today! Click here to go to the registration page.
As of December 11, 2019, according to voter registration data provided by the Lieutenant Governor's office, the Utah Libertarian Party has 15,514 active registered voters. Keep it growing!
## Governor Lincoln Chafee to headline UTLP Fundraiser!
On Thursday night, January 20, former Rhode Island Governor Lincoln Chafee will appear at a fundraiser for the UTLP, at the home of Joe Buchman in Alpine. There will be a cocktail hour and dinner, followed by more time for open conversation.
Governor Chafee's move to join the LP earlier this year has been noted around the country. Having served as a big city mayor, a Governor and a Senator, his experience is vast. He has much to share with us - and, as a new life member of the the party, is looking to learn from Libertarians as well. You can expect some lively conversation!
This event will be very limited in size with a maximum of 30, so get in now and secure your place at the table! Order your seat here!
Looking Ahead to 2020
As 2019 winds up to an incredible finish we want to thank all of our candidates who have been elected to local offices all across Utah. We have heard reports of successes ranging from removing restrictions on front yard gardens to eliminating the fee to operate a business, as well as a handful of other things that have been done to help free Utah's people to achieve their personal goals.
We have also made a lot of progress with significant membership increases and people who have registered with the party. We encourage anyone who has not already joined the state party to do so on our website [[URL REDACTED]], and we also encourage you to take a little bit of time to research your local representatives and learn as much as you can about the the founding principles of libertarianism.
The sooner we engage in building the strength and potency of the state party, the more impact we can have supporting candidates in 2020. This is why we encourage you to stand up and not only join the party but become a donor. We especially encourage you to a monthly donor to help us build a budget for marketing and for investing in our candidates' campaigns, as well as showing everyone the available positions that they may be able to run for in 2020. It's going to be an enormous year for elections and we are not going to take this 2020 election season sitting down.
Thank you for all you do for Liberty and peace!

Message from the Chair
Thank you to everyone who has volunteered throughout this campaign. This is going to be remembered as a historic year in Utah, and it is thanks to those who have given an amazing and hugely appreciated effort
As noted below, the Utah Libertarian Party has gained over 1100 new voter registrations in the past month. This is extraordinary, and reinforces what we already know - America's dissatisfaction with the old establishment parties is growing, and tolerance for them is declining!
20,000 registered LP voters in Utah is in sight!
\-- Barry Short
## Utah's Seven Proposed Constitutional Amendments
Some have inquired about the Libertarian Party's position on the seven amendments to the Utah constitution that are on our ballot. And so, we are happy to provide this guide to them, and how we suggest you vote.
In evaluating these, we have looked for those areas where they implement Libertarian ideas. Some have the possibility, others are more administrative and neutral. So we ask: does it make us more free? Does it waste our money? Does it make government more or less blind in how it treats differences between individuals?
Clicking on the title will take you to Ballotpedia's test and analysis of the amendment.
Amendment A: Gender-Neutral Constitutional Language
We recommend a Yes vote. Language evolves, and the law likes precision. Removing presumptive gender from the language in the Utah constitution makes equality under the law more evident.
Amendment B: Legislator Qualification Amendment
Here's a note from our former chair, Andrew McCullough, about the kind of circumstances that led to this amendment:
""My secretary and friend, Chelsea Travis, is a ground-breaker. Several years ago, she filed to run for Utah legislature. At the time she did so, she was 24. She was going to be 25 after election day, but before the legislature was sworn in. the County Clerk said she could not file. I called the Attorney General's office and got a ruling that she was old enough to run. As far as I know, she was the first. Now the ballot contains Amendment B, which would require a person to be old enough to serve on election day, not the day she is sworn in. VOTE NO ON AMENDMENT B! Free Chelsea from Tyranny!""
Amendment C: Remove Slavery as Punishment for a Crime from Constitution
We recommend a Yes vote. It's a little mind-boggling that slavery as punishment for a crime ever existed in the state constitution, since Utah became a state 30 years after the end of the Civil War.!
Amendment D: Municipal Water Resources Amendment
We recommend a qualified Yes. The fact is that Utah's water rights situation is a total mess, made worse by the Colorado River Compact in 1923. This amendment does not make any progress toward addressing the underlying issues, but it does solve a small current problem as more and more hosing is built outside of city limits, with cities still being expected to provide services such as water.
Amendment E: Right to Hunt and Fish
There is a growing movement to add this type of language to state constitutions, as various organizations such as PETA have expressed their intent to end hunting and fishing. As these activities have long been associated with feeding oneself and one's family, we support the intent of this amendment.
That said, the language in this amendment seems quite broad, with no limitation on what or how much may be hunted beyond a nod to “rules and regulations adopted by statute”. (As I was asked, ""Have you seen ""Running Man"" or, more recently, ""The Hunger Games""?"")
Call this a coin flip because of that – there is little doubt that the legislature will have to further amend this if passed, and the Attorney General will be forced to spend our tax dollars prosecuting someone who takes their “rights” further than intended.
Amendment F: Legislative Session Start Date Amendment
Another coin flip. This amendment would allow the legislature to set its own start date, but does not extend the number of days in the session. No particular reservations, though it may end up with a move to alter filing deadlines and such, which traditionally have immediately followed the end of the legislative session.
Amendment G: Use Income and Property Tax Revenue to Support Children and Individuals with Disabilities
Here is the question: do you or do you not like that the ways in which specific taxes may be utilized is restricted by the Utah Constitution? At present, all revenue from income tax must be applied to public education. This amendment cuts a little chip out of that bulwark, adding that it can be used “to support children and to support individuals with a disability “. But what does that mean? After school programs? Skate parks? Any example of ADA compliance? This opens up the possibility of income tax increases for a wide variety of programs, as long as they can be justified under that new clause.
The long game on this move is that the legislature would like to get rid of earmarks on all tax revenue, allowing them to allocate it as they see fit. Some see this a good idea, others look at other states with fewer restrictions and doubt the legislature's ability to spend responsibly without strict guidelines. The bottom line is that once again, this a rearrangement of spending without addressing the Libertarian question of whether what we are spending money on is something we should be spending money on. Our Chair gives this a No, but recognizes it's strategically debatable.
These digital billboards are already appearing across Utah! It costs just pennies each time one of these signs flashes on a billboard - but there are a lot of digital billboards and a lot of Utah to cover! Every $5 displays a billboard to approximately 1500 people - it is a great cost-effective way to reach out to all Utahns! If we could get enough donations to budget at least $25 per day - $50 would be better - 2020 will be a record year for Utah Libertarians.

Message from the Chair
If you have not voted yet, today's a great day to fill out your ballot!
And if you have already voted, then today is a great day to make plans to join other Libertarians on Tuesday evening to celebrate getting through the strangest campaign season I've ever experienced. Details below!
\-- Barry Short
##
Join the Libertarian Party for an election night event! At last it's over (for now!) and we can relax for an evening and celebrate all the hard work that has been done. Let's salute our candidates (several of whom will be there)!
We will be at Athena Beans Coffee House & Bistro in Sandy, from 7 to 10 PM. We'll have a feed of election coverage so we can see what's going on across the nation. No, we may not know the result of every election by 10 PM - we may not know all of !them for a week or two!
This event is FREE. Donations to help offset the costs are of course welcome, and you'll find a donation link when you check out. But we are asking that you let us know you're coming so we can make sure to have the right amount of food on hand! Beverages and finger foods of various types will be provided - we're not doing a sit-down dinner because we want to facilitate conversations and mingling!
The venue can accommodate up to 100 people, so we do ask please that registration means you really do intend to be there.
Libertarian Covid policies will be observed: wear a mask if you wish, do not wear a mask if you wish, shake hands or don't shake hands, bump elbows or just waggle your eyebrows, whatever you are comfortable with. You're an adult, you can make decisions for yourself - and respect the decisions others make for themselves!
We look forward to you being part of what we expect to be a historic night for Libertarians. Register here!

COVID-19 Response Forces Changes to Events
Response to the COVID-19 outbreak at the local, state, federal and personal levels is leading to many changes in events throughout the country.
The Libertarian Frontier Summit, scheduled for April 4-5 in Cheyenne, Wyoming, has been rescheduled to the weekend of August 1-2. Registrations and reservations will be carried over. You can find more at [[URL REDACTED]]
The Utah Libertarian Party's Nominating Convention is still scheduled for April 24-5 in Ogden. While we hope to hold the convention as intended, it is looking more and more as if that will not be possible. We are making plans to conduct a virtual convention on Saturday April 25th should the public gathering become untenable, and will send the appropriate information for participation if that becomes the case.
Any money paid for meals or events related to the convention will be fully refundable if we are unable to hold those events. Hotel reservations made through our link may be cancelled without penalty up until 4 PM on the scheduled arrival day.
We wish everyone health, safety, and liberty as we navigate this unprecedented situation.

Message from the Chair
This is an exciting time, as we enter the final month before ballots arrive in voters' mailboxes!
HUGE congratulations to Rob Latham, who has become the first Libertarian candidate to reach the polling threshold to participate in Utah debates! According to data provided by the Utah Debate Commission, both Daniel Cottam and Rudy Bautista missed the required polling by only about 1%. While that's disappointing - and we still have issues with the procedures put in place by the debate commission - in prior years we haven't even been close, so it is, at worst, a sign that we are growing and being noticed.
As noted in our Libertarian voter count box below, we have gained almost 500 new registered Libertarian voters since this time last month. That is spectacular!
There are many opportunities to help promote our candidates, which you'll find in this newsletter. Please, if you can, help place a sign, distribute door hangers, share social media. Or make a cash contribution to help pay for our signs and advertising!
Will we win? Well, it's 2020, has there been anything about this year that's gone as expected?.

It costs just pennies each time one of these signs flashes on a billboard - but there are a lot of digital billboards and a lot of Utah to cover!

If we could get enough donations to budget at least $25 per day - $50 would be better - 2020 will be a record year for Utah Libertarians.

LP Vice Presidential Candidate Spike Cohen brought the real message of freedom to SLC on September 8! Dozens of Libertarians - and those ready to embrace a truly free society - met on the capitol lawn for a rousing evening, emceed by Craig Bowden and with messages from our 4th District Congressional candidate John Molnar and our candidate for Governor, Dr. Daniel Cottam!

Daniel Cottam for Governor Door Hangers and Yard
Signs Available
Can you help out by walking a block or two where you live? We have these door hangers that have been designed to introduce Dr. Cottam to voters, and all you have to do is hang it on the doorknob! Of course if you want to knock on doors and talk to your neighbors that's great too, but it isn't required with these!
Let us know how many you can commit to distribute! A pack of 25 will cover a block or two (depending on where you live, of course!) 50 will cover three or four blocks, and if you really want to get some exercise you can request 100 or 200! Whatever you can do is a big boost to the campaign, and to making Utah the kind of place we all want it to be!
Be the grass roots of the Cottam campaign!
Packs will be mailed direct to your address.

After watching so many come together for the Tax Referendum and in protest to the large property tax hikes in various counties around the state I know people are looking for something different. The Utah Legislature was reminded that people are paying attention.
Our January fundraising event was a success. Thanks so much to Joe and Cindy Buchman for hosting at their lovely home. Thank you to all who attended. It is always great to rub elbows with fellow Libertarians.
I’m also looking forward to the convention in Ogden, April 24-25. We have set a goal to reach more Liberty- leaning individuals by having the convention in various counties. Please if you are in Weber and Davis County and haven’t traveled to a convention before- join us! I know many of you will travel long distances and for that I’m truly grateful.
Let’s make 2020 the best year for the Utah Libertarian Party!!! Reach out if you have questions, want to volunteer, want to run for office, or donate. As we all work together we’ll be closer to being set free in our lifetimes.

UTLP Seeks Candidates and Volunteers
Are you ready to help spread liberty? The 2020 elections are going to be here soon. November 3, 2020 is 272 days away.
Filing for Utah races will be open Friday March 13- Thursday March 19, by 5:00 PM. For additional information on qualifications and filing fees for specific races see the state's 2020 Candidate Manual: here
We have a unique opportunity this cycle to build on the work of the Tax Referendum. People want more accountability, transparency in government. They are looking for an alternative to the status quo.
Utah has joined the Libertarian Frontier Project and so we have unique supports in place to help coordinate more effective campaigns.
If you want to run a thorough campaign, ‘In It to Win it”, please reach out to our chair Amber Beltran, via [[URL REDACTED]] We can start assisting you now with logo design, volunteer coordination, and fundraising. Please know we are here to assist but you must be willing to put in a lot of hard work. If you want to just put your name on the ballot as an alternative to the status quo, that's OK too, but please be sure to file on time and attend convention to be nominated.
If you are willing to volunteer to help candidates please let us know. There are many ways to help candidates: helping write press releases, assisting with social media, knocking doors, coordinating meet-and-greets, etc. You can fill out our volunteer form here: [[URL REDACTED]]
The Executive Committee is also seeking to fill a position for a Volunteer Coordinator for the 2020 campaign season. The Volunteer Coordinator will track and organize those who have offered their time, matching them with activities in their general areas. We have a number of people around the state who have offered to help with canvassing, distributing literature, and other campaign activities, and also with party promotions such as booths as events. We need someone who can track available volunteers and coordinate them with events in their areas. It will mostly involve some data organization and emailing/texting, with maybe some phone calls, and coordinating with the various candidates and campaigns If this is something you would be willing to do, please go here and send us a message.
Looking forward to 2020 Elections!
Delegate Applications for the Libertarian National Convention to Open February 8 at 10:00 AM
Because the 2020 Utah Libertarian Party Convention will take place less than 30 days before the national LP convention, we will be taking applications to be a delegate to the national convention in accordance with UTLP bylaws. In 2020, the UTLP has qualified to have nine delegates, and we prefer to have an additional two or three alternates to fill delegate seats if a vote is taken while a primary delegate is not on the convention floor.
The national convention will be held May 21-25 in Austin, TX, at the JW Marriott. To be considered as a delegate, you must be a member in good standing (i.e, with current paid dues) in either the Utah Libertarian Party or the national LP. The UTLP does not subsidize any travel or lodging expenses, although delegates often cooperate on rooms, transportation, etc.
Delegates to the national LP convention are unbound: unlike the Republican or Democratic conventions, delegates are not committed to vote for any specific candidate who may have won a primary. Delegates are expected to choose the candidates who, in their estimation, will have the greatest positive impact for the party both in the current election and going forward.
Delegates at the convention will select the LP 2020 Presidential and Vice Presidential candidates, as well as electing the party chair and other members of the Libertarian National Committee, for a two-year term.
If you want to be a delegate to the Libertarian National Convention, we will open applications on Saturday, February 8, at 10:00 AM. The active link will be at [[URL REDACTED]]
The official website for the national convention is here.
Eight LP Presidential Candidates to Attend UTLP Convention
As of this newsletter, eight of the candidates seeking the LP nomination for President have indicated their intent to attend the Utah Libertarian Party convention April 24-25 in Ogden. This will be the largest number of national candidates ever to appear at a UTLP convention.
Those who have committed are Keenan Dunham, Souraya Fass, Jo Jorgenson, Adam Kokesh, Steve Richey, Sam Robb, Vermin Supreme and Mark Whitney. (We expect another candidate or two to join us as well!)
Additionally, we have commitments from two candidates seeking to be chair of the Libertarian National Committee, Joe Bishop-Henchman and Joshua Smith, and also our current Regional Representative, Richard Longstreth, who is seeking the office of Vice Chair.
There will be an opening reception on Friday evening from 7-10 PM, offering an excellent opportunity to talk to both other Utah Libertarians and the various candidates in a more informal setting. A catered lunch is offered on Saturday for a donation of just $25 - the conversation is always a highlight for many! And we have a great rate of $99 at the Comfort Suites - you'll get a reservation link when you register for the convention. Join us for the weekend!
If you are registered to vote in Utah as a Libertarian, you are qualified to be a delegate! Registration is open as of today! Click here to go to the registration page today.
Links to all LP presidential candidates' websites can be found here.
As of February 3, 2020, according to voter registration data provided by the Lieutenant Governor's office, the Utah Libertarian Party has 15,887 active registered voters. Keep it growing!
Utah Libertarians Assist in Tax Referendum
Many members of the Utah Libertarian Party took part in January's tax referendum petitioning, an effort which paid off with the repeal of SB 2001, the tax reform package passed in December's special session. In a purely voluntary effort (making it truly libertarian at its core), over $20,000 was raised to print and distribute signature packets, and over 150,000 signatures were gathered in all 29 counties of Utah.
While the reform that was passed would have resulted in tax savings for some Utahans, many aspects of it were extremely troubling, including increases in taxes on food and gasoline which would most adversely affect lower income residents, and have inflationary effects on other prices. Equally troubling for many was the expansion of sales tax onto many services, an additional burden upon small business and entrepreneurship that stood to force tens of thousands of Utah business owners to become unpaid employees of the state (that is, tax collectors!) Plank 2.4 of the national LP platform includes this: ""We oppose any legal requirements forcing employers to serve as tax collectors.""
Among many who helped in various ways, several are especially notable. Andrew McCullough opened his law office as a location for those in the Midvale area to sign the petition. Craig Bowden served as the Cache County County coordinator for the efforts. Vice Chair Barry Short served as an assistant coordinator in Iron County (which gathered more than 200% of the necessary signatures to qualify the county), and also helped with gathering in Sevier and Piute counties, assuring that those rural counties met and exceeded their needed 8% of voters from the 2018 election.
Two takeaways:
1\. Voluntary cooperation - at the heart of Libertarianism - works and can do great things. That applies both to individuals and corporations like Harmon's Grocery Stores, whose participation in support of the referendum was crucial to its success.
2\. A huge percentage of Utahans are going to be looking for new names on their ballot this November. This year's elections offer a hunger for change that hasn't existed in Utah in decades. Let's not miss the opportunity.
2nd Libertarian Frontier Summit Scheduled
Join top tier candidates, activists, and experts for the second annual Libertarian Frontier Summit!
This summit is geared toward training candidates and campaign staff on best practices and tactics that will help elect Libertarians and advance libertarian ideas in practical ways. Join canvassing experts as they teach campaign volunteers and staff how to best reach their audience in the short time they have with them at their doors. Plus much more, including the fight for medical cannabis in Wyoming. Whether you are a candidate or looking to support our nominees, this will be a hugely valuable experience!

UTLP Fundraiser features Governor Lincoln Chafee
The Utah Libertarian Party kicked off efforts to place Libertarians in elected positions in Utah by welcoming special guest, former Rhode Island Governor and Senator Lincoln Chafee to a fundraising dinner on January 23. Governor Chafee announced his candidacy to become the 2020 Libertarian Presidential nominee just prior to attending the event, which was the first fundraiser of the year.
Chafee is a former Republican, and Democrat, and Independent who won election to be Governor as an Independent candidate. He joined the Libertarian Party when he moved to Wyoming in 2018. While registering to vote in his new home state, Chafee described comparing the the list of values of each party and realizing that Libertarian values more closely matched his own. “I was reading the list and it said end the wars – check! Limit the size and scope of government? Check! Follow the Constitution and defend the rights of the individual? Check! All of these things made me recognize that the Libertarian Party is where I belong.”
His story resonated with many in attendance, including Utah’s Libertarian Party Chair, Amber Christianson Beltran. “I always enjoy gathering with a group – or Constitution – of Libertarians. I’m grateful to Governor Chafee for sharing his story of finding the Libertarian Party. It encourages me to reach out more to those on both sides of the aisle.”
The event was held at the home of the former Utah Libertarian Chair, Dr. Joe Buchman. To learn more about Governor Chafee, visit [[URL REDACTED]]

In-person UTLP 2020 Convention Cancelled
Despite the date above, this sadly is not an April Fool's prank. The Utah Libertarian Party Executive Committee has made a decision to hold our 2020 nominating convention in an online format.
We very much regret not being able to hold a convention in person this year. However, the circumstances we face tell us this is the right thing to do for now. Our guests from around the country face travel restrictions that make their attendance very difficult if not impossible. Here at home, some of our members have medical conditions that compromise their resistance to disease, and we do not wish to endanger any of them. The continuing political uncertainty has wreaked havoc on planning, and while we still hold out a slim hope that by April 25th it will appear this was unnecessary, we feel it is better to have a clear plan going forward from today.
We will be announcing more specifics over the next week as a few details get ironed out, and we will be in touch with all members in good standing with the appropriate new registration links and contact information. It is our intent to move national candidate presentations off the program and onto the website, and have the only candidates making presentations during the convention being those seeking Utah offices. We will have the opportunity to nominate Utah candidates, and conduct other internal party business. We also still intend to conduct a presidential candidate and LNC Chair preference poll, for which details will be announced soon.
If you have purchased either lunch during the convention or a ticket to the Friday night reception, we will be offering a refund if you wish. Details will be emailed to those who made purchases.
Stay strong, stay safe, stay healthy. We are disappointed that we will not gather in person this year, but remain focused on nominating and promoting our candidates for office, and most importantly on promoting the ideals of liberty and the fundamental value of every unique individual, the real backbone of a vibrant, thriving nation.

UTLP Convention to be Held Online -
Here's How to Register
The UTLP 2020 Nominating Convention will be held Saturday, April 25. if you wish to participate, we are asking everyone to PLEASE register online by 5 PM on Friday, April 24. This will assure that we have adequate time to process and email the necessary links and unique voter IDs that will allow us to securely conduct business in this new and unprecedented, but necessary, manner.
As described in the UTLP Constitution, membership in the UTLP falls into two categories: dues-paying members and pledging members. If you have made a donation of at least $20 since May 1, 2019, you are a dues-paying member. If you have joined by signing the UTLP pledge but have not made a donation, then you are a pledging member. Both member categories are eligible to vote to ratify candidates, but only dues-paying members are qualified to vote on other party business, including changes to the party constitution and bylaws and the election of delegates to the national convention.
All dues-paying and pledging members have been sent a separate direct email with the necessary links to register. If you believe you qualify as either type of member and have not yet received your email, contact secretary Susan Baird who will consult with the treasurer or EC and check on your status.
If you are neither type of member but still wish to observe the convention, you can register as a guest here.
We thank everyone for their forbearance in our attempt to run a proper convention in very trying times. It's been quite a learning curve!
UTLP Candidates for Nomination for 2020
These are the candidates who will be seeking the nomination of the Utah Libertarian Party in 2020, to be voted on at the convention:
Governor: Dr. Daniel Rhead Cottam, MD
Lieutenant Governor: Barry Short
Attorney General: Rudy J. Bautista
Utah State Treasurer: Joseph Speciale
Congressional District 2: J. Robert Latham
Congressional District 4: John Molnar
Utah House 16: Brent Zimmerman
Utah House 46: Lee Anne Walker
# Presidential Preference Poll
In conjunction with the convention, we are running a poll of Utah Libertarians as to their preference for a presidential nominee. Because the Libertarian Party sends all delegates to our convention officially uncommitted (although some may choose to express a preference), this poll is nonbinding. But with the filed being so large and wide open, it is expected that delegates will find the information of great interest.
To register for the poll, go here.
Many of you have probably heard from many of the candidates, but to help with that we have set up a page with links to the websites and Facebook pages of ALL the declared candidates seeking the Libertarian Presidential nomination. You can find it here \- enjoy!
National Delegates
Because the national LP convention (as currently scheduled) falls less than thirty days after ours, the UTLP Bylaws called for our delegation to be filled by a signup process, on a first-come, first-serve basis, which was announced in the Liberator, on the website and on our Facebook page. As we have nine delegate seats this year, the first nine to sign up are the delegates, the remainder alternates. However, the state convention delegates must ratify and may amend the delegation list.
The current delegation list, in order of signup is:
Barry Short
Rob Latham
Craig Bowden
Caleb Bowden
Jaren Redding
Justin Bake
Amber Beltran
Willy Star Marshall
Adam Feller
Phillip Lammi *
Geoffrey Johnson *
* Alternate
Did you get your bonus COVID-19 tax refund yet? (It's not new money from government, it's just a refund of money taken from you a long time ago!)

But if you can spare some, do exactly what they wouldn't want you to do, and put it toward making Utah FREE in our lifetimes!

Message from the Chair
There are exciting things on the Liberty Horizon in 2020. I look forward to having Libertarians elected to bring new ideas and broaden the discussion away from “pet projects” to creating more liberty and less government overreach, including:
* As we discuss housing shortages, let’s also discuss how zoning ordinances limit social mobility.
* As we discuss where to build new prisons, let’s also talk about how and why we continue to incarcerate non-violent offenders.
* As we discuss the importance of ending gerrymandering, let's also discuss the improvement ranked choice voting would make in better representing all of the constituents in a district.
* As we discuss where to build new homeless shelters, let’s also discuss how the war on drugs has created so many felons - keeping them out of the workforce and limiting housing options.
If you have an interest in running for office I would encourage you to do so. It is an amazing opportunity to be involved in your community and help bring important issues to the forefront of discussion. If you would like to help other candidates please reach out to volunteer.
There is much work to be done and it is going to be a long journey but thank you for joining us on this journey.

Candidate Filing Dates Friday March 13 - Thursday March 19
New Regulation Adds Extra Step
Filing for 2020 Utah elections will be open Friday March 13 through Thursday March 19. We were notified this past week that a bill passed by the legislature in 2019 has made a surprising (and arguably pointless) change to the process of filing. Before a candidate can file a Declaration of Candidacy, they must first file a Conflict of Interest Disclosure at the Lieutenant Governor's Disclosure website.
Because this is new, we want to clarify the process. There are three steps to filing a disclosure:
1\. Create an account at the website, if you do not have one. If you already have an account, log in;
2\. Create an ""entitiy"" (i.e., declare what office you are planning to file for);
3\. Once the entity is approved by the LG's office, you may create your Conflict of Interest Disclosure.
ONLY after completing these steps can you go to your county clerk's office (or the LG's office, for certain positions) and file your Declaration of Candidacy. If your COID is not filed electronically first, your candidacy will be disqualified. You can do this process now, before the filing period starts \- which is important because there can be delays between any of the steps as you wait for approval. If you are considering more than one office, create all of them as entities and file a COID for each. You must have created an entity and have the COID on file for whatever office you decide to run for. Those you do not file for simply become moot, and will be deleted.
Why did we call this new regulation pointless? Two things. First, the Disclosure has no legal authority - no potential conflict of interest would disqualify anyone for any office. Second, while the information on the disclosure could be useful to voters, requiring that it be filed prior to filing candidacy makes no difference in that value. It could be filed any other time - 7 days before convention, 15 days before the primary, whatever - and be of equal value. The only apparent use for this timing is to create a new way to disqualify competition.
You can be assured we will work to have this ridiculous law changed. However, it is what is in place right now - and we don't want anyone to get disqualified!
For additional information on qualifications and filing fees for specific races see the state's 2020 Candidate Manual: here
We have a unique opportunity this cycle to build on the work of the Tax Referendum. People want more accountability, transparency in government. They are looking for an alternative to the status quo. The Libertarian Party is BEST qualified to provide that alternative!
If you have any questions please reach out to the Executive Committee and we will answer them. We are here to help you become a candidate!
NINE LP Presidential Candidates to Attend UTLP Convention
We're now less than two months away from the biggest Utah Libertarian event ever! As of this newsletter, ten of the candidates seeking the LP nomination for President have indicated their intent to attend the Utah Libertarian Party convention April 24-25 in Ogden.
Those who have committed are Lincoln Chafee, Keenan Dunham, Souraya Fass, Jacob Hornberger, Jo Jorgenson, Adam Kokesh, Sam Robb, Vermin Supreme and Mark Whitney. We expect another candidate or two may join us as well! We will be conducting a straw poll after the candidate presentations.
Additionally, we have commitments from two candidates seeking to become chair of the Libertarian National Committee, Joe Bishop-Henchman and Joshua Smith, and also our current Regional Representative, Richard Longstreth, who is seeking the office of Vice Chair. The Bylaws Committee of the LNC will also be meeting in Ogden concurrently with our convention, so you can expect to see other Libertarians from around the US!
There will be an opening reception on Friday evening from 7-10 PM, offering an excellent opportunity to talk to both other Utah Libertarians and the various candidates in a more informal setting. A catered lunch is offered on Saturday for a donation of just $25 - the conversation at lunch is always a highlight for many! We have a great rate of $99 at the Comfort Suites - you'll get a reservation link when you register for the convention. Join us for the weekend! Please register soon so that we can make proper preparations for the number attending.
If you are registered to vote in Utah as a Libertarian, you are qualified to be a delegate! Registration is open as of today! Click here to go to the registration page today.
Links to all LP presidential candidates' websites can be found here.

Note: we are monitoring the Covid-19 situation and will announce if there are any changes in response to future developments. However, there are statutory deadlines that the UTLP and the national party must meet, so our decision making is linked to actions by government at both levels. For now, we will proceed as normal, and hope for the best outcome.
As of March 2, 2020, according to voter registration data provided by the Lieutenant Governor's office, the Utah Libertarian Party has 16,222 active registered voters - an increase of 335 in the past month! Keep it growing!

Be Seen Being Green in 2020!
2020 has us reflecting on the celebrations and demands for our focus as Greens. This email offers highlights of various areas of focus for 2020 and opportunities to ""be seen being Green"". At the end is a graphic on how you can contribute through your tax form to the Green Party of Utah with no impact on your refund.
In Service To Life Campaign
The GPUT has a promising candidate for Salt Lake County Mayor in 2020, Michael Cundick, Michael is a community activist dedicated to life on the planet and demonstrates this through the many projects he has initiated and/or in which he is involved. Michael's ""In Service to Life"" campaign is focused on green infrastructure and food independence, environmental protection, and social justice and healing. Michael’s campaign will build momentum in the coming months and we need Utah Greens to get involved. This campaign not only has the potential of helping the Green Party of Utah maintain its ballot access, but also will help build Green Party locals and community resilience. Stay tuned for more information and announcements about this campaign.
Visit Michael's campaign site here.
Be Seen Being Green
Utah has a rich and cohesive activist community with members focusing to end injustices in our communities, organizing, holding events, attending government and board meetings to speak out, and risking their lives by engaging in non-violent direct action. Utah Greens will continue to be among them and “be seen being Green"".
Stop the Polluting Port
Utah is facing a continued denial of the impact of changes in climate by our officials through the development of an Inland port, which will damage the ecosystem, increase pollution, potentially increase presence of border patrol, and will create a threat to the women and children of our communities due to increased human trafficking. The Green Party of Utah supports the Stop the Polluting Port Campaign.
Other issues and campaigns where Utah Greens are involved:
Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women
Utahns Against Police Brutality
Poor People's Campaign
We hope that 2020 is the year that we can build our state party membership, develop more locals around the state, increase involvement in the critical issues in our communities and maintain our ballot access. We need you! Find out the many ways to get active at our website. The Green Party is the only party that is focused on the protection of all life. We are looking forward to working diligently with everyone in 2020 to continue building our party. Be Seen Being Green!
Please also take this opportunity to help the Green Party of Utah by donating through your 2019 tax form (see graphic below). Or visit our donation page for additional donation options.
The Green Party of Utah is committed to building a political structure upheld by our Four Pillars of Democracy, Ecology, Peace, and Social Justice.
Thank you for your involvement and support!

Green Party of Utah,greenpartyutah@gmail.com,Michael Cundick visits with Green VP Candidate Darlene Elias this Tuesday!,"This Tuesday night, June 30, 2020, at 5:30pm, Michael Cundick, the Green Party nominated candidate for Salt Lake County Mayor,will visit with potential Green Party Vice-Presidential Candidate Darlene Elias (Dario Hunter 2020 Campaign) to discuss Green Party values and her campaign.
[[URL REDACTED]]
Darlene Elias has a history of service to the Green Party as a former-Co-Chair for the National Party, Chair of the Massachusetts Green Rainbow Party, as well as Co-Chair and Delegate for the Latinx Caucus. In 2017, as a co-chair of the National Green Party, Darlene addressed a UN special committee on Puerto Rico stressing the need for Puerto Rico to be independent and free of US colonialism.
On a national level, Darlene wants to ensure the future of our party by focusing on increasing membership and strengthening party infrastructure. Many Americans have become more disenchanted than ever with our government. They know the system is rigged, influenced by corporate dollars, and it does not have its priorities straight.
Darlene believes that the Green Party must be the voice of the 99%, and work to ensure the fair and equitable treatment of the disenfranchised and marginalized by creating a fair and more just democracy. If we are to address the major crisis of our times, such as climate change, terrorism, xenophobia, racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, and social and economic inequalities to name a few, we must run candidates and seek to change the electoral system.
Darlene believes the youth of America are the future of our party and will change the landscape of our country. It is our responsibility to usher them into the Green Party with open and welcoming arms, providing refuge, encouragement, and guidance.
Please check out the Facebook event page and RSVP for the event. Also be sure to invite anyone else you think might be interested and share on your page!
