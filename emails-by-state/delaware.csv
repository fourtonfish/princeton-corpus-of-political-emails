Hi There --
When Joe Biden launched his campaign a year ago this Saturday, he said that this campaign was about more than just politics - it's about restoring the soul of this country. That is true now more than ever before.
Tomorrow, Team Joe will come together for its Service Outreach Unity Leadership (S.O.U.L.) of the Nation Saturday to thank our communities' heroes and connect with friends and neighbors. I'm participating, and I would love it if you come too.
Fill out this form to share how you'll take action to support your community - then the campaign will provide resources to help you take action.
In the midst of our current crisis, the grit and spirit of the American people are shining through.
From posting a sign thanking frontline workers in you window, to calling or texting friends and family to check in on them, or attending virtual a community meeting to discuss how you can support the good work happening in your community, there are so many oppourtunities to participate in the day.
Click here to say we can count on you to take action and what you'll be doing this SOUL of the Nation Saturday!
Thanks so much!

"Delaware Democratic Party
Dear Democrat,
As we head into the most important election year of our lifetimes, the difference between our Party and the Republicans here in Delaware couldn't be more clear.
While our Democratic leaders continue to fight to expand access to affordable healthcare, reform our broken criminal justice system, and demand clean air and water for future generations, the Republican Party of Delaware is following President Trump into the gutter.
Last week, two of the Delaware GOP's county chairs made national headlines for anti-Semitic and homophobic statements. A week later, and neither appears to have heeded calls for their resignation. Sadly, this kind of vile rhetoric devoid of consequences seems par for the course for Donald Trump's Republican Party.
The good news is that the Delaware Democratic Party has been hard at work, building the infrastructure we need to win up and down the ballot. In the last month alone, we've held a series of trainings for prospective candidates and campaign staff, and we've onboarded hundreds of new volunteers through outreach efforts like our debate watch parties.
The handful of Republicans who have condemned these incendiary remarks should not be held up as profiles in courage when they've failed to find their voice so many times before.
And now we need your help to defeat them. Donate today!
The truth is, we've heard nothing but complicit silence for three years while President Trump has spewed similarly vile and divisive rhetoric.
While white nationalists like Steve Bannon and Stephen Miller have been pushing their extreme agendas inside President's inner circle, we haven't heard a peep of concern.
And when their own Republican colleague in the General Assembly went on an Islamophobic tirade from the floor of the Senate, they couldn't muster a word.
As I told reporters last week, perhaps it's taken the arrival of an election year for the most vulnerable members of the Delaware GOP to get up the courage to break their silence. But for the Delawareans who are tired of hearing they are lesser because of the color of their skin, their sexual orientation, or how they pray, that is far too late.
We need your help to ramp up for the election of our lifetime, not only to defeat Donald Trump, but to defeat his Republican Party at every level. Please contribute $100, $50, $25 or whatever you are able so we can build the infrastructure we need to win in November and restore sanity and civility to our halls of government.
With gratitude,
ERIK RASER-SCHRAMM

Dear Democrat,
It has been an amazing, inspiring week to be a Delaware Democrat.
On Thursday night, Vice President Joe Biden accepted our party's nomination for President, right here in Wilmington. He stood just miles away from the house where he grew up in Claymont, from the Amtrack station where he started and ended so many of his days as Delaware's Senator, from the Brandywine High School classroom where Dr. Jill Biden taught English.
He was also just a few steps away from the Delaware Democratic Party's campaign office.
As a team we work hard every day to help Delaware Democrats get elected, up and down the ballot. When you get a call asking you to support Joe Biden and the Democratic ticket, it's us at the other end of the line; when you get a piece of mail explaining the local Democratic races in your area, we probably sent it to you!
We're doing everthing that we can to help VP Biden and the rest of the Delaware Democrats. Can you send in a few dollars to help us today?
This year, we have a chance not just to elect Delaware's favorite son to the White House, but also to elect amazing Delaware Democrats all accross the state. It's going to take all of us working together if we're going to get it done-- but we're more than ready to do it.
Join us today by chipping in whatever you can, here >>.
And if you want to show your Biden pride you can support our work by purchasing some of our unique Biden County signs, totes, and t-shirts at our online store.
No matter how you choose to support the Delaware Democratic Party, know that your contribution will make a difference this fall.
Thanks for your support,
Erik Raser-Schramm
