# Route to Liberty 2020!
### COME JOIN US FOR THE BIGGEST EVENT OF THE YEAR. IF YOU HAVE EVER BEEN TO A CONVENTION IN THE PAST, THIS YEAR WILL BE LIKE NOTHING YOU HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED.
This year promises to be the best convention ever held in Oklahoma. You will get to hear from great Libertarians from all across the state. Meet the candidates vying for our party's nomination for President of the United States. There will be a debate, not only between the candidates for President, but by those seeking to be the Chair of the Libertarian National Committee. Plus, you get to decide on the future of the OKLP!
REGISTER NOW!
This year we will be selecting 14 delegates and 14 alternates to the National Convention in Austin, TX. These delegates will help decide the future of the LP as well as our nominee for President and VP.
There is quite a bit of other business to discuss such as selecting a new Treasurer, electing members to the Judicial Committee, selecting Presidential Electors, seating members to the Rules Committee, amending our platform and bylaws, and setting forth our vision for success into the coming years.
To be a delegate to the State Convention you must be a member. Your dues must be current at least 10 days before the start of convention. You must also be registered Libertarian and a resident of the State of Oklahoma.
Become a Member or Renew Today!
In the coming days we will be sending out all the information you need to apply for the many positions within the OKLP that need filled including National Delegates, Judicial Committee, Treasurer, and more.
If you are interested, email Cherise at [[URL REDACTED]]
### BE SURE YOU DON'T MISS OUT ON THE MOST EXCITING EVENT OF THE YEAR. IF YOU CAN'T MAKE IT WOULD YOU CONSIDER DONATING TO HELP US MAKE THIS EVENT A SUCCESS?

Message from the Chair
Hello, Alex
As you may have already heard, we have postponed our 2020 State Convention due to the COVID-19 pandemic. I want to assure you that this was not an easy decision. The ExCom and I have a responsibility to you, the members, and to the Party as a whole. With that in mind, we knew that it would be irresponsible for us to put other members at risk of contracting the disease. Many have said that the libertarian solution is to self-quarantine, however, this simply would not work as someone could have the disease and not have symptoms for up to three days. The argument at this time is moot, as of this writing, as the City of Tulsa has closed all entertainment venues until further notice.
We truly apologize for any inconvenience this has caused anyone who had made plans to attend. We are offering anyone who has purchased a ticket the opportunity to get a full refund, if they so desire.
We have every intention to see that business goes on as usual. However, due to time constraints involving the National Convention and the uncertainty of the situation, we are left with the decision to invoke Article VII Section 5. This article gives the ExCom the authority to choose the delegates to the National Convention. This ExCom does not want to make this decision alone, and therefore we are asking all members to join us in an open meeting to help select our delegates. On April 18, 2020, we will be hosting an online Zoom meeting where every member is invited to join and have the opportunity to vote on national delegates. We will send out the details, including the link to the meeting in the coming weeks to keep everyone informed. We will also send out links and how-tos on the Zoom platform. We want to make this as easy as possible for everyone, therefore we have chosen Zoom as it allows anyone with an internet connection to join in using almost any device. It is compatible with iOS, Android, Windows, and Linux, so whatever device you have, you can join in.
The ExCom has scheduled a meeting on Sunday, March 22, 2020, to finalize the details on the logistics of conducting our meeting for the 18th. There will also be a credentialing period prior to the meeting on the 18th, so if your membership is set to exprire soon, we urge you to renew now. Also the State Election Board freezes all voters from changing their affiliations starting April 1. Therefore, if you are not a registered Libertarian please make the switch now before its too late. If you are unsure as to your status please reach out to me or Cherise and we can let you know.
Again we truly apologize for any inconvenience this has caused and hope that this situation resolves itself quickly so we may have our convention and carry out the business of the Oklahoma Libertarian Party.
In Liberty,
Chad Williams

Message from the Chair
Hello, Alex
Being a new year and a new decade, I want to start in a new direction. I want to get new people more involved in the party. We also need to be open to others viewpoints and not let personal squabbles get in the way of the big picture. Our regional structure was set up to allow a more local way of attracting new people to the party, however, I haven't seen much if any activity from any of the regions. Central has only had 3 meetings in the last year. North Central, while more active than most, has only had a few impromptu meetings online and hasn't really incorporated a way to include new people. Northeast has basically been non-existent except for Tulsa County, though there hasn't been any activity there in nearly 2 years. Oklahoma County hasn't had a meeting or anything since their formation. I'll take full blame for that one, as I was the one who started it, but I didn't properly see to any kind of transition since becoming Chair of the Party. Southeast is having their first convention this coming weekend. I'm excited about this as this region has been one on my radar as a must need. The remaining 3 regions have nothing, and that is disheartening especially since one of those regions already has an affiliated county.
I don't mean to bag on the regions. I get it. There are so few of us, with so little money, and so much ground to cover that it seems extremely overwhelming. I get emails almost daily with people who want to volunteer but don't know where to go or what to do. I want to help steer these people in the right direction.
We need to start thinking outside of the box. Stop trying to focus on proper structure, and look towards ways of getting people involved. What I'm asking should not be construed as meaning more activism and less party politics. What I'm asking is for less formality and more action on political matters. More candidate recruitment, more campaign training, and more volunteer opportunities are necessary to take the next step towards our party's goal. I want to see people who are really interested in policy matters to follow legislation. I want numbers people to start looking for winnable races. I want people who have never been involved in a campaign to volunteer to be a campaign manager or a treasurer. It's ok if you have zero experience, there are several of us with experience and/or the knowledge to help you succeed. I would like to see many of you who have been involved in the past to come back and share your experiences. Let's reignite the passion for liberty that you once had, and let it be the spark to a whole new generation of liberty loving Okies.
If you don't know where to start but are interested in being involved reach out to your regional chair or any of the Executive Committee members. Let's brainstorm together. When you or someone else asks what is the OKLP doing or what is coming up, instead of replying with ""I don't know,"" reply back with ""Let's start something together.""
In Liberty,
Chad Williams

Our past Chair and current Chair of the North Central Region has challenged all of the regions to create a basket that will be auctioned off at our upcoming State Convention in March. The region with the most successful basket will win the first annual OKLP Best Region Award. This is a great way to encourage our regions to build something new and forge new bonds. So let's see what you can make together!
