Friend, today we saw just how far Democrats are willing to go.

LOOMING VOTE
Friend,
It's official.
After weeks of delay by Nancy Pelosi, Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan will take part in an Impeachment trial of President Trump.
While the process in the Senate begins today with the introduction of the sham articles of Impeachment passed by the House, we know that Hassan and Shaheen will follow and Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi's footsteps.
Congress has a sacred duty to uphold the Constitution of the United States - and the power of impeachment should only be used in the most dire circumstances. New Hampshire elected Maggie Hassan and Jeanne Shaheen to represent the people of the Granite State; not those of California and New York.
New Hampshire’s Senators are going to fail us through their complete lack of leadership. Join with the New Hampshire Republican Party by donating $10, $20.20, $25, $50, $100, or another contribution today. Any donation will go directly to making sure that we defeat Jeanne Shaheen later this year and Maggie Hassan in 2022.
It is critical that every Republican can step up in any way they can. New Hampshire deserves better. Join us today in building a strong NHGOP.
Rep. Joe Alexander
NHGOP Finance Director
Defeat these disastrous Democrats!

"Dear Friend,
I wish I could say I am surprised, but the NH House just passed another gun control bill. This is hardly the New Hampshire Way.
Unfortunately the gun control movement is not confined to New Hampshire. Advocates of ‘extreme risk protection orders’ argue that 17 other states have already implemented a policy “to temporarily limit a person’s access to firearms.” They cite places like DC as models for New Hampshire gun control policy.
Make no mistake, this is a national movement - and it must stop in NH. Support NHGOP today by donating $20.20, $25, $50, 100, or another amount as we combat these national gun grabbing groups run by billionaires Michael Bloomberg and Tom Steyer.
The NHGOP is committed to countering the national money flowing into our State. Support that effort today.
There is too much to lose as these national groups descend on NH.
Stand with us today.
Rep Joe Alexander
NHGOP Finance Director
P.S. Did you see what Democrat Rep. Deb Stevens had to say about gun owners? Help us defeat these Democrats with an investment today.

Friend,
Dan Feltes is already Flip-Flopping post-Primary. In this upcoming Sunday's Close-Up, Dan Feltes walks back his Primary debate declaration that he'd commute Cop-Killer Michael Addison's sentence.
Dan Feltes will say anything to get elected which is why Dan fights for Himself, not for New Hampshire.
Granite Staters just can't trust Dan Feltes as Governor.

Friend,
Wanted to flag this release from the Republican Governors Association for you:
Former NH Senator And Prosecutor In Cop Killer Case: Feltes-Volinsky Pledge To Commute Sentence “Extremely Disturbing”
Former New Hampshire U.S. Senator Kelly Ayotte eviscerated Democratic gubernatorial candidates Dan Feltes and Andru Volinsky for pledging to commute the sentence of convicted police killer Michael Addison in a primary debate aired this week.
As New Hampshire’s Attorney General at the time, Ayotte personally prosecuted the 2006 case against Addison, who was convicted of shooting 35-year-old Manchester Police officer Michael Briggs in cold blood when Briggs had not drawn a weapon. Addison’s conviction was unanimously upheld by the New Hampshire Supreme Court in 2015.
In a blistering statement issued Wednesday, Ayotte excoriated Feltes and Volinsky for refusing to stand “against violence directed at our police officers,” and failing to “appreciate the difficulty and danger our police officers face” while praising Governor Chris Sununu for “standing with law enforcement”:
> “Today I watched the tape of the Democrats Gubernatorial Debate between Dan Feltes and Andru Volinsky,” she said in a statement. “It is extremely disturbing that both said they would commute the sentence of convicted cop killer Michael Addison who murdered heroic Manchester Police officer Michael Briggs in cold blood.
>
> “Addison is a career criminal who had committed multiple armed robberies the week before he shot Officer Briggs in the head. Addison was convicted by a jury of his peers and his conviction was upheld by the New Hampshire Supreme Court. At a time when law enforcement officers are facing increasingly dangerous situations on a daily basis, our leaders should be standing against violence directed at our police officers, not commuting the sentences of convicted cop killers.
>
> “It is clear that neither Andru Volinksy nor Dan Feltes appreciate the difficulty and danger our police officers face when they put their lives on the line every day to keep us safe. I commend Governor Sununu for standing with law enforcement in N.H. and stating clearly that he would never commute Michael Addison’s sentence,” Ayotte said.
Governor Sununu responded to the Democrats’ disturbing pledge on Tuesday, stating he was “shocked,” and would “never support commuting” Addison’s sentence:
> “Let me be very clear: I will never support commuting the sentence of a convicted cop killer like Michael Addison. I heard that clip [from the debate]. I was quite shocked by it. I think everybody in Manchester should be quite shocked by it.
>
> “Frankly, I think it sends the absolutely wrong message that when you have a convicted cop killer, you’re going to now decide that you would commute his sentence. I would never support that,” Sununu said.
Officer Briggs left a wife and two young sons behind when he was shot and killed by Addison. One of his sons, Officer Mitchell Briggs, graduated from the New Hampshire Police Academy in 2019.

Legislative Beer Caucus: A tale of two New Hampshires
KEY EXCERPT: ""Good leaders keep people informed, calm, and feeling positive about the future and Governor Sununu has done that while giving credit to others and making us proud to be Granite Staters.""
By Representatives Tim Lang, Mike Moffett, Reed Panasiti and Howard Pearl
“IT WAS the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness.” — A Tale of Two Cities
Charles Dickens’ words may aptly be applied to 2020 New Hampshire vs. 2010 New Hampshire — and an age of wisdom vs. an age of foolishness regarding state fiscal policy.
Leadership matters and we’re fortunate that in the last four years Governor Chris Sununu enhanced our financial stability by using one-time monies for one-time projects and restocking our “Rainy Day Fund,” increasing it to a record $115 million.

Friend\- We have an important deadline tonight that we can't miss.

The State Party needs the resources to run a successful digital and mail operation to support all of our candidates this November, and tonight's deadline is a major test. In order to show that New Hampshire Republicans are serious about winning in November, we need to hit our goal tonight before the deadline.
Please invest in the NHGOP before midnight! Your support will help Republicans up and down the ballot.

Breaking News \- Joe Biden just officially accepted the Democrat Nomination for President.
With just 75 days until the 2020 election, Democrats are going to pull out all the stops and tricks they need in order to win. We need to fight back.
If we don't raise $3500 in the next 24 hours in response to Joe Biden's nomination, we're at risk of falling behind this election cycle.
Democrats in D.C., New York, and California are looking to flood New Hampshire airwaves and mailboxes in order to squeak a victory for Joe Biden and the Democrats, and we need the resources to compete. Your immediate donation tonight will help us meet the challenge head on and defeat the Democrats this November.

Friend,
Today New Hampshire's filing period officially opens - which means we're officially on the path to Take Back New Hampshire this November.
We're fielding candidates across the State to take back the New Hampshire House, Senate, and Executive Council. They're going to start filing today so their names show up on the November ballot, and they need a strong NHGOP supporting their campaigns. Can you invest in that strong NHGOP today?
Governor Chris Sununu has had to veto 57 terrible Democrat bills in the last two years and has had his nominations obstructed by the Democrat Executive Council. We need to send Governor Sununu reinforcements so Republicans in Concord can pass impactful legislation and confirm qualified nominees.
We're planning our most impactful campaign cycle to date, but we need your support today to meet our goals and get good Republicans up and down the ballot elected.
Thank you for your support. Please consider investing in the NHGOP to Take Back NH today.

Friend,
I couldn't believe it when I first heard it. Last week, Democrat Deb Pignatelli altered our Nation's Pledge of Allegiance during an Executive Council meeting, stating ""Liberty and Justice for SOME.""
Patriotic Granite Staters have given their all to preserve Liberty and Justice for ALL Americans, and over 100,000 of our Nation's Veterans currently live in New Hampshire. Pignatelli's disgraceful remark is an insult to all of them.
The good news, out of this entire episode, is that Deb Pignatelli is up for election in less than 6 months. That gives us 6 months to continue organizing, raising money, and executing the right strategy to defeat her on November 3rd.
HOLD HER ACCOUNTABLE
In order to defeat her this November we will need the resources to win. Invest in the NHGOP today with your most generous donation to help us hold Deb Pignatelli accountable and defeat her this Fall.
The Democrat Majority on the Executive Council have been dedicated puppets to their Left-wing special interests. Those same special interests will support Pignatelli with massive contributions to keep her in that seat - we need everything on the table to take it back.
Councilor Pignatelli disgraced our Nation's Pledge of Allegiance and disrespected all who have sworn to protect Liberty and Justice for All. Help the NHGOP hold her accountable today.
Sincerely,
Stephen Stepanek
NHGOP Chairman
P.S. We know the media will quickly move on from this story to help Councilor Pignatelli avoid accountability. Help us continue reaching voters across her district and across New Hampshire to hold all New Hampshire Democrats accountable for her disgraceful comments.

Friends, here's a quick update on where things stand in the New Hampshire Senate race.
What we’re up against in this race: Jeanne Shaheen has raised over $11,00,000 during this term and has over $7,000,000 cash on hand. We need the financial resources to compete and win this election the New Hampshire way.
What we need to fight back: With Senate control on the line this year, we need to raise $5,000 before midnight tonight to flip this seat and defeat Jeanne Shaheen.
How you can help today: Chip in $5. It may not sound like much, but your $5 plus someone else’s $5 help us fight back against the Democrat big money machine. Chuck Schumer and national Democrats are going to finance Jeanne Shaheen's campaign, and we need to be able to fight back with grassroots contributions like you.
Rush $5 or more right now to help flip New Hampshire's Senate seat and preserve the Republican Senate Majority!

So far hundreds of NH Republicans have renewed their membership. Will you consider being on our 2020 Sustaining Membership List? The Chairman told me we need to get 15 more Republicans signed up as sustaining members by tonight to reach our fundraising goal.
Will you reactivate your 2020 sustaining membership and download your membership card?

Friend,
Earlier this year, I reached out to you with your downloadable New Hampshire Republican Party 2020 sustaining membership Card. In reviewing our records last night I noticed that we had not received your 2020 Sustaining Membership contribution.
With our successful First-In-the-Nation Presidential primary concluded, and with President Trump receiving the most votes of any incumbent, our race is shifting towards supporting our slate of Republican candidates. It's critical we have 17 more Republicans renew their membership tonight to reach our aggressive fundraising goal.
Our NH Senate race could very well determine who controls the US Senate in 2021 and beyond. President Trump has already confirmed a record number of judges. We need a US Senator that will confirm the President’s nominees who will interpret the Constitution as written.
Will you make your 2020 sustaining membership contribution today with your downloadable membership card? Your membership is as important now as ever.

Whether it’s cutting a record amount of red tape, passing historic criminal justice reform, implementing our new USMCA trade agreement or tax cuts for the middle-class Donald Trump has shown time-and-time again that he is working for YOU.

Please consider donating any amount you can to help us get closer to goal.
Our deadline is Midnight tonight, so please contribute today.

"Friend,
When we built our plans to take back the New Hampshire State House in 2020, we knew it would be an extremely close and competitive election.
Now, with less than 2 weeks to go until the election the polls are showing that we were right - we're currently projected to have a slight majority in the New Hampshire House while our Senate and Executive Council are currently tied according to UNH's latest polling.
The momentum is on our side but we need to finish the job and win big on November 3rd so that Governor Chris Sununu can have majorities in the House, Senate, and Executive Council that will work with him to protect the NH Advantage.
The New Hampshire Republican Party is doing more to elect our candidates this year than has ever been done before. Contribute today and you'll help New Hampshire Republicans secure their victories on November 3rd.
Best,
Elliot
Friend,
We are so close to taking back our Granite State on November 3rd and the polls are showing that momentum is on our side.
Since September, UNH polls have shown clear movement in our direction towards our efforts to FLIP the New Hampshire House while our Senate and Executive Council races are TIED.
We are in the homestretch. Your donation today will empower us to increase our GOTV and persuasion efforts between now and election day and enable us to take back the New Hampshire House, Senate, and Executive Council.
Donate today and help New Hampshire Republicans finish the job of taking back New Hampshire.

"Hello ,
I wanted to send you an update as to what the New Hampshire Republican Party is doing and how we are continuing our efforts to organize, recruit, and train Republicans across the State of New Hampshire to ensure a victorious November election is on the horizon.
Since I last wrote to you, the NHGOP & Trump Victory staff have still been hard at work fielding questions from activists, orchestrating our online NHGOP Convention, and holding virtual trainings. In the last month our team has contacted 75,000 voters by phone, held 60+ virtual events, and have trained over 350 volunteers.
To date, the NHGOP working alongside the Committee to Elect House Republicans (CTEHR) has recruited over 325 candidates to the New Hampshire House, and we're closing in on recruiting over 50 more before filing in June. The NHGOP, Trump Victory, and CTEHR have trained over 100 of those candidates for State House in the last few weeks, preparing our candidates for the fall elections with the latest tools and campaign strategy.
In short, the New Hampshire Republican Party is active and prepared during COVID-19 and we will continue continue to hold the Democrats accountable.
With this update today, I want to stress that we need your support in order to have the resources needed for victory. Our competition isn't slowing down and we aren't either which is why we need your help to have the resources to properly fight back.
Donate $10 to help us reach out to 500 voters digitally
Donate $20 to help us call 1000 voters
Donate $30 to do both!
The NHGOP is ready and prepared to elect Republicans across the State of New Hampshire during these times. I hope you can support us in that effort.
Regards,
Stephen Stepanek

Please consider donating today to help us flip the House, Senate and Executive Council on Tuesday: [[URL REDACTED]]
Best,

Friend, we are almost there.
Polls released by the University of New Hampshire yesterday are now showing that we are on the verge of FLIPPING the New Hampshire House, Senate, and Executive Council.
As the polls show our hard work paying off, we can't give up now. We need to continue to mobilize our voters and get out the vote over these next 4 days in order to ensure we have something to celebrate on Tuesday night. Your donation today will empower us to increase our GOTV and persuasion efforts between now and election day and enable us to take back the New Hampshire House, Senate, and Executive Council.
We have all put a lot into this effort since the Democrats took over the General Court and Executive Council in 2018. Republicans have testified at countless committee meetings, rallied around Governor Chris Sununu's vetoes, organized new town committees, recruited a new and bold field of candidates, and have made record setting voter contacts. Campaigns across the state, up and down the ballot, have knocked on doors and made phone calls. The NHGOP has invested more this year than ever before in targeted digital and mail programs in strategic ways to get out the vote and support Republicans up and down the ballot. It's been a long two years, but victory is now clearly in our sights.
Now is not the time to rest on our laurels. These polls might make us feel good today but nothing will feel better than securing our victory next week. There is so much at stake on Tuesday and we need to make sure we can get our candidates across the finish line. Our candidates and committees are doing everything they can to win up and down the ballot on election day, but your donation today will help the NHGOP increase our efforts over these truly critical next few days.
Donate today and help New Hampshire Republicans finish the job of taking back New Hampshire.
\- Team NHGOP
P.S. We are so close to electing Republican Majorities to the New Hampshire House, Senate, and Executive Council, completely flipping the New Hampshire State House in the Republican column and giving Governor Chris Sununu a team he can work with in Concord. Donate securely today to ensure the NHGOP has every available resource to secure victory on Tuesday.

With the end of 2019 quickly approaching, we need everything on the table as we enter 2020.
We need the resources to get out the vote and elect Republicans up and down the ballot in November.
New Hampshire Republicans need you to invest in the NHGOP before midnight in order to be in the best position possible.
In 2020 we can take back the New Hampshire House, Senate, and Executive Council, defeat Chris Pappas, Ann Kuster, Jeanne Shaheen, re-elect Governor Sununu, and send 4 electoral votes to re-elect President Trump.
But we can only do all of that with your support.
Invest in the New Hampshire Republican Party today to ensure our 2020 victories.

Friend,
We have a critical open positions up for nomination right here in New Hampshire, and we need to flip the Executive Council this November 3rd to ensure Governor Sununu and Republican Councilors can fill them with qualified nominees.
Unfortunately, the Democrat majority on the Executive Council have completely obstructed Governor Chris Sununu and have halted attempts to fill vacancies. This level of Democrat obstruction is unprecedented - but we have a great team of Executive Council candidates who are running to FLIP the Executive Council on November 3rd.

District 3 \- Janet Stevens

Friend,
Bernie Sanders dropped out last week but New Hampshire's Andru Volinsky vowed to continue pushing his agenda at the State level.
New Hampshire wouldn't have been able to afford Bernie Sander's agenda and we can't afford Andru Volinsky's agenda.
Some of those agenda items that Volinsky will push in office?
\- A State Income Tax taking money out of your paycheck
\- A State Sales Tax
\- Increased taxes on employers
\- More burdensome regulations
We are dedicated to stopping these Democrat attacks on the New Hampshire Advantage, but we need your support to do so.
Please invest in the NHGOP today so we can defeat this Democrat agenda in November.

Unfortunately, our Federal Delegation is in lockstep with California politicians like Nancy Pelosi and Diane Feinstein. They're not advocating for New Hampshire, they're advocating for more campaign cash and D.C. support.
HELP US DEFEAT CHRIS PAPPAS
HELP US DEFEAT ANN KUSTER

Friend,
Just hours after Ruth Bader Ginsburg passed away, Chris Pappas decided to send out a campaign email.
The email sender? Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
This is despicable, and Chris Pappas should be ashamed of himself.
Want to help defeat Chris Pappas this November 3rd? Donate today and you donation will be split between the New Hampshire Republican Party and Matt Mowers campaign to defeat Chris Pappas.
Democrats are scrambling to keep Chris Pappas in office, and he's filled his campaign coffers with special interest PAC money and lobbyist support. We need all the resources to fight back.
We've just launched this page to increase the impact of your donation, and we need you to be one of our first donors to this new effort.
We have 43 days until November 3rd and we need all the resources on the table to win. Donate today and help us fight back!

Friend,
Corky Messner is hosting a luncheon with Senator Tom Cotton on Monday, October 19th and wants you to join!
Where: The Grand At Bedford Village Inn
When: Monday, October 19th, 12:00 P.M. - 1:15 P.M.
RSVP: [[URL REDACTED]]
Corky is a West Point graduate, veteran, proven businessman, and principled Conservative running for U.S. Senate against Jeanne Shaheen.
Corky and Sen. Cotton align on many of the most important issues facing our country like economic freedom and personal liberty. He might be from Arkansas, but he embodies New Hampshire's ""Live Free or Die"" spirit!
By joining the two of them on Monday, you’re going to get a look “under the hood” of this tight race for U.S. Senate. And you will be helping Corky end Jeanne Shaheen’s tenure “working” for the Granite State!

Friends, we're just 15 weeks away from the 2020 elections. We have 15 weeks to get 361,046 Republican and Unaffiliated voters out to vote on November 3rd for President Trump, Governor Sununu, and our entire Republican ticket- with Democrats amassing big donor checks to get out their voters in New Hampshire, we need the resources to fight back.
What we’re up against in this race: Joe Biden and the DNC joined forces to raise over $360,000 per donor, creating a massive influx of big dollars on the Democrat side. Jeanne Shaheen and Joe Biden will spend any amount in order to defeat us in November.
What we need to fight back: With the Presidency and Senate control on the line this year, we need to raise $10,000 this week to win New Hampshire and defeat Joe Biden and Jeanne Shaheen.
How you can help today: Chip in $5. It may not sound like much, but your $5 plus someone else’s $5 help us fight back against the Democrat big money machine. Joe Biden, Chuck Schumer, and national Democrats are going to finance New Hampshire Democrats, and we need to be able to fight back with grassroots contributors like you.

"Hello ,
I wanted to send you a note during these uncertain times to give you an update as to what the New Hampshire Republican Party is doing and how we are continuing our efforts to organize, recruit, and train Republicans across the State of New Hampshire to ensure a victorious November election is on the horizon.
Just this week I have been on Zoom video calls with our county and city chairs along with our Vice Chair Pamela Tucker and House Republican Leader Dick Hinch to examine the current state of candidate recruitment and bring focus to areas we need to recruit in before candidates file in 7 weeks.
The NHGOP & Trump Victory staff have been hard at work fielding questions from activists, organizing our latest online petition, and managing the transition to this new digitally organized world. Since the beginning of March our team has contacted over 90,000 voters by phone and held 50 activist trainings activating over 350 volunteers.
In short, the New Hampshire Republican Party is active and prepared to handle this current crisis and continue to hold the Democrats accountable.
One of the biggest changes we face is the different approach we have to take to getting Republicans out to vote in November. In light of this, we need to switch our focus and budget to support a robust mail and digital advertising program along with increased remote phone-banking to reach voters.
That's why I am reaching out and providing you with this update today. Now more than ever we need your support in order to have the resources needed for victory. Our competition isn't slowing down and we aren't either which is why we need your help to have the resources to properly fight back.
Donate $10 to help us reach out to 500 voters digitally
Donate $20 to help us call 1000 voters
Donate $30 to do both!
The NHGOP is ready and prepared to elect Republicans across the State of New Hampshire during these times. I hope you can support us in that effort.

Stephen Stepanek

"Hello ,
Wanted to make sure you saw the Chairman's email from last week.
We are working every day at the New Hampshire Republican Party to make sure we are ready to campaign and win in November. This last month has only increased the dire need for a Republican Legislature and Executive Council in Concord - we need a government that will work with Governor Chris Sununu and not fight him at every opportunity.
Since the Chairman's email last Thursday, our team has made 15,439 phone calls to voters, held 10 virtual events, and activated over 100 volunteers.
Democrat legislative leaders were in court yesterday suing the Governor to obstruct his ability to disperse Federal CARES Act funds.
The stakes couldn't be higher. We need the resources to be successful, and your support during this time couldn't be more critical.
Donate $10 to help us reach out to 500 voters digitally

Your investment in the New Hampshire Republican Party is vital now more than ever.

Friend,
Did you see the news last week?
Democrat candidates for Governor Dan Feltes and Andru Volinsky are now fighting for tax increases during a global pandemic and economic downturn.
I'd like to tell you that they recognize the burden a tax increase would have on Granite Staters right now, but unfortunately they are committed to raising taxes.
Republicans are committed to fight for lower taxes and to protect the New Hampshire Advantage. Democrats like Feltes, Volinsky, and their State House majorities want to raise your taxes and increase costs for New Hampshire employers.
We can't let the Democrats get away with their tax increases, and here's what we need to do to stop them:
* Inform Granite Staters of the Democrats' anti-jobs agenda before November 3rd.
* Elect Republican Majorities to the New Hampshire House, Senate, and Executive Council.
* Defeat Feltes and Volinsky while re-electing Governor Chris Sununu this Fall.
In order to complete our checklist we will need the resources to wage a competitive campaign. Our mail, digital, and voter contact programs will need support from Grassroots donors like you if we are to be successful.
Can you invest $20 today to help us defeat the pro-tax Democrats in November?
Donate $20
Donate $40
Donate $60
Democrats like Dan Feltes and Andru Volinsky don't want us to succeed in November. Help us fight back with your donation today.
Sincerely,
Stephen Stepanek
NHGOP Chairman

NEW HAMPSHIRE CAMPAIGN MEMO
ACCOMPLISHED GOALS:
✅ Host hundreds of MAGA Meetups and Candidate Trainings
✅ Activate thousands of Volunteers
✅ Make 650,000 Voter Contact calls
OUTSTANDING GOALS:
🗹 Raise $5,000 to Support Republicans in New Hampshire by midnight tonight (8/13/20)
🗹 Deliver New Hampshire for President Trump and Republicans on November 3rd, 2020
Friend, we are meeting our voter contact goals and making sure every Granite State Republican is ready and prepared to vote this fall.
If we're going to continue supporting our volunteer voter contact efforts and help Get Out The Vote for Republicans this fall, we need to hit our goal of raising $5,000 by midnight tonight.
This election in New Hampshire is going to come down to every single vote cast, and we need to make sure we have the resources to get Republicans and Granite State independent voters out to vote.
Tens of thousands of Granite Staters stayed home in 2016 when we lost crucial races by just a few thousand votes - we're laser focused on getting those voters out this year and delivering the Granite State for President Trump and Republicans up and down the ballot.
Can you donate $10, $25, or $50 today to help us reach our $5,000 goal by midnight?

Friend,
The UNH poll released today tells us something I am already seeing on the ground: We have the momentum. President Trump is statistically tied in New Hampshire face-to-face matchups with Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, and Pete Buttigieg, while he is dominating a face-to-face matchup with Michael Bloomberg.
New Hampshire was the first state this cycle with Trump Victory staff, and the results are showing. This is one of the President's strongest New Hampshire polls to date and it shows how the momentum is on our side - we've closed the gap and are now tied or beating our likely Democrat opponent. After an incredible turnout of support for our President in the First-in-the-Nation Primary, we are confident we can build the infrastructure needed to deliver New Hampshire for President Trump in November.
With this UNH poll showing a dead heat, will you join me today in supporting the NHGOP in their efforts to deliver President Trump four electoral votes from NH?
It is clear to me that NH will reject the socialist policies of the Democratic Party in favor of four more years of a strong economy. Any amount, no matter how big or small, is going to go directly towards taking on the Democrats. Will you contribute $20, $25, $50, $100, or your most generous contribution today to help us push the President over the top in NH?
Thank you,
Lou Gargiulo
NH Trump Co-Chair
PS: Bernie Sanders wants nothing more than to win his neighboring state, we need to push back against the socialist policies from Senator Sanders. Contribute today.

New Hampshire Republicans are behind Elliot and will do everything we can to secure victory in March. To win, we need your investment today.
Democrats in the New Hampshire House are pursuing an out-of-touch and reckless agenda marked by higher taxes and all-out assaults on our New Hampshire Advantage. Help us defeat their agenda at the polls on March 10th.
The NHGOP will work tirelessly to keep this seat Republican as we continue to gear up for the 2020 election cycle.

Friend, I couldn't believe what I was hearing.
On Wednesday Senate Democrat Leader Chuck Schumer lashed out with a disgusting attack on Supreme Court Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh.
What have we heard from New Hampshire Senators Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan? Crickets.
This is unacceptable. We cannot sit idly by while Chuck Schumer's attacks on the Judicial Branch go uncontested from New Hampshire's U.S. Senators.
It's clear: We need to defeat and retire Jeanne Shaheen this November. We can only do that with your support.
We can win big in November in New Hampshire and replace Jeanne Shaheen with a Republican candidate. Whoever our party's nominee is will need a strong NHGOP to secure victory - which is why your donation today will be split between the NHGOP and our New Hampshire Senate Republican Nominee Fund on WinRed.
New Hampshire will see UNPRECEDENTED money flooding in from Chuck Schumer and his allies to support Jeanne Shaheen, and we need the resources to fight back.
If you've donated before you can process your donation with one-click. Please consider investing in New Hampshire Victory today.
Sincerely,
Stephen Stepanek

At this time next week, polls will start closing across New Hampshire and we'll be hours away from knowing how New Hampshire votes this election.
We are so close to victory and we need to seal the deal by reaching out to even more voters between now and election day.
Your donation tonight will enable us to increase our digital spending, reaching voters online with our Republican message.
Republicans in New Hampshire will always stand firm against an Income or Sales Tax. We'll fight to lower taxes on small businesses and expand opportunity for all. We need strong Republican majorities in our State House, Senate, and Executive Council that will work with Governor Chris Sununu, and we need to make sure we have the resources to send a new Republican delegation to Congress from New Hampshire.
We can't achieve any of our goals without your support right now. Please donate to help us deliver our message and win this November 3rd.

Thanks to Governor Chris Sununu and Republican leadership, New Hampshire is stronger than ever before.
Our economy is booming. Unemployment is down to record lows and more people are working than ever before in our State's history. As long as we have Governor Sununu in office, New Hampshire will never have an Income or Sales Tax.
But we cannot rest on Governor Sununu's strong leadership on its own - we need to send him reinforcements to Concord and take back the New Hampshire House and Senate.
Invest in the NHGOP today to ensure Republican victory this November.
We can take back the House, Senate, and Executive Council on November 3rd, but only with your support.
Sincerely,
Elliot Gault

Friend,
Earlier this year, I reached out to you with your downloadable New Hampshire Republican Party 2020 sustaining membership Card. In reviewing our records last night I noticed that we had not received your 2020 Sustaining Membership contribution.
With our successful First-In-the-Nation Presidential primary concluded, and with President Trump receiving the most votes of any incumbent, our race is shifting towards supporting our slate of Republican candidates. It's critical we have 17 more Republicans renew their membership tonight to reach our aggressive fundraising goal.
Our NH Senate race could very well determine who controls the US Senate in 2021 and beyond. President Trump has already confirmed a record number of judges. We need a US Senator that will confirm the President’s nominees who will interpret the Constitution as written.
Will you make your 2020 sustaining membership contribution today with your downloadable membership card? Your membership is as important now as ever.

I wanted to send you a quick reminder about tomorrow's lunch with Corky Messner and U.S. Senator Tom Cotton. You can RSVP securely here: [[URL REDACTED]]
Best,
Elliot
Friend,
Corky Messner is hosting a luncheon with Senator Tom Cotton on Monday, October 19th and wants you to join!
Where: The Grand At Bedford Village Inn
When: Monday, October 19th, 12:00 P.M. - 1:15 P.M.
RSVP: [[URL REDACTED]]
Corky is a West Point graduate, veteran, proven businessman, and principled Conservative running for U.S. Senate against Jeanne Shaheen.
Corky and Sen. Cotton align on many of the most important issues facing our country like economic freedom and personal liberty. He might be from Arkansas, but he embodies New Hampshire's ""Live Free or Die"" spirit!
By joining the two of them on Monday, you’re going to get a look “under the hood” of this tight race for U.S. Senate. And you will be helping Corky end Jeanne Shaheen’s tenure “working” for the Granite State!
Tickets for this event are still available, but availability is limited. Don’t miss out on your chance to reserve your seat at the table! Just click or tap here.

Friend,
When Ann Kuster and Chris Pappas voted for the Democrats' $3 Trillion Wishlist, we knew they were doing so due to politics and Nancy Pelosi's marching orders.
Their colleague, California Democrat Katie Porter, confirmed that reasoning for her - do Kuster and Pappas agree?
Ann Kuster and Chris Pappas' $3 Trillion Wishlist included:
* $1,200 payments to illegal immigrants.
* A blanket release of prisoners, including murderers and rapists.
* The use of taxpayer funds to subsidize abortion.
* Forcing states like New Hampshire to comply with stringent federal election mandates, including no ID requirement for in-person voting and ballot harvesting.
* Protecting illegals from deportation and grant them work authorization during the pandemic, allowing them to work at jobs that could be held by unemployed Americans.
Now, does this really sound like the type of plan Granite Staters would want to see during a global pandemic?
Democrats are openly discussing how bad this bill is, but they voted for it anyways. This wasn't a case of having to pass the bill before they could find out what was in it - they knew how bad it was and still pushed it through.
Democrats like Ann Kuster and Chris Pappas do a phenomenal job as foot soldiers for Nancy Pelosi, but they do a terrible job fighting for New Hampshire. We need to fight back.

Friend,
This November, everything is on the line. If the Democrats take power and win, here's what we'll be looking at in 2021:
* A New Hampshire Income Tax
* Repeal of Republican Tax Cuts
* Increased Taxes on Granite State Employers
* Infringements on our Second Amendment Rights
* Far-Left judicial nominations
It will take all of us working together to make sure we elect Republicans up and down the ballot and defeat the Democrat agenda before it's too late - and I'm asking you to commit to vote.
Granite Staters are fired up about our Republican candidates, and it’s a testament to the incredible success of Trump Victory NH, our unified organizing operation for Republicans campaigns up and down the entire ballot. Trump Victory NH has held hundreds of virtual events, with thousands of energized volunteers who are phone banking and door knocking every week in communities across the state to remind voters how much is at stake.
By voting in-person on November 3rd or by casting your Absentee ballot beforehand, you'll ensure that our Republican candidates get across the finish line and win this November.
Find out how to get your absentee ballot here.
Let's win big in November,

Friend,
Today is Tax Day 2020, and Democrats in New Hampshire have been chomping at the bit to implement an Income Tax. They've already submitted multiple Income Tax bills that Governor Chris Sununu had to veto in order to protect the New Hampshire Advantage and keep you from having to file and pay a State Income Tax.
With less than four months to go until Election Day 2020, we need to pull out all the stops to defeat the Democrat Income Tax.
Democrats will spread any amount of misinformation to claim otherwise, but they can't hide from their pro-Income Tax record that they've developed in Concord - and a vote for any Democrat on the ballot is a vote for an Income Tax in New Hampshire, and they must be defeated.
The Granite State prides itself on being Income and Sales Tax free. We can't let the Democrats get away with their plans to implement either in our state.
Help us protect the New Hampshire Advantage and our Live Free or Die status by supporting Republicans today.

DIVISIVE DEMOCRATS
Friend,
Speaker Shurtleff has failed to lead his caucus- evidenced by Democrat Representative Deb Stevens's divisive comments.
Sadly, this is yet another New Hampshire Democrat elected official making ridiculous comments about her constituents and Granite Staters.
To suggest that Republican voters will cause a civil war depending on the election results is a dangerous insinuation and does great damage to the ability of Republicans and Democrats looking to work together. Help us defeat these Democrats in 2020.
As unhinged rhetoric in the Democrat caucus continues to spread from member to member, Speaker Shurtleff has been turning a blind-eye to his caucus’ misbehavior all session.
We need to elect a Republican majority to the House in 2020 to usher in new House leadership under a Republican Speaker. Will you invest in the NHGOP to get the job done?

"Friend,
With just 18 days to go until November 3rd, we know that New Hampshire is in play in all of our major races - but we're currently being outspent by out-of-state groups who want to impose their values on New Hampshire.
I know a lot of people have asked you for a contribution this election, but dollar-for-dollar New Hampshire is the best investment you can make this election cycle. When so many of our target races could be decided by just a handful of votes - and I truly mean just a handful of votes \- that makes your donation to support New Hampshire Republicans so much more valuable.
Many emails will try to push you with a special match rate or ability to increase your impact, but I can genuinely tell you that the 5 dollars that you donate to the New Hampshire Republican Party will do so much more to impact the 2020 election than any other political donation you make this cycle.
In 2016, President Trump lost New Hampshire by just 2,736 votes. Even closer than that razor thin margin was State Senator Harold French's race, when he defeated a well entrenched Democrat incumbent by just 17 votes.
That's not 17 percentage points - that represents the 17 New Hampshire voters who determined his crucial win in 2016.
In 2018 we lost 35 New Hampshire House seats by margins under 100 votes - and we are roughly that many seats away from flipping the New Hampshire House of Representatives this year and placing it in Republican control.
From President Trump on down through our state legislative and county candidates, New Hampshire Republicans need a strong & united New Hampshire Republican Party to help close the gap and deliver victory on November 3rd. I know we can do it by getting everyone on board, but our chances greatly increase if we could count on your support today.
A lot of candidates and organizations have asked a lot of you this election cycle, but that just highlights how important it is that we succeed and win on November 3rd. Your donation to the NHGOP today will go directly to electing Republicans up and down the ballot in a critical swing state that the nation's eyes are all on.
Yours in Victory,
Pamela Tucker

Friend,
In addition to 2020 being an election year, it is also a Census year - and it's important that Republicans take part and get counted.
The basics
● The census counts every person living in the United States, regardless of age or citizenship status, every 10 years in years ending in 0.
● It’s in the Constitution.
It’s important
● It’s about money, power, and data.
● Every 10 years we help decide how taxpayer dollars come back to our communities. The 2020 Census will help to distribute billions of dollars in federal resources to your community.
● Our community gets resources based on census population counts, that help pay for hospitals, emergency services, schools, roads, and more.
● An accurate and complete census helps businesses, community leaders and elected officials make informed decisions every day.
It’s easy
● For the first time, people can respond online and by phone, in addition to the mail-in option. Your response impacts funding for your community for critical services for the next 10 years.
● The next decennial census happens in 2030.
It’s safe and confidential
● Your data is protected and it’s confidential. Federal law protects your responses, which cannot be shared with law enforcement, immigration agencies, or housing authorities.
COVID-19 & the 2020 Census
● The 2020 Census is underway and the most important and safe thing you can do is respond online, by phone, or by mail. It has never been easier to respond to the 2020 Census.
● Responding now will minimize the need for the Census Bureau to send census takers out into communities to follow up with households.
● Please check this page regularly for updates and adjustments in response to COVID-19.
Financial Benefit of the Census to New Hampshire

Friends, we're just 20 weeks aways from the 2020 elections. We know Joe Biden and Jeanne Shaheen are going to spend big, out-of-state dollars to win here in New Hampshire and we need the resources to fight back.
What we’re up against in this race: Joe Biden and the DNC joined forces to raise over $360,000 per donor, creating a massive influx on big dollars on the Democrat side. Jeanne Shaheen has raised over $11,00,000 during this term and has over $7,000,000 cash on hand. We need the financial resources to compete and win this election the New Hampshire way.
What we need to fight back: With the Presidency and Senate control on the line this year, we need to raise $5,000 this week to win New Hampshire and defeat Joe Biden and Jeanne Shaheen.
How you can help today: Chip in $5. It may not sound like much, but your $5 plus someone else’s $5 help us fight back against the Democrat big money machine. Joe Biden, Chuck Schumer, and national Democrats are going to finance New Hampshire Democrats, and we need to be able to fight back with grassroots contributors like you.
Rush $5 or more right now to help win New Hampshire in November and defeat Joe Biden and Jeanne Shaheen!

It's been one week since the historic RNC Convention where President Trump accepted our party's nomination in front of the White House.
In that last week, Democrats have been freaking out regarding polls, and the movement shows the momentum is on our side.
We have a stronger team and a more unified party than the Democrats, but what we need is your contribution.

Friend, I wish I could say I am surprised.
After the NH Senate laid the “Born-Alive Protection Act” on the table, NH House Judiciary just voted along party lines to kill the House version of the “Born Alive Infant Protection Act”
This bill would protect an infant that is born alive - just what is controversial about that? Babies that take their first breath should be entitled to the same medical care provided to any human being.
I am not surprised because we see Democrats across the nation go to extreme measures to side with Planned Parenthood and other special interests.
That is why I am personally asking you to contribute $25, $50, $100, or your most generous contribution today so we can flip the NH House and restore sanity to New Hampshire.
I am making a personal ask of $25, $50, $100, or your most generous contribution to give the NHGOP the tools necessary to take back New Hampshire.
Thank you,
Chris Ager
RNC Committeeman
PS: HB1675 was a commonsense bill aimed at protecting life if an abortion fails. Democrats chose to side with Planned Parenthood. Support Republicans today.

This November Democrats are gearing up to enact an Income Tax across the State of New Hampshire this Fall and we need to fight back.
We're just $1500 away from meeting our goal so we can have the resources to elect Republicans up and down the ballot in New Hampshire on November 3rd.

"Special Election Alert
Friend,
In exactly one week Republican voters in Hooksett will go to the polls in the special primary to nominate a State Representative to replace late Republican Representative Dick Marple. We at the NHGOP are committed to maintaining control of that seat in the general election on March 10th.
Republicans in the NH House have been pushing back against a wave of proposals that will increase taxes, restrict your Second Amendment Rights, and weaken elections. We have barely enough votes to sustain Governor Sununu’s vetoes on the Democrats destructive legislation. Help us protect the NH Advantage by sending another Republican to Concord to stand with the Governor and protect the New Hampshire Advantage.
Your donation of $10, $20, or $25 will go directly into our “Hooksett Victory Fund” in which will help us support our Republican nominee through mail, digital advertisements, and supporting our volunteers in the field knocking doors.
Contribute to our Hooksett Victory Fund today!
Many thanks,
-Team NHGOP
P.S. The NHGOP will hit the ground running following the special primary on January 22nd to support our Republican nominee. With more job killing legislation being introduced in 2020, it is critical we send another Republican to Concord. Consider donating $25 to our Hooksett Victory Fund today.

Friend,
Last week, New Hampshire Democrats opened the door to Massachusetts taxing New Hampshire workers who are working from home.
Democrats in New Hampshire want an Income Tax for New Hampshire so it's no wonder they wouldn't be outraged when Massachusetts started taxing our residents' income when they are working from home.
This heightens the need for us to Take Back NH this November - before the New Hampshire Democrats trade our incomes to Massachusetts.
Democrats like Tim Horrigan currently serve in the House Majority in New Hampshire, and they're counting on you not stepping up to stay in power.
Step up today with a donation, Friend.
We are just 63 days away from the election, and we need your support now more than ever.

Friend, have you seen some of the headlines about the Democrat Executive Council in the last few weeks?
While Andru Volinsky runs for Governor, he's been leading the Obstructionist Democrats on the Council for years. Volinsky's ""structural political racism"" is being enabled by just two individuals: Mike Cryans and Deb Pignatelli.
Neither called out Volinsky when he said Ryan Terrell was a ""demeaning"" nomination akin to ""tokenism."" Neither voted for Ryan Terrell, siding with Volinsky that he was ""unqualified."" Neither broke ranks with Volinsky on the Council to schedule a hearing for Eddie Edwards.
And, as of this email, neither have apologize to Ryan Terrell or Eddie Edwards for the ""structural political racism"" exhibited by the Democrat Executive Council.
Both Cryans and Pignatelli are running for re-election - will you donate to our ""FLIP THE COUNCIL"" campaign to help defeat them?
We have to hold these Democrats accountable for their enabling of Volinsky, and we need to Flip the Council this November. Invest in the NHGOP so we can do just that.

Friend,
In the latest Nancy Pelosi pork-ridden spending bill, Democrats want to use YOUR New Hampshire tax dollars to subsidize income tax revenues in New York, California, and other liberal states.
This is a clear case of Democrats trying to take advantage of a crisis and use Granite Staters' hard-earned tax dollars to prop up other states that were poorly-run long before this current crisis hit.
Granite Staters shouldn't be subsidizing other state's income tax revenues, and we need to send a clear message to our Federal Delegation that we're ready to flip their seats this November.
We've set up dedicated funds to defeat Jeanne Shaheen, Ann Kuster, and Chris Pappas. You can donate to our efforts to defeat these three Democrats at once, or you can donate to whichever fund you want to specifically target.
Donate to our DEFEAT SHAHEEN Fund
Donate to our DEFEAT PAPPAS Fund
Donate to our DEFEAT KUSTER Fund
Donate to our DEFEAT THE DEMOCRATS Fund
We need to hold Democrats accountable for this egregious move - and we need to flip their seats in November.
Sincerely,
Pamela Tucker

Friend,
Did you see the news? Jeanne Shaheen is on TV, lying about her record on Health Care.
She's trying to portray herself as a defender of New Hampshire Health Insurance Market, but her actions in the State Senate and as Governor brought down the number of New Hampshire providers from 26 to just 2 - devastating the market and limiting access for countless Granite Staters.
Jeanne Shaheen's D.C. consultants don't care about these facts, and they just don't care about the people of New Hampshire.
Want more proof Jeanne Shaheen doesn't care about Granite Staters' private insurance providers? She gave a full-throated endorsement to Bernie Sanders' socialist takeover of health care, Medicare-For-All.
Jeanne Shaheen's campaign is funneling money from California and New York behind her new ad, and we need the resources to fight back.
Donate today to help us Defeat Shaheen on November 3rd.

"Friend, we are almost there.
Polls released by the University of New Hampshire yesterday are now showing that we are on the verge of FLIPPING the New Hampshire House, Senate, and Executive Council.
As the polls show our hard work paying off, we can't give up now. We need to continue to mobilize our voters and get out the vote over these next 4 days in order to ensure we have something to celebrate on Tuesday night. Your donation today will empower us to increase our GOTV and persuasion efforts between now and election day and enable us to take back the New Hampshire House, Senate, and Executive Council.
We have all put a lot into this effort since the Democrats took over the General Court and Executive Council in 2018. Republicans have testified at countless committee meetings, rallied around Governor Chris Sununu's vetoes, organized new town committees, recruited a new and bold field of candidates, and have made record setting voter contacts. Campaigns across the state, up and down the ballot, have knocked on doors and made phone calls. The NHGOP has invested more this year than ever before in targeted digital and mail programs in strategic ways to get out the vote and support Republicans up and down the ballot. It's been a long two years, but victory is now clearly in our sights.
Now is not the time to rest on our laurels. These polls might make us feel good today but nothing will feel better than securing our victory next week. There is so much at stake on Tuesday and we need to make sure we can get our candidates across the finish line. Our candidates and committees are doing everything they can to win up and down the ballot on election day, but your donation today will help the NHGOP increase our efforts over these truly critical next few days.
Donate today and help New Hampshire Republicans finish the job of taking back New Hampshire.
\- Team NHGOP
P.S. We are so close to electing Republican Majorities to the New Hampshire House, Senate, and Executive Council, completely flipping the New Hampshire State House in the Republican column and giving Governor Chris Sununu a team he can work with in Concord. Donate securely today to ensure the NHGOP has every available resource to secure victory on Tuesday.

We're working with the Trump Campaign and Trump Victory Operation to elect Republicans up and down the ballot - on November 3rd we will take back our State House, Senate, and Executive Council while re-electing Governor Sununu, re-electing President Trump, and defeating Jeanne Shaheen, Chris Pappas, and Ann Kuster.
Help us accomplish these goals by joining us Thursday evening for this important campaign update - secure your ticket today!
Secure your Ticket with a $20 contribution
Democrats are targeting New Hampshire Republicans up and down the ballot - secure your spot for the official Trump Campaign update today.
Stephen Stepanek
NHGOP Chairman
P.S. We need to show President Trump that New Hampshire stands with him - RSVP today for this Thursday's campaign update.

Friend,
Ann Kuster and Chris Pappas filed to get on the ballot this week and they still haven't made it clear - did they vote for a $3 Trillion Wishlist out of fear of Pelosi retribution?
Their campaigns are going to be powered by out-of-state donors and PACs that prop them up - we need to fight back today with your grassroots contributions.
We're just $750 off from our goal for this week to help hold Democrats like Kuster and Pappas accountable. Your donation will help us reach our goal today.
HELP US DEFEAT CHRIS PAPPAS
HELP US DEFEAT ANN KUSTER
HELP US DEFEAT THE DEMOCRATS
We need all the resources from Grassroots donors like you in order to fight back and defeat the Democrats this fall. Please consider donating today.
\- NHGOP HQ
Friend,
When Ann Kuster and Chris Pappas voted for the Democrats' $3 Trillion Wishlist, we knew they were doing so due to politics and Nancy Pelosi's marching orders.
Their colleague, California Democrat Katie Porter, confirmed that reasoning for her - do Kuster and Pappas agree?
Ann Kuster and Chris Pappas' $3 Trillion Wishlist included:
* $1,200 payments to illegal immigrants.
* A blanket release of prisoners, including murderers and rapists.
* The use of taxpayer funds to subsidize abortion.
* Forcing states like New Hampshire to comply with stringent federal election mandates, including no ID requirement for in-person voting and ballot harvesting.
* Protecting illegals from deportation and grant them work authorization during the pandemic, allowing them to work at jobs that could be held by unemployed Americans.
Now, does this really sound like the type of plan Granite Staters would want to see during a global pandemic?
Democrats are openly discussing how bad this bill is, but they voted for it anyways. This wasn't a case of having to pass the bill before they could find out what was in it - they knew how bad it was and still pushed it through.
Democrats like Ann Kuster and Chris Pappas do a phenomenal job as foot soldiers for Nancy Pelosi, but they do a terrible job fighting for New Hampshire. We need to fight back.
HELP US DEFEAT CHRIS PAPPAS
HELP US DEFEAT ANN KUSTER
HELP US DEFEAT THE DEMOCRATS
We need all the resources we can get in order to fight back and defeat the Democrats this fall. Please consider donating today.
Sincerely,
Kate Day

As you may know, New Hampshire Trump Victory has had a ton of recent excitement. In the last 10 days alone, the Granite State has been visited by John Pence, Eric Trump, and Vice President Mike Pence. Today, Donald Trump Jr. joined us for an event in North Conway! Throughout these events, we’ve had the pleasure of meeting countless supporters eager to get involved with helping the President’s campaign for re-election. But what we’ve been most thrilled to see is the energy and interest from Hispanics here in the state. So as we celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month, we are excited to announce our very first Latinos for Trump event in New Hampshire!
Come and join the Trump Victory Team this Saturday in Nashua for a Latinos for Trump MAGA Meet-up and Potluck! Candidate for New Hampshire Congressional District 2, Steve Negron will help us kick things off. Bring your friends, a dish to share, and join us in ""Gathering for Freedom"" as we work together to flip New Hampshire red! We will also have a stream playing of the President announcing his Supreme Court pick, expected at 5 PM.

Friends, we sent this update earlier this week and we are just $1500 away from reaching our current goal. Read our memo below for an update on where things stand here in New Hampshire:
\---
Friends, here's a quick update on where things stand in the New Hampshire Senate race.
What we’re up against in this race: Jeanne Shaheen has raised over $11,00,000 during this term and has over $7,000,000 cash on hand. We need the financial resources to compete and win this election the New Hampshire way.
What we need to fight back: With Senate control on the line this year, we need to raise $5,000 before midnight tonight to flip this seat and defeat Jeanne Shaheen.
How you can help today: Chip in $5. It may not sound like much, but your $5 plus someone else’s $5 help us fight back against the Democrat big money machine. Chuck Schumer and national Democrats are going to finance Jeanne Shaheen's campaign, and we need to be able to fight back with grassroots contributions like you.
Rush $5 or more right now to help flip New Hampshire's Senate seat and preserve the Republican Senate Majority!

And now, we're so excited to come together, UNITED to win big in November.
We’re united in our fight for good public schools, environmental protections, quality and affordable health care, reproductive rights, and an economy that works for all Granite Staters.
We're united in our effort to defeat Chris Sununu, who has brought Donald Trump’s agenda to New Hampshire and has left too many Granite State families behind.
We're united in our effort to protect and expand our Democratic majorities in the State House, State Senate, and on the Executive Council – so we can continue to deliver for working people.
We're united in our effort to re-elect Congresswoman Annie Kuster and defeat the out-of-state Trump 'Yes Men' running against Senator Jeanne Shaheen and Congressman Chris Pappas.
And we're united in our effort to elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, and restore dignity to the White House.
Now more than ever, it’s clear that the stakes of this election couldn’t be higher. This fight is going to take all of us working together, and we need you with us.
JOIN US TOMORROW

"Top moments from last night's debate.
Alex,
Last night, Dan Feltes went head to head with Chris Sununu on WMUR in the first gubernatorial debate of this election. And a few things are clear — Chris Sununu is still a ""Trump guy through and through,"" his special interest agenda is wrong for New Hampshire, and we need Dan Feltes as our next governor!
CHIP IN TO DEFEAT SUNUNU
In case you missed the debate, here are a few highlights:
* Dan held Chris Sununu accountable for his years of attacking and undermining the Affordable Care Act. Click here to watch the clip!
* Like Trump, Sununu bragged about a ""miracle"" economy that maybe ski resort owners like the Sununus and his corporate special interests are experiencing, but that Granite State families sure are not.
* Sununu lied about his record on climate, even though he said in 2016 that ""the jury really still is out"" on climate change, and has since continually used his veto pen to block New Hampshire’s transition to a clean energy economy while taking huge sums from fossil fuel interests.
* Sununu doubled down on his support of the national gun lobby, and refused to support common sense background checks for gun owners.
* Feltes asked Sununu: “When you cast your ballot for Donald Trump, are you going to be proud to do that?” To which Sununu responded like this:
While Dan Feltes is fighting for working families, Chris Sununu is busy blocking progress on all of the issues we care about — from raising the minimum wage, to enacting paid family leave, to supporting our public schools, and more.
Sununu has shown us time and time again that he stands with Donald Trump, not New Hampshire — no matter how disgraceful and extreme Trump's views, politics, and policies are. And we need your help to stop him.
Can we count on you to chip today to help us boot Sununu out of office and elect a governor who will put New Hampshire first?
Two weeks to win it,

"Let's run through the tape.
Alex,
There are just a couple hours left for Granite Staters to get out and vote in the most important election of our lifetimes, and we're not taking anything for granted.
In 2016, Donald Trump only lost New Hampshire by 2,700 votes. Trump’s campaign knows they need to win the Granite State this time – and we can’t let that happen. New Hampshire could be the only thing standing between Trump and the White House.
We've been at it since 5am this morning and are working hard all the way until the polls close to get every Granite State voter out to vote for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, and Democrats all the way down the ticket.
We still have a couple hours til polls close — can I count on you to chip in $10 now to help us finish strong and mobilize every last voter to get to the polls?

"Get your ticket to see all the candidates in person on Saturday.
Alex,
If they weren't already posted up here, around 4am this morning the Democratic presidential candidates descended on New Hampshire to kick off the final week sprint to Primary Day.
In just one week, tens of thousands of Granite Staters will have cast their ballots in our First In The Nation primary contest — and the results are likely to shape the rest of the 2020 primary. That's why it's so important that every single one of us takes advantage of the opportunities this week will provide to hear from the candidates directly about their visions for the future and their plans to make this state and country better for everyone.
The best way to see all the candidates in one place — asking for your vote one last time before you head to the polls on Tuesday — is by attending our McIntyre-Shaheen 100 Club Event this Saturday evening at SNHU Arena in Manchester. Tickets for this exciting event are almost sold out – so be sure to get yours today!
* For seats in the bowl that start as low as $20, click here.

"Dear Alex,
Today marks just two months until Election Day on November 3rd. For the next two months, New Hampshire Democrats will be working non-stop to re-elect my good friends Jeanne Shaheen, Annie Kuster, and Chris Pappas – because our country's future depends on the outcome of this election.
Jeanne, Annie, and Chris have always fought for Granite Staters. They’ve worked to secure federal funding to combat the opioid crisis, safeguard our environment and clean drinking water, defend our state against attacks by the Trump administration, and protect access to quality, affordable health care. They’ve delivered results that New Hampshire can count on, and now they’re counting on us to have their backs.
Make no mistake – these are tough races. In 2016, I won my Senate race by just 1,017 votes. So if you've ever wondered whether your donations or phone calls make a difference, those 1,017 votes are your answer. Every single vote you help Jeanne, Annie, and Chris get this year could make the difference in whether we maintain our House majority and flip the Senate, which is why I'm urgently asking for your support today.
With just 2 months until Election Day, can you chip in whatever you can right now to help New Hampshire Democrats raise $2,000 by midnight?
CHIP IN
Serving New Hampshire alongside Jeanne, Annie, and Chris has given me the opportunity to see firsthand their dedication, hard work, and passion for the people of our great state. I'm so proud to support them in their re-election, and I hope I can count on you to support them, too.
I can tell you from experience that the final two months of this election won’t be easy. Chris Pappas's district has been called the “swingiest swing district” in the country, and out-of-state candidates and money are vying for New Hampshire's Senate and House seats. We’re gearing up for a fight, and it’s going to take all of us to win.
Alex, I'm asking you – just as you helped ensure my victory in 2016, will you donate to the New Hampshire Democratic Party today to help ensure Democratic victories in 2020?
This moment in our nation’s history demands we step up and take action – and that starts with electing Democrats up and down the ballot right here in New Hampshire. Thank you for joining me in this fight – and let's get this done.
With every good wish,
Senator Maggie Hassan

"Chris Sununu put partisan politics ahead of the needs of Granite Staters.
Alex,
Last week, Chris Sununu did what he does best: veto bills that would help hardworking Granite Staters. I'm disappointed but not surprised – putting special interests ahead of New Hampshire families is nothing new for the governor.
❌ Sununu vetoed a bill providing housing protections to prevent New Hampshire renters and homeowners from being kicked out of their homes during the COVID-19 pandemic.
❌ He vetoed a bill to expand absentee voting and bring New Hampshire up to speed with online voter registration.
❌ And Sununu vetoed paid family and medical leave. For the second year in a row. During a pandemic.
These are common sense bills that have overwhelming support, but it's clear Sununu is out of touch with what Granite Staters need. Auctioning off his veto of paid family and medical leave to the highest bidder last year was bad enough, but playing politics with people’s livelihoods in the middle of an unprecedented pandemic? Downright shameful.
It’s past time to kick him out of office, and we need your help. Can you chip in now to help us #VetoSununu and elect a governor who will put Granite Staters first?
EXPRESS DONATE $10
EXPRESS DONATE $20.20
EXPRESS DONATE $50
DONATE OTHER AMOUNT
Sununu is bankrolled by his corporate special interest donors – so we need your contribution to bring the fight and kick him out of office.
Always standing with you,
Senator Martha Fuller Clark

"6 days to get out the vote!
Hi there Alex,
I'm reaching out to ask for a quick favor today — but first, I’m excited to tell you that this year, we’re running the biggest digital ads program the New Hampshire Democratic Party has ever run.
Digital ads are a key part of our strategy — they help us reach voters in every corner of the state that we might not be able to contact by phone or literature drop, and they let us really meet people where they're at. And especially this year, as we’ve needed to scale back in-person campaigning while simultaneously doing a ton of extra voter education to make sure Granite Staters know all the options they have to cast their ballot, we’ve invested heavily in a strong and innovative ads program to make sure we’re not leaving anything on the table.
But here’s the thing: Republicans are just as focused on reaching voters this way, too. Donald Trump’s campaign has spent record funds on Facebook ads — so we need to make sure we have the cash to compete, and keep all of our GOTV ads running strong through this final week.
PITCH IN TO KEEP OUR ADS RUNNING
Your contribution will allow me to put more money behind our online ads this weekend — so we can reach even more voters, keep getting our message out, and make sure a record number of Granite Staters get out to vote for Democrats up and down the ballot by November 3rd.
Can you chip in, Alex? Even just $10 will allow us to deliver a few hundred more ad impressions — and we know that here in New Hampshire, those kinds of margins often make all the difference.
To close, I just want to say thank you for all you've done to support our campaign efforts. I'm so grateful you're on our team, and we truly couldn’t have made it this far without you. Now, let’s bring this election home.
Thanks so much,
Savannah

"Are you ready to get Donald Trump out of the White House?
Alex,
It’s official: Donald Trump just accepted the Republican nomination for a second term as president — and we have to do everything we can to keep him from winning another four years.
CHIP IN RIGHT NOW TO STOP TRUMP
Four more years of Donald Trump means four more years of attacks on the Affordable Care Act, reproductive rights, public education, the environment, LGBTQ Americans, and more. Trump has broken nearly every promise he’s made to Granite Staters. He puts special interests first and New Hampshire last, and he won’t stop pushing his dangerous agenda until we beat him.

"Alex,
It’s John Kerry here. I know a thing or two about running a campaign, and let me tell you something – it takes a village.
This year is no different. Granite Staters across the political spectrum have come together to reject the divisive and dangerous politics of the current Republican Party, led by Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell and all of their enablers here in New Hampshire.
You and I both know that to truly undo the damage of the last four years, it's not enough to just beat Donald Trump. We need to win control of the U.S. Senate – which starts with re-electing my good friend Jeanne Shaheen, keep that Democratic U.S. House majority we all fought so hard for in 2018, replace your governor, and elect Democrats down the ballot who will fight for our shared values.
Right now, there are just 10 days until Election Day. These last days of the campaign are critical to our victory on November 3rd, and we have to make sure our state operations in battlegrounds like New Hampshire are well-funded through the finish line – so today I’m asking: can you make a contribution to keep this well-oiled machine of a campaign firing on all cylinders?
HELP KEEP THIS CAMPAIGN RUNNING
I’ve got to say, I love New Hampshire. Campaigns here belong to Granite Staters like you – you make the phone calls, you knock doors in the cold, and you give your talent, your heart, and your time to help build a future we can all believe in. I’ve had the pleasure of spending a lot of time in your state over the past couple of decades, and it's a pretty special place. And I also know it's a state we can’t afford to lose.
There’s a whole lot on the ballot this year, Alex. From quality and affordable health care and action on climate, to protecting reproductive rights and creating an economy that works for everyone, there's so much at stake. In this last push to the finish line, we need your support. Can I count on you to chip in whatever amount you can give to help my friends Joe Biden and Jeanne Shaheen, and Granite State Democrats all the way down the ticket, win their elections?
I guarantee we won’t be able to win this one without you – so let’s give it all we’ve got.
All the best,
John Kerry

"Chris Sununu is a “Trump guy through and through”
Big news, Alex!
We just launched our new ad exposing how Chris Sununu’s loyalty to Donald Trump hurts New Hampshire. Check it out here.
During the Republican National Convention this week and ahead of Trump’s New Hampshire rally this Friday, this ad will remind voters across the Granite State that Trump and Sununu have the same agenda – and that even after all the damage Trump has done, Chris Sununu STILL stands by him.
Watch the ad yourself to see how Sununu is leaving Granite State workers and families behind – blocking a minimum wage and paid family leave, and prioritizing his corporate special interest donors in the middle of a pandemic – and then chip in to make sure other New Hampshire voters see it, too!
This is the earliest substantial ad buy we’ve ever launched in a gubernatorial race, because this election is just that important — Chris Sununu is a “Trump guy through and through,” and his extreme agenda is bad for New Hampshire.
It’s critical we get this message out to as many Granite State voters as possible, and we need your help! Right now, we only have enough funds to run this ad on social media. Can you make a contribution today to help us put it on TV?
WATCH & DONATE
We need to defeat Chris Sununu and Donald Trump in November in order to move our state forward. Please consider a contribution today to power our campaign.

By midnight tomorrow, our fundraising numbers from the past three months will be locked in and made public — and we need to make sure those numbers reflect the incredible enthusiasm and momentum of our grassroots movement that is working to elect Democrats up and down the ballot here in New Hampshire!

DONATE OTHER AMOUNT
With just 5 weeks left until voting in the 2020 election ends, we can’t slow down or fall behind now — especially when we’re up against corporate special interests who are desperate to hold on to their power.
We need to raise $6,218.73 by MIDNIGHT TOMORROW, September 30th, to reach our end-of-quarter goal and stay on track so we can win BIG on November 3rd — help us get there by chipping in today.
The dollars raised in this final stretch couldn’t be more important — so we can talk to even more voters, pay for even more print, television, and digital ads, and get as many yard signs to our supporters as we can.
There are just 35 days left to give this all we’ve got and to keep our grassroots operation running all across the Granite State. Make a contribution today to help us reach our goal so we can keep our campaign moving full speed ahead.
Let’s bring this election home,
Ray

"Alex,
Last night, we lost a trailblazing champion for women, for families, for equality, and for justice. Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s fights, and her presence on the Supreme Court, meant so much to so many — and future generations will remember the immeasurable progress she made. Our deepest condolences go out to her family and everyone who knew her.
I know we are all grieving this devastating news and fearful of what her passing means for the future of our rights and freedoms. But today I woke up committed to fighting harder than ever for the future of our country. And I hope you’ll join me.
We need to make sure this presidential election is not close, and that starts by doing our part here in New Hampshire. We need to elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris by huge margins. We need to re-elect Jeanne Shaheen and do our part to flip the Senate. And we also need to protect and expand our legislative majorities and defeat Chris Sununu in order to make progress and stop bad laws from being passed in New Hampshire.
We already knew how much was at stake in 2020, but now these fights are even more urgent. We are working day in and day out to win up and down the ticket in November, and we need you with us.
DONATE MONEY
DONATE TIME
I’m reminded today of Kamala Harris’s words at the Democratic National Convention, when she said,
> “Years from now, this moment will have passed. And our children and our grandchildren will look in our eyes and ask us: Where were you when the stakes were so high? They will ask us, what was it like?
>
>  And we will tell them. We will tell them, not just how we felt. We will tell them what we did.”
There are a lot of important fights to be had over the next 45 days and beyond, but let’s start with today. Click here to make a donation to fund our campaign efforts here in New Hampshire. Or, click here to sign up to join us for our Weekend of Action.
Fighting with you — in her honor,

"Let's stop the GOP's mega-donors from buying our governor's office again.
Alex,
The Koch brothers are at it again.
They just launched a $300,000 ad buy in New Hampshire in the hopes of re-electing Chris Sununu, so that he'll continue to do their bidding in the corner office.
We need to fight back immediately — and show the Koch brothers that their money and their anti-worker, anti-environment agenda isn't welcome here in New Hampshire.

Make a donation today to help us elect Dan Feltes on November 3rd — a leader who will put Granite State workers and families first, not corporate special interests and the top 1%.

"Alex,
Last week, Donald Trump brought his “Women for Trump” bus tour to New Hampshire. But Granite State women aren’t fooled: no amount of out-of-state boosters could hide the fact that Trump has attacked women’s rights throughout his entire presidency.
Donald Trump’s anti-woman agenda is dangerous, out of touch, and wrong for New Hampshire.
\- He promised to overturn Roe v. Wade, and said that women who have abortions should be punished.
\- He rolled back workplace sexual harassment, discrimination, and equal pay protections, and has opposed paid family leave plans.
\- He introduced a gag rule forcing Planned Parenthood and other family planning providers out of Title X, cutting off reproductive health care for low-income and uninsured Americans.
And that’s just the tip of the iceberg! At every turn, Trump has sabotaged the Affordable Care Act, attacked abortion rights, and undermined access to birth control. AND, he has failed to deliver affordable childcare for hardworking families. Granite Staters deserve better, which is why we're going all in to defeat Trump and elect Democrats who will fight for women and families. Will you stand with us?
CONTRIBUTE TODAY
Donald Trump and Republican politicians have made their intentions crystal clear – and they won’t stop attacking our rights until we beat them. We need your help to protect reproductive rights and access to affordable care for ALL Granite Staters. Can we count on you to chip in today?
EXPRESS DONATE $10

We can beat Trump and put a stop to his dangerous agenda, but it’s going to take us all.

"We’re fighting hard, and need your help
Alex,
For almost four years now, we’ve been building towards the moment when we can defeat Donald Trump and elect a president who puts people first. And now, we’ve got less than four weeks left to make it happen.
I was honored to spend time in New Hampshire in the past couple of years, and to get to know Granite Staters who are working tirelessly to elect Democrats up and down the ballot and make New Hampshire work for working people. There is so much at stake — from quality and affordable health care, to reproductive rights, to making the economy work not just for those at the top, but for everyone. These are issues that touch people’s daily lives.
Alex, your support is powerfully important to defeating Donald Trump, electing Joe Biden, and restoring decency to the White House — and I know Granite State Democrats have a plan to win big. So today, I'm asking if you can make a donation to help fund the New Hampshire Democratic Party's voter outreach efforts over this final month.
Your donation will help power grassroots organizing to elect Democrats up and down the ticket, share our vision with even more voters, and make sure every Granite Stater knows the importance of voting in this election, the most important one of our lifetimes.
I’m so grateful that you’re on this team. As Joe Biden says, we are in a battle for the soul of our nation — and we’re only going to be able to win with strong grassroots support. Can you chip in today to help elect Democrats in New Hampshire, all the way from Joe Biden and Kamala Harris at the top of the ticket down to the fantastic local leaders running for important positions in your community?
We can’t leave anything up to chance, because everything is on the line — the White House, the Senate, your governor’s office, State House, and Executive Council majorities, and even the Supreme Court. You don’t get what you don’t fight for — so let’s give this everything we’ve got for these final weeks.
Thanks for being a part of this,
Elizabeth

"Everything is on the line.
Alex,
Trump just made it official — he nominated anti-choice Amy Coney Barrett to fill Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s seat on the U.S. Supreme Court. We already knew how much was at stake in 2020, but it’s never been more clear that our rights are on the line.
HELP US FIGHT BACK
As any nominee of Donald Trump would be, Amy Coney Barrett is dangerously anti-choice. She’s ruled in favor of upholding restrictions to abortion, and if given the chance, she would vote to overturn Roe v. Wade. We need you in the fight with us to make sure we elect Democrats who will protect the right to choose — and in New Hampshire, that starts with defeating Chris Sununu.
Like Trump, Chris Sununu has a long record of attacking reproductive rights. He voted to defund Planned Parenthood, and he’s given taxpayer dollars intended for COVID-19 relief to an anti-choice crisis pregnancy center — a kind of group that is known for lying to patients to block them from accessing abortion. He has restricted access to reproductive care for Granite Staters, and he supported Brett Kavanaugh — and now, like Trump, he’s trying to nominate an anti-choice activist to New Hampshire’s Supreme Court.
To protect choice and honor all that Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg fought for, we must defeat Chris Sununu and elect Dan Feltes. That’s why this week, we launched a campaign to make sure Granite Staters know that Sununu’s anti-choice agenda threatens reproductive rights for thousands of NH women.
JOIN THE FIGHT – AVENGE RBG, DEFEAT SUNUNU
As Trump tries to reshape the Supreme Court in his anti-choice image, it couldn’t be more clear that we need reproductive rights champions in the corner office, the State House, the State Senate, and on the Executive Council to fight to protect the right to choose for all Granite Staters. Can you chip in today to help us bring the fight to Chris Sununu?
In times like these, when things are difficult or I feel powerless, what keeps me going is knowing that I am in this fight with all of you. And I couldn’t be more motivated to carry on Justice Ginsburg’s legacy with Granite Staters like you on our team. There is a lot at stake in just 38 days, but I know that if we continue fighting together, we can win.
In solidarity,
Amy

"9 days to win.
Alex,
Donald Trump just arrived in Manchester to host another one of his dangerous rallies. And make no mistake – he is all in to flip New Hampshire red. Trump knows that this is a must win state for him, and so with just 9 days left until Election Day, he’s back in a last ditch effort to turn his abysmal poll numbers around and win the Granite State.
We can't let that happen.
Four more years of Donald Trump means four more years of attacks on our health care, our environment, and our democracy. It means more anti-choice judges, dismantled worker protections, and corporate special interests before working families.
CHIP IN TODAY TO STOP TRUMP
Every single New Hampshire Republican has welcomed Trump and his dangerous agenda with open arms. Chris Sununu, Corky Messner, Matt Mowers, Steve Negron, and Republicans down the ballot support Trump’s agenda that puts wealthy corporations and the top 1% first and leaves everyone else behind. And to thank him, special interest, big money donors are working around the clock to help Trump and his New Hampshire enablers pull out a win.
Our fight is fueled by contributions from supporters like you, so can we count on you to chip in today to help us defeat Donald Trump – and all the Trump rubber stamps running for office here, too?
STOP TRUMP - GIVE $10
STOP TRUMP - GIVE $20.20
STOP TRUMP - GIVE $50
STOP TRUMP - GIVE $100
STOP TRUMP - GIVE WHATEVER YOU CAN
There are just 9 days left in this election, and we can’t leave anything on the table. So today, will you give whatever you can to help us win big on November 3rd?
Glad to be in this fight with you,
Ray

"Our shopping list.
Alex,
That's a wrap on the first day of our last Get Out The Vote weekend of the 2020 election!
Today was incredible. Our team of organizers and volunteers contacted thousands of voters in New Hampshire to help them make their plan to vote for Democrats up and down the ballot! Can you chip in to help make sure we have enough supplies to do it all again tomorrow, Monday, and Tuesday?
Our campaign has mobilized a massive army of volunteers who are doing literature drops in more than 50 must-win cities and towns, making calls and sending texts to voters, and doing visibility on street corners across the state. We need to do a quick supply run tonight — can you help us out?
We can’t let a couple clipboards, a few hundred door hangers, or a handful of masks be the reason this team falls short — so can we count on you to help us cover the costs of our safe, socially distanced Get Out The Vote operation in the last few days before Election Day? Pitch in whatever you can.
This is the sprint to the finish line, and we need all hands (and supplies!) on deck — so chip in today, and let’s make this happen.

Thanks so much,

We have an exciting announcement! On Thursday, September 10th at 12:00pm, we hope you’ll join us for our post-primary unity event: United for Victory 2020! This will be unlike any other unity event we’ve had before, and it will feature Senator Shaheen, Senator Hassan, Congresswoman Kuster, Congressman Pappas, both of our gubernatorial candidates, and candidates from the executive council and state senate primaries!
Though this year's United for Victory event will be different than what we’ve hosted in the past, the spirit remains the same – that we are stronger when we come together and work to elect every single Democratic candidate up and down the ticket. After the primary, we need to do everything we can to support our nominees so we can protect and expand affordable health care for tens of thousands of Granite Staters, invest in our public schools, defend the right to choose, take action on climate change, and work with scientists and medical professionals to end the COVID-19 crisis.
On Thursday, September 10th, join us as we unite behind our Democratic nominees and help us win in November.

"50 days left.
[[URL REDACTED]]
Alex,
Last week’s state primary broke records! More Granite Staters made their voices heard than ever before in a primary election, and we turned out more Democrats than Republicans! And we need to do it again in November.
With just 50 days until the general election, our grassroots campaign operation is firing on all cylinders. In the past four months, we've hosted over 12,000 grassroots events, and our incredible volunteers have made and sent over a million calls and texts to New Hampshire voters to remind them what's at stake in this election. But we can't take our foot off the gas!
To continue the momentum and fuel our fight through these final 50 days, we’ve set a goal of raising $5,000 by midnight tonight.
If just 250 people donate $20.20 right now, we'll pass that goal in a heartbeat! Will you be one of the 250 to make it happen?
We need to take back the White House and the corner office this November, but we can't stop there. We need to elect Democrats up and down the ticket, and with your help, we'll have the resources to do it.
With just 50 days left, we’re working harder than ever, sharing our fight for good schools, quality and affordable health care, and an economy that works for everyone with people in every corner of the state. Will you chip in to help us reach our $5,000 goal today so we can spread our message further, reach more voters, and win BIG on November 3rd?

"This couldn't be more urgent.
Alex,
In just 12 days, the Supreme Court will hear oral arguments on Donald Trump’s lawsuit to gut the Affordable Care Act — and with Amy Coney Barrett’s confirmation bringing Trump one step closer to making his ACA repeal agenda a reality, I know I don’t have to tell you twice how urgent this election is to protect our health care.
PROTECT OUR HEALTH CARE
We have to fight back — because overturning the Affordable Care Act would be devastating for New Hampshire. It would mean 105,000 Granite Staters could lose their health care, 572,000 Granite Staters could lose their pre-existing conditions protections, and 57,000 Granite Staters could lose their access to health care through Medicaid. And make no mistake: Donald Trump and the Republican ticket are coming for your care.
Alex, we both know that Amy Coney Barrett is a reliable vote to overturn the Affordable Care Act. But we can’t give up hope, we must keep fighting. The fight to protect and expand access to affordable health care doesn’t end on Election Day, and it won't end with this Supreme Court case — meaning it’s more critical than ever that we elect leaders who will fight for health care, no matter what. Can we count on you to chip in today to help us elect Democrats up and down the ballot who will go to bat to protect our health care?
There are now just 5 days left to give it all we’ve got to elect Joe Biden, put Dan Feltes in the corner office, send Jeanne Shaheen, Annie Kuster, and Chris Pappas back to Congress, and protect and expand our State House, Senate, and Executive Council majorities — so chip in today to help elect health care champions who will bring the fight to Donald Trump and the Republican health care repeal agenda.

Ray

"Health care, reproductive rights...
Alex,
Senate confirmation hearings for Amy Coney Barrett wrapped up this week, and make no mistake: there couldn’t be more on the line.
Judge Barrett is a critical part of Trump and his New Hampshire Republican allies’ latest scheme to strip health care and reproductive rights from hundreds of thousands of Granite Staters, and we must fight back — will you join us by chipping in today?
AMY CONEY BARRETT:
🚨 Is a reliable vote to overturn the Affordable Care Act
🚨 Signed a statement calling Roe v. Wade “barbaric”
🚨 Poses a threat to the rights of LGBTQ+ Granite Staters
🚨 Was hand-picked by the extreme right-wing Federalist Society
The Supreme Court hears the Republican lawsuit to gut the Affordable Care Act just one week after Election Day, meaning health care is on the ballot.
And just this week, Trump said: ""I think depending on what happens with Roe V. Wade...perhaps it could get sent down to the states and the states would decide"" — so make no mistake, reproductive rights are on the ballot.
We’re fighting to elect Democrats up and down the ballot who will protect our health care and reproductive rights — because with the Affordable Care Act and Roe v. Wade more at risk than ever, Democratic state leaders are our strongest line of defense against Republicans' attacks on our rights.
DONATE WHATEVER YOU CAN
Alex, this is the fight of our life, and it means so much to have you with us. I know that if we stand together, we can do this — so join us in the fight by making a contribution today.
Standing with you always,

"Enough is enough.
Alex,
Granite Staters work too hard to go any longer without better wages, paid family and medical leave, and access to quality and affordable health care. Yet time and time again, Chris Sununu stands in the way of progress for New Hampshire’s working families. And enough is enough.
No New Hampshire governor has ever even come close to issuing the record number of vetoes Chris Sununu has, and Veto Override Day yesterday further highlighted how he’s failing Granite Staters in need.
He has BLOCKED reproductive health care access, BLOCKED a renewable energy economy, BLOCKED higher wages for working families, BLOCKED paid family and medical leave, BLOCKED worker protections for state employees, BLOCKED housing protections for renters and homeowners, BLOCKED independent redistricting, and more. Sununu is extreme, he's out-of-touch, and he needs to go so we can move our state forward.
CHIP IN NOW TO HELP KICK SUNUNU OUT OF OFFICE
Sununu is a self-described “Trump guy through and through.” He puts his corporate special interest donors first and Granite Staters last, and we won’t be able to put a stop to the Trump-Sununu agenda without your help.
Alex, so much is at stake this November: quality and affordable health care, good public schools, and an economy that works for every Granite Stater. We’ve got to do everything we can to defeat Chris Sununu and elect Dan Feltes, who will put New Hampshire workers and families first — and we need you with us.
There’s a lot of work to do in the next 47 days, but if we work together, we can get it done. Can we count on you to chip in today to help us Veto Sununu and elect a champion for working families this November?
LET'S VETO SUNUNU

"Alex,
Betsy DeVos's anti-public school agenda has been an unmitigated disaster. As Donald Trump's totally-unqualified Secretary of Education, she has undermined our public schools and tried to take away the rights of students at every turn.
And one of her biggest enablers? Chris Sununu.
Sununu is a self-described “enthusiastic supporter” of DeVos, and has been attacking public education since he entered the corner office. He’s tried to divert funding away from public schools towards wealthy private institutions, flat-funded New Hampshire's college and university system, and even nominated New Hampshire’s own version of DeVos as Education Commissioner.
Betsy DeVos and Donald Trump want to dismantle our public education system, and Chris Sununu is their Granite State rubber stamp. Sununu is even taking his cues on school reopening from DeVos and Trump, telling educators they are on their own.
We need your help to defeat Trump and make sure this is Sununu's last term as governor. Can you chip in today to help us win in November?
The Trump-Sununu-DeVos education agenda has always been wrong for New Hampshire, but the COVID-19 pandemic has shown just how important it is that our leaders have the best interests of students and educators at heart. It's more clear than ever before that Donald Trump and Chris Sununu are not those leaders.
Can we count on you to chip in today to help us elect leaders who will fight for students and schools?
Thank you,
Ray Buckley

"Take action today to help elect climate champions in November.
Alex,
50 years ago, we celebrated the first Earth Day. I was in the 5th grade and wrote about the evils of littering and the need for recycling for a class assignment. Simpler times...
Over the past 50 years, the need to take action to protect our environment has grown more urgent with every passing day, every bit of warming, and every foot of sea level rise.
But as Democrats have worked to meet the climate crisis head on and ensure future generations can enjoy the great outdoors — Republicans from Donald Trump to Chris Sununu have continued to deny the science of climate change and prioritize the profits of polluters and dirty energy corporations over necessary action on climate.
We can vote out climate change deniers and send their anti-environment agenda packing, but we need your help.
#### \--->> Chip in today to help elect Democrats up and down the ballot who will work to protect the environment and our public health.
Even as coronavirus and the deadly respiratory disease it causes grips the country, the Trump administration is actively weakening restrictions on air pollution — a move that could increase the fatality rate of the virus. We can’t give him four more years to continue rolling back the environmental protections that ensure clean air and water.
Even as New Hampshire’s landscape is being drastically impacted by the changing climate and record breaking temperatures — threatening our environment and economy — Chris Sununu vetoed virtually every clean energy bill that came to his desk. We can’t give him another two years to stand in the way of New Hampshire’s transition to a clean energy economy.
Although Earth Day looks a little different than usual this year, the call to action has never been more clear: it is critical that we elect climate champions in November who will fight for clean air and water, protect our natural environment and public lands, and promote clean energy. This action simply cannot wait. Help fund our organizing efforts by making a donation today!
Thanks for your support — and here's to a greener future for everyone,

"The countdown to Election Day 2020 begins.
Alex,
Everything we’re fighting for is on the line in November. From raising the minimum wage, guaranteeing paid family leave, and making health care more affordable, to taking action on climate change, fighting for racial justice, protecting a woman’s right to choose, and making sure Donald Trump doesn’t get to make any more Supreme Court appointments – the stakes could not be higher.
CONTRIBUTE TO OUR ELECTION EFFORTS TODAY
This year, we have the chance to take back the White House, flip the U.S. Senate, and replace Trump-aligned leaders like Chris Sununu with Democrats who will fight for every Granite Stater. But we can only do it if everyone does their part.
Today marks 5 months until Election Day, and we’ve set a goal of raising $5,000 by midnight to fuel our organizing team and send Republicans from Donald Trump to Chris Sununu a message: your time putting corporate special interests above the people of New Hampshire is up.
If you want to see progress in our state and our country, chip in now to help us raise $5,000 for our voter outreach program by midnight. Your donation will help us spread our message even further and earn every vote so we can win in November.

"Quadruple your impact — become a weekly donor.
Alex,
You’ve heard it before: the path to winning the White House and flipping the Senate runs through New Hampshire — and protecting the health care of millions of Americans runs through New Hampshire, too.
In 2016, Senator Maggie Hassan won her election by just 1,017 votes. Those 1,017 votes allowed Democrats to save the Affordable Care Act, protect health care for millions of Americans, and defend pre-existing conditions protections for hundreds of thousands of Granite Staters. No less is at stake this year.
Right now, we’re four weeks out from Election Day. And one week after Election Day — in five weeks — the Supreme Court will hear Donald Trump’s lawsuit to overturn the Affordable Care Act. From health care to reproductive rights, so much is riding on the outcome of this election. We’re entering the sprint to the finish line, and every dollar we raise now will make a critical difference in this fight. So we’re asking you: can you commit today to making a weekly donation through Election Day?
FOUR WEEKS, FOUR CONTRIBUTIONS
This election isn’t just happening in four weeks, it’s happening now — ballots have officially dropped in New Hampshire, which means that Granite Staters are already voting and we have limited time to finish making our case to every last persuadable voter. So don’t wait: turn your support into action today. Your weekly dollars allow us to plan out the final stretch now — knowing what money is coming in — and every contribution truly adds up.
COMMIT TO A WEEKLY DONATION THROUGH ELECTION DAY
Alex, we're so grateful that you’re on our team. Grassroots donors like you are who fuel this fight, and with just 4 weeks left, your support will make a direct impact on our campaign. Click here to increase your impact by committing to a weekly recurring donation of whatever you can give.

"Joe Biden is our nominee for president, and he's fighting for our health care.
Big news, Alex: Joe Biden is officially our Democratic nominee for President of the United States!
At the Democratic National Convention last night, we made it official, nominating Joe Biden to take on Donald Trump and WIN on November 3rd.
And what critical timing – because today, we got the news that the Supreme Court will hear arguments on the lawsuit to overturn the Affordable Care Act starting November 10th. One week AFTER the election. Health care is truly on the ballot, and we need your help to defeat Donald Trump, protect the Affordable Care Act, and elect a leader who will fight for all of us.
Pitch in whatever you can right now to make sure we can win big on November 3rd.
Now more than ever, it’s clear that the stakes of the 2020 election couldn’t be higher. Donald Trump and Republicans in Washington have been trying time and time again to strip hardworking families of their health care coverage – and if we don’t stop them on November 3rd, the future of the Affordable Care Act and the care of millions is in jeopardy.
Donate to our election fund.
Over the next 76 days, we’re going to leave it all out on the field and win the most important election of our lifetimes, but we can’t do this without you. Winning in November is going to take all of us coming together to fight for our shared values – and if we all do our part, we will take back the White House and elect Democrats all the way down the ticket.
Contribute right away.
Thank you for helping us meet the urgency of this moment.
Standing with you,
Ray

"Sign up to be a Ballot Inspector today.
Hello!
I am the General Counsel for the Biden Campaign and a native Granite Stater. I grew up appreciating the significance of our first in the nation primary, and the opportunity it afforded to meet presidential candidates every four years. It taught me to value and take seriously not just our individual civic obligation to vote, but our collective civic obligation to run safe and accessible elections. That is why I am reaching out to you today.
Specifically, I am writing to ask you to become a Ballot Inspector. Ballot Inspectors (also known as Ballot Clerks) are the essential link between election administrators and voters — ensuring that votes are issued, cast, and counted. They are community members who serve in one of the many roles needed at the polls, including: marking the checklist, handing out ballots, helping voters in need at the ballot booths, receiving ballots at the box, and more. Ballot Inspectors serve for all state and local elections during a two-year term (starting in August 2020), and come with a small monetary stipend for your service.
This role is particularly important this election season. In recent elections across the United States, we have seen the pandemic exacerbating problems with long lines, changing polling locations, and insufficient poll workers. In fact, many jurisdictions are consolidating polling places because they are having difficulty recruiting volunteers to work at polling locations. We need to proactively address these issues in NH so that we are ready for November’s election. Becoming a Ballot Inspector (also known as a Ballot Clerks) is a critical way in which you can help do this--ensuring that every Granite Staters’ right to vote is protected. Ballot Inspectors are the first people readily available to stand-up for voters at the polls on Election Day.
Do your part to protect democracy. Sign up to be a Ballot Inspector here, before the July 15 deadline.
Best,
Dana

"500 hours to defeat Donald Trump.
Alex,
My name is Erin, and I’m the Senior Political Advisor at the New Hampshire Democratic Party! I’m reaching out because now more than ever, we need you on our team.
Three weeks, 21 days, 500 hours. That’s how much time is left for Granite Staters to get out and vote this year — and to help decide what path our state, and our nation are headed toward. People across New Hampshire are already voting every day — so from here on out, it’s Get Out The Vote, all the time! Have you signed up for a GOTV shift yet?
With only three weekends remaining until Election Day on November 3rd, we’re counting on dedicated supporters like you to help us reach hundreds of thousands of voters to make sure they know how to vote, when to vote, where to vote, and why it’s so important that they vote BLUE this year!
SIGN UP TO GET INVOLVED TODAY
Getting out the vote for Democrats in New Hampshire is easy and fun! But even more importantly, the actions you take over the next three weeks will have a direct impact on our ability to make real change.
With your help, we can put leaders like Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in the White House who have a real plan to get this virus under control, protect and expand access to health care, and build our economy back stronger to ensure it works for all of us — not just big corporations and those at the top. I’m fighting every day to create a future we can all be proud of, and I hope you’ll join me over these final three weeks.

Volunteers aren’t just the heart and soul of our grassroots campaign to win back the White House and the governor’s office, re-elect Jeanne Shaheen, Annie Kuster, and Chris Pappas, and protect our legislative majorities — they’re the ones who are going to make all the difference. There’s so much at stake, there’s so much to do — and we need your help!

"Do you have a plan to support your local Democrats?
Friend,
On Tuesday, March 10th, Granite Staters in over 200 towns across New Hampshire will have the chance to vote for incredible Democrats in their Town Meeting Day elections!
Democrats at the local level are running for Selectmen, Supervisors of the Checklist, Moderators, and other important positions because they are invested in their communities and know how to solve local issues that make a profound impact on our daily lives. They are fierce advocates for funding public schools, demanding environmental protections, and ensuring their towns are safe and welcoming places that reflect New Hampshire’s values.
Electing Democrats at this coming Tuesday’s Town Meeting Day will continue the momentum we’ve been building that will lead us to victory on November 3rd, 2020. This momentum will help us beat Donald Trump who has broken every promise he made to Granite Staters. It will allow us to beat Chris Sununu, who has denied Granite Staters a livable wage, paid family leave, and common sense gun safety laws – just so he can help his special interest donors.
And, this momentum will ensure we re-elect our Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Congresswoman Kuster, Congressman Pappas, and expand our majorities in the State House and on the Executive Council.
Make sure you know where to vote on Town Meeting Day!
All the best,
Raymond Buckley, Chair

### Special Election Alert!
On Tuesday, March 10th, Hooksett residents will also have a chance to vote for Kathleen Martins for State Representative! Polls are open from 6:00 AM - 7:00 PM at the David R. Cawley Middle School (89 Whitehall Road).
Kathleen is a longtime Hooksett resident and educator who will strengthen our public schools, increase access to affordable health care, and lower property taxes. She is running against extremist Free Stater, Elliot Axelman, who’s said he wants to abolish Medicare, criminalize abortion, and has advocated that New Hampshire should secede from the U.S.
Click here to learn more about the candidates in this special election!
### At the New Hampshire Democratic Party
The progress we’ve made as Democrats in this state couldn’t have happened without leaders like Kathy Sullivan. Kathy’s legacy is a successful and professional New Hampshire Democratic Party and the preservation of the first-in-the-nation presidential primary. The victories Democrats have celebrated over the past 22 years have been nothing less than astounding due in large part to Kathy Sullivan’s skill and determination. Every progressive in New Hampshire owes a debt of gratitude to Kathy Sullivan.
Save the Date for the 9th Annual Snowflake Reception with Senator Jeanne Shaheen
Join us for the most exciting event of the season, Senator Shaheen's 9th Annual Snowflake Reception, on Friday, March 13th from 6:00-7:30pm at the Puritan Backroom Conference Center.
RSVP Here!
### In the State House
This week the State Senate...
* OVERRODE Chris Sununu's veto of Senate Bill 159 which will raise the cap on net metering, allowing for the growth of renewable energy projects across the state. This will help lower property taxes, combat climate change, and ensure the Granite State becomes more energy independent.
* PASSED Senate Bill 555 which would clarify coverage for telehealth and telemedicine services under the Medicaid program, further expanding access to health care for Granite Staters, specifically in rural areas of the state.
* PASSED Senate Bill 684 will re-institute federal reimbursement to school districts participating in the Medicaid to Schools program, which was in jeopardy because of the Sununu administration’s mismanagement of the program.
This week in the State Senate Finance Committee...
* Waves of Granite Staters TESTIFIED IN SUPPORT of Democrats’ paid family leave bill, House Bill 712, which would allow Granite Staters to take time off to care for a newborn or sick loved one without having to worry about missing a paycheck. At the hearing, Chris Sununu refused to answer questions about his half-baked scheme that completely misses the mark on what a good paid leave policy should be.
This week the State House...
* PASSED Senate Bill 7, the Secure Modern Accurate Registration Technology (SMART) Act which will establish automatic voter registration in New Hampshire, making voting more accessible for Granite Staters.
* PASSED House Bill 1629 which will address New Hampshire’s housing shortage and make housing more affordable.
### In Washington
Senator Shaheen confronted Education Secretary Betsy DeVos about the Trump administration’s scheme to end the Public Service Student Loan Forgiveness program which helps those who commit their careers to public service by promising to forgive their federal student loans after ten years. So far the administration has denied as many as 99% of borrowers’ claims for debt relief, and our Senator is working to hold the Department of Education accountable.
Senator Hassan introduced the Capital Investment Grant Program Improvement Act to help spur federal investment in passenger rail from Boston to Nashua and Manchester. The bill would increase funding for the federal Capital Investment Grant program and prioritize projects connecting smaller cities to existing passenger rail in larger cities, making it easier for New Hampshire to secure the grant funding to move forward with passenger rail.
Congresswoman Kuster discussed her new bipartisan bill, the Humane Correctional Health Care Act at a hearing in the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health. Kuster’s bill would improve access to treatment and health care services for individuals involved in the criminal justice system by repealing the Medicaid Inmate Exclusion which strips health coverage from Medicaid enrollees involved in the criminal justice system.
Congressman Pappas introduced a bill with Congresswoman Kuster which would provide a grant for American Job Centers across the country to create childcare programs, helping American families access career and employment services.

"Listen to this clip of hris Sununu...
Alex,
After a radio host noted New Hampshire is about to be the center of the political universe with our primary just around the corner, Chris Sununu really showed his true colors by responding, ""I'm a Sununu. I thought I was the center of the political universe."" Listen to the clip here.
Sununu smugly laughing about the power his family name has given him is an important reminder that his track record of putting himself and his special interests first comes at the expense of working people. From his refusal to give Granite Staters a living wage to auctioning off his veto of the paid family leave bill, it's clear Sununu is more interested in how he can personally benefit from his position than he is in helping those who need it most.
It's time to kick Silver Spoonunu out, and replace him with a governor who will fight for all of us. Help us make it happen -- make a donation now to help us build a movement to boot him out of office in November.
DONATE NOW
Let's take back the corner office,

Friend,
Thank you to everyone who bought a ticket for tonight’s Eleanor Roosevelt Gala!
Although tonight's celebration will be different from years past, I’m so excited to come together virtually one last time with supporters from across the state as we get ready for the election that is just 18 days away.
I'm so excited to see Senator Shaheen, Senator Hassan, Congresswoman Kuster, Congressman Pappas, and other incredible New Hampshire Democratic leaders — along with our friend and neighboring Senator, Ed Markey.
And I am thrilled that we will be honoring Kathy Sullivan for her years of service to her community, the Democratic Party, and New Hampshire. Her tireless work and dedication to fighting for Democratic values have made New Hampshire a better place to work, live, and grow — and our party is better because of her leadership.

* Bill Bolton, District 2
* Jenn Alford-Teaster, District 8
* Sen. Shannon Chandley, District 11
* Sen. Melanie Levesque, District 12
* Sen. Jon Morgan, District 23
Tonight, these amazing current and former Democratic legislators are being honored at the Eleanor Roosevelt Gala for the work they do to improve the lives of Granite Staters:
### Updates from Our Federal Delegation
Senator Shaheen and Senator Hassan announced this week that they will vote no on Trump’s Supreme Court nomination of Amy Coney Barrett. They believe Trump and Mitch McConnell should not be ramming through a nomination while Americans are voting, and they are standing up for Granite Staters' reproductive rights and access to affordable health care.
Senator Shaheen was endorsed by 217 Granite State veterans this week who highlighted her bipartisan efforts to make a difference for New Hampshire veterans and expand veterans’ health care access. Shaheen worked to ensure veterans could get health care closer to home, and her provision to renew and expand community care for veterans living in states like New Hampshire without a full-service VA was signed into law.
Senator Hassan spoke with industry experts about how federal COVID-19 relief is helping fund projects to expand broadband internet across New Hampshire to support telehealth, remote learning, and working from home.
Congresswoman Kuster visited the Claremont Fire Department, The Ink Factory, and Claremont MakerSpace to talk about their COVID-19 operations and how she can continue to support them in Washington.
Congressman Pappas joined State Senator David Watters and local leaders in Dover to discuss the need for investments in infrastructure. Congressman Pappas co-sponsored legislation to increase federal funding to meet our state’s urgent transportation needs by 30% and invest in broadband and other key areas.

"This year’s anniversary of the Voting Rights Act reminds us how much is at stake.
Friend,
Yesterday marked the 55th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act, a monumental piece of legislation in the fight to protect access to the ballot box for every eligible voter. In celebration, we joined the Ambassador and former U.S. Senator Carol Moseley Braun, State Senator Melanie Levesque, and civic groups across the Granite State for a virtual Voter Information Town Hall. There’s nothing more important to our democracy than protecting the right to vote, and we must make sure every eligible voter can safely exercise their right to vote this fall.
Here in New Hampshire, Republicans have been following their party’s lead and doing everything they can to rig elections in their favor through voter suppression. From SB 3 to HB 1264, Sununu and his State House Republican accomplices have attacked the constitutionally protected right to vote. Sununu has vetoed common-sense, bipartisan legislation to institute election reform and fair redistricting. It is shameful, undemocratic, and emulates the dismantling of the Voting Rights Act by Republican-appointed conservative judges across the country.
Yet despite Republicans’ best efforts to gerrymander our districts and disenfranchise young voters, New Hampshire Democrats have fought back and won, time and time again — and we’re going to win big again on November 3rd.
The election happening in 88 days is the most important of my lifetime, and the stakes are even higher given the challenges posed by COVID-19. We believe that no one should have to choose between protecting their health and safety and exercising their right to vote, so it’s important for every single eligible Granite Stater to know that they can vote by absentee ballot if they are concerned about COVID-19.
In honor of the Voting Rights Act and the fight to protect access to the ballot box for every voter, we’ll be working every day to ensure every eligible Granite Stater can cast their vote. On November 3rd, we’re going to elect Joe Biden, re-elect Jeanne Shaheen, and flip the Senate blue – so that we can finally pass the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act and reauthorize protections for every single American voter.
Learn how to get your absentee ballot and help us win here
All the best,
Raymond Buckley, Chair

### In the State House
This week:
* Chris Sununu vetoed House Bill 685 sponsored by Senator Cindy Rosenwald. This bill would have required insurance plans which cover maternity benefits to provide coverage for abortion services.
* Chris Sununu vetoed House Bill 687, sponsored by Representative Deborah Altschiller. This bill would have allowed concerned family members and law enforcement to ask the courts for assistance in protecting someone who has access to a firearm and whose behaviors demonstrate that they are a danger to themselves or others.
* House Bill 1245 sponsored by Senator David Watters was signed into law. This bill raises the age for the purchase and possession of tobacco to 21, which will help keep young people in New Hampshire away from harmful tobacco products.

Senator Shaheen is supporting legislation that ensures that even if students are not on campus this fall, colleges and universities would still have to share resources to help them register to vote, request absentee ballots, and exercise their different options to vote depending on their preference and eligibility.
Senator Hassan pushed for additional funding for schools in the next COVID-19 relief package as teachers, parents, and students prepare for the upcoming school year. Hassan also discussed the importance of additional funding to expand broadband access in order to support the remote learning needs of students and teachers in rural areas in New Hampshire and across the country.
Congresswoman Kuster co-sponsored the Great American Outdoors Act which was signed into law this week and will permanently fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund and support conservation efforts so we can continue to enjoy public lands in New Hampshire.
Congressman Pappas spoke at a press conference with Manchester Mayor Joyce Craig, State Senator and Vice-Chair of Southern New Hampshire Services Lou D’Allesandro, and Co-Owner and CEO of 360 Intel Tyler Goodwin to discuss how Manchester has been affected by the lost revenue and budget shortfalls due to COVID-19. Pappas is fighting for Congress’ next COVID-19 relief package to provide flexible relief funding directly to local governments and support small businesses.

"Looking for ways to stay connected to the causes you care about?
Alex,
Many aspects of our daily lives are changing as we continue to do what we can to stop the spread of the coronavirus and keep our friends, family, and neighbors safe and healthy. Social distancing, cancelling community events, and staying inside are essential to flatten the curve — which is why Democratic candidates across the state have cancelled fundraising events and rallies, local Democratic committees have cancelled their community meetings or moved them remote, and face-to-face conversations with our fellow New Hampshire voters are on hold.
But there's a lot we can still do from home! We can reach out to our neighbors to see what they need, we can turn our regular check-in texts to friends and family into phone calls or video chats, we can see what the needs of our community are and find ways to pitch in, and we can donate to local organizations that are in critical need of support. AND - we can stay involved in the causes and campaigns that matter most to us!
As we continue to do our part to flatten the curve, here are 8 ways you can campaign from home to help elect Democrats in November and make lasting change in our state.
## Sign up for a training!
Next week, we're hosting the FIRST in our new series of virtual Tuesday Trainings to help you stay involved while you're staying home. The first training this Tuesday, March 31st at 4PM is called ""Sharpening Your Grassroots Communications Tools"" and will focus on:
* Writing great letters to the editor
* Using social media effectively
Sign up for this Tuesday's webinar, and stay tuned for more in the coming weeks!
## Write a letter
Write a letter to the editor about something you're passionate about! You can write to:
* Support the work our Democratic leaders are doing to help Granite Staters during this crisis
* Support the ACA, paid leave, or no-excuse absentee voting
* Support Democratic candidates
If you need help getting started, email us here!
## Use social media
Social media is an important way to stay connected, stay engaged, and take action while in-person activism is on hold. You can use social media to:
* Share all of the good work Dems are doing to help NH, like this!
* Share why you support certain policies, like this!
* Hold Republicans accountable when they fail to act in the best interests of NH, like this!
## Read up on candidates
There are amazing candidates running for Governor, Executive Council, State Senate, and State House — and our members of Congress are up for re-election! Take this time to read about the candidates running to represent you, and consider joining their campaigns by signing up to volunteer or making a donation!
## Make sure you're registered to vote
The November election is likely to be the most important election of our lifetimes. Go to [[URL REDACTED]] to confirm you're registered to vote! After you're done, text or call five friends to make sure they're registered too — and that they're committed to voting for Democrats up and down the ballot in November!
## Sign up to volunteer
Winning in November is going to take all hands on deck! Can you believe we're only 7 months away from Election Day? If we can count on you to join a phone bank, help organize your neighbors, or Get Out The Vote, let us know here.
## Share your ACA Story
The need for quality, affordable health care has never been more apparent. But Trump and Republicans continue to double down on their efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and leave millions without health care. Share your story here or on social media with the hashtag #MyACAStory about what the ACA has done for you, and why we need to elect leaders who will fight to protect and expand health care — not to take it away.
## Complete the census
While you're at home practicing social distancing, you can fill out your 2020 Census! It only takes 10 minutes, and it ensures your community is represented and gets the resources it needs. Make your voice heard, and get counted!
Alex, The actions we take now will go a long way to ensuring we elect leaders in November who will fight for us. SO: show your support for our Democratic representatives and those running for office, continue to push for policies like paid family and medical leave, no-excuse absentee voting, and affordable health care, and most importantly — take care of yourself, and let’s continue to do what we can to support one another during this challenging time.
Thank you for all you do!
All the best,
-Your NHDP Staff: Amy, Chloe, Chris, Donnie, Gates, Holly, Jack, Josh, Kelsey, Lavanya, Mariam, Michael, Savannah, and Slate

"Do you have a plan to vote?
Friend,
When we go to the polls in 18 days to cast our votes for the candidate we want to be the next president of the United States, we want to make sure we go with the right information about how to vote.
Republicans like Donald Trump and Chris Sununu know that Granite Staters are excited to vote against them and for Democrats who will make health care more affordable, protect a woman’s right to choose, and safeguard our environment. That’s why these Republicans have made it their mission to spread disinformation about voting in New Hampshire and enact laws that put an unnecessary financial burden on voters, especially young people.
To ensure New Hampshire voters have everything they need to know about voting when they go to the polls, we've launched a guide to voting in the First in the Nation Primary. If you or someone you know have questions about whether you can register to vote in New Hampshire or if you need to find your polling place and the hours it will be open on Election Day, our guide can answer those questions and more, so that you’re ready to vote in the Democratic primary on February 11th.
Click here to read and share our voting guide!
All the best,

### At the New Hampshire Democratic Party
This Saturday at 10:00 am, Democrats from across New Hampshire will participate in 22 pre-primary delegate selection caucuses to elect the district-level delegates to the 2020 Democratic National Committee Convention in Milwaukee.
A historic number of Granite Staters filed to run for delegate this year – 382 in total – representing 11 different presidential campaigns and beating the previous 2004 record. Delegate candidates hail from 130 communities across the state and all ten counties, and of the 382 delegate candidates, 85 are young people, 65 are LGBTQ+, 4 identify as non-binary, 29 are persons with disabilities, 16 are Asian American and Pacific Islander, 13 are Latino and Hispanic, 11 are African American, and 5 are Native American.
Being a delegate is an incredible opportunity to work and organize alongside party leaders, activists, and fellow Democrats to help shape our message and build a plan for victory in the November elections. We’re excited to see so many voters and activists step up and run for delegate.

### In the State House
This week, Senate Democrats introduced six bills to lower prescription drug costs.
* Senate Bill 685 would make certain drugs from Canada available to the state, insurers, pharmacies, and prescribers, helping New Hampshire residents access medications at a lower cost.
* Senate Bill 686 would increase the oversight of pharmacy benefit managers to prevent cost increases throughout the supply chain.
* Senate Bill 687 would create a drug affordability board to bridge the gap between those working on the inside of price development and health care professionals.
* Senate Bill 688 would hold drug manufacturers accountable by combating price gouging by drug manufacturers and wholesalers, which makes essential medications unaffordable.
* Senate Bill 689 would protect a patient’s right to choose their pharmacy and prevent pharmacy managers or insurers from steering patients to their own pharmacies for their financial gain.
* Senate Bill 690 would prohibit insurers from removing drugs from a list of prescribed medications and replacing them with more expensive drugs, forcing families to pay more out of pocket.
### In Washington
Senator Shaheen led Senator Hassan, Congresswoman Kuster, and Congressman Pappas in a letter to urge President Trump to include funding for the State Opioid Response grant program in his budget proposal for fiscal year 2021. The grant program has been a critical tool for New Hampshire and other states on the frontlines of the substance use disorder crisis.

"Have you filled out your Census?
Friend,
Every 10 years, we have the chance to help determine how much funding our state receives for our schools, health care clinics, and police and fire departments, and to ensure we have fair elections and political representation – by completing the Census! The Census counts every person living in the United States, and those population counts help decide how taxpayer dollars come back to our communities.
An accurate and complete Census helps our state fund critically important programs that improve the lives of all Granite Staters. For example, in 2016, New Hampshire received more than $3 billion from federal spending programs guided by data from the 2010 Census. This funding supported Medicaid, Medicare, the National School Lunch Program, Unemployment Insurance, and more. The 2020 Census will help to distribute billions of dollars in federal resources to our communities over the next decade.
Not only does the Census ensure we can fund programs that many Granite Staters rely on, but it also directly impacts our political representation. The Census determines how many seats we get in the House of Representatives, how many Electoral College votes our state will receive, and how our State House, Senate, and Executive Council districts are drawn. After the last Census, many of our districts were drawn to unfairly favor Republicans. But this year, we have a chance to help ensure more accurate representation for all of our communities!
Filling out the Census only takes five minutes and will help us continue to turn New Hampshire blue. Make your voice heard, and get counted!
Complete the Census online here!
All the best,
Raymond Buckley, Chair

The New Hampshire Democratic Party's Voter Protection Team has launched a new website — [[URL REDACTED]] — to ensure Granite Staters have up-to-date and accurate information on how to vote in New Hampshire. This new website is part of our stepped-up efforts to keep Granite Staters informed about voting, especially as some processes are adapted to protect the health and safety of voters during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Check out our website here!

We hope you will share this great new resource with your friends, family, and community members so that every eligible Granite Stater has the information they need to safely exercise their right to vote in the elections this fall. This site will be updated regularly as new guidelines are released from the state, so be sure to check back often!
### In the State House
This week, Senator Martha Fuller Clark announced that after 30 years, she is retiring from the State House. In a statement, Senator Fuller Clark said, “Thank you for your support and kindness over the years, sending me back to Concord year after year where I have tried to represent you and your interests to the best of my abilities. It has truly been an honor and a privilege for me to serve on your behalf, first as a member of the NH House for 12 years and then as a member of NH Senate for an additional 12 years. I will miss you and miss speaking up for you in Concord.”
Read more about Senator Fuller Clark's announcement here
On Tuesday, Republican State Representatives voted to shut down the State House for the rest of the year and not conduct legislative business to help Granite Staters struggling during the COVID-19 pandemic. In a statement, House Speaker Steve Shurtleff said, “The action today also prevents the House from acting on bills that address the COVID pandemic, naming a highway after a police officer killed in the line of duty and from finishing the rest of the work Granite Staters elected us to complete.”
Read the full statement here
The filing period to run for state office starts next week on June 3rd - 12th. These past few months have shown the importance of having strong leaders in all corners of government.

### Updates from Washington
Senator Shaheen delivered a $1 million Economic Development Administration grant to Rockingham County that will sustain hundreds of jobs and generate $15 million in private investment through a revolving loan program for businesses. The Trump administration has tried to cut this program in the past, but Senator Shaheen stopped them, and now this grant will make a real difference for small businesses and the local economy.
Senator Hassan led her colleagues in calling on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to issue specific guidelines for when long-term care facilities can safely reopen their doors to visitors, and what steps long-term care facilities should take to ensure the safety of residents and family members when they do so.
Congresswoman Kuster introduced a bill that would ensure National Guard members receive benefits for their service while allowing governors to extend National Guard deployments through the duration of the COVID-19 public health emergency so they can continue to support our communities.
Congressman Pappas called on Congress to pass the bipartisan Paycheck Protection Program Flexibility Act, a bill he cosponsored which will make the Payroll Protection Program (PPP) more effective for Granite State small businesses.

"With your support, we'll win big next year.
Alex, 2019 has been a big year.
The victories we've won have inspired us to keep going. The battles we've faced have motivated us to do everything we can to make sure we send a Democrat to the White House next year, and re-elect Senator Shaheen, Rep. Kuster, and Rep. Pappas. And the vetoes we've opposed have shown us the importance of kicking Sununu out of the corner office and protecting and growing our majorities in the legislature.
From the dozens of bills the legislature passed to improve the lives of Granite Staters, to the more than 20 Democratic presidential candidates we've welcomed to our state and whose campaigns have put in thousands of hours mobilizing voters, to the municipal elections, where Democrats won more than 76% of the races in which they competed – momentum is building in the Granite State.
We’re proud of what New Hampshire Democrats have been able to accomplish this year, and if we keep up the momentum, strategize, and continue working hard, we’ll take back our government next year and build a brighter future for all.
Before we close the books on 2019 tonight, can we count on you to donate $20.20 to help us head into next year strong? We’re only $3,917.52 short of our end-of-year grassroots fundraising goal, and if just 200 people donate right now, we’ll easily make it across the finish line.
MAKE YOUR END-OF-YEAR CONTRIBUTION NOW
We’re thankful to have you on our team, and with your support, we look forward to winning big next year.
Together we can,

"Now’s your big chance!
Dear friend,
Every four years, Democrats from across the state have the chance to partake in the historic process of voting for the nominees for president and vice president, adopting a national party platform, and hearing from national leaders at the Democratic National Committee Convention.
Every convention has been unique in its own way – whether it was my first convention in 1980 at Madison Square Garden, the 2008 convention where we nominated the first African American presidential nominee, or 2016, when we again made history by voting for the first woman to ever secure a major U.S. party’s nomination. This year will also be historic in its own right. We will come together and reaffirm our commitment to making health care accessible and affordable, creating an economy that works for everyone, protecting a woman’s right to choose, and defeating Donald Trump.
Being a delegate is an incredible opportunity to work and organize alongside party leaders, activists, and fellow Democrats to help shape our message and build a plan for victory in the November elections. Anyone can run for delegate, and the majority of those who go to the convention are first time delegates. We encourage everyone to participate in this process — because it’s important that New Hampshire’s delegates are reflective of the party as a whole.
If you are interested in becoming a delegate, you can start by downloading this form, and reaching out to the campaign of the candidate you support to let them know you’re running to represent them at the DNC. We’re so excited to begin this process with you.

### In the State House
This week, Senator Jay Kahn and Representative Dave Luneau announced legislation that will fully restore the Medicaid to School program after nearly $29 million in federal Medicaid reimbursement to New Hampshire public schools was left in limbo under Governor Sununu.
The legislation will restore Medicaid payments for health care services provided in schools, help schools stay on budget, reduce the local tax burden, and make sure students get the mental and physical health services they depend on.
### In Washington
Senator Shaheen introduced a bipartisan bill to fix an unfair measure in President Trump's tax law, which has led to unfair taxes on water infrastructure projects in New Hampshire and could hurt Granite State communities by disincentivizing investment in water infrastructure and community development. Shaheen’s bipartisan legislation will restore the tax-exempt status for contributions to these projects.
Senator Hassan sent a letter to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights urging it to support the repeal of a discriminatory policy that allows employers to pay sub-minimum wages to employees who experience disabilities. Under Hassan’s leadership as governor, New Hampshire became the first state in the nation to outlaw this practice.
Congresswoman Kuster joined her colleagues on the Energy and Commerce Committee to discuss how the Food and Drug Administration can ensure that cosmetic and personal care products are safe.
Congressman Pappas led efforts to save $40 million of New Hampshire's federal highway funding, ensuring that our state gets the resources it needs to improve our infrastructure and support local businesses and jobs.

Friend,
What a week it’s been!
I first want to congratulate Bernie Sanders on a well-run presidential campaign, and in particular congratulate his supporters for their dedication and hard work throughout the First in the Nation Primary and beyond. Right now, his supporters should take a moment to feel proud of their grassroots campaign.
And in the coming days, it will be time for all of us to get to work together and continue our shared fight to make health care more affordable, raise the minimum wage, and address climate change. Together, we will take back the governor's office, re-elect Senator Shaheen, Congresswoman Kuster, and Congressman Pappas, expand our majorities in the State House, State Senate, and Executive Council, and restore responsibility in the White House by electing our presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, Joe Biden.
Joe has spent his career fighting for workers and middle class families – working with President Obama to bring our country out of the Great Recession. He’s taken on the NRA, and has been a driving force to protect and expand quality, affordable health care coverage for millions of Americans.
We have the chance to end Donald Trump’s disastrous presidency in November – but only if we work together.
Sign up here to get to work.
All the best,
Raymond Buckley, Chair
New Hampshire Democratic Party
P.S. I wanted to make sure you saw this important op-ed from Rep. Marjorie Smith this week - discussing how Chris Sununu violated the New Hampshire constitution by creating an unaccountable new bureaucracy to disburse the $1.25 billion in coronavirus relief aid - without oversight or checks and balances.
Read the op-ed here
### At the New Hampshire Democratic Party
In 2017, Chris Sununu and New Hampshire Republicans took their voter suppression scheme to the next level — passing restrictive voting laws like SB 3 that added confusing and burdensome steps to the voting process. For the last three years, the New Hampshire Democratic Party and other voting rights organizations have been in court defending the right of all eligible voters in New Hampshire to cast a ballot, and standing up against Chris Sununu and the Republican Party’s voter suppression agenda. And yesterday, we won.
While this ruling is a significant step forward, there is still more work to do to make sure all eligible Granite Staters have the right to vote in the critical elections this fall, and to educate and mobilize voters to get to the polls.
Read about the lawsuit here
Many aspects of our daily lives are changing as we continue to do what we can to stop the spread of the coronavirus and keep our friends, family, and neighbors safe and healthy. Social distancing, cancelling community events, and staying inside are essential to flatten the curve — which is why Democratic candidates across the state have cancelled fundraising events and rallies, local Democratic committees have cancelled their community meetings or moved them to virtual meetings, and face-to-face conversations with our fellow New Hampshire voters are on hold.
During this time, there's a lot we can still do from home! As we continue to do our part to flatten the curve, check out these 10 things you can do from home to help elect Democrats in November and make lasting change in our state.
10 Ways to Take Action from Home
To prioritize the health and safety of Granite Staters, the NHDP Executive Committee voted unanimously to adapt the State Committee meeting on April 25 and our May 9 State Convention to virtual meetings. If you are a State Committee member or a Convention Delegate, you should have received an email this week with details about our virtual events! Please reach out to [[URL REDACTED]] if you did not receive the email.
### Highlighting the Helpers
This section will celebrate the work of individuals across the state who are making a difference in their community. If you know someone who should be featured, you can send us a note.
This Week's Helper Highlight:
In Nashua, State Representative Latha Mangipudi is working with a group of over 50 community members, calling themselves the “maskateers,” to make and donate cloth masks for healthcare workers all over the region. So far, they have made nearly 1,000 masks for staff at hospitals, nursing care facilities, and the correctional facility. As the demand for masks grows, Rep. Mangipudi welcomes anyone who wants to help. You can click here to get involved!
### In the State House
This week, our Democratic House and Senate leaders sent a letter to Governor Sununu calling on him to ensure that Granite Staters who receive treatment for the coronavirus from a doctor or hospital that would otherwise be considered ""out-of-network"" by their insurance company will not face surprise billing.

The filing period to run for state office is fast approaching and runs from June 3rd - 12th. This past month has shown the importance of having strong leaders in all corners of government.

### In Washington
Senator Shaheen and Senator Hassan called on the Trump administration to open a health care special enrollment period so that un- and under-insured Granite Staters can access health care coverage under the Affordable Care Act. Allowing Americans to enroll through a unique Special Enrollment Period lasting throughout the duration of the pandemic would ensure millions of families have comprehensive health care coverage to financially protect themselves from COVID-related illness.
Congresswoman Kuster helped introduce the Coronavirus Community Relief Act which will provide $250 billion in stabilization funds for communities that are struggling amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.
Congressman Pappas led a group of 62 bipartisan lawmakers in calling on the House leadership to make local chambers of commerce eligible for direct federal assistance as they work to support New Hampshire's main street economy.

"11 Days until the New Hampshire Primary!
Friend,
With the 2020 election just 10 months away and the New Hampshire Primary right around the corner, it is becoming increasingly important to remain vigilant against online disinformation. Spreading disinformation through social media is a strategy our foreign adversaries used in 2016 and 2018 to sow division and mislead voters. It's clear these nefarious tactics are already ramping up again for the 2020 election cycle, and we are committed to ensuring it won’t hinder the success of Democrats up and down the ballot.
But we can’t do it alone, which is why we put together a guide to identifying and combating disinformation for you to use and share with friends, family, and co-workers. Stopping the spread of disinformation online is going to play a huge role in ensuring we defeat Donald Trump, Chris Sununu, and Republicans in New Hampshire — and elect Democrats up and down the ticket in November.
View and share our guide to combating online disinformation

### In Washington
Senator Shaheen led a letter with our federal delegation calling on President Trump to increase, and not cut, funding for the Meals on Wheels Program. Shaheen noted that the Meals on Wheels has become strained for resources in parts of New Hampshire due to their efforts to provide meals for the 30,000 Granite Staters who depend on the program for nutritious food, yet the Trump Administration proposed slashing its funding.
Senator Hassan co-sponsored legislation to ensure houses of worship and nonprofits in small states like New Hampshire would be eligible for grant funding that can be used to enhance their security and protect against foreign and domestic terrorist threats. The President signed this legislation into law this week.
Congresswoman Kuster helped pass the Temporary Reauthorization and Study of the Emergency Scheduling of Fentanyl Analogues Act. This legislation will extend the emergency designation of fentanyl-laced narcotics past February 6, 2020 which is when it was set to expire. This extension will ensure that law enforcement can continue to fight the proliferation of fentanyl-laced narcotics in communities in New Hampshire and across the country.
Congressman Pappas introduced the Connecting America’s Active Transportation System Act which provides a $500 million federal grant to help build connected, active-transportation routes like trails, sidewalks, and bikeways that support the health and economic growth of our communities.

"And we are ready to work together
Friend,
On Tuesday we made history with our incredible Democratic turnout, with our record absentee voting, and by nominating not just our female majority congressional delegation, but female majorities for executive council and state senate as well. Democrats are certainly doing our part to break that glass ceiling! And we have nominated more young people, more people of color, and more LGBTQ+ candidates than ever before.
I want to thank every single candidate who stepped up to run for office — you make our state and our party stronger. With the primary in the rearview mirror, on Thursday we celebrated our Democratic ticket at our United for Victory 2020 event where we heard from our incredible nominees. In these next 53 days, we’re going to work harder than ever before to elect them and Democrats up and down the ballot. Granite State Democrats are ready to stand together and win.
We’re ready to re-elect Senator Shaheen, Congresswoman Kuster, and Congressman Pappas, elect Dan Feltes, and hold and expand our majorities in the state legislature and on the Executive Council — and we are ready to restore the soul of our nation by sending Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to the White House.
Help us win in 53 days
I also wanted to take a moment and reflect on today, which marks nineteen years since September 11th. No matter how much time passes, the images of sacrifices made by first responders, firefighters, and everyday Americans are ones we’ll never forget. During one of the darkest days in our nation’s history, they didn’t hesitate to do everything they could to help their fellow citizens — their bravery, selflessness, and courage are forever ingrained in the minds of Americans. Today, we are mourning those who we lost, we’re honoring their legacy and memory, and we’re promising to never forget.
All the best,
Raymond Buckley, Chair
New Hampshire Democratic Party

### Updates from Our Federal Delegation
Senator Shaheen made history on Tuesday when she received over 140,000 votes, the most votes in a New Hampshire state primary ever! Shaheen has been leading bipartisan efforts to provide Granite Staters with relief from the COVID-19 crisis, combat the opioid crisis, protect women’s reproductive rights, and make health care more affordable for all Granite Staters. It’s clear New Hampshire voters are ready to re-elect her in November.
Senator Hassan received support from The American Legion and Veterans of Foreign Wars for her bipartisan legislation that will ensure that Social Security, Veterans Affairs, and Supplemental Security Income beneficiaries will automatically receive any future COVID-19 stimulus payments.
Congresswoman Kuster co-sponsored several bills that were approved by the Energy and Commerce Committee, including the State Opioid Response Grant Authorization Act that will provide $1.5 billion annually to help treatment providers, first responders, and families facing the challenge of addiction.
Congressman Pappas welcomed the arrival of $82,000 in federal support for the Manchester Police Department that will help improve mental health and wellness services for law enforcement and fund suicide prevention programs. Pappas is leafing the fight in Congress for increased funding to state and local governments - including local police departments.

"In November, we need to win up and down the ballot
Friend,
As the excitement of the First in the Nation primary subsides, it’s time to shift our focus back to winning our state and local elections. Ensuring we have Democratic victories up and down the ballot in November has never been more important - Democrats in Concord and Washington are holding the line against Republican attacks on our health care, women’s reproductive rights, and the environment.
That’s why we have to fight hard to expand our majorities in the State House, re-elect our Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Congresswoman Kuster, and Congressman Pappas, and vote Chris Sununu out of office.
We can, and will be successful in November if we come together and engage voters through grassroots activism in our communities - knocking on doors, making phone calls, and writing letters to the editor. Let’s get to work.
Click here to support Democrats up and down the ticket.
All the best,

### In the State House
This week, in the Senate:
* Senator Cindy Rosenwald introduced Senate Bill 486 to require private insurance and plans on the health insurance marketplace cover abortion if the plans also cover prenatal care.
* Senator Martha Fuller Clark introduced Senate Bill 508 which would end the statute of limitations for civil action based on a sexual assault and allow an action at any time.
* Senator Martha Hennessey introduced Senate Bill 679 which would require all college campuses to adopt new policies on reporting and counseling on sexual assault, coordinate services with local crisis centers, and administer an anonymous statewide survey to students to document sexual assault, violence, and stalking.
* Senator David Watters introduced Senate Bill 591 which would establish a statewide solid waste disposal reduction goal and Senate Bill 629 which would charge a $1.50-per-ton surcharge on all waste, and then rebate the money to municipalities to help their solid waste programs.
This week, Democrats in the House:
* PASSED House Bill 1218 which will expand net metering in New Hampshire to bring clean, affordable energy to Granite Staters.
* PASSED House Bill 1281 which would require insurance coverage for EpiPens, making this life-saving medicine more accessible for New Hampshire families.

* PASSED Senate Bill 684 will re-institute federal reimbursement to school districts participating in the Medicaid to Schools program, which was in jeopardy because of the Sununu administration’s mismanagement of the program.
### In Washington
Senators Shaheen and Hassan have long championed women's reproductive rights, and this week they teamed up to denounce the draconian, anti-women legislation that has been introduced in the U.S. Senate and the NH Legislature that would send doctors to prison for performing abortions. Shaheen and Hassan were unequivocal in their condemnation of these bills and vowed to fight to protect women's health care, no matter what.
Congresswoman Kuster led a group of her colleagues in urging the owner of Tinder, Hinge, OkCupid, and Plenty of Fish to check the users of their dating services against sex-offender registries — a crucial step in keeping Americans safe and preventing sexual violence.
Congressman Pappas has been a leader for lowering the cost of prescription drugs. This week he met with constituents and Protect Our Care in Rye to hear personal stories from Granite Staters about their experiences dealing with the high cost of prescription drugs and the need for better access to quality, affordable health care.

"This is a huge win for Democrats.
Friend,
The Secretary of State's office released the updated voter registration numbers from the First in the Nation primary, and the results are a huge win for New Hampshire Democrats. The raw numbers are: 324,593 registered Democrats, 306,542 registered Republicans, and 387,648 registered Undeclared (""Independents"").
For the first time in 10 years, there are now more registered Democrats than Republicans in New Hampshire, and Democrats have the most registered members of a political party ever in our state.
Before the primary, we set out with a goal to flip the voter registration edge Republicans have held in our state for a decade – and we did it! – thanks to all of the grassroots organizing and outreach by Granite Staters like you leading up to the primary.
This new voter registration edge is a declaration that we are ready to come together and defeat Donald Trump and Chris Sununu who have left a trail of broken promises in our state. It’s a declaration that no matter who wins the presidential nomination in July, we will be united in our efforts to send them to the White House. It’s a declaration that we are going to support Democrats up and down the New Hampshire ticket. And, it’s a declaration that we are ready to win in November.
Sign up to get involved!

### In the State House
This week in the State Senate...
* Senate Majority Leader Dan Feltes, Sen. Tom Sherman, and Sen. Cindy Rosenwald, sent a letter to Gov. Chris Sununu requesting an update on any preparedness plans his administration is undertaking for the potential spread of the coronavirus, following the CDC’s urging that United States businesses, hospitals, and communities begin preparing for the possible spread of the virus.
This week in the State House...
* Representative Megan Murray introduced House Bill 1633, which would require more insurance coverage for tick-borne disease testing – focusing on more than just Lyme disease.
This week in House committees...
* The House Committee on Education voted against House Bill 1251, a discriminatory bill which would have banned transgender students from playing on teams of their self-identified gender.
* The House Transportation Committee voted in favor of House Bill 1622 which would require adult drivers and passengers to wear seatbelts. This law would significantly reduce fatalities in New Hampshire which is the only state that does not require adults riding in the front seat to wear seatbelts.
### In Washington
Senator Shaheen condemned Republican efforts to pass radically restrictive anti-abortion legislation on the Senate floor, calling out state and congressional Republicans for pushing forward extreme anti-choice bills that would in some cases criminalize abortions and put doctors in jail. These bills would infringe on women’s constitutionally-protected rights and are part of a broader campaign by Republicans to overturn Roe v. Wade.
Senator Hassan introduced a bipartisan bill to support innovative startups in New Hampshire and across the country by establishing a competitive grant program for incubator networks. Incubators help startups by providing resources such as low-cost space, access to capital, business counseling, and mentorship opportunities during their early stages of development.
Congresswoman Kuster has been a strong advocate for commuter rail in New Hampshire. This week in Nashua, she unveiled her bipartisan legislation, the Invest in American Railroads Act. The bill would help New Hampshire pay for the Capitol Corridor Project to connect Manchester and Nashua to Boston via commuter rail, which would boost New Hampshire’s economy, and expand and connect our technology industries in Nashua and Manchester.
Congressman Pappas secured the commitment of the Department of Veterans Affairs Secretary to resolve issues with community care networks, which has led to New Hampshire health care providers having $134 million in unpaid claims. Pappas has been working on this issue as Chair of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee of the House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, and has made it a priority to bring everyone to the table to fix the system.

"Alex,
I just wanted to reach out to see how you're holding up during this tough time. This email isn't about politics — I just wanted to take a minute to let you know that we're here and we care about you, and share some incredible New Hampshire organizations that could use your help.
At the core of what we do here at the New Hampshire Democratic Party is a deep and genuine commitment to helping our neighbors, taking care of those who are vulnerable, and making our corner of the world a little better. In times of crisis, this mission is more important than ever.
Right now, there is an abundance of need in our state. Many service industry workers are out of a job and missing paychecks, school closures mean many children are missing their free school lunch and busy parents are taking on teaching duties, families are struggling with childcare options, first responders, frontline health care workers, and hospitals need supplies... It can all feel pretty scary and overwhelming, but I find comfort in doing a bit of good, and it's been truly heartwarming to see the way Granite Staters have already stepped up to meet the needs of their communities.
If you have the means, below are a few community organizations that could use your help during this difficult time. And remember: wash your hands thoroughly and regularly, practice social distancing to help flatten the curve, follow CDC and Health Department guidelines for staying safe and healthy, and check in on those around you. Call a friend or family member, ask your neighbor if they need anything, and be extra kind to those who are still providing essential services to your community. We will get through this together.
In solidarity,
Raymond Buckley, Chair
New Hampshire Democratic Party

"We’re looking forward to seeing you!
Friend,
I am so excited for this year's first-of-its-kind virtual New Hampshire Democratic Party State Convention – kicking off LIVE tomorrow at 10AM! Though we can’t meet in person, tomorrow we will come together virtually, celebrate the work Democrats in New Hampshire are doing, and gear up for what will be the most important election of our lives in just 6 short months.
It's sure to be an exciting event that you won't want to miss! Click here to join us.
And, I cannot wait to have Stacey Abrams – a leading advocate for voting rights – join us to kick off the Convention. After witnessing the gross mismanagement of the 2018 election by the Georgia Secretary of State’s office, Leader Abrams launched Fair Fight to ensure every American has a voice in our election system through programs such as Fair Fight 2020, an initiative to support and train voter protection teams in 18 battleground states, including New Hampshire.
New Hampshire is expected to be one of the closest battleground states in 2020. With a competitive presidential race in addition to tight races for the U.S. Senate, governor, and Congress, Donald Trump and his allies have made New Hampshire a top 2020 target after losing to Hillary Clinton in 2016 by just a few thousand votes. Not only is New Hampshire a top Republican target, Chris Sununu and Donald Trump have fought hard to restrict the right to vote and rig elections to help the Republican Party, their special interest donors, and themselves.
We are working every day to fight back against the Trump-Sununu voter suppression agenda by making sure all eligible Granite Staters have the right to vote, because we know how much is at stake this year – from health care, to the environment, to women's rights, and more.
That's why we're continuing to get together - virtually - to do everything we can to elect Joe Biden, re-elect Senator Shaheen, Congresswoman Kuster, and Congressman Pappas, put a Democrat in the corner office, and grow our majorities in the legislature and on the Executive Council.
We’ll see you tomorrow!

### In the State House
* We are grateful to Senator Hennessey for her service and for her hard work for the people of New Hampshire's fifth district. During her tenure Senator Hennessey has accomplished so much for Granite Staters, from improving access to mental health care, to expanding rights for transgender Granite Staters, to protecting reproductive rights for women. We thank her for her incredible service to the state, and we wish her the best.
* The filing period to run for state office is fast approaching and runs from June 3rd - 12th. This past month has shown the importance of having strong leaders in all corners of government.

### Updates from Washington
Senator Shaheen introduced a bill to expand national service programs as New Hampshire and the United States work to respond to and recover from COVID-19. The Pandemic Response and Opportunity Through National Service Act would fund 750,000 national service positions over a three-year response and recovery period, in part to meet the projected need for as many as 300,000 public health workers.
Senator Hassan led her colleagues in calling for greater support for students who experience disabilities in upcoming COVID-19 response legislation. The funding would give school districts more resources to continue to provide students who experience disabilities with a free and appropriate public education as required under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA).
Congresswoman Kuster introduced legislation to provide $25,000 in either student loan debt relief or education benefits to essential workers and their family members. The bill recognizes the contributions made by firefighters and first responders, health care providers, grocery store employees, transportation workers, and more, to help Americans through the COVID-19 health emergency.
Congressman Pappas introduced bipartisan legislation to ensure local chambers of commerce and other nonprofits who support small businesses can receive the federal assistance they need to weather this economic downturn while they continue working to help America’s Main Street businesses.

"We have four days. Let's make them count.
Friend,
Four years of hard work electing Democrats and fighting for affordable health care, women's reproductive rights, and protections for our environment have come down to this. I’m so grateful for everything you’ve done to get us here today, but there is still more work to do! We need to finish strong and spend the next four days making sure that everyone we know has a plan to vote.
Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, there are more ways for you to vote this year, and the good news is voting in New Hampshire has never been easier:
* You can request your ballot, fill it out, and return it, all in one trip to your town or city clerk’s office. Find your clerk’s office and the hours they’re open here.
* As always, you can register and vote in person on Election Day at your local polling place. Find your polling place and learn more about voting on November 3rd here.
* And, if you have already received your absentee ballot in the mail and still need to return it, we recommend that you hand-deliver it directly to your clerk’s office as soon as possible. All absentee ballots must be received by 5:00 pm on Election Day. Learn how to prepare your absentee ballot for return here.
If you or anyone you know has any questions about how to vote, call our voter assistance hotline at 603-466-8683, or visit [[URL REDACTED]] Voting is easier than ever this year. And the stakes have never been higher.
We need you with us over these last four days as we talk to every voter in New Hampshire to convey the power of their vote and ensure everyone has a plan to cast their ballot by November 3rd. Don't wake up on November 4th wishing you had done more. Join us by volunteering this weekend, and let's win this together.

"And carrying their memory and legacy with us.
Friend,
I hope you’re staying safe and healthy during these challenging times.
In just a few days, our country will observe Memorial Day and honor those who have made the ultimate sacrifice for our nation. From Lexington and Concord to Afghanistan, Granite Staters have always been among the first to volunteer. We have a proud tradition of community and self-sacrifice. Each of us owes a debt of gratitude to those who served the nation but never came home. Our respect and admiration have no bounds for their willingness to give their lives for our country.
I’ve seen the sacrifices of our men and women in uniform firsthand. For nearly three decades I served as an F-15 pilot in the U.S. Air Force. I fought in combat in the Middle East during Desert Storm, and I served as the U.S. Ambassador to Saudi Arabia during the Obama administration. I’m reminded of the bravery of those I served with every day, many of whom have called New Hampshire home and some who never were able to make it back.
The memories of a lifetime came rushing back last December when I joined the many volunteers and Veterans groups who laid wreaths at the New Hampshire Veterans Cemetery. There, in perfect symmetry, was the last roll call of those who had served and those who gave their last measure of devotion. The experience caused me to pause and remember those of many wars whose lives were cut short too soon.
Every day, I remember that the sacrifice our service members made is why we have the many freedoms we enjoy today. On Monday, as a nation, we will honor their bravery, we will ensure their memory lives on, and we will carry their legacy with us as we work together in the hopes of a better future for our country.
All the best,
Ambassador Jim Smith

"And they’re already getting to work for you.
Dear friend,
Our Democratic State Senators and Representatives jump-started the 2020 legislative session this week by passing bills that will keep families safe from gun violence, ensure no Granite Stater has to choose between caring for a newborn or dying loved one and missing a paycheck, and defend our right to vote.
While our Democrats in the State House are working on achieving legislative goals that improve the lives of Granite Staters by raising the minimum wage, creating an economy that works for everyone, protecting our environment, and supporting our public school system, Chris Sununu and New Hampshire Republicans are actively working against the interests of the voters.
This year, they’ve proposed draconian abortion bans, phony environmental bills that prevent New Hampshire’s renewable energy economy from growing to its full potential, and more pieces of legislation that mirror a Republican agenda designed to solely benefit special interests, corporations, and the top one percent.
That’s why it is critical that we support our State Senators and Representatives, and Democrats up and down the ticket in 2020, so we can continue to push New Hampshire forward.
Sign up here to learn how you can support Democrats through Letters-to-the-Editor, on social media, and more.
All the best,
Raymond Buckley, Chair
New Hampshire Democratic Party

GET 100 CLUB TICKETS HERE
### In the State House
This week, Democrats in the House passed:
* House Bill 687 which empowers families and law enforcement to work with the courts to prevent a crisis involving firearms from escalating to a fatal tragedy.
* House Bill 690 which repealed Sununu’s illegal and regressive work requirement for health care that has cost the state millions of dollars.
* House Bill 712, the paid family and medical leave bill which ensures families don’t have to choose between taking care of a newborn or a sick or dying loved one and getting their paycheck.
* House Bill 731 which will gradually increase the state’s minimum wage from the outdated $7.25.
* Senate Bill 8 which establishes an independent redistricting commission to eliminate gerrymandering and ensure that every vote is counted.
* Senate Bill 122 which invests in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), a regional plan to implement a flexible, market-based program to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
* Senate Bill 124 which updates our renewable energy portfolio standards by 2040.
This week, Democrats in the Senate passed:
* Senate Bill 13 which boosts net metered projects from 1 MW to 5MW allowing communities, school districts, and businesses to generate their own power while investing in their community.
* Senate Bill 248 which increases the age for sales and possession of tobacco and vaping products from 19 to 21.
* Senate Bill 287 which requires the Commissioner of the Department of Environmental Services to bolster PFAS regulation standards to improve the safety and quality of our drinking water.
### In Washington
Senator Shaheen announced her support for the United States - Mexico - Canada Agreement this week, joining Senator Hassan, Congresswoman Kuster, and Congressman Pappas. The USMCA will make improvements to the The North American Free Trade Agreement that will help empower Granite State businesses while protecting American workers and safeguarding our environment.
Senator Hassan joined in introducing a bipartisan bill to help students in rural areas reach their higher education goals and connect them with employment opportunities in their hometowns. This bill would help create additional jobs and economic opportunities in rural towns across New Hampshire and the country.
Congresswoman Kuster joined Granite State Progress and Riverbend Community Mental Health to discuss the Lower Drug Costs Now Act, and how the $10 billion of funding will go to fighting the opioid epidemic and making life-saving prescription drugs more affordable.
Congressman Pappas authored a bipartisan amendment in the PFAS Action Act, which passed the House this week. His amendment will set proactive limits for PFAS discharge, hold polluters accountable, and provide impacted communities across New Hampshire with the resources they need address contamination.

"Celebrating moments of unity and community
Friend,
Last weekend, we made history by being the first state party in the nation to hold our scheduled State Convention virtually and live. More than 3,000 Granite Staters tuned in during the hour and a half-long event and thousands of additional Granite Staters have been watching and sharing the video since it aired! In this challenging time, it was wonderful to come together – even virtually – to share moments of community, see some familiar faces, and recommit to the important work we have ahead of us in the leadup to November’s election.
If you missed the 2020 NHDP State Convention, watch the full program on Facebook or watch the individual speakers' videos on our website.
And this Saturday, May 16th at 8 pm, tune in for another historic first – a national, virtual graduation celebration with a Commencement Address from President Barack Obama, put on by #GraduateTogether2020 \- an organization that is celebrating the hard work and achievements of millions of high school seniors, their teachers, and their families.
The Class of 2020 has taken the challenges they’ve faced in the COVID-19 era in stride and will be remembered for how they handled this generation-defining crisis: with courage, conviction, and compassion.
I could not think of a better person to give the Commencement Address for the Class of 2020 than President Obama, who led our country out of dark times with the promise of hope and unity. Today, though we find ourselves in dark times again, made worse by Donald Trump’s chaotic and unprepared response to the coronavirus crisis, I know that there is a bright future ahead – not just for the Class of 2020, but for our nation.
Celebrate the Class of 2020 with President Barack Obama!
All the best,
Raymond Buckley, Chair
New Hampshire Democratic Party

### In the State House
Senate President Donna Soucy and House Speaker Steve Shurtleff announced that the House and Senate will be returning to legislative session in the beginning of June. To ensure legislators are able to continue practicing safe, social distancing, the Senate will meet in Representatives Hall in Concord, and the House will meet in the Whittemore Center at the University of New Hampshire. Until then, Committee and Commission meetings will continue remotely. Read more about the back to session plans here.
House Democrats wrote a letter to Governor Sununu, imploring him to issue a temporary face-covering order, so New Hampshire can continue to flatten the curve and safely move toward reopening efforts in the future. Read the letter here.
The filing period to run for state office is fast approaching and runs from June 3rd - 12th. These past few months have shown the importance of having strong leaders in all corners of government.

### A Note to Our Federal Delegation
We are so grateful to Senator Shaheen, Senator Hassan, Congresswoman Kuster, and Congressman Pappas for continuing to deliver urgent relief and resources to Granite Staters, our front-line workers, hospitals, and small businesses. This week, they announced that New Hampshire will be receiving $61 million for COVID-19 testing and contact tracing which are essential to protecting public health and gradually re-opening our economy. The funding will support the purchasing of testing kits and supplies, and the expansion of contact tracing in the weeks and months ahead – which will help mitigate the spread of this virus. We sincerely thank our federal delegation for everything they are doing to fight for us.

"We celebrate, we remember, and we continue to move forward.
Friend,
Today we acknowledge Juneteenth, the holiday marking when news that slavery had been abolished reached Galveston, Texas two years after the Emancipation Proclamation.
Today, we must also remember that our fight for equality and justice for Black Americans is far from over. The unfortunate reality is that systemic racism is still a part of daily American life. Across New Hampshire and across the nation, we have watched as systemic racism has led to the death and disenfranchisement of Black Americans. Police brutality is systemic racism. Voter suppression is systemic racism. The pay gap is systemic racism. Lack of affordable housing is systemic racism.
That’s why together we are marching, we are speaking up, and we are working to put a stop to the generations of systemic racism. We all must commit to doing our part - even when it’s uncomfortable or hard - to end discrimination, bigotry, and racism in our communities, our state, and our country.
This Juneteenth we celebrate, we remember, and we continue to move forward. We join together to say that Black lives matter, and we will continue to honor that statement as we work together to reshape our country. Today, tomorrow, this year, and for years to come we will recognize Juneteenth and recognize the contributions Black Americans have made and will continue to make to our history, to our culture, and to our country.
Watch the NHDP African American Caucus commemorative Juneteenth video here
All the best,
Hon. Ray Buckley, NHDP chair
Sen. Melanie Levesque, NHDP African American Caucus co-chair
Hon. Jackie K. Weatherspoon, NHDP African American Caucus co-chair
### At the New Hampshire Democratic Party
The 2020 election is going to be the most important in our lifetimes. With so much at stake – from health care to the environment to education – we are doing everything we can to make sure all eligible Granite Staters have the information they need to vote, and vote safely. We believe that when more people vote, democracy wins!
This week, we launched our new voter information hotline - 603-GO-N-VOTE (603-466-8683) \- to answer Granite Staters’ questions about voting ahead of the September primary and November general election.
This hotline is monitored 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and live assistance will be available Monday through Friday 9AM-6PM. If you have any questions about voting, requesting your absentee ballot, registering to vote, and more — don't hesitate to pick up the phone and give us a call! We would love to help you make a plan to vote today.
Our Voter Protection Team has also set up an incredibly helpful website — [[URL REDACTED]] — to ensure Granite Staters have up-to-date and accurate information on how to vote in New Hampshire this year, especially in light of COVID-19.

### Updates from the State House
In the State Senate this week, Democrats advanced legislation to improve the lives of Granite Staters by:
* Re-establishing and raising the minimum wage,
* Increasing police accountability and improving bail reform,
* Lowering health care and prescription drug costs,
* Requiring commercial insurance plans, including Affordable Care Act plans, to cover abortion care if they also cover maternity benefits,
* Providing COVID-19 relief including expanded paid leave and free testing,
* Expanding telehealth services in New Hampshire so Granite Staters have increased access to health care,
* And more!
Last week’s historic candidate filing period ended with more than 400 Democratic State Representative candidates filing to run for over 380 House seats statewide. It is a testament to their commitment to public service that so many Granite Staters are stepping up to do this important work, even during these challenging and unprecedented times.
### Updates from Our Federal Delegation
Senator Shaheen introduced legislation to provide a second round of relief to small businesses that have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. This legislation prioritizes smaller businesses, particularly those in the restaurant and hospitality industries, which have been hit especially hard in recent months. Senator Shaheen continues to advocate for New Hampshire’s small businesses to ensure they’re getting the relief they need from the Federal government.
Senator Hassan led a Senate Finance Paid Leave Working Group roundtable where she advocated for Americans’ access to paid leave so no one has to choose between a paycheck and their own health.
Congresswoman Kuster introduced the bipartisan RESTAURANTS Act to provide a lifeline to the restaurant industry and support New Hampshire restaurant owners and employees who have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Congressman Pappas, who is a co-sponsor of the Equality Act which would amend the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to explicitly prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, applauded the Supreme Court ruling this week that said LGBTQ+ individuals cannot be discriminated against in the workplace.

"Are you ready to join us for this historic week?
Friend,
I am so excited for next week’s Democratic National Convention! While this year’s Democratic Convention will be different than previous years, we’re excited to bring the virtual convention home - to Granite Staters’ living rooms - where more people can participate than ever before and hear Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and our Democratic candidates’ vision for fighting for people all across New Hampshire.
This year, our local convention theme is “Bringing It Home!” because – in addition to the all-virtual convention being quite literally brought to every Granite Staters' living room – so much about this election hits close to home to us. From Joe Biden's robust economic recovery plan to Democrats' dedication to raising wages and protecting the Affordable Care Act, this convention will highlight how Democrats up and down the ticket will deliver on the issues that matter to us – while Donald Trump and Republicans like Chris Sununu who support him push an agenda that leaves the middle class and working families behind.
We’re also going to spend convention week making sure every Granite Stater concerned about COVID-19 knows they can vote from home this year! And, our grassroots organizing operation is firing on all cylinders to bring this election home for Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Senator Shaheen, Congresswoman Kuster, Congressman Pappas, and every New Hampshire Democrat.
We are fired up and ready for this year's Democratic National Convention, and we hope that you'll join us from home at one (or more!) of the 100 events across the state next week, from convention watch parties and phone banks to national constituency caucus events. It's sure to be a historic and exciting week!
Join us for the Democratic National Convention next week
All the best,
Raymond Buckley, Chair
New Hampshire Democratic Party
### At the New Hampshire Democratic Party
While this year’s Democratic National Convention Week will be celebrated from the comfort of our couches rather than gathering in Milwaukee or at big watch parties here in New Hampshire, we couldn’t be more excited to celebrate Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and every Democrat running for office this year.
Over the next week, we want to plaster social media with ""Let's Go Joe!"" messages to spread that enthusiasm to every Granite Stater – so we're launching a Social Media Challenge (with prizes!) to see who has the most Joe Biden spirit.

### In the State House
* House and Senate Finance Chairs Mary Jane Wallner and Lou D’Allesandro wrote a letter requesting a detailed proposal for the state to provide rapid testing for New Hampshire schools, which are set to start in just a few weeks. Rapid testing will ensure that there are limited school shutdowns and disruptions to our workforce as we navigate the COVID-19 crisis. Read their proposal here.
* On Thursday the Committee to Elect House Democrats hosted a virtual event with Mayor Pete Buttigieg and a dynamic panel of speakers from underrepresented communities including State Representatives Matt Wilhelm, Sue Mullen, Donovan Fenton and first-time house candidates Ben Ming, Carrie Duran, Sara Dillingham, and Ed Rajsteter who discussed the importance of stepping up and running for office.
### Updates from Our Federal Delegation
Senator Shaheen remains concerned about the Trump administration’s efforts to undermine and politicize the U.S. census, and this week she called on the Inspector General to investigate the administration for trying to rush the census and cut it early. Shaheen is demanding answers on the efforts of Trump and his allies to change the census schedule for political gain during the coronavirus pandemic, and will continue to hold them accountable.
Senator Hassan cosponsored legislation to return billions of dollars to Americans through a national, online “lost and found” website to track retirement accounts as people move between jobs. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Americans are especially concerned about their retirement savings, with one in five Americans now saying that they plan to retire later than they initially hoped.
Congresswoman Kuster held a virtual roundtable with New Hampshire college and university presidents to discuss campus testing strategies for COVID-19 and plans for reopening institutions for the upcoming fall semester.
Congressman Pappas introduced the Protect the Youth Vote Act which would strengthen voting rights and protections for young people by increasing transparency and more clearly defining actions that violate the Twenty-Sixth Amendment which prohibits state and federal governments from using age as a reason for denying the right to vote to U.S. citizens who are least 18.

"I see you, I hear you, I support you.
Friend,
In a dozen communities from Conway to Nashua, from Portsmouth to Keene, people are grabbing their masks and using their voices to demand an end to the systemic racism in our country. They are demanding that those who murdered George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, and too many others be held accountable, and they are demanding that all of us do more to ensure this never happens again. This has to end.
To people of color in our state and country: I see you, I hear you, I support you, and I stand with Black lives because they matter.
I stand in solidarity with all those across New Hampshire, in all 50 states, and in 18 countries who have marched and protested for justice this past week and will continue to in the weeks ahead, because we know how powerful we can be when we come together.
In fact, this Pride Month, we are reminded of how powerful a movement dedicated to change can be. The Stonewall Riots over the course of three nights were led by the powerful courage of a Black transgender woman, Marsha P. Johnson. It took decades of grassroots activism, protests, and policy changes pushed by the LGBTQ+ community to get to where we are now, but there is still work that remains - especially for LGBTQ+ people of color who continue to face significantly higher levels of inequality and discrimination. And to that point, I am profoundly angry over the constant murders of trans people of color and the silence that accompanies their violent deaths.
And despite the ever-present challenges communities of color and the LGBTQ+ community face, I remain hopeful that change will come. When Republicans like Chris Sununu and Matt Mowers remain silent as Donald Trump calls for violence against Americans, Granite Staters are saying enough is enough and demanding they speak out. When Republicans like Manchester Aldermen Joe Kelly Levasseur and Michael Porter use racial slurs and incite violence on social media, Granite Staters are saying enough is enough and calling for their resignation. When Trump supporters heckled a Democratic elected official and a local Republican Committee targeted LGBTQ+ Granite Staters with violence, Granite Staters are saying enough is enough.
It’s important to remember that while protests and vigils are one way to show up, it may not be an option for all given the current public health crisis, even though masks have been handed out at demonstrations and social distancing is encouraged. There are still many things you can do to do be part of the solution to ending systemic racism and police brutality in America.
Support leaders who will hold power to account, have difficult conversations about racism with the people in your lives, donate whatever money or time you have to support communities and people of color, and vote in November. We must not rest. We cannot stop. We have so much to do.
In solidarity,
Raymond Buckley, Chair

### Updates from Washington
Senator Shaheen officially filed for re-election to the U.S. Senate seat by mail and held a virtual rally with more than 100 supporters to discuss how she is working to make a difference for all Granite Staters during the Coronavirus pandemic and how our state can work together in the fight for racial justice. At her virtual rally, she discussed how tens of thousands of Granite Staters will likely be voting by mail this fall due to Coronavirus, and said she is working to make sure that everyone can participate in democracy while staying safe.
At a hearing this week, Senator Hassan highlighted the especially critical role the United States Postal Service is playing during the COVID-19 pandemic - helping Granite Staters, especially those in rural communities and those who experience mobility issues, get access to the supplies they need.
Congresswoman Kuster introduced the Coronavirus Vaccine Development Act to help ensure Americans – especially communities disproportionately affected by COVID-19 – won't face unnecessary delays or obstacles to getting vaccinated once a vaccine is available.
Congressman Pappas announced a new infrastructure package that will invest more than $1.3 billion in New Hampshire’s infrastructure. The INVEST in America Act includes key priorities that Pappas has championed to move New Hampshire’s economy forward, like a federal grant program that will build bike and pedestrian infrastructure and increased funding for New Start programs.

"Donald Trump is not welcome in New Hampshire
Friend,
Exactly one week ago, Donald Trump canceled what would have been a COVID-19 super spreader rally in Portsmouth because of anticipated low turnout. He said he would be back in the coming weeks, but given his massive unpopularity in New Hampshire due to his countless broken promises and failed response to the COVID-19 crisis, I don’t think Trump will be showing his face around the Granite State any time soon.
It was bad enough that Trump was planning to hold an unsafe rally that would invite out-of-staters to descend on New Hampshire as COVID-19 cases are spiking across the country, but it was absolutely despicable how Chris Sununu and New Hampshire Republicans were ready to welcome Trump into New Hampshire with open arms and refused to issue necessary public health orders to protect Granite Staters. This rally was the latest example of how Trump and Sununu are putting the health and safety of Granite Staters in jeopardy because of their partisan interests.
While New Hampshire Republicans showed they were willing to risk the lives of Granite Staters to appease Donald Trump, New Hampshire Democrats were a force to be reckoned with. They wrote letters, called their local elected officials, and made it loud and clear that Donald Trump’s hateful campaign would not be welcomed in the Granite State.
If Donald Trump comes back to New Hampshire, we’ll be ready to remind him and every other New Hampshire Republican that come November, we are going to kick them out of office, elect Joe Biden, re-elect Senator Shaheen, Congresswoman Kuster, Congressman Pappas, and support Democrats up and down the ticket.
If Trump comes back to New Hampshire, will you stand with us?
All the best,
Raymond Buckley, Chair
New Hampshire Democratic Party

### In the State House
Governor Sununu and his unqualified Education Commissioner Frank Edelblut released a sham plan to send New Hampshire’s students and teachers back to school in the fall that doesn’t come close to what we need to keep our students and teachers safe and healthy.
Representative Mel Myler, chair of the House Education Committee said, ""Today Governor Sununu failed the students and hard-working staff at New Hampshire [[URL REDACTED]] teachers and students deserve more than what they saw today.” Read Rep. Myler’s statement here.
This week a number of important bills spearheaded by Democrats were signed into law.
* House Bill 705 increases protections for survivors of sexual assault and gives our court system the necessary tools to process and deliver justice in cases of assault and abuse.
* House Bill 1645 will ban police use of chokeholds, expands bail reform, require reporting of officer misconduct, and establish a fund to ensure all law enforcement undergoes psychological screenings.
* House Bill 1280 will reduce the cost of insulin, require insurance coverage for epi-pens, and make prescription drugs more affordable.
* House Bill 1266 will help to simplify the absentee forms, add a “concern for COVID-19” excuse for absentee voting and registration and support local election officials by allowing more flexibility in processing and safe polling arrangement.
### Updates from Our Federal Delegation
Senator Shaheen launched her first TV ad this week! The ad focuses on Shaheen’s bipartisan efforts to secure a 10x increase in federal funding to help combat New Hampshire’s opioid crisis. It features Anne Marie Zanfagna, who began painting “Angels of Addictions” after losing her daughter, Jackie, to a heroin overdose. Shaheen has worked with Anne Marie and her husband Jim for years, advocating for additional federal resources to help New Hampshire weather the addiction epidemic, and has been incredibly moved by their story and service.
Senator Hassan, New Hampshire mayors, and municipal leaders discussed the need for additional COVID-19 funding to address revenue shortfalls that state and local governments are experiencing as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Congresswoman Kuster cosponsored the Scarlett’s Sunshine on Sudden Unexpected Death Act which was approved by the Energy and Commerce Committee this week. The bill would improve national guidelines and data consistency for sudden infant death and sudden unexpected death for children as well as offer support for affected families.
Congressman Pappas called on Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and IRS Commissioner Rettig to establish a pathway and timeline to ensure that widows and widowers receive their Economic Impact Payments as many New Hampshire seniors have been informed by the IRS that due to the passing of the spouse, their payments have been withheld.

"Did you hear the news?
Friend,
According to the official candidate filings and data just released this week, for the first time in Granite State history, Democrats have exceeded the number of Republican candidates running for office! Democrats are competing in 482 races, while Republicans only put up candidates for 459 races, which shows us the strong position Democrats are in as we head toward November.
We have a record-breaking 13 candidates running for the executive council, senate Democrats are competing in ALL 24 districts, and we have 425 candidates for over 391 state representative seats – including more than 200 women, 125 first-time candidates, 70 young Democrats, and many LGBTQ+ candidates and candidates of color. I could not be more excited to have such a dedicated and dynamic group of Granite Staters running up and down the ticket this year.
And for the first time in 10 years, according to the Secretary of State’s latest public update, there are now more registered Democrats than Republicans in New Hampshire! In fact, Democrats have the most registered members of any political party in our state’s history, with 323,430 registered Democrats compared to 301,720 registered Republicans.
This year’s registration sea change reflects voter sentiment in the state - with Independents and Republicans disillusionment with Donald Trump’s broken promises driving them to abandon their previous affiliation and join the Democratic Party. We have shown voters that we will work to make health care more affordable, to protect our environment, and to stand up for the rights of women, LGBTQ+ Americans, and underrepresented communities.
We have to continue our hard work every single day for the next 130 days to defeat Donald Trump, Chris Sununu, and New Hampshire Republicans, and protect and grow our Democratic majorities so we can continue fighting for all Granite Staters.
Chip in to help us win in November!
All the best,
Raymond Buckley, Chair

### At the New Hampshire Democratic Party
We’ve seen how the shortage of poll workers due to COVID-19 has impacted elections around the country, and we need to make sure that doesn’t happen here in New Hampshire. That’s why we need YOU to step up and help us make sure that our 2020 elections go off without a hitch by having Ballot Inspectors at every polling location in the state who will stand up for voters’ rights on Election Day!
Ballot Inspectors (also known as Ballot Clerks) are community members just like you who are interested in maintaining the integrity of our elections. As a Ballot Inspector, you would serve in one of the many roles needed at the polls – marking the checklist, handing out ballots, helping voters in need at the ballot booths, receiving ballots at the box, and more. Ballot Inspectors serve for two-year terms (starting in August 2020), for all state and local elections, and they receive a small monetary stipend for their service.
We need great Democrats like you in your community's polling locations to advocate for voters' rights. The deadline to be appointed as a Ballot Inspector is July 15th, click below to sign up and help keep our elections secure!
Be a Ballot Inspector and protect the right to vote

On Monday, June 29th at 11 am, Senate President Donna Soucy and Senator Martha Hennessy will speak at an online rally hosted by New Hampshire Moms Demand Action in support of State Representative Deborah Altschiller’s House Bill 687, which would strengthen New Hampshire’s gun safety laws.
Register here to attend the rally
This week, the New Hampshire Democratic Party launched the Must Resign Nine, a list of nine Republican legislators who have spouted racist and sexist comments, have run into problems with the law, have insulted and embarrassed their constituents, and have gotten away with it for too long.
Not only are these Republican legislators out of touch, but they’re completely out of bounds. It is past time for these nine to resign, and if they refuse, New Hampshire voters will hold them accountable in November.
Is your legislator on the list?
### Updates from Our Federal Delegation
Senator Shaheen and Senator Hassan helped introduce legislation requiring the Pentagon to remove all Confederate names, symbols, paraphernalia, or monuments within one year. As a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Shaheen successfully passed a bipartisan amendment to remove these Confederate figures in the annual defense bill, and she will continue to work across the aisle to rename our military installations.
Congresswoman Kuster introduced the Internet for All Act to help ensure New Hampshire students, teachers, and business owners have the high-speed internet connection they need, which has become crucial for those working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Congressman Pappas introduced bipartisan legislation to expand the federal tax deductions for charitable donations to support nonprofits that have been impacted by the decreased donations, fewer available volunteers, and canceled fundraisers in the wake of the coronavirus crisis.

"Help us win in November.
Friend,
Did you see this?
After seeing the substantial lead Joe Biden has over Donald Trump in New Hampshire, Republicans are afraid. But we can’t take anything for granted – in 2016, Donald Trump only lost New Hampshire by 2,700 votes. Trump’s campaign knows they need to win the Granite State this time – and we can’t let that happen. New Hampshire could be the only thing standing between Trump and the White House.
The coronavirus crisis has shown us what happens when someone like Donald Trump is in a position of power. Trump’s chaotic, unprepared response to this global pandemic has led to the deaths of more than 60,000 Americans, skyrocketing unemployment numbers, and over one million cases of coronavirus – which Trump thinks is “a great success.”
Despite the damage he’s inflicted on our country, Republicans like Chris Sununu and the Republican candidates for Congress and Senate continue to parrot Trump's dangerous debunked disinformation – equating COVID-19 with the flu, saying the virus was made in a Chinese lab, and promoting deadly ""treatments"".
Kicking Donald Trump and Chris Sununu out of office has never been more important for our country or our state. That’s why we’ve been building our grassroots network of activists and volunteers who will help us elect Joe Biden to the White House, re-elect our Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Congresswoman Annie Kuster, and Congressman Chris Pappas, and expand our majorities in the State House and Executive Council.
Help us make sure Trump doesn't win in November.
All the best,
Raymond Buckley, Chair
New Hampshire Democratic Party

Many aspects of our daily lives have changed as we all do what we can to stop the spread of the coronavirus and keep our friends, family, and neighbors safe and healthy. Social distancing, cancelling in-person gatherings, and staying home are essential to flatten the curve — but New Hampshire Democrats aren’t slowing down!
Instead, we’re finding ways to adapt, stay connected, and continue doing the work to make sure we elect Democrats up and down the ballot in November. Over the past month, hundreds of Granite State Democrats have joined virtual meetings and trainings, written letters to the editor, or taken other online action. We hope you’ll join us! To get started, read and share our list of 10 things you can do from home to help elect Democrats in November and make lasting change in our state.

### Highlighting the Helpers
This section will celebrate the work of individuals across the state who are making a difference in their community. If you know someone who should be featured, you can send us a note.
This Week's Helper Highlight:
Pelham resident Lisa Celata wanted a way to help those on the front lines of the coronavirus crisis. When she asked two relatives who work in hospitals what they needed the most to help them get through this crisis at work, they told her they need snacks! That’s when Lisa started Help Give Snacks and Comfort for Front Line Health Care Workers, a group where volunteers donate baskets of snacks to front line workers. So far the group has donated over 80 baskets to health care workers in New Hampshire and Massachusetts.

### In the State House
After our members of Congress secured $1.25 billion for New Hampshire in COVID-19 relief in the federal CARES Act, the New Hampshire Senate Democrats put forward a comprehensive proposal that ensures these funds are distributed in a fair and transparent way and that the relief gets to Granite Staters as quickly as possible.
The Granite Promise Proposal is based on public input and focuses on relief for individuals, families, small businesses, and nonprofits in New Hampshire and ensures that those who have been hit hardest by this crisis get the relief they need during these difficult and unprecedented times.
Read about The Granite Promise Proposal here
On Thursday, the New Hampshire House Finance Committee made history as the first policy committee of the New Hampshire House to meet remotely. To quote Finance Chair Mary Jane Wallner, “The public is counting on us to find a way to complete our work in a manner that is safe for everyone and we were happy to be able to do that today.”
The filing period to run for state office is fast approaching and runs from June 3rd - 12th. The last few months have shown the importance of having strong leaders in all corners of government.

### A Note to Our Federal Delegation
We are so grateful to Senator Shaheen, Senator Hassan, Congresswoman Kuster, and Congressman Pappas for continuing to deliver urgent resources to our front-line workers, hospitals, and small businesses. This week they announced that New Hampshire health care providers received the second batch of federal funding from the CARES Act, and they teamed up to call on the Trump administration to provide relief for the U.S. Postal Service, which is vital for Granite State seniors and small businesses. Additionally, Senator Shaheen announced that more than $70 million in loans to 5,500 New Hampshire small businesses have been approved through the Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) program that she helped negotiate. We sincerely thank our federal delegation for everything they are doing to fight for us.

"Let’s make this our most successful year yet
Dear friend,
The beginning of the new year is a time for us to set our goals and resolutions for the months ahead. If we build on the progress we made last year, we can make 2020 the year that Granite Staters earn a livable wage, can afford to take time off from work to care for a newborn or sick loved one, are able to afford a quality education, and have access to affordable health care.
But to see all of those goals come to fruition, we need to work every day to support and elect Democrats. That’s why my resolutions are to expand our majorities in the State House, re-elect our Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Congresswoman Kuster, and Congressman Pappas, and vote Chris Sununu and Donald Trump out of office.
As you make your own resolutions, I hope you will join me in working every day – whether by knocking on doors, making phone calls, or writing a letter to the editor – so we have Democratic victories up and down the ticket in November.
Start your resolution by donating to help us win in 2020.
P.S. We'll be rooting for a big win for the Patriots during tomorrow's Wild Card game. You know who won't be? Corky Messner, who's running against Senator Shaheen. More on that here.
All the best,
Raymond Buckley, Chair

Our Senators cosponsored this bipartisan legislation, the TRACED Act, to require phone companies to ensure that Granite Staters are not constantly bombarded by robo-callers, helping block these calls and strengthen enforcement tools against them.
Congresswoman Kuster and Congressman Pappas introduced the Stop Taxing Our Potential (STOP) Act to overturn the 2018 Supreme Court Wayfair decision which forces New Hampshire small businesses to collect online sales tax, placing a financial burden on small businesses. The STOP Act will protect New Hampshire’s economic competitiveness and support small businesses.

"Primary day is just 4 days away!
Friend,
Happy September! I can hardly believe it, but there are less than two months left until the 2020 election on November 3rd — and even closer is the state primary, just four days away on Tuesday, September 8th!
Though voting may look a little different this year because of COVID-19, it’s critical we all get out to vote, and that we do it safely. Every Granite Stater needs to make a plan to vote safely now — and if you have questions about voting this Tuesday, we’re here to answer them. Call our hotline at 603-466-8683 (603-GO-N-VOTE) to speak to a voter protection expert, or visit [[URL REDACTED]] to learn how you can vote safely in the primary and general election.
After we all vote this Tuesday, join us on Thursday, September 10th at 12 pm as we come together virtually to celebrate our incredible Democratic ticket. We’ll hear from Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Senator Maggie Hassan, Congresswoman Annie Kuster, Congressman Chris Pappas, both our gubernatorial candidates, our executive council and state senate nominees, and the House leadership about how we are all united and ready to support our Democratic ticket — because when we stand united, we win!
In closing and ahead of the upcoming Labor Day, I want to say that the cause of the labor movement is the cause of the Democratic Party. Support for American workers, their families, and their right to organize is the very core of what we do here at the NHDP. And with that, I wish you an enjoyable, safe, and restful Labor Day weekend.
Join us for our United for Victory 2020 event
All the best,
Raymond Buckley, Chair
New Hampshire Democratic Party
### At the New Hampshire Democratic Party
Voting this year could look a little different due to COVID-19, so we laid out some of the facts voters need to know to ensure their vote is counted.
* New Hampshire has same-day registration and voting, meaning that you can register AND vote on Election Day!
* Ballots must be received by 5 pm on Election Day if you are voting absentee. With just four days until Election Day, we recommend dropping your ballot off in person at your town or city clerk’s office. If your clerk’s office has a dropbox, it must be staffed when you drop your ballot there.
* If you’ve tracked your ballot and are worried it won’t be received by mail in time, you still have options! You can show up on Election Day to cast a new ballot instead, just make sure to let the poll workers know you sent your ballot but aren’t sure it was received on time — OR you can call your town or city clerk, go in person to request a replacement ballot, and fill in out and hand it in in person.
* Polling hours throughout New Hampshire vary, so make sure to check your local hours. And if you’re in line by the time the polls are set to close, stay in line! You’ll be able to vote.
If you still have questions, call our hotline at 603-GO-N-VOTE (603-466-8683) or visit [[URL REDACTED]]!

### Updates from Our Federal Delegation
Senator Shaheen, a senior member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, wrote to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo yesterday to raise serious concerns with the Trump administration’s failure to unequivocally rebuke Russia for its escalatory aggression and harmful actions against U.S. forces around the globe.
Senator Hassan led a virtual roundtable with Granite Staters to discuss the importance of the U.S. Postal Service for New Hampshire small businesses, medication delivery, and service members in the wake of COVID-19. Granite Staters on the call discussed their concerns with the harmful impact of the Postmaster General’s changes and the mail delivery delays that they have experienced.
Congresswoman Kuster, the co-chair of the Bipartisan Opioid Task Force, joined a group of legislators to announce a historic effort to highlight National Recovery Month in Congress throughout the month of September. Their efforts will include virtual and in-person events throughout the month to elevate voices in recovery as well as a Congressional Day of Action on September 16th.
Congressman Pappas met with area school leaders at Somersworth High School on Wednesday to hear from stakeholders and constituents as he continues to advocate for additional federal relief for New Hampshire’s school districts that are impacted by the costs of COVID-19 testing and reopening.

"Have you made your plan?
Friend,
It’s hard to believe, but tomorrow marks just one month until Election Day 2020 — and the good news is, you don’t have to wait until November 3rd to vote for our Democratic candidates! Ballots have officially dropped in New Hampshire, which means Granite Staters have already begun voting, and so can you. This year, there are a multitude of different ways to cast your ballot. Whether you are mailing in your completed absentee ballot or dropping it off at your clerk’s office, requesting your ballot and voting in one trip at your local town clerk’s office, or grabbing a mask and voting on Election Day, the most important thing is that you VOTE!
Coming off of the record-breaking turnout of our state primary, we’ve got to continue the momentum through this next month, and we need your help. It is critical that we elect Democrats up and down the ticket this year – from Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, to Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Congresswoman Annie Kuster, and Congressman Chris Pappas, to Dan Feltes and every Democrat running for state office – who will fight for affordable health care, women's reproductive rights, and an economy that works for everyone.
This is the most important election of our lifetimes, and we’ve all got to do our part. That’s why I’m asking you to sign up to help us Get Out The Vote this weekend. It’s critical that every single New Hampshire voter knows how to vote and that they get out to vote.
There are just 32 days left — so let’s give this all we’ve got, together.
Sign up to help us elect Democrats up and down the ticket
All the best,

### Updates from Our Federal Delegation
Senator Shaheen called on the Senate to prioritize passing COVID-19 relief legislation that would support health care providers on the frontlines, help local leaders facing severe budgetary shortfalls, give schools working day and night the resources they need to ensure the safety of students and teachers, and assist businesses that are trying to reopen.
Senator Hassan introduced two bills to increase maternal vaccination rates. The first makes vaccines more affordable by requiring that Medicaid plans cover vaccines during pregnancies, and the second requires the federal government to issue guidance to states about how to effectively increase vaccination rates.
Congresswoman Kuster led the Bipartisan Task Force to End Sexual Violence in a virtual roundtable discussion about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the rates and prosecution of human trafficking crimes.
Congressman Pappas voted to pass the Heroes Act, which includes four bills he authored that will provide free coronavirus treatment and vaccines for low-income individuals, expand tax credits for small businesses to keep workers on the job, and will give our veterans a reprieve from VA debt collection and greater access to emergency care during this pandemic.

"Here is how we’re staying positive during these hard times.
Friend,
I hope you’re doing okay.
We know that members of our New Hampshire Democratic family are already being personally impacted by COVID-19. Our hearts and best wishes for a speedy recovery go out to Senator Clark, her husband Jeff, and others who are personally impacted.
Here at the New Hampshire Democratic Party, we have been trying to stay focused on the positive when we can in the middle of this difficult time, and I’ve been so inspired by the Granite Staters who have risen to the challenge. From members of our community to our elected leaders, the people of New Hampshire are coming together and helping each other.
Throughout this public health crisis, Senator Shaheen, Senator Hassan, Congresswoman Kuster, and Congressman Pappas have been working tirelessly to ensure that small businesses, working families, and medical professionals are getting the support they need.
Our state senators and representatives have been doing their part to keep Granite Staters informed and safe. This week, over 200 state representatives signed a letter urging Governor Sununu to issue a stay at home order for all Granite Staters. Sununu heeded the concerns of our representatives and public health officials and issued this order this morning.
And people across New Hampshire are answering the call to volunteer at a number of organizations that are working around the clock to ensure our most vulnerable citizens are being taken care of. You can learn more about how to help the organizations that are doing amazing work in our state here.
To stay positive, we’ve also added a new section to our newsletter this week, “Highlighting the Helpers.” You can read more about it below, and we hope you enjoy it.
Stay positive as often as you can, and remember that we are in this together.
All the best,
Raymond Buckley, Chair
New Hampshire Democratic Party
### At the New Hampshire Democratic Party
Many aspects of our daily lives are changing as we continue to do what we can to stop the spread of the coronavirus and keep our friends, family, and neighbors safe and healthy. Social distancing, cancelling community events, and staying inside are essential to flatten the curve — which is why Democratic candidates across the state have cancelled fundraising events and rallies, local Democratic committees have cancelled their community meetings or moved them to virtual meetings, and face-to-face conversations with our fellow New Hampshire voters are on hold.
Earlier this week the NHDP Executive Committee voted unanimously to cancel the in-person style State Committee meeting on April 25 and our May 9 State Convention. If you are a State Committee member or a convention delegate, please keep on the lookout for details soon.
During this time, there's a lot we can still do from home! As we continue to do our part to flatten the curve, check out these 10 things you can do from home to help elect Democrats in November and make lasting change in our state.
10 Ways to Take Action from Home
### Highlighting the Helpers
Mr. Rogers once said, ""When I was a boy and I would see scary things in the news, my mother would say to me, 'Look for the helpers. You will always find people who are helping.'"" Inspired by Mr. Rogers and a desire to stay positive during this time, we’ve also added a new section to our newsletter, highlighting the helpers. This section will show off the work of individuals across the state who are making a difference in their community. If you know someone who should be featured, you can send us a note.
This Week's Helper Highlight:
The New Hampshire High School Democrats (NHHSD) launched a video this week, urging their fellow young people to stay home to save lives. “Do the right thing, listen to scientists, and stay home,” said Lily Coady, Communications Director for the NHHSD.

### In the State House
June 3rd - 12th is the filing period to run for state office, and it is fast approaching!
If you’re interested in running for state representative or in helping to recruit strong candidates, the first step is to check in with Rachael Thomeer, the House Caucus Director for the Committee to Elect House Democrats (CEHD) and your town or county Democratic chair (you can find their contact information here). CEHD and our town and county chairs are amazing resources and will let you know which towns have candidates and where there are open seats.
And if you don't currently have a Democratic state representative serving your town, consider running yourself!

### In Washington
We are so grateful to Senator Shaheen, Senator Hassan, Congresswoman Kuster, and Congressman Pappas for working across the aisle and passing the latest bipartisan, coronavirus response package this week. Our members of Congress worked tirelessly to provide direct cash assistance and expanded unemployment payments to individuals, emergency funding for hospitals that are bracing for an enormous surge in patients, and at least $1.25 billion to New Hampshire's state and local governments. New Hampshire small businesses are hurting, and we are grateful that our Senator Jeanne Shaheen led bipartisan negotiations on their behalf, ultimately securing $377 billion so that small businesses have the resources to stay afloat and keep their employees paid. This relief package will make a big difference for New Hampshire, and we sincerely thank our federal delegation for everything they are doing to fight for us during this crisis.

"This is a huge win for voting rights in New Hampshire.
Alex,
Did you hear the great news? A New Hampshire Superior Court judge has struck down Senate Bill 3 as unconstitutional!
In 2017, Chris Sununu and New Hampshire Republicans took their voter suppression scheme to the next level — passing restrictive voting laws like SB 3 that added confusing and burdensome steps to the voting process. For the last three years, the New Hampshire Democratic Party and other voting rights organizations have been in court defending the right of all eligible voters in New Hampshire to cast a ballot, and standing up against Chris Sununu and the Republican Party’s voter suppression agenda. And yesterday, we won.
While this ruling is a significant step forward, there is still more work to do to make sure all eligible Granite Staters have the right to vote in the critical elections this fall, and to educate and mobilize voters to get to the polls. Can you chip in $20.20 to support our work today?
If one thing is clear from my time as a college campus organizer during the 2018 election, it’s that young people are passionate about issues from health care to climate change, and they want their voices to be heard — just like everyone else. But Chris Sununu, Donald Trump, and the Republican Party are trying everything they can think of to deny young people that right.
That's why at the New Hampshire Democratic Party, we will never stop fighting the Sununu-Trump voter suppression agenda. Are you with us? Make a donation now to help us continue to fight voter suppression and elect leaders who will work to protect the right to vote.
Thank you for your support,
Gates

"Donald Trump is closer than ever to repealing the ACA.
Alex,
This week, the Supreme Court announced that it will consider the Trump lawsuit that could strike down the Affordable Care Act and strip health care coverage and pre-existing conditions protections from millions of Americans.
Despite the fact that gutting the ACA would have devastating impacts in our state, New Hampshire Republicans — from Governor Sununu to the candidates running against Senator Shaheen — have all signed on to Trump’s scheme to kick Granite Staters off their health care.
Here's the truth: health care is on the ballot in November, and we can't afford to lose. The 89,000 Granite Staters who could lose coverage can't afford for us to lose. The 572,200 Granite Staters with a pre-existing condition can't afford for us to lose. And the 57,000 Granite Staters enrolled in Medicaid expansion can't afford for us to lose. So I'm asking you: can you chip in $10 or whatever you can today?
The only way to stop the GOP's relentless attempts to take health care away is to take back the Senate, keep the House blue, and vote out Republicans from Donald Trump to Chris Sununu.
Donate now to defend our health care and the lives of millions.
In solidarity,
Kathy Sullivan

"Exciting things coming in the new year...
Dear friend,
Every year since 1959 — when Granite State supporters of Senator John F. Kennedy organized a dinner to raise money for the New Hampshire Democratic Party and showcase Kennedy's candidacy for president — Democrats from across the state gather to contribute the funds necessary to build a successful, statewide, grassroots operation in the upcoming year's elections.
This year, our McIntyre-Shaheen 100 Club event is on track to be the largest in history — with all of the Democratic presidential candidates in attendance, asking Granite Staters for their vote one last time before we go to the polls to cast a ballot in our First In The Nation primary.
Tickets for this exciting event will go on sale on Monday, January 6th, and we want you to be the first to get them! You'll want to watch your inbox that morning because we'll send you an email letting you know as soon as they're available. We've made it easy for you to mark your calendars today to make sure you don't miss our ticket launch in the new year.

### In the State House
This week, House Speaker Steve Shurtleff spoke at a press conference to call out Chris Sununu for insisting on cutting the Christmas Day holiday for dozens of cleaning workers at the New Hampshire Veterans Home. Workers at the Veterans Home in Tilton, represented by SEA/SEIU Local 1984, are some of the hardest working Granite Staters, and they deserve to be home with their families on Christmas.
### In Washington
Senator Shaheen secured a major provision in the federal budget agreement that will give treatment providers flexibility in how they use opioid response funding to help patients suffering from meth and cocaine dependency as well. This provision came from Shaheen's comprehensive legislation to combat substance use disorder, the Turn the Tide Act, and will help more Granite Staters get the treatment they need.
Senator Hassan has made protecting community and religious organizations from domestic and foreign terrorist threats a major priority, and this week, she announced that grant funding to help protect these organizations will be quadrupled next year.
Congresswoman Kuster voted for a funding package that includes her initiatives to protect the rights of unaccompanied migrant children, to boost rural economic growth, to help educate individuals with disabilities, and to address online child sexual abuse.
Congressman Pappas voted for a bipartisan funding package that includes amendments he introduced to build out care for female veterans, increase funding for opioid crisis response, and expand investments to safeguard our water and hold polluters accountable.

"Democrats are working for Granite State workers and families
Friend,
Over the last 24 hours, our Democratic candidate for governor Dan Feltes embarked on a 10 county tour to meet with New Hampshire workers and small business owners and to hear about the issues that impact their everyday lives — because when Dan is in the corner office, working families will have someone in their corner 24/7.
He wrapped up his tour by casting his ballot in Concord. And just like Dan, you can make your plan to vote today! Ballots have dropped in New Hampshire, and we’re hosting events around the state for the next three weeks with local leaders to make sure Granite Staters know how to vote — because this year, voting is easy! Whether you mail in your absentee ballot, request your absentee ballot and vote in one trip at your local town or city clerk’s office, or grab a mask and vote on Election Day, the most important thing is that you VOTE!
As we get closer to Election Day, it's important to remember that we can’t let up now. From phone calls, to yard sign deliveries and lit drops, to socially distanced visibility, we need all hands on deck. There couldn’t be more at stake this year, and it’s critical that we all do our part to get out the vote for Democrats up and down the ballot — so, can you join us for our Get Out The Vote Weekend of Action this Saturday and Sunday?

### Updates from Our Federal Delegation
Senator Shaheen again proved to be a champion for Granite Staters in her North Country debate this week against Republican opponent “Colorado Corky” Messner. At the debate, Colorado Corky denied the existence of 572,000 Granite Staters with pre-existing conditions. This is a stark contrast to Senator Shaheen who has led efforts in Congress to lower health care costs and expand access, reduce the price of prescription drugs, protect people with pre-existing conditions, and fight back against Republican efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act.
Senator Hassan hosted a virtual roundtable with New Hampshire college students and staff to discuss the challenges they are facing amid the pandemic. The Senator emphasized that schools are being hurt by Washington Republicans' refusal to work with Democrats in good faith on an additional comprehensive relief package.
Congresswoman Kuster cast her ballot in Hopkinton this week and talked to Granite Staters about how they can vote safely in this year’s election for Democrats up and down the ticket.
Congressman Pappas, a co-sponsor of the Save Our Stages Act which aims to bring aid to the independent music venues that have been hit hard by the pandemic, met with owners of New Hampshire's independent music venues to discuss their critical role in our communities and our Main Street economy.

"There’s no time to waste.
Friend,
This Sunday marks 100 days until the general election. In just 100 days on November 3rd, we have the chance to take back the White House and the corner office, flip the U.S. Senate, and elect Democrats up and down the ticket in New Hampshire – from the State House to Congress.
Democrats have been organizing every day, in every county, city, and town across New Hampshire to elect incredible leaders in all of our communities – leaders who will fight for quality and affordable health care, defend reproductive rights, fund our public schools, protect the environment, and so much more.
The work we all do over the next 100 days will determine the outcome of this election, which is why it’s so important that we all continue to do our part. The momentum is on our side – Democrats have more candidates running for office, we’ve raised more money, and our grassroots campaign efforts are unrivaled – but now is not the time to get comfortable. Now is the time to ignore the polls, continue to work hard, and leave it all on the field.
Everything we’ve been fighting for comes down to these final 100 days. If we make calls, if we talk with our neighbors about what’s at stake, and if we all vote on November 3rd, we can kick Republicans like Donald Trump and Chris Sununu out of office and elect Democrats who will build a better future for everyone. I’m asking you to join us over the next 100 days, because with your help, I know we can get it done.
Sign up here to help us win in 100 days.
All the best,
Raymond Buckley, Chair

### In the State House
This week, five important pieces of legislation were signed into law:

### Updates from Our Federal Delegation
Senator Shaheen, a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, successfully passed her amendment to the annual defense bill that will boost funding for the PFAS health study she established with an additional $15 million. Shaheen also secured support for a number of priorities that will make a difference for New Hampshire and our national security, including health benefits for veterans and disaster assistance relief for rural communities.
Senator Hassan introduced bipartisan legislation to expand small business and non-profits’ access to federal COVID-19 relief, allowing eligible small employers to participate in the Paycheck Protection Program and claim the Employee Retention Tax Credit to help keep workers on payroll and pay for their health care coverage.
Congresswoman Kuster participated in a virtual House Energy and Commerce Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee hearing to discuss efforts to develop a safe, effective, and accessible vaccine for COVID-19.
Congressman Pappas introduced legislation to provide small and mid size police departments with a grant to help update their standards and best practices to strengthen accountability, enhance community trust, and improve operational effectiveness.

"Together, we can win in 2020
Friend,
Donald Trump is about to take the stage for his rally here in New Hampshire today. While he spreads hate, division, and lies, volunteers across the state are contacting thousands of Granite State voters to let them know why they are voting for Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and Democrats up and down the ticket in November. I’m so proud of our incredible grassroots movement – especially on days like today.
Trump’s chaotic convention this week has reaffirmed just how important it is that we elect Democrats up and down the ticket. Donald Trump, Chris Sununu, and every Republican running for Congress and the State House have made it clear that if elected, they will push Trump’s extreme agenda, rip health care away from tens of thousands of Granite Staters, enact draconian anti-choice policies, and use their elected office to benefit special interests at the expense of working families.
The contrast between our message and theirs couldn’t be more clear — while Trump spread lies, disinformation, and fear this past week, we’ve been focused on making sure every Granite Stater knows about Joe Biden’s plan to build our country back better. Trump has broken nearly every promise he made to Granite Staters, and that’s why it’s so important that in these next 67 days, we do everything we can to beat them this November.
We need to elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, but we also need to ensure that we elect Democrats up and down the ticket, from the governor's race, to the executive council, and every state and local race on the ballot. All of our Democratic candidates are going to fight for Granite State families, and after the primary on September 8th, I hope you’ll join me for our Post-Primary United for Victory 2020 event. This will be unlike any other unity event we’ve had before, but the spirit remains the same – that we are stronger when we come together and work to elect every single Democratic candidate up and down the ticket.
Join us for our United for Victory 2020 event
All the best,
Raymond Buckley, Chair

This week, the New Hampshire Democratic Party launched an ad exposing how Chris Sununu’s loyalty to Donald Trump hurts New Hampshire. This is the earliest substantial ad buy we’ve ever launched in a gubernatorial race, because this election is just that important – Chris Sununu is a “Trump guy through and through,” and his extreme agenda is bad for New Hampshire.

### Updates from Our Federal Delegation
Senator Shaheen joined union leaders at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard who rallied in support of her, praising Shaheen for working across the aisle to save the shipyard whenever it has faced cuts – including last year when the Trump administration tried to cut as much as $244 million in shipyard dollars, which Shaheen helped block. Her bipartisan efforts to secure federal investment for new construction projects and to deliver pay raises for workers were applauded by the workers who called her a “critical friend” and “top advocate” in the Senate.
Senator Hassan visited the Manchester Cedar Swamp Preserve this week, one of the many sites that benefited from legislation Senator Hassan helped pass to permanently fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF). The LWCF helps sites like Manchester Cedar Swamp Preserve protect and maintain their critically important ecosystems.
Congresswoman Kuster visited White Mountain Community College to hear how the community college is safely preparing to bring staff and students back to school, and discussed how she can continue to advocate for more aid for New Hampshire colleges and universities in the next COVID-19 relief bill.
Congressman Pappas met with faculty leaders from the University of New Hampshire and discussed how he’s working to ensure relief for schools like UNH in the next COVID-19 relief bill so universities have the resources they need to keep students and teachers safe.

"The First in the Nation Primary is right around the corner.
Dear friend,
With less than one month until the First in the Nation Primary, Granite Staters are fired up to cast their vote for Democrats who have plans to make health care more affordable, safeguard our environment, and create an economy that works for everyone.
Just last week, we saw a historic number of Granite Staters file to run to be a district-level delegate and attend the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee — hoping to take part in the historic process of nominating the next president and vice president.
And on February 11th, thousands of Democrats and independents across New Hampshire will come together in an effort to defeat Donald Trump by voting for a Democrat for president in the Democratic presidential primary.
Many Democratic primary voters will be previously undeclared voters, and we want to urge those who are drawing a Democratic ballot to stay a Democrat after they vote! That’s why this week, we launched a new campaign called “Declare Yourself” to close the registration edge New Hampshire Republicans have held for many years, despite our purple state continuing to elect blue senators and members of Congress.
New Hampshire’s independent voters are taking every chance they have to vote against Donald Trump, starting by voting for a Democrat in our exciting First in the Nation primary. And when they do, we’re here to welcome them to our Party.
Declare your support for Democrats here!
All the best,
Raymond Buckley, Chair

### In the State House
* Senate President Donna Soucy introduced SB 410, which will re-establish and raise New Hampshire’s minimum wage from the outdated federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour.
* Senator Tom Sherman introduced an amendment to his own legislation, SB 287, which calls for updated regulations for PFAS chemicals to meet those recommended by the state Department of Environmental Services in 2019. The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee voted to pass the legislation.
* Representative Willis Griffith introduced House Bill 1500, the Student Loan Bill of Rights, to protect borrowers from issues such as interest rates, over-borrowing, and unreasonable repayment plans. It also increases the accessibility for loan education, so young people don’t get stuck deferring or defaulting on loans during the borrowing process.
### In Washington
Senator Shaheen has led the fight to get big money out of politics, and put power back in the hands of the American people. Ahead of the 10 year anniversary of the Supreme Court Citizens United decision, Shaheen discussed her Democracy for All Amendment, which would overturn Citizens United and get big money out of politics to ensure elected representatives reflect the will of the public, not corporations.
Senator Hassan co-sponsored the Rural MOMS ACT to help ensure that new and expecting mothers living in rural communities get the care they need. The legislation will expand prenatal and postpartum telehealth services and create new federal grants to address maternal mortality.
Congresswoman Kuster sponsored the PFAS Action Act of 2019 which passed in the House this week. This legislation addresses toxic chemicals like PFAS in the nation’s waterways by working to minimize PFAS contamination, limit production of the chemical, and establish stricter drinking water standards to keep communities safe.
Congressman Pappas authored a key provision in the PFAS Action Act of 2019 which the House passed this week, to set proactive limits for PFAS discharge, hold polluters accountable, and provide impacted communities with resources to address contamination.

"We can honor Justice Ginsburg's legacy by electing Democrats up and down the ticket who will fight for reproductive rights.
Friend,
This past week we’ve been mourning the loss of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who was a force for equality and a trailblazing champion for women, for families, and for justice. Now, we must honor her life and her work by continuing the fight through these next 39 days and beyond — for her, and for all of us.
Make no mistake: whether Roe v. Wade remains the law of the land is at stake in this election. Like Donald Trump, Chris Sununu believes that Granite State women shouldn’t be able to make their own reproductive health care decisions — and he will do everything in his power to rip away this freedom if given the chance.
We already knew how much was at stake in the upcoming election, but now, these issues are even more urgent — from reproductive rights and the future of the Affordable Care Act, to worker protections and voting rights — and all of them are under attack right here in New Hampshire under Chris Sununu. And we’ve got to fight back harder than ever before.
That’s why we’re making thousands of phone calls, hosting hundreds of virtual events, and today we just launched a new ad that exposes Chris Sununu for bringing Donald Trump’s agenda to the Granite State. We’re leaving it all on the field because we know that if we work every day for the next 39 days, we will win.
Watch our new ad below, and be sure to share it on social media! Help us make sure every Granite State voter sees it. Click here to share on Facebook. Click here to share on Twitter.

### At the New Hampshire Democratic Party
After the devastating passing of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the future of Roe v. Wade is in jeopardy at the U.S. Supreme Court. Now more than ever, we need to elect leaders who will protect the right to choose here in New Hampshire.
This week, our “Protect Choice, Veto Sununu tour” took us all across the state, making sure Granite Staters know that Chris Sununu is anti-choice. He has voted to defund Planned Parenthood, restricted access to abortion, given taxpayer money to a crisis pregnancy center, and supported Brett Kavanaugh. And just like Trump is trying to nominate an anti-choice activist to SCOTUS, Chris Sununu is trying to nominate an anti-choice activist to the NH Supreme Court. To protect choice in New Hampshire, we must #VetoSununu and elect Dan Feltes governor.

### Updates from Our Federal Delegation
Senator Shaheen helped introduce the Science and Transparency Over Politics (STOP) Act which will prevent the Trump administration from interfering with the work of experts and the nation’s public health agencies to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Senator Hassan secured commitments from leaders in the Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that their agencies would conduct key oversight measures to help ensure that any potential COVID-19 vaccine is safe and effective for all Americans.
Congresswoman Kuster led a virtual roundtable with members of the Bipartisan Opioid Taskforce and health experts to discuss how to use technology to prevent addiction and promote patient safety.
Congressman Pappas’ SHIELD Act passed in the House this week and will reform the Veterans Administration’s debt collection process which has caused financial hardship for veterans by requiring the VA to provide more notifications to veterans when overpayments are made.

"We couldn’t be more proud of the work you did for us this week.
Friend,
Yesterday, Democrats in the State House heroically worked through a marathon House session that lasted until 4:00am today. For 19 hours, Democrats pushed through a lengthy legislative calendar and passed bills that will make health care more affordable, protect our environment, make voting more accessible, promote the use of clean energy, make our communities safer and more inclusive, and support our veterans and first responders. Our legislators also fought to defend women’s reproductive rights by voting down four extreme Republican anti-choice bills that would have banned abortion in New Hampshire.
While our Democratic State Representatives worked through the long hours, Republicans whined about having to do the jobs they were elected to do. They even stooped so low as to obstruct the voting process – threatening to kill bills that would help their constituents and wasting valuable time making excuses for the seven Republicans who refused to attend a mandatory sexual harassment prevention training.
In November, we need to vote out the Republicans who showed they would rather play dirty political games than do their jobs for Granite Staters. And, we need to re-elect the incredible Democrats who showed their unwavering dedication to working for us.
We are so proud of our Democratic legislators for their commitment to public service and going above and beyond to fight for Granite Staters.
Sign up here to help us elect Democrats in November!
All the best,
Raymond Buckley, Chair

This year, we are excited to revisit our NHDP State Platform and adapt it to our priorities for 2020.

"Let’s get ready to do it again in November
Friend,
As this year's First in the Nation primary comes to an end, it’s clear Granite Staters are energized and ready to elect a Democrat to the White House and defeat Donald Trump. For over a year, Democrats in New Hampshire have been working tirelessly to engage voters and get out the vote through grassroots organizing, knocking on doors, and making phone calls – and our efforts paid off.
We broke the record for voter turnout in past Democratic primaries and for either party in a New Hampshire presidential primary, with 300,622 Granite Staters casting their ballots for a Democrat on Tuesday. This is an incredible accomplishment for Democrats across the state.
Now that the primary is over, it’s time to get to work to ensure we defeat Donald Trump, win a majority in the U.S. Senate and House, protect and grow our majorities in the New Hampshire Legislature and Executive Council, and kick Chris Sununu out of the corner office.

### In Washington
Senator Shaheen held a forum today in Concord to talk to Granite Staters about protecting their health care from cuts proposed in the Trump administration's budget. The budget will further threaten the Affordable Care Act and health care for millions of Americans on Medicaid and Medicare. This week Shaheen also led a letter with 44 Senators that urges President Trump to direct the Department of Justice to protect health care coverage for people with pre-existing conditions

Congresswoman Kuster met with the Opioid Task Force to discuss with experts how Congress can ensure that those struggling with addiction have access to the mental health services needed to recover.
Congressman Pappas held a hearing to address the challenges facing community care providers, who are raising serious concerns about payment issues with the VA that are making it difficult for veterans to receive the care they need.

"This year’s Democratic National Convention was one for the books!
Friend,
What a week! I am so inspired by everyone who participated in this year’s virtual Democratic National Convention. This year, New Hampshire's delegation was one of the most diverse in the state's history, with LGBTQ+ Granite Staters, people of color, women, and young people from all different backgrounds representing the very best of the New Hampshire Democratic Party. We saw just how fired up Democrats are to elect our official nominees for president and vice president of the United States – Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, and I truly believe that despite this year’s challenges, we put on a convention that will be remembered for decades.
Throughout the week we heard from fantastic Democrats across America – and we even had some notable speakers from the Granite State featured as well! In the historic roll call vote that took viewers to every corner of the country, Governor John Lynch was joined by New Hampshire Young Democrats President Ashley Marcoux, New Hampshire College Democrats board member Emery Rheam, New Hampshire High School Democrats President Asma Akbar and New Hampshire’s youngest elected state official, State Representative Denny Ruprecht. Together, they cast New Hampshire’s votes to officially nominate Joe Biden for president of the United States.
On Tuesday night alongside 16 other rising stars, Representative Ruprecht took part in delivering the keynote address and highlighted how Joe Biden will help working families like his. On Thursday, 13-year-old Brayden Harrington spoke with courage and conviction about how Joe Biden made him feel more confident about what he could accomplish after Joe told him that they ""were members of the same club"" because they both stutter. These Granite Staters make all of us so incredibly proud.
The convention highlighted the compassionate, thoughtful leadership of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, who understand the issues important to hardworking Americans. They understand the struggles of working families because they have lived them, and will use their experience to work for Granite State families. Joe and Kamala are going to build our country back better by creating an economy that works for everyone, tackling the climate crisis, protecting our health care, reforming our immigration system, and ensuring equal rights for all.
But they can’t do this without you. It’s going to take all of us to elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris as president and vice president, to re-elect Senator Shaheen, Congresswoman Kuster, and Congressman Pappas, and to make sure Democrats win BIG up and down the ballot!
As President Obama said on Wednesday night, what we do from now until November 3rd will “echo through generations to come.” In these next 74 days, make sure you’re doing something you’ll be proud of. Start by joining us in the fight and sign up for a phone banking or digital door-knocking shift for our Weekend of Action that starts tomorrow!
Sign up for our Weekend of Action
All the best,
Raymond Buckley, Chair
New Hampshire Democratic Party
### At the New Hampshire Democratic Party
This week, we hosted over 100 grassroots events to bring the virtual convention home - to Granite Staters’ living rooms - where more people were able to participate than ever before. We hosted exciting speakers from around the country, heard from incredible New Hampshire leaders, texted and phone banked thousands of voters, played trivia and ate ice cream, and joined together for virtual watch parties each night of the convention.
And if you haven’t submitted your entry to our Social Media Challenge yet, you can still do so until Sunday night! We’re looking for pictures of your Biden lawn signs and homemade signs, your living room decorated for a virtual Convention Watch Party, a chalk mural getting out the vote for Biden on your driveway, or other creative and fun ways you're showing your support for Democrats up and down the ballot in New Hampshire. Click here to learn more.
### In the State House
This week, Senate President Donna Soucy and House Speaker Steve Shurtleff talked about why they’re excited to vote for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in 74 days!
* Click here to learn why Senator Soucy is so proud to cast her vote for Joe Biden – ""a man with warmth and empathy, with grit and determination"" – for president of the United States!
* Click here to learn why Speaker Shurtleff says when Joe Biden is elected, it will be “one of the happiest days” of his life!
Senator Martha Fuller Clark has introduced 1,560 bills, signed 737 into law, and provided decades of leadership at the State House and in the Democratic Party. Come join the NH Senate Democratic Caucus this Monday evening to celebrate the Notorious MFC and wish her a happy retirement! You can also sign her retirement card here.
### Updates from Our Federal Delegation
Senator Shaheen and Senator Hassan called on Postmaster General Louis DeJoy to answer questions about his significant operational changes, which are leading to serious delays for postal customers in New Hampshire and across the country. The Senators called on Postmaster General DeJoy to testify before Congress and provide clear, transparent answers on service delays that have caused seniors and veterans to miss their prescription medications, small businesses to lose money, and other serious disruptions that affect communities across the country who count on the Postal Service for timely delivery.
Congresswoman Kuster introduced new legislation to ensure that every Granite Stater is able to afford and access necessary vaccinations to keep themselves and their families safe and healthy during the COVID-19 crisis.
Congressman Pappas met with restaurant and small business owners that have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic to discuss what he is doing in Congress to push for a relief package that would include funding for small businesses and state, county, and town governments.

"Here’s what we’ve been up to this week.
Dear friend,
Our party was founded on the belief that everyone should have a fair shot, regardless of their last name or family ties. That’s why it’s vital to ensure that a program like Opportunity Zones – which allows states to give business tax breaks to a certain number of economically-distressed communities – are not abused to enrich government officials and their friends, or rig the system for those who already have a leg up. So this week, following reports that Chris Sununu used the Opportunity Zone program to give his family's business in Waterville Valley a triple tax break, I filed a Right To Know request to Sununu to shed light on this concerning decision.
This decision raises serious questions about whether any of the other 78 low-income New Hampshire communities that were eligible were more deserving of an economic boost, but were turned away because of Sununu’s personal and financial connections to Waterville Valley. Granite Staters deserve to know who their governor is working for, and we will hold him accountable when he puts his and his family’s business first at everyone else’s expense.
All the best,
Raymond Buckley, Chair
New Hampshire Democratic Party
### At the New Hampshire Democratic Party
On February 7th, four days before the First In The Nation Primary, the New Hampshire Democratic Party will partner with the Democratic National Committee to host the eighth Democratic debate at St. Anselm College in Manchester! Watch your inbox for more details about how to tune in on February 7th to hear each of the Democratic presidential candidates' plans to strengthen the middle class, make college more affordable, ensure Americans have access to quality, affordable health care, and protect a woman's right to choose.
Do you want to take part in the historic process of voting for the nominees for president and vice president, adopting a national party platform, and hearing from national leaders at the Democratic National Committee Convention? Did you know that the majority of those who go to the convention are first time delegates? Check out our video below for a glimpse at past conventions, and then check out this page on our website to learn more about becoming a delegate to the 2020 convention in Milwaukee! Anyone can run for delegate, and we encourage everyone to participate in this process.
### In the State House
This week, six state Democratic leaders sent a letter to the state agencies that were consulted in the Opportunity Zone designation process to ask for clarity about their recommendations, and why Waterville Valley was chosen over 78 other eligible communities.
You can read the letter from Senators Kevin Cavanaugh, Martha Fuller Clark, Martha Hennessey, and Representatives Mary Jane Wallner, Marjorie Porter, and Suzanne Smith here.
### In Washington
Senator Shaheen secured an additional $10 million in federal funding for the PFAS health impact study that she created in 2018. Shaheen has led efforts in Congress to combat PFAS because of water contamination challenges facing New Hampshire communities, and she has now secured $30 million for this national study, which is currently investigating PFAS at its pilot site, Pease.
Senator Hassan’s bill, the Support for Suicide Prevention Coordinators Act, passed in the Senate this week. This legislation aims to reduce the high suicide rate among veterans by addressing staffing shorages and the workload of coordinators within the VA’s Suicide Prevention Coordinators program, to ensure veterans are getting quality and efficient mental health treatment.
Congresswoman Kuster and Congressman Pappas have been tireless advocates for lowering the cost of prescription drugs for Granite Staters. On Thursday, H.R. 3, the Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act – which Kuster and Pappas co-sponsored – passed in the House. This bill will lower the cost of life saving drugs for Granite Staters, and includes a provision by Rep. Kuster that secures $10 billion in funding for addressing the opioid epidemic over the next five years, and a provision by Rep. Pappas that will expand low-income seniors' access to prescription drugs under the Medicare prescription drug benefit program.

"He can’t stop us from voting him out on November 3rd.
Friend,
Yesterday, Trump tried to use the COVID-19 pandemic to push his extreme, self-serving, and dangerous agenda by suggesting that we postpone the November election – a move that comes straight out of an authoritarian playbook, and a decision that he does not have the authority to make.
Donald Trump can tweet authoritarian threats all he wants, but let’s be clear: he does not have the power to delay the election. This is yet another attempt to distract from the fact that 150,000 Americans have lost their lives because of his chaotic and unprepared response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
It’s obvious that Trump is scared – he wouldn’t suggest postponing the election if he thought he stood a chance at winning it. He’s deflecting from the surging COVID-19 cases, the failing economy, and the countless broken promises he’s made to Granite Staters over the past four years. New Hampshire voters are fed up with his lies and broken promises, and Trump knows it. He’s panicking, and it shows.
Granite Staters are fired up about our Democratic candidates, and it’s a testament to the incredible success of Organize NH, our unified organizing operation for the Biden, Shaheen, Kuster, and Pappas campaigns as well as Democratic campaigns up and down the entire ballot. Organize NH has held hundreds of virtual events, with thousands of energized volunteers who are phone banking, text banking, and participating in digital door knocking every week in communities across the state to remind voters how much is at stake.
With only 95 days from now until November 3rd, we need to make sure that every eligible Granite Stater casts their ballot for Democrats up and down the ticket. It’s going to take all of us working together, and we can’t do it without you – so request your absentee ballot today and join us in the fight.
Find out how to get your absentee ballot here
All the best,
Raymond Buckley, Chair
New Hampshire Democratic Party
### At the New Hampshire Democratic Party
Next Thursday, August 6th at 6:30 pm - on the 55th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act - top New Hampshire civic groups are coming together to host a virtual voter information town hall on Facebook Live, where Granite Staters will be able to ask their questions and learn everything they need to know to exercise their right to vote in November!
As voting processes have been adapted in New Hampshire to keep voters safe during the COVID-19 pandemic, this town hall event will provide Granite Staters non-partisan, accurate information about how to register and vote this fall.
RSVP here!
This week, the New Hampshire Democratic Party launched a new campaign, “Educators Against Sununu,“ exposing how Chris Sununu’s failure to lead on school reopening and his anti-public education agenda hurts Granite State teachers, students, and taxpayers.
Learn more about how Sununu has failed NH teachers and students
### In the State House
This week, Chris Sununu put his partisan agenda ahead of the well-being of Granite Staters and vetoed a number of bipartisan bills:
* Senate Bill 7 would have lowered costs for our municipalities, reduced the amount of time spent in line on election day, and created a more streamlined and accessible registration process.
* Senate Bill 311 would have waived a fee for those trying to annul their conviction of a misdemeanor or non-violent felony.
* House Bill 250 would have provided affordable, quality dental care to Granite Staters on Medicaid.
* House Bill 1665 would have established an independent redistricting panel to increase accountability, transparency, and fairness in our election process.
* House Bill 1660 would have helped vulnerable adults seek protection from abuse.
* House Bill 1234 would have provided administrative updates to state and local governments, to increase transparency and efficiency.
### Updates from Our Federal Delegation
Senator Shaheen, the only woman on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, took the Trump administration to task for refusing to hold Vladimir Putin and Russia accountable for paying bounties to the Taliban to kill American service members. At a committee hearing, Shaheen stood up for U.S. service members by pressing U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on the Trump administration’s inaction on these intelligence reports. For weeks, Shaheen has led congressional efforts to hold Russia accountable for targeting Americans with bounties, while both of her Republican opponents have refused to condemn Putin and the Kremlin.
Senator Hassan led her colleagues in a letter to Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, urging Facebook to stop the spread of climate change disinformation on the platform. Facebook’s decision to label climate change content as “opinion content” has prevented fact checks on misleading or false information on climate change, which emboldens climate deniers and promotes the spread of disinformation.
Congresswoman Kuster led a virtual roundtable to discuss how state and local organizations that combat sexual violence are navigating the challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The roundtable also discussed how the virus has exacerbated racial disparities in our communities.
Congressman Pappas met virtually with local leaders to discuss how he’s working to secure more COVID-19 relief funds for local governments across New Hampshire that have been impacted by revenue and budget shortfalls due to the coronavirus crisis. Pappas is fighting to increase funds for state and local governments so New Hampshire cities and towns don’t have to lay off first responders, health care professionals, educators, and other critical public sector employees.

"Get your yard signs and join us for our Weekend of Action to elect Joe Biden and NH Dems up and down the ticket
Friend,
Today marks 46 days until November 3rd when we will elect our 46th president of the United States, Joe Biden.
With just 46 days left, there’s plenty of excitement here in the Granite State! We were thrilled to welcome Dr. Jill Biden and Doug Emhoff to New Hampshire this week. They discussed Joe Biden’s commitment to protecting the Affordable Care Act and ensuring access to quality, affordable health care, they met with Granite State veterans and military families, and kicked off the distribution of Biden-Harris 2020 yard signs with a car parade!
And to keep the enthusiasm going, we’re hosting a Weekend of Action with special guests Jason Kander, Maura Healey, and Kathy Hochul who will help us reach out to as many voters as we can to talk about how critical the November 3rd election is.
Meanwhile, this week 47 New Hampshire Republicans refused to wear a mask at the last House session of the legislative year, embarrassed their constituents, and showed a complete and utter disregard for the health and safety of their colleagues, the health and safety of Granite Staters in Durham, and for the 438 Granite Staters who have died after Sununu and Trump’s chaotic and failed mismanagement of the COVID-19 pandemic. It was also disappointing to learn of the beer drinking during the session by the maskless Republicans.
The difference between New Hampshire Republicans and Democrats could not be more clear. Our candidates will support our public schools, ensure quality and affordable health care, fight for living wages, protect reproductive rights, and create an economy that works for every Granite Stater – but we can’t do it without you.
Join us during our Weekend of Action and let’s get to work electing Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, Jeanne Shaheen, Annie Kuster, Chris Pappas, Dan Feltes, and Granite State Democrats down the ballot!
Sign up today for our weekend of action
All the best,
Raymond Buckley, Chair
New Hampshire Democratic Party

### In the State House
Wednesday was the House Veto Override Day and the last legislative session of the 2019-2020 term. Governor Sununu vetoed many important bills passed by House and Senate Democrats this term that would have helped everyday Granite Staters, especially during a pandemic, including:
* Paid family and medical leave insurance
* Independent redistricting
* Protections for renters
* Renewable energy
To the detriment of Granite Staters, House Republicans sustained Governor Sununu's reckless vetoes. That’s why on November 3rd, we need to elect Dan Feltes as Governor and protect our majorities in the NH House and Senate.
### Updates from Our Federal Delegation
Senator Shaheen made history on Tuesday when she received over 140,000 votes, the most votes in a New Hampshire state primary ever! Shaheen has been leading bipartisan efforts to provide Granite Staters with relief from the COVID-19 crisis, combat the opioid crisis, protect women’s reproductive rights, and make health care more affordable for all Granite Staters. It’s clear New Hampshire voters are ready to re-elect her in November.
Senator Hassan received support from The American Legion and Veterans of Foreign Wars for her bipartisan legislation that will ensure that Social Security, Veterans Affairs, and Supplemental Security Income beneficiaries will automatically receive any future COVID-19 stimulus payments.
Congresswoman Kuster co-sponsored several bills that were approved by the Energy and Commerce Committee, including the State Opioid Response Grant Authorization Act that will provide $1.5 billion annually to help treatment providers, first responders, and families facing the challenge of addiction.
Congressman Pappas welcomed the arrival of $82,000 in federal support for the Manchester Police Department that will help improve mental health and wellness services for law enforcement and fund suicide prevention programs. Pappas is leafing the fight in Congress for increased funding to state and local governments - including local police departments.

"We only have 11 days left. Let's make them count.
Friend,
During the debates this week, we heard our incredible Democratic candidates Vice President Joe Biden, Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Congresswoman Annie Kuster, Congressman Chris Pappas, and State Senate Majority Leader Dan Feltes discuss their plans to save the Affordable Care Act and make health care affordable for Granite Staters, defend women's reproductive rights, and support a clean energy economy.
We also heard their Republican opponents’ schemes to gut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, undermine reproductive rights, and we heard every single one of them – Chris Sununu, “Colorado” Corky Messner, New Jersey Matt Mowers, and Steve Negron – proclaim their unwavering support for Donald Trump.
That’s why we need to spend the next 11 days making sure that everyone we know – our sisters, mothers, brothers, fathers, cousins, uncles, significant others – has a plan to vote for our Democratic candidates up and down the entire ticket.
Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, there are a few ways for you to vote this year:
* You can request your ballot, fill it out, and return it, all in one trip to your town or city clerk’s office.
* As always, you can register and vote in person on Election Day at your local polling place.
* And, if you have already received your absentee ballot in the mail and still need to return it, we recommend that you hand-deliver it directly to your clerk’s office as soon as possible. All absentee ballots must be returned by 5:00 pm on Election Day.
If you or anyone you know have any questions at all about how to vote, call our voter assistance hotline at 603-466-8683, or visit [[URL REDACTED]]
So please make a plan to vote today if you have not done so already, and be sure to reach out to every other voter in your life to do the same. Voting is easier than ever this year. And the stakes have never been higher.
Sign up here to help us get out the vote!
All the best,
Raymond Buckley, Chair
New Hampshire Democratic Party
### At the New Hampshire Democratic Party
With only 11 days until the most important election of our lives, we need your help to make sure we have a successful Election Day at the polls. Here are a few ways you can help:
* Early Processing Sessions - these meetings are happening in a number of municipalities across the state where election officials process absentee ballots prior to Election Day. We are recruiting volunteers to observe these sessions and record whether there are any rejected ballots. Meetings will happen between Thursday, October 29 and Monday, November 2 - dates and times are still being set. Please SIGN UP HERE if you are interested in attending one of these processing sessions and our Early Processing Team will be in touch about training and specific details for your town!
* Election Day Poll Visibility \- we are working with all of the Democratic campaigns to schedule volunteers to hold signs at the polls on Election Day. Our plan is to schedule volunteers at all polling locations for 2 hour shifts from when polls open to when polls close. We would love to work with you to get full coverage for your polling locations. The coordinated campaign will provide what you need! If you are interested in doing visibility at the polls on Election Day, please SIGN UP HERE.
* Election Day Voter Support Volunteers \- these volunteers will be stationed outside of polling locations to help be our eyes and ears for what is happening on the ground. They will flag for our team if there are long lines, safety concerns, etc. happening at polling locations across the state. If you are interested in being an Election Day Voter Support Volunteer, please SIGN UP HERE.
* Election Night Results Tracking \- finally, we need to identify volunteers in every city and town to help us capture results across the state. This is important to ensure that we have the most accurate picture of what is happening in all of our Democratic races. We need committed individuals who are willing to stay until final results are available; in some locations that could be very late. If you can commit to reporting results for your town on Election Day, please SIGN UP HERE.
With your help – Election Day will be hugely successful! If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to [[URL REDACTED]]
### In the State House
The Committee to Elect House Democrats, the Senate Democratic Caucus, and the Executive Council Candidates launched a joint project to encourage voters to fill out their full ballot. In 2016, tens of thousands of Granite Staters voted for President then left blanks on their ballot for critical State House, Senate, and Executive Council races. We need your help to spread the word to remind voters to fill out their full ballot this year!

### Updates from Our Federal Delegation
Senator Shaheen was endorsed by 145 small business leaders across New Hampshire for her bipartisan leadership throughout her career and her persistent efforts to support them during the pandemic. A former small business owner, Shaheen helped New Hampshire businesses create nearly 67,000 jobs as Governor while lowering electricity rates for small businesses and creating a job training fund to help workers. During COVID-19, Shaheen worked across the aisle to create the Paycheck Protection Program, helping save more than 24,000 New Hampshire small businesses and helping more than 206,000 Granite Staters keep their jobs.
Senator Hassan cosponsored two pieces of bipartisan legislation to help connect veterans with the health care services that they need and have earned. The WWII Veterans Hospital and Medical Eligibility Act opens up the Department of Veteran Affairs’ (VA) health care system to all WWII veterans who are not already enrolled so they can receive essential health care benefits, and the Helping Expand and Launch Transitional Health (HEALTH) for Women Veterans Act informs women veterans who are transitioning to civilian life about VA health care benefits that they are eligible for.
Congresswoman Kuster unveiled her 2020 Jobs and Opportunity Agenda, which outlines policies to help alleviate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic by investing in essential workers, expanding access to affordable child care, expanding the child tax credit to prevent childhood hunger, supporting individuals and communities struggling with addiction, expanding access to affordable housing, and more.
Congressman Pappas was endorsed by over 100 Granite State veterans this week for his work to make quality health care more accessible for veterans, his legislation that protects whistle blowers, and his efforts to prevent veteran suicides.

"Over two weeks, hundreds of Democrats have filed to run for office.
Friend,
This week concludes the filing period to run for office in New Hampshire, and I could not be more excited about all of the incredible candidates we have running up and down the ticket. A slate of over 400 Granite Staters filed to run for state representative, 28 Granite Staters filed to run for state senate, and a record 11 Democrats are running for the executive council. Democrats are fired up and ready to work for Granite Staters.
Meanwhile, as New Hampshire Republicans are filing for re-election, they are simultaneously refusing to do their jobs. Just yesterday during the historic House session at the University of New Hampshire, Republicans put their extreme, right-wing agenda first, and the people they were elected to serve last. They shamelessly voted against protections for children, against helping renters impacted by COVID-19, against addressing racial profiling and unconscious bias in policing, and against a plan to update our highways.
This is just the latest example of Republicans throwing temper tantrums, obstructing the legislative process, and refusing to do their jobs – which is why it is so critical that we elect Democrats who will fight for Granite Staters and will support implementing paid family medical leave, raising the minimum wage, expanding access to affordable health care, protecting safe and secure elections, and defending a woman's right to choose.
Let’s continue working together to expand our hard-fought majorities in the State House and sweep the executive council, elect a Democratic governor and vote Chris Sununu out of the corner office, re-elect our Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Congresswoman Annie Kuster, Congressman Chris Pappas, and elect Joe Biden to the White House.

### In the State House
Our Democratic State Senators announced the creation of the Granite Promise Proposal, a new package of legislative reforms and initiatives to give Granite Staters economic relief from the coronavirus. This proposal will include permanent increases to New Hampshire’s weekly unemployment insurance benefits, and funds to support our unemployment trust fund, worker safety, family businesses, improvements to computer systems, and protections for homeowners and renters.
Read about the Granite Promise Proposal here
On Thursday, our legislature made history by meeting outside of the State House Chamber for the first time since the Civil War. We are so proud of our Democratic legislators who walked into the University of New Hampshire Whittemore Center Arena with their face masks and protective gear, ready to do their jobs, despite the House Republicans' refusal to do theirs.
### Updates from Our Federal Delegation
Senator Shaheen, a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, passed the annual defense bill through committee – securing significant resources for New Hampshire that will bolster our state’s role in our national defense and security. In addition to a three percent pay raise for service members, Shaheen fought for and is working to deliver $160 million in investments at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard and millions in additional funding to continue the PFAS health impact study she established that has a pilot site at Pease.
Senator Hassan continues to push the Trump administration to get states the personal protective equipment, testing capacity, and other medical supplies that they need. FEMA agreed to Senator Hassan's call to make public a document outlining some projections for personal protective equipment, and Senator Hassan is calling for more answers on what the administration will do to identify and address ongoing needs for critical medical supplies.
Congresswoman Kuster and Congressman Pappas filed for re-election this week! Both Reps. Kuster and Pappas have been working across the aisle to get results for Granite Staters, to make health care more affordable and lower prescription drug costs, to ensure our veterans have access to health care, and to give a voice in Congress to New Hampshire’s small business owners.

"We need to protect our democracy
Friend,
We are witnessing shocking displays of undemocratic behavior from Donald Trump and Chris Sununu, who are trying to use the coronavirus crisis to expand their executive power and limit oversight and accountability.
In addition to his failure to expand testing and make protective equipment widely available, this week Donald Trump threatened to go against the advice of public health experts and force states to re-open, without giving them the resources to safely do so. He also decided to hold up direct aid to Granite Staters, just to have his signature added to the checks. Meanwhile, Chris Sununu is obsessed with taking $1.25 billion in federal COVID-19 funding and funneling it to an unaccountable slush fund that only he controls, violating New Hampshire’s Constitution and possibly delaying relief to Granite Staters who need it most.
These recent actions by Trump and Sununu have only reminded Granite Staters just how much is at stake this November. We must ensure that Trump and Sununu never again use an elected office to advance their self-serving agenda.
That’s why we are continuing to organize. This week, 75 Granite Staters joined our virtual Tuesday Training to learn how to run for State Representative and recruit great candidates in their communities — because we are ready to keep our State House blue, expand our majorities, and elect local leaders who have New Hampshire’s best interests at heart. And, young people across the state participated in virtual trainings hosted by the NHDP, New Hampshire Young Democrats, and the New Hampshire High School Democrats — because they know that issues like voting rights, climate change, and their access to affordable education are on the ballot in November.
Every time Donald Trump, Chris Sununu, and New Hampshire Republicans try to take power from the people, they give us another reason to use our voices and our votes in 200 days – when we will replace them with Democrats who will fight for us, for our rights, and for democracy.

Many aspects of our daily lives are changing as we continue to do what we can to stop the spread of the coronavirus and keep our friends, family, and neighbors safe and healthy. Social distancing, cancelling community events, and staying inside are essential to flatten the curve — which is why Democratic candidates across the state have cancelled fundraising events and rallies, local Democratic committees have cancelled their community meetings or moved them to virtual meetings, and face-to-face conversations with our fellow New Hampshire voters are on hold.
During this time, there's a lot we can still do from home! As we continue to do our part to flatten the curve, check out these 10 things you can do from home to help elect Democrats in November and make lasting change in our state.

This Week's Helper Highlight:
Noticing how the coronavirus had forced everyone in her neighborhood inside, Lindsay Herdman, an Epping resident of 10 years and a mental health therapist, decided to use her passion for photography to spread some positivity.
Lindsay is bringing the “Front Step” movement to New Hampshire, a nationwide initiative where photographers take professional portraits (at a safe distance) of community members on their front porch. The sessions are free, and Lindsay says she accepts donations through her business, Lindsay Marie Photography, for the Epping nonprofit End 68 Hours of Hunger, or she says people can “pay it forward with kindness.” (Photo is courtesy of Lindsay Herdman.

Rep. Mary Jane Wallner, Sen. Lou D’Allesandro, House Speaker Stephen Shurtleff, and Senate President Donna Soucy wrote an op-ed about why Chris Sununu needs to let the Joint Fiscal Committee, an experienced, bipartisan, and accountable committee, “carry out its constitutional role and get Granite Staters the relief they need without delay.”

### In Washington
Senator Shaheen has led bipartisan efforts to ensure that New Hampshire airports would receive federal funding through the CARES Act, and this week she announced that they will receive $15.2 million. New Hampshire's airports have been hit incredibly hard by this crisis, and Senator Shaheen is making sure that they have the funding necessary to keep travel open and available for local businesses and industries.
Senator Hassan was appointed to a new bipartisan White House task force consisting of senators and members of the House of Representatives to provide counsel to the president on reopening the economy in the wake of COVID-19. Senator Hassan’s participation in the president's task force will help ensure that New Hampshire's perspective is heard.
Congresswoman Kuster joined a bipartisan effort calling on congressional leadership to temporarily waive copays for mail-order prescription drugs for TRICARE beneficiaries – service members, military retirees, and their dependents – during the COVID-19 pandemic. This will ensure military families can practice physical distancing and safely access the medications they rely on without increased costs.
Congressman Pappas introduced a bill to guarantee free access to COVID-19 treatment and vaccination for children and low-income New Hampshire residents. This will ensure Granite Staters can access critical health services that will save lives and help public health efforts succeed long-term.

"For you, and what you’re doing to help others during this time.
Friend,
This week, Senator Jeanne Shaheen wrote an op-ed that truly reflects how grateful I feel to be part of our incredible New Hampshire community during these difficult times. “This is one of those moments when I’m reminded they don’t call us Granite Staters for nothing. We are tough in New Hampshire, and we come together to meet the challenges of tough times with persistence, smarts and compassion.”
To echo what Senator Shaheen wrote, in New Hampshire we rise to meet challenges of difficult times and we lift each other up in the process. I’m proud to be a Granite Stater and I’m so encouraged by the way we’ve been supporting one another over the past month. Whether it’s bringing groceries to a neighbor, calling our families, friends, or co-workers to check in, or donating whatever time or resources we have to organizations that are helping our most vulnerable citizens – the smallest acts can make the biggest difference.
I’m also proud to be a Democrat. Our party has always been champions of the middle class and hard working families. We have been fighting for paid family and medical leave, for quality and affordable health care, and for livable wages — because these policies are good for our communities, not just in times of crisis. We are committed to these values because we are committed to taking care of our neighbors, supporting our communities, and ensuring everyone has the opportunity to be successful and live a full life.
There’s no doubt that these are challenging times, but Granite Staters everywhere are stepping up to do their part — because the president of the United States is so severely unwilling and ill-equipped to do his. I want you to know that we’re still here, we’re still fighting for Granite State workers, for families, and for you.
Hang in there. We will get through this one day at a time, by staying positive, and focusing on helping each other.
All the best,
Raymond Buckley, Chair

Matthew LeBlanc, special educator at Dover Middle School, raised $2,115 by running a marathon in his backyard for the Community Food Pantry in Somersworth. LeBlanc decided to run the backyard marathon to keep his students engaged while they study remotely as schools are closed, and to inspire others who are frustrated by the pandemic. He decided to donate the money he raised to the food pantry because he knows students who use it, and thinks more people are going to need it as a result of job losses related to the coronavirus pandemic. Read more about Matt and his backyard marathon here!
### In the State House
Although our Democratic New Hampshire State Senators aren’t able to meet at the State House, they’re still working to ensure Granite Staters, our communities, and small businesses have the resources and support they need during this pandemic.
Our New Hampshire House Democrats are also hard at work for Granite Staters and are gearing up for candidate recruitment! June 3rd - 12th is the filing period to run for state office, and it is fast approaching! If you’re interested in running for state representative or in helping to recruit strong candidates, the first step is to check in with Rachael Thomeer, the House Caucus Director for the Committee to Elect House Democrats (CEHD), and your town or county Democratic chair (you can find their contact information here). CEHD and our town and county chairs are amazing resources and will let you know which towns have candidates and where there are open seats.
And if you don't currently have a Democratic state representative serving your town, consider running yourself!

### In Washington
Thanks to the hard work of our Senator Shaheen, Senator Hassan, Congresswoman Kuster, and Congressman Pappas, New Hampshire is receiving a huge influx of federal funding under the the Coronavirus Aid Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act, which includes at least $1.25 billion set aside for New Hampshire. Because of the work of our delegation, New Hampshire is also receiving an additional $147 million in specific grants to support first responders, and to provide funding for education, low-income heating assistance, and public transit. Our delegation also secured $11.7 million in funding that can be used by local cities and towns for emergency shelters to prevent homelessness and to continue services such as child care, food banks, and community health centers. The final deal that Senator Shaheen, Senator Hassan, Congresswoman Kuster, and Congressman Pappas passed will make a difference for New Hampshire workers, businesses, and families, and we’re grateful to our federal delegation for everything they are doing to fight for us and keep us informed during this crisis.

"I hope you’re staying safe.
Friend,
The last six weeks have been challenging for so many of us in New Hampshire and across the country. I’m heartbroken over the news of Granite Staters who have lost their lives battling the coronavirus, and I want to extend my sincere condolences to the families who are grieving for the loss of their loved ones.
The coronavirus doesn’t care about borders or political parties, age or occupation. The only way we can beat the virus, flatten the curve, and keep one another safe is by staying home – which for many of us has meant not spending time with our loved ones the way we used to. But the moments when we get to hear the voice of someone we love over the phone, or see their smile through a screen, are all the more precious now. And once this is over, the quality time we will spend with our co-workers, friends, and family will mean even more to us than it did before.
I could not be more grateful to our brave nurses and doctors, firefighters, EMTs, and law enforcement who are on the front lines of this crisis, for the essential workers in grocery stores and state services, and for you – for all that you’re doing to help your friends, family, and neighbors weather this storm.
If you’ve been feeling the weight of these difficult times, I want you to know that you’re not alone. We are all still in this together and we will get through it together.

This Week's Helper Highlight:
Dartmouth students Amy Guan and Rine Uhm wanted to find a way to serve essential workers all over the country — from postal workers to grocery store cashiers — who are risking their lives to keep our communities safe. So they launched Give Essential, which directly connects essential workers in New Hampshire and across the country to the household items they need.
“During these uncertain times, a single donation—kids’ toys, a box of tampons, or an extra bottle of shampoo—can make a huge impact for an essential worker on the frontlines,” said Guan. “Give Essential is a peer-to-peer matching platform that connects people with extra household items to essential workers in need.”
Since launching less than two weeks ago, Give Essential has reached 1600+ essential workers and 500+ donors, and has facilitated matches for almost a third of the matches.

### In the State House
This week, Judge Dave Anderson dismissed the lawsuit against Chris Sununu’s unconstitutional power grab of the $1.25 billion in federal coronavirus relief aid on technicality - not merits. Below is the statement from Representative Mary Jane Wallner, Senator Lou D’Allesandro, Senate President Donna Soucy and Speaker Stephen Shurtleff:
“We respectfully disagree with the Court's ruling. The legislature constitutionally holds the “power of the purse,” and the Joint Fiscal Committee is the body that legally approves proposed spending requests by the executive branch during an emergency. This lawsuit is ultimately about a dispute between two equal branches of government and it is appropriate for the third coequal branch of government to settle this disagreement in a timely manner so critical relief to Granite Staters is not delayed. Knowing that time is of the essence it is discouraging that instead of arguing this case on the merits, Governor Sununu continues to put up technical roadblocks on this issue and continues to allow a cloud of constitutional uncertainty to persist over how more than a billion dollars in federal aid is properly provided to our communities.""
Sununu’s unconstitutional power grab reminds us why it is so important that we continue to support and elect strong Democratic leaders. If you’re interested in running for State Representative or if you want to help recruit strong candidates, click below to learn more!

### A Note to Our Federal Delegation
We are so grateful to Senator Shaheen, Senator Hassan, Congresswoman Kuster, and Congressman Pappas for working across the aisle and passing the latest bipartisan Coronavirus response package this week. New Hampshire small businesses and hospitals need urgent help, which is why our delegation fought for a bill that provides much-needed relief for small businesses, workers, and health care providers, and $17 million for COVID-19 testing in New Hampshire. These federal funds will make a big difference to Granite Staters, providing a lifeline to small businesses that are hurting and to health care providers on the front lines of the pandemic. We sincerely thank our federal delegation for everything they are doing to fight for us.
Watch Senator Shaheen Give the Weekly Democratic Address!
Today, our Senator Jeanne Shaheen gave the Weekly Democratic Address, where she discussed the urgent needs she's hearing from Granite Staters and the work that remains to make a difference for those affected by the Coronavirus pandemic. From her home in Madbury, she discussed the new, bipartisan aid package that was just signed into law, which will help small businesses stay afloat, provide emergency funding for New Hampshire health care providers, and increase testing capacity across the state.

"Everything you need to know for these last few days.
Friend,
It’s finally here! The First in the Nation Primary is just days away and Granite Staters could not be more excited to vote for Democrats who have plans to make health care more affordable, protect a woman’s right to choose, take action on climate change, and create an economy that works for everyone.
And, we know that no matter who ends up winning our primary or getting the nomination, we will be united in supporting them and defeating Donald Trump in November.
Amidst the craziness of the next four days, I hope you’ll take advantage of every opportunity to see the candidates, encourage your friends and neighbors to vote, and engage in the uniqueness of the New Hampshire Primary. It truly is one of the most exhilarating weeks in Democratic politics.
The best way to see all of the candidates in one place is at tomorrow night’s McIntyre-Shaheen 100 Club Event, where they’ll be making their final case for why they deserve your vote on Tuesday.

### In the State House
This week, Democrats in the Senate:
* Rejected Senate Bill 651-FN, Republican “Right to Work” (for less) legislation which would weaken labor unions.
* Voted in favor of Senator Tom Sherman’s Senate Bill 646-FN which would require insurers to automatically lower Medicare premium rates when a qualifying individual turns 65. Currently, insurers are not required to send notification of the lowered premium rate resulting in unnecessarily high out-of-pocket costs.
* Passed Senator David Watters’ Senate Bill 583, which adds climate and environmental science to the criteria for adequate science education standards.
* And, the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee voted 5-0 in favor of Senate Bill 496-FN with Senator David Watters’ amendment, which sets up a fund for municipalities to help finance remediation projects in response to PFAS contamination in both drinking water and wastewater treatment.
This week, Democrats in the House:
* Rejected House Bill 1513, a disastrous proposal to convert the Medicaid program to a block grant, which would cap federal Medicaid funding to New Hampshire and lead to reduced access to care.
And, committees in the House held hearings on bills including:
* Representative Josh Adjutant’s House Bill 1370 which would support New Hampshire’s biomass industry and conserve jobs.
### In Washington
Senator Shaheen led the New Hampshire delegation in urging President Trump to fund coronavirus prevention efforts in his budget. The president’s previous FY2020 budget request called for significant funding cuts for the Centers for Disease Control, but Senator Shaheen is working to make sure these agencies have the resources they need to combat and contain this disease and other threats to public health.
Senator Hassan is leading efforts to expand rural broadband access in communities across New Hampshire. She introduced a pair of bills that would provide local governments with innovative financing options for broadband projects, giving states and localities additional resources to invest in rural broadband.
Congresswoman Kuster testified in support of her bill, the Protecting Our Conserved Lands Act, which ensures local voices have a seat at the table to protect conservation lands from natural gas pipeline routes.
Congressman Pappas led a bipartisan letter to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) demanding answers and a plan to resolve Mission Act implementation issues. Mounting unpaid claims have prompted providers to stop caring for veterans and our veterans are suffering as a result. Congressman Pappas’s letter not only calls attention to this issue, but demands answers and assurance from the VA they are working to resolve this issue.

"Democrats will continue working every day to ensure equality for all Granite Staters
Friend,
Tomorrow is the 244th anniversary of our nation’s independence. As we commemorate the progress our country has made because of the generations of activists who fought for civil rights, LGBTQ+ equality, women’s reproductive freedom, disability rights, and more, we should also take this time to acknowledge that we have a long way to go to ensuring liberty and justice for all in America.
We know that the road to creating a more perfect Union will take us well beyond the November election that is only four months away, and we know that we still have a lot of work to do to fully realize our values and ensure equality for all.
I’m optimistic that we will get there and I’m so inspired by the momentous efforts of people in the Black Lives Matter movement, activists in the LGBTQ+ community, and Democrats just like you who are fighting to see the promise of America fulfilled for everyone – regardless of their gender, the color of their skin, who they love, or where they’re from.
On November 3rd, we can continue to build on the progress we’ve made for civil rights and equality and undo the damage Donald Trump, Chris Sununu, and the Republican Party have inflicted on our democracy. We will vote them out and elect Democrats up and down the ticket who will fight to protect the health care of millions of Americans, defend a woman’s right to choose, create a fair economy that works for everyone, and ensure that the progress we make is for all Granite Staters.
We only have four months left. Will you join us?
All the best,
Raymond Buckley, Chair
New Hampshire Democratic Party

### In the State House
On Tuesday, Democrats in the State House voted in concurrence with the State Senate on legislation that would improve the lives of Granite Staters by:
* Ensuring that New Hampshire providers and long-term care facilities impacted by COVID-19 receive the essential support and funding they need
* Establishing an independent redistricting commission to end gerrymandering in New Hampshire
* Preventing at-risk Granite Staters from hurting themselves or others with a firearm
* Removing the civil statute of limitations on sexual assault, banning police chokeholds, mandating reports of officer misconduct, and more
* Re-establishing and raising the minimum wage
* Improving access to special education and behavioral health services for students
* Making prescription drugs more affordable by importing the same quality medications at a more affordable rate from Canada, capping the price of insulin, and more
* Expanding rights and protections for sexual assault and domestic violence survivors
* Protecting Granite Staters' constitutional right to vote without risking their health
* And more!
### Updates from Our Federal Delegation
Senator Shaheen introduced the PFAS Free Military Purchasing Act, which would prohibit the Department of Defense from procuring items that contain harmful PFAS contaminants. This will help protect our service members and their families from exposure to the dangerous chemical.
Senator Hassan urged the Department of Housing and Urban Development to help assist renters by facilitating tenant-landlord mediations, an eviction prevention strategy that will help vulnerable Granite Staters following the lifting of New Hampshire’s eviction moratorium. The moratorium was established to prevent people from being evicted if they couldn't afford their rent due to job losses from COVID-19.
Congresswoman Kuster unveiled the Opportunity and Justice for All Agenda which outlines legislation she supports that will help our nation dismantle and address institutional racism, police brutality, health disparities, unequal economic opportunity, and voter suppression so we can create a more just society for all Americans.
Congressman Pappas helped develop a comprehensive, five-year transportation and infrastructure package that the House passed this week. The legislation incorporates key New Hampshire priorities championed by Pappas, including funding for connected pedestrian trails, a Manchester to Boston commuter rail, and cleaning up PFAS in our waterways.

Many aspects of our daily lives have changed as we all do what we can to stop the spread of the coronavirus and keep our friends, family, and neighbors safe and healthy.

"Join us and Senator Jeanne Shaheen this week.
Hey Alex,
This Wednesday at 6:00pm, Organize NH will be kicking off our FIRST Women to Women Phone Bank with Senator Jeanne Shaheen! Join us for a conversation with our senator before hopping on the phone to talk to women across the state about the importance of voting for Democrats up and down the ballot, as well as how to safely cast their vote this fall. We'll start with a training before making calls to voters, so all you'll need is a computer and a phone — and a friend to make calls with you!

"Have you committed to #VoteFromHome in 2020 yet?
Hey Alex, Happy 100 Days!
100 Days, 15 Weekends, 4 Months, only 1 chance to defeat Donald Trump! We know it may feel like election day is far away, but it’s not too early to be making a plan to vote. Just as going to work, volunteering, and hanging out with our friends and family look different this year, voting will too! That’s why we are asking you to commit to vote at home now and think about your plan to vote from home this fall.
Just like wearing a mask, voting from home is an easy way to help stop the spread of COVID-19 while still being able to cast your vote for Democrats up and down the ballot. Any eligible voter in New Hampshire is able to vote absentee this year by checking the box on the absentee ballot application stating, “I am unable to vote in person due to concern for the novel coronavirus (COVID-19)”.
#### We need your help to make sure every eligible Granite Stater is able to safely cast their ballot in 2020! Once you’ve committed to vote at home, help your friends and family make a plan to vote safely by sending this form to them:
COMMIT TO VOTE IN 2020!
Thank you for keeping New Hampshire safe for all of us!

"Tell the NH GOP to stop discriminating against LGBTQ+ Granite Staters.
####
Alex, sign the petition to the New Hampshire GOP: drop discrimination against LGBTQ+ Granite Staters from your party platform and embrace equality for all.
June is Pride Month – a time to celebrate the LGBTQ+ community and the progress that has been made in the fight for equality, and to recommit to working to ensure that LGBTQ+ individuals have equal rights and opportunities in all aspects of life.
But the New Hampshire Republican Party’s current platform includes a hateful relic that should be confined to history, stating that marriage is a “legal and sacred union between one man and one woman.”
Today, we’re calling on the New Hampshire Republican Party to drop this discriminatory missive from its party platform and embrace equality for all Granite Staters.
CLICK TO ADD YOUR NAME TO OUR PETITION
This week 11 years ago, New Hampshire became one of the first states in the nation to make same-sex marriage the law of the land. Yet, more than a decade later, the New Hampshire Republican Party and its candidates continue to oppose equal rights for LGBTQ+ Granite Staters. Both Republicans running for U.S. Senate have attacked the LGBTQ+ community – with Don Bolduc opposing marriage equality and Corky Messner calling the fight for transgender equality “horrific."" And GOP congressional candidate Matt Mowers led the NH GOP when this discrimination was voted into its party platform.
A change to the New Hampshire Republican platform is long overdue. By signing this petition, you can help us send a message loud and clear that love is love, and there's no place for bigotry in the Granite State.
Thank you for making your voice heard — and Happy Pride.

"Join me in saying thanks.
Alex,
This week, I wanted to take a moment and say thank you to our firefighters, nurses, and teachers for their courage, resilience, and strength – at all times, but especially during this unprecedented crisis. The past few months have shown us what we’ve always known to be true – that our communities are filled with heroes who rise to meet the challenges of difficult times. Our firefighters, nurses, and teachers deserve our thanks, deserve to be paid a living wage and retire with dignity, and deserve to have elected leaders who value them and fight for them.
Monday was International Firefighters Day. I want to thank our firefighters for always being on the frontlines of emergencies, and especially now for the sacrifices they’re making every day to keep us safe.
Today is National Nurses Day, and I want to thank our nurses for doing everything they can – under extraordinarily dangerous conditions – to care for those who are battling coronavirus, knowing full well they’re risking their health for ours.
And, this week is National Teacher Appreciation Week, so I want to thank our teachers for going above and beyond to ensure New Hampshire students are continuing to receive a quality education, aren’t left behind during the transition from in-person to remote learning, and feel cared for during this difficult time.
While our nurses, firefighters, and teachers are facing unprecedented challenges compounded by Donald Trump’s chaotic mismanagement of this crisis, which has led to a shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) and testing, they are still doing everything they can to keep us safe and healthy.
#### Will you join me in saying thank you to our firefighters, nurses, and teachers?
Though it may be a small gesture, it’s important to let our firefighters, nurses, and teachers know that we appreciate all that they’re doing for us.

All the best,
Ray

Together, we can send Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to the White House, elect Dan Feltes as our next governor, re-elect Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Congresswoman Annie Kuster, and Congressman Chris Pappas, and protect and expand our majorities in the State House, State Senate, and on the Executive Council. Every vote, in every election, matters.

If it has not yet been marked as ""received,"" you can go to your local polling place now and ask whether they have received your absentee ballot.

We’re also working every day to elect Democrats up and down the ballot — from the State House to the White House. But Alex, we need your help if we’re going to win in November. Can we count on you to rush a contribution today?

"I am devastated.
####
Dear friend,
I wanted to reach out and send you a note that I, like you, am devastated by the murder of George Floyd.
Ahmaud Arbery.
Breonna Taylor.
And so many more.
I'm devastated that police brutality has hurt generations of Black families and is a daily reality these communities are forced to face.
I'm devastated that our president chooses to fan the flames of violence, while our governor remains silent.
And I'm devastated that those who are raising their voices across the country have been met with violence, even right here in the Granite State.
We stand with all those across New Hampshire who have marched and protested for justice this past week, and will continue to in the weeks ahead. The officers responsible for George Floyd's murder must be held accountable, and the institutional racism and police violence that has stolen the lives of countless Black Americans must end. I hope you'll join me in calling for justice, saying the names of those who have been killed, supporting leaders who will hold power to account, and having difficult conversations about systemic racism with the people in our lives.
This conversation is not over, and so long as Black men and women cannot breathe, we cannot rest.
If you are looking for additional ways to take action and are financially able, please consider donating to one or more of the organizations promoting racial justice below.

"and allow COVID-19 relief funds to quickly get to communities across the state.
####
Alex, sign the petition to tell Governor Sununu: Follow the New Hampshire Constitution and allow COVID-19 relief funds to quickly get to communities across the state.
Last week, Governor Sununu announced that he wants a new, unaccountable bureaucracy to make final decisions about where the $1.25 billion in COVID-19 relief funds for NH will go.
Sununu is trying to turn federal relief funds for our state into his personal slush fund — to distribute them without oversight, without checks and balances, and without legislative approval.
The bipartisan Joint Fiscal Committee is the fastest and most efficient way to get this funding to Granite Staters who need it most. It's already established, it has experience approving funds during emergencies, and it ensures this process is transparent and accountable.
Instead of working with the legislature like the New Hampshire constitution mandates, Sununu is wasting precious time trying to give his office sole authority over the distribution of federal COVID-19 funds. This move is irresponsible, unaccountable, and illegal – and it could delay much-needed pandemic relief for our state.
CLICK TO ADD YOUR NAME TO OUR PETITION
By signing this petition, you can help ensure these relief funds are distributed equitably and to the people who need them most, and that we emerge from this pandemic with our system of government still intact.
Thank you for helping us make sure this is done right,

Click here to RSVP for this important event today!
Some voting processes have been adapted this year to keep voters safe during the COVID-19 pandemic, and this town hall event will provide an opportunity for Granite Staters to ask voting experts all of their questions about how to register and vote in 2020. You're invited to attend!
What: A Virtual New Hampshire Voter Information Town Hall
When: Thursday, August 6, 2020 from 6:30pm - 7:30pm
Where: This will be an online event - hosted on Facebook Live. It is a free event and is open to all. RSVP here to receive information on how to join the virtual town hall.

That's why we're doing everything we can to make sure all eligible Granite Staters have the information they need to vote in the September 8th state primary and November 3rd general election. We believe that when more people vote, democracy wins!

"Put small business relief ahead of big corporate profits!
####
Alex, sign the petition to Donald Trump and Chris Sununu: Put small business relief ahead of corporate profits!
While our leaders should be focused on customer and worker safety and getting relief to small businesses who need it most, Donald Trump and Chris Sununu are instead pushing a scheme that absolves large corporations of all responsibility to keep their customers and workers safe from COVID-19.
As New Hampshire reopens, front line and essential workers need to know that our government is making their safety a priority. But instead, Trump and Sununu are trying to give corporations ""immunity"" if they fail to take common-sense, reasonable steps to prevent the spread of coronavirus to their employees or customers. This scheme would allow corporations to disregard health and safety precautions to maximize their own profits.
Republicans have been pushing corporate immunity for decades, and now, they aren't letting a crisis go to waste. It’s no surprise Chris Sununu supports it, since he’s prioritized the profits of large corporations over Granite Staters at every turn.
This sham plan would disincentivize small businesses who are doing everything right — and give a competitive advantage to the businesses that decide to cut corners at the expense of worker and customer health and safety. This is wrong for New Hampshire, and could allow further spread of COVID-19. Workers need more protections right now, not fewer.
CLICK TO ADD YOUR NAME TO OUR PETITION
By signing this petition, you can help us send a message loud and clear that Granite Staters won't stand for the Trump-Sununu agenda of putting corporate special interests first and everybody else last.

"Troubling news from [[URL REDACTED]] you seen the results?
Alex,
In Tuesday's primary for the special election in Hooksett, Republican voters selected town budget committee member Elliot Axelman, a staunch Libertarian with ties to the Free State movement. Among many other troubling and outlandish positions, he is a climate change denier who has stated that “‘global warming’ is a corrupt, authoritarian agenda created by politicians,” and accused Democrats of trying to make it illegal to use cars.
I could go on and describe other positions he’s taken publicly, like his commitment to vote to sustain Gov. Sununu’s vetoes if elected, but I think you get the idea.
In the general election on March 10th, Democratic Candidate Kathy Martins has a chance to prevent Axelman and his bizarre proposals from reaching the House Chamber in Concord. However, like many districts in New Hampshire where Democrats struggle to get elected, Republicans have a significant registration advantage. We believe Kathy has what it takes to win this election, but it's going to be an uphill battle.
In our efforts to strengthen our majority in the House in 2020, every seat counts. Electing Democrats in historically Republican districts like Hooksett is how we gained a majority in 2018, and our top priority in 2020.
Take a stand against Republican candidates like Axelman and the risks they present to Granite Staters by making a contribution to the Committee to Elect House Democrats today.
Your donation at any level supports our efforts to hold our majority, so we can serve the people of NH by passing legislation to address the opioid epidemic, increase access to affordable healthcare, provide public school funding and more.
Alex, can I count on you to rush a contribution today?
Thank you,

"Dear Alex,
With the First in the Nation Primary less than two weeks away, it’s no surprise that presidential candidates are dominating the national conversation. The importance of selecting a Democratic nominee to run against Donald Trump in 2020 can not be understated. However, I urge you to remember that the fight to defeat the president is not the only battle that Democrats will be fighting in 2020.
In 2018, we made history by flipping 66 seats from red to blue and electing the largest Democratic majority in the New Hampshire House since 2006 with 233 members. This was a huge victory for Democrats, but we cannot take anything for granted. The state legislators we elect in November will be responsible for redistricting; the process of drawing new electoral districts for Congress and state offices based on new census figures.
Re-electing a Democratic majority that makes independent redistricting a priority will end gerrymandering and ensure fair electoral districts for all Granite Staters.
If we lose our majority, and Republicans control this process, the next Democratic President will be forced to contend with a gerrymandered, uncooperative, and conservative Congress for the next ten years. That’s why the Committee to Elect House Democrats is already hard at work building an operation capable of delivering a Democratic victory in 2020--but with over 400 seats in play, we simply cannot do it without your help.
Monthly recurring contributions at every level provide us with consistent funding we can count on every month. We rely on these contributions to support our program in the tough months ahead.
Join our small group of dedicated monthly recurring donors by making a recurring contribution today. Can I count on you?
Sincerely,
Doug Ley

"Dear Alex,
I hope you’re doing alright.
The health and safety of our supporters is our top priority, so we made the decision to postpone all of our in-person fundraisers this spring. But, I’m going to cut to the chase–this has had a major impact on our fundraising efforts. Now, in order to meet our goals, we are relying on our online grassroots supporters like you to help us stay on track.
As we practice social distancing, my team and I are working hard to make sure we have the resources we need to run a successful program, and re-elect and grow our Democratic majority in 2020. In light of recent events, we’ll need to rely more on direct mail, literature, and social media ads to connect with voters. As you know, these tools cost money.
In these difficult times, contributions of any amount can help us get closer to reaching our goal. Can you pitch in today to help us stay on track?
And a special thank you to those who support our efforts through monthly recurring contributions. These donations are critical to our success in the uncertain months ahead. If you haven’t already, become a recurring donor today.
Stay safe,

"You're the first to know about an exciting new project we're launching today.
Hi Alex,
We're launching an exciting new project today with our friends in the NH Senate and Executive Council! In a minute, we're going to ask for your help, but first here is some important background: In 2016, 20% of Granite Staters voted for President then left blanks on their ballot for State Representative. In 2018, 33 State Representative seats were decided by 100 votes or less. Every. Vote. Counts.
Your State Representatives make decisions on health care, reproductive rights, public school funding, workers' rights, and so much more that impacts the daily lives of Granite Staters. When you cast your ballot, make sure you vote for Democrats all the way down the ticket, don't skip any office.
Alex, We're asking you to sign the Full Ballot Promise to commit to filling out your entire ballot. Click here to add your name.
If you've already voted do your part by asking 3 friends to sign this pledge and fill out their full ballot on or before November 3rd. You and your friends could be the deciding factor in whether or not Democrats protect our majorities in the State House, Senate, and Executive Council.
There is so much at stake and so little time. Thank you for everything that you are doing to elect Democrats up and down the ballot!

"Join me in wishing Representative Mary Jane Wallner a happy birthday!
Alex,
Did you know that today is my friend Mary Jane Wallner's birthday?
In her 40 years in the New Hampshire House, Representative Wallner has been fierce advocate for issues that affect hard working Granite State including paid family and medical leave, supporting our public schools, and countless other worthy causes. Her leadership and dedication to New Hampshire is unmatched and I feel lucky to be serving beside her in the House.
She has been a mentor and friend to so many State Representatives over the years, myself included, and I want to make sure she knows how much we appreciate her today.
Last year, as Chair of the House Finance Committee, Mary Jane led the effort to craft a budget of which we can all be proud; one that returned over $178 million to cities and towns by restoring revenue sharing for the first time in 2 decades!
For the past few years, Mary Jane has served as the treasurer of the Committee to Elect House Democrats. She keeps track of all of our expenses and, when we spoke earlier today, she let me know that we are coming up a little short on our fundraising goal for the final 9 days of the campaign.
Will you join me in making a contribution to the Committee to Elect House Democrats today to celebrate Mary Jane’s birthday?
Thank you,
Steve

"Dear Alex,
In 2018 we made history by flipping the NH House from red to blue and electing one of the the largest and most diverse Democratic caucuses in New Hampshire history. Since then, being in the majority has allowed us to make significant progress on expanding access to affordable healthcare, preventing gun violence, promoting paid family and medical leave, and so much more.
We're proud of our success this session, but with 400 seats in play in November, we can't take anything for granted.
Republicans are already hard at work raising money and recruiting candidates to retake the majority. Democratic candidates and incumbents in historically red and purple districts are especially vulnerable. Can you pitch in $10 today to help defend our majority?
If we are successful in re-electing a Democratic majority in 2020, we will be able to continue to make life better and level the playing field for hard working Granite Staters. If we lose, House Republicans with long records of blocking progress, and putting corporate special interests first at the expense of New Hampshire families will be in total control of the legislative agenda.
We just can't let that happen. Donate today to keep the NH House Blue in 2020.

"Dear Alex,
The NH Committee to Elect House Republicans just released a statement claiming to have out-raised House Democrats this period. They intend to spend this money doing everything they can to re-take their majority in the NH House.
I’m grateful for everyone of you who has stepped up so far, but let me be direct—we need your help now more than ever. Unlike the GOP, who rely on big checks from special interest donors, grassroots supporters like you are the backbone of our campaign.
Join our team of grassroots donors by pitching in 20.20 today.
The good news? A late surge in big checks from lobbyists and special interest donors does not change the fact that we have many more donors and grassroots contributions, and have raised almost nine times more than the GOP from grassroots supporters who have given under $25.
Rather than wasting thousands of dollars on dangerous in-person fundraisers for special interests and high dollar donors, we have prioritized investing in actual candidate support. We're helping our candidates directly, but we're counting on your contributions if we’re going to continue to provide this critical support in the months ahead.
We cannot afford to be outraised or outspent. To be blunt—we still need many of you to make your first donation if we hope to be successful in re-electing our majority in November.
Onward,
DL

Dear Alex,
As the Treasurer of the Committee to Elect House Democrats, it’s my job to make sure we have the resources we need to succeed in re-electing (and growing!) our Democratic majority in November.
I’ve served in the House for 40 years, and the challenges we’re facing this year are unprecedented. We can't take anything for granted this year, and we’re going to have to work harder than ever in order to be successful in November. We set a huge grassroots fundraising goal to close out August, to make sure we have the resources to scale up this campaign in the tough weeks ahead.
But, I’m sorry to have to tell you that we are coming up short on our goal, and the NH GOP has taken notice. I’m hoping you can help make up the difference. Can I count on you to pitch in $20.20 to get us back on track to protect our majority in November?
In tough times like these, every dollar helps provide substantive candidate support. We are grateful for contributions of any amount that move us closer to our goals. So, if it’s feasible for you today, I hope you’ll pitch in.

In 2018, we flipped the House from red to blue, but we need all hands on deck to make sure that we stay in the majority this year so we can continue fighting for affordable health care, paid family and medical leave, fair wages and working conditions, quality public schools, and so much more.
Here are some key numbers:
394 Democrats running for State Representative (record breaking!)
234 Seats that Democrats currently hold in the NH House
201 Women candidates
118 First time candidates
33 Seats that were decided by 100 votes or less in 2018
15 days until Election day!
Alex, I don't need to tell you how much is at stake in this election. Can I count on you to rush a contribution today to help protect our majority in the State House?

"Dear Friend,
When I decided to run for State Representative in 2018, the response I got from many in my community was one of concerned disbelief. While they welcomed my candidacy, they asked, “how can you possibly beat a 37-year incumbent Republican who is the Speaker of the House?”
Well, it turned out that our team was able to accomplish the impossible when our district became one of 66 that flipped from red to blue in 2018 and I was elected as State Representative for Bartlett, Jackson, and Hart’s Location.
I made the decision to run for State Representative because I was concerned about where our country was headed. Serving my community on the state level was an opportunity to work on legislation that makes life better for NH families. Since regaining our Democratic majority in 2018, our caucus has prioritized fighting for a decent living wage, common sense gun safety, a woman’s right to control her own body, adequate funding for public education, and so much more.
But in 2020—it's clear that we can’t take anything for granted. We must protect our majority in the State House to continue to work towards the values we cherish.
The best way to help make that happen is by contributing the Committee to Elect House Democrats, the only organization whose entire mission is to elect a Democratic Majority in the NH House in 2020. Electing candidates and vulnerable incumbents in districts like mine is crucial to achieving this goal.
With the support of the Committee to Elect House Democrats, our little engine of committed volunteers worked to ensure my election in 2018. Can you pitch in $20.20 to help us flip more seats like mine and re-elect a Democratic majority this November?
Warmly,
Rep. Anita Burroughs

"Dear Friend,
Yesterday, the New Hampshire House of Representatives returned to the UNH Whittemore Center Arena for the final day of the 2018-2020 session to vote to uphold or override the Governor's 22 vetoes.
This was an opportunity to come together to overturn Governor Sununu’s reckless vetoes of legislation providing protections from evictions, establishing paid family medical leave, and many more urgently needed bills for struggling Granite Staters.
That is not what happened. Many of these bills were developed with bipartisan collaboration, had Republican sponsors, and passed with support from members of both parties. However, House Republicans abandoned their responsibilities to the people of NH and banded together to uphold every single one of the Governor’s 22 vetoes.
Pitch in to help vote out House Republicans who are standing in the way of progress.
Despite months of collaboration and compromise across the aisle, these are just a few of the bills that failed to earn the support from GOP Legislators needed for a veto override.
* HB 1247: Would have provided temporary and targeted support for NH residents struggling to pay their rent or mortgage due to covid-19.
* HB 73: Compromise legislation raising the minimum wage for NH workers
* SB 159: Bipartisan bill encouraging the development of small-scale renewable energy in NH and reducing energy costs for consumers
* HB 250: Provided access to Dental Coverage to Adults on Medicaid
Throughout the day, House Republicans demonstrated their disrespect for the constituents they were elected to serve. Republican legislators repeatedly interrupted to boo or shout, snuck in beer to day-drink during House Session, stormed out mid-speech....
Not to mention the 40+ Republican Representatives who compromised the safety of the entire legislature, UNH students and staff by refusing to wear masks during a pandemic!
Pitch in TODAY to hold these elected officials accountable on Election Day.
Time and time again, House Republicans have shown us their willingness to put partisan politics over the urgent needs of the people of New Hampshire. Hard working Granite Staters deserve Representatives who take their struggles seriously, and won’t abandon NH families when it matters most.
The House session may have ended, but with election day on the horizon, our work is far from over. Donate $20.20 today to help us protect and expand our majority on November 3rd.
Onward,
DL

"Today is a special day!
Dear Alex,
Today is a special day! Not only is it 26 days until Election Day, but it is also our Deputy Caucus Director, Julia Derby’s birthday!
Julia has been a member of our Committee to Elect House Democrats team for over a year now and, before joining our staff, she worked to elect NH Democrats up and down the ballot in the 2018 election. I know that all of the candidates who have worked with Julia will agree: we are so lucky to have her on the team!
I have an important meeting coming up with Julia and the rest of our team to decide where to send extra support in these final few weeks. In 2018, 33 races were decided by less than 100 votes, so we can’t leave anything to chance.
Can you rush a contribution today to celebrate Julia’s birthday and to help us expand the support we are offering to candidates, particularly in tight contests, in these critical final weeks?
Alex, we can’t take anything for granted or wake up on November 4th wishing that we had done more. The time to get involved is now. If you have never made a contribution to the Committee to Elect House Democrats, I urge you to give what you can today.
We’re celebrating Julia’s birthday today, let’s do all we can to make sure we have a lot more to celebrate this November!
Sincerely,
Rep. Mary Jane Wallner

"Dear Alex,
There are just 50 days between today and election day.
Fifty days left to make phone calls, send mailers, spread the word online, talk to friends and neighbors, and do everything we possibly can to elect Democrats up and down the ballot in 2020. From the Presidential race, all the way down to the 390+ Democrats running to serve in the NH House this year, the outcome of these races will be determined by our successes in the next fifty days.
It goes without saying that this campaign cycle is unprecedented and presents unique challenges for candidates. Increased reliance on mail and digital tools to connect with voters come at a significant added cost. The Committee to Elect House Democrats Team is working hard to meet this increased need and provide essential candidate support to the record number of Democrats running for NH House this year.
Can you pitch in 20.20 today to ensure we have the resources we need to win in November?
If we lose, House Republicans with long records of blocking progress, and putting corporate special interests first at the expense of New Hampshire families will be in total control of the legislative agenda.
We just can't let that happen. Donate today to keep the NH House Blue in 2020.

"I have some good news and you’re the first to know.
Good morning Alex,
Rachael here--House Caucus Director of the Committee to Elect House Democrats. Two weeks ago, we were excited to announce that over 400 Democrats had filed to run for over 380 seats in the NH House in 2020. Today, now that we have updated numbers from the Secretary of State, I wanted you to be the first to know some very important news.
I am thrilled to announce that we have recruited more candidates to run for the NH House in 2020 than any party–ever–in New Hampshire history!
In 2018, House Democrats set the all time record by recruiting Democrats to run in 388 seats. This year, not only do we have 425 incredible candidates who stepped up to run, but we have Democrats running in 391 out of 400 seats - 97.75%!
We’re especially proud to have more Democrats competing in historically red and purple districts than ever before. We have plans to provide extensive campaign support to all of our 425 dynamic candidates, but we need your help to make it happen.
Can you make a contribution today? Every dollar raised will allow us to provide more support to our record-breaking 425 candidates for NH State Representative.
Granite Staters are facing so many pressing concerns that hang in the balance this election year. Facing these challenges, 425 Democratic candidates chose to step up to do the hard work of campaigning because they understand the importance of strong leadership when times are tough. House Democrats are energized and stepping up like never before to make positive change in their districts.
Decisions are made by those who show up. Please join me in applauding these brave candidates for showing up and fighting for the opportunity to serve their communities in the legislature.
Show your support for these inspiring leaders, and do your part to help us re-elect a Democratic majority by pitching in $20.20 today. Make it a recurring contribution to continue your support in the tough months ahead!
Thank you for your continued support,
Rachael

Dear Alex,
I hope you’re doing okay. Here at the Committee to Elect House Democrats, nothing is more important to us than the well-being of our community. Our hearts go out to the many families across our state who have already been impacted by COVID-19.
In times like this, when the stakes are so high, it has never been more critical to have elected leaders we can trust.
The ongoing pandemic presents challenges unlike any our country has faced before. It’s more clear than ever that we need elected leaders who are proactive, who think creatively, and who understand the ways this crisis affects families and businesses in our state.
This term, House Democrats have prioritized paid family and medical leave, improving access to quality and affordable health care, reducing barriers to receive unemployment benefits, and expanding voting rights to include no excuse absentee voting. We believe that these are essential policies to have during normal times, but they are especially critical during a pandemic.
The future is uncertain, and it's hard to know when this crisis will end. One thing we do know for sure is that we’ll need all hands on deck, and state legislators that we trust to help families and workers recover from the unprecedented impacts of this crisis. The State Reps we elect in 2020 will be the ones making decisions on how to respond to these needs and rebuild our communities.
I know that funds are tight everywhere right now, but if you are able to make a contribution of any size, even $5, you will help us meet our March goal and allow us to continue working to sustain the Democratic majority in the NH House that will be crucial to lead us out of this crisis.
Please chip in today, if you can. Alex, hoping you and your family stay safe and healthy during this time.
Take care,
NH Committee to Elect House Democrats

Subject: FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: Over 400 Democratic Candidates File for State House
For immediate release:
June 12, 2020
Over 400 Democratic Candidates File for State House
Concord, N.H. - Today, Stephen Shurtleff, Speaker of the New Hampshire House and Leader of the Committee to Elect House Democrats, released the below statement following today’s historic candidate filing period in which more than 400 Democratic candidates filed for the State House:
“We are proud to announce that the New Hampshire House Democrats have over 400 candidates running in over 380 seats statewide.”
“In a year that has already presented unprecedented challenges for Granite Staters, we're proud to have so many dedicated citizens step up to serve their communities when it matters most. That our Democractic candidates are willing to do this critically important work, even in these challenging times, is a testament to their commitment to public service.”
“I have been fortunate to speak with many candidates who have shared the powerful stories and experiences behind their motivation to do the hard work of campaigning and serving in the House. While we all share different perspectives, we are united in our commitment to improve the lives of the people of New Hampshire by addressing the impacts of the ongoing pandemic, taking substantive action to address systemic bias in law enforcement, making health care more affordable, and ensuring adequate resources for our students and schools.”
“Unlike our Republican counterparts, who demonstrated their unwillingness to do the people’s work by voting to abandon countless important bills in yesterday’s House session, Democrats understand what it takes to make meaningful progress on the issues that matter most to Granite Staters. The people of New Hampshire deserve State Representatives who are willing to put in the work to serve all Granite Staters, not just the few.”
Background:
In November 2018, Democrats flipped 66 seats from red to blue and elected a robust majority with 233 [[URL REDACTED]] year’s filing numbers demonstrate that Democrats are energized and equipped to compete in virtually every district across New Hampshire - no matter how red.
Here are some notable preliminary statistics about the Democrats who will expand our State House majority in 2020:
* More than 400 candidates for 380 seats
* 202 women
* 114 first time candidates
* 71 young Democrats
* 45 educators

"Dear Alex,
In 2019, the Committee to Elect House Democrats has been hard at work hiring staff, recruiting and training candidates, raising money, and building a strong program for the 2020 election. This work was made possible thanks to our generous supporters, like you, who understand the importance of retaining our Democratic majority in the State House in 2020.
In the year ahead, we have ambitious goals to expand our program by hiring regional campaign managers, who will work closely with and provide essential campaign support to hundreds of Democratic candidates across the state.
We’re proud of our historic success in 2018--when we recruited a record number of candidates and retook control of the State House by electing a historically diverse Democratic majority. But, we’re not taking anything for granted. That’s why in 2020, we’re expanding our program, and plan to recruit more candidates, re-elect more Democratic incumbents, and flip even more Republican seats than we did in 2018.
Monthly recurring contributions at every level play a major role in ensuring we have the resources we need to achieve these goals in the months ahead.
Will you commit to supporting our efforts to keep the State House blue in 2020 by making a recurring contribution today?

"This coming Tuesday, voters will cast their ballots to elect a new State Representative in Hooksett.
Dear Alex,
This coming Tuesday, voters in Hooksett will cast their ballots to elect a new Representative to serve in the New Hampshire State House. In their primary on January 21st, Republicans selected Elliot Axelman, a staunch Libertarian who moved to Hooksett in 2017 in support of the Free State Project, a political movement with the objective of New Hampshire seceding from the United States. And that's not all, here are just a few of Axelman’s radical ideas (from his recently deleted twitter account).
Can you rush a donation to help fight this extreme agenda in New Hampshire?
Despite the odds being stacked against her, Democratic candidate Kathleen Martins has been hard at work knocking on doors, and talking to voters about her commitment to advocate for the working people of Hooksett. As an educator and local activist with deep ties in her community, Kathy understands the need to increase access to affordable healthcare, ensure adequate funding for our public schools, and well paying jobs for Hooksett families.
Hooksett voters deserve better than Elliot Axelman’s radical beliefs. Can you pitch in to help elect Democrats like Kathy in red districts across the state?
* Axelman supports abolishing Medicaid and cutting critical services for Hooksett families
* Axelman does not believe in public education - supports cutting funding for public schools in favor of school voucher programs
* Axelman called climate change “the biggest hoax in human history.”
The bottom line: Kathy Martins will work hard for bipartisan solutions in Concord. Elliot Axelman doesn’t believe in government.
Show your support for candidates like Kathy, fighting for fair and reasonable Democratic representation in Concord by rushing $20 TODAY!
Thank you for your support.

"Today, the NH House issued reprimands to 7 Representatives who violated House Rules and failed to attend mandatory sexual harassment training. This is serious. A reprimand hasn’t been issued in 15 years.
Dear Alex,
Yesterday, the NH House issued reprimands to 7 Representatives who violated House Rules and failed to attend mandatory sexual harassment training. This is serious. A reprimand hasn’t been issued in 15 years.
In 2018, House Democrats knew that we needed to do more to prevent sexual harassment in the workplace. That’s why, after retaking the majority, we called for mandatory sexual harassment training for all Reps, and with the support of legislators on both sides of the aisle, we implemented this new rule.
Democrats are committed to making the workplace safer for everyone, but these few Republican Representatives refused to attend a single training. This is unacceptable.
Join us in condemning these Republican Representatives and support our efforts to VOTE THEM OUT by making a $20.20 contribution to the Committee to Elect House Democrats today.
Your support will help unseat House Republicans like those listed above, flip more seats from red to blue, and re-elect a dynamic Democratic majority in 2020.

Have you heard the news? The Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee just announced its first slate of Spotlight Endorsements, which aim to highlight the work of Democratic legislators, and support their efforts to elect Democratic majorities in State Houses across the country in 2020.
Join us in congratulating Rep. Liz McConnell and Rep. Sue Mullen for being among the first 10 candidates to receive this honor in New Hampshire!
Both first term members of the House, Reps McConnell and Mullen made history by defeating Republican incumbents and flipping their seats from red to blue for the first time in their districts in over a decade. Since getting elected, both have been instrumental in the fights to secure adequate funding for education, expand access to affordable healthcare, and provide property tax relief to hardworking granite staters.
Our Democratic Caucus is eager to continue working hard to advance legislation that serves the people of our state. But—to continue making progress, we must remain in the majority.
We’re so grateful for Rep. McConnell and Rep. Mullen for their commitment to run again in 2020, as well as exciting new candidates like Diane Hanley, Nikki Fordey, and Ed Rajsteter, who also received spotlight endorsements from the DLCC.
Your contribution supports our efforts to protect incumbents like Liz and Sue in vulnerable districts, recruit and train candidates, flip more seats from red to blue, and re-elect a Democratic majority in 2020.

"New State House polling available: too close to call.
Hi Alex,
Yesterday, a new poll was released that shows Republicans retaking the majority in the NH House. From the Granite State Poll report: ""[[URL REDACTED]] findings translate into a predicted 207 seats for Republicans and 193 seats for Democrats.""
Can you help us fight back and defend our majority?
Alex, we cannot afford to lose this election, there's too much at stake. Affordable health care, reproductive health, paid family and medical leave, quality public schools, workers rights, and so much more are on the ballot this year.
The good news is that the election is not over yet! We still have 13 days before voting ends to change the outcome and make sure Democrats protect and expand our majority in the NH House. I'm counting on you to chip in today to help us redouble our efforts in key swing districts across the state.

"Wanted to make sure you saw the results from last night.
Dear Alex,
I'll keep this brief, but I wanted to make sure you saw the exciting results from yesterday's Special Election for State Rep. in Hooksett.
Kathleen Martins (D) - 1000
Elliot Axelman (R) - 961
Flipping this seat from red to blue is a HUGE victory for NH Democrats--in a town where Trump won by 10 points in 2016!
Yesterday, Hooksett voters across the political spectrum came together to reject Axelman and his plans to abolish medicare, cut funding for our public schools, and push NH to succeed from the United States.
Democrat Kathleen Martins is an educator and union member with deep ties in her community. Unlike her opponent, she will represent working people in Hooksett, and advocate for practical policies that actually benefit NH families. Kathleen's historic victory shows that the the State Legislature is no place for Elliot Axelman and his radical and divisive agenda.
We're so proud of Kathy's success, but our work is just beginning. We're counting on your support to flip more seats from red to blue, and elect Democrats in tough districts across the State.
Alex, can you pitch in $25 today to help us win big in 2020?

"Dear Alex,
When the Covid-19 pandemic hit, we knew that Granite Staters were relying on their elected Representatives to do the jobs we were elected to do. We mobilized to adapt to do our work safely–despite deliberate efforts by House Republicans to delay and obstruct the process.
On Tuesday, the House returned to the UNH’s Whittemore Center Arena for the final day of the 2019-20 House Session. We took action–passing numerous bills addressing:
* Voting Rights: Making sure that Granite Staters are able to exercise their constitutional right to vote this fall without risking their health
* Covid-19 Relief: Securing essential support to providers and long-term care facilities impacted by Covid-19
* Minimum Wage: Establishing and raising the minimum wage for New Hampshire workers
* Independent Redistricting: Restoring fairness to elections by establishing an independent redistricting commission to end gerrymandering
* Police Accountability: Taking steps to address systemic bias in law enforcement by banning police chokeholds, mandating reports of officer misconduct,
* Prescription Drug Costs: Making medication more affordable and capping the price of insulin
* Protections for Survivors of Assault: Expanding rights and protections for survivors by removing the civil statute of limitations on sexual assault
All of this (and more) was accomplished in spite of House Republicans who deliberately put politics over the people of New Hampshire by voting against important bills–many had been developed with bipartisan support and collaboration!
We must continue to take action and respond to the urgent needs of Granite Staters next year. Pitch in 20.20 a month to ensure we protect and expand our majority in November.
The legislative session may be behind us now, but the impacts of House Republican’s shameful efforts to disrupt the process, block voting or even consideration of important bills, and refusal to cooperate at the expense of the people of New Hampshire will not be forgotten on election day.
Here’s the bottom line, Granite Staters deserve better. Don't let them get away with these self serving partisan tactics--chip in to re-elect and grow our Democratic majority in 2020.

I’ve served in the House for 40 years, and the challenges we’re facing this year are unprecedented. It’s clear that we’re going to have to work harder than ever in order to be successful in November. We set a huge grassroots fundraising goal to close out April, to make sure we have the resources to scale up this campaign in the tough months ahead.
But, I’m sorry to have to tell you that we are coming up short on our goal. I’m hoping you can help make up the difference. If you’re able, can I count on you to pitch in $20.20 to help protect our Democratic majority in 2020?
In tough times like these, every dollar helps expand our reach, and we’re grateful for contributions of any amount that move us closer to our goals. So, if it’s feasible for you today, I hope you’ll pitch in.
Thank you for joining us in this fight.
Mary Jane Wallner

Dear Alex,
We know you’re busy, so we’ll cut to the chase. We ordered a limited number of copies of “A Busy Representative’s Cookbook” for the 2020 legislative session - which started today! This special-edition cookbook is full of quick, easy, and delicious recipes submitted by your 2019-2020 Democratic State Reps.
Do you want a copy? Order here.
If you already have a cookbook and want to contribute to the cause to celebrate the first day of session click here.
Show your support for our hardworking Democratic Representatives as they kick off the 2020 legislative session! All proceeds go towards our effort to hold and grow our majority in the NH House this year.
Happy cooking!

"Dear Friend,
For those of you who don’t know her, I’d like to introduce you to my friend Rachael Thomeer. Rachael joined our team more than two years ago and helped deliver a historic victory in November 2018 when we flipped the House from red to blue and elected the largest Democratic majority since 2006.
Now in 2020, she runs a robust statewide program providing critical training and candidate support to a record breaking 394 Democrats running for the NH House in 2020. Those of you who have had the pleasure of working with Rachael already know how lucky we are to have her, but you may not know that today is her birthday.
Here's the bad news. Rachael just called to let me know that we are coming up short on our fundraising goal for September. Can you pitch in $20.20 to help fill in the gap?
In the final stretch before election day, every contribution provides essential resources and support to Democratic House candidates running in districts across New Hampshire.
Take it from me, nobody is working harder than Rachael to protect and expand our Democratic majority. Donate today to do your part.
Warmly,
Steve

"Dear Alex,
Over the past few months, we’ve built up a team of 55 grassroots supporters who play a major role in sustaining our efforts to re-elect a Democratic majority by contributing on a monthly basis. These folks aren’t hedge fund managers or corporate executives writing big checks, they are everyday people who are willing to pitch in a few dollars of their hard earned money to support our efforts to keep the NH House Blue. The most popular level is $20.20 a month, but we value contributions of any amount that move us closer to our goals.
With the ongoing Covid-19 crisis, this election year is going to be different from anything we’ve ever faced before. We’ll be using digital outreach and direct mail even more than usual to reach voters across the state, but these tools are expensive. If you’re not already one of our grassroots supporters, can we count on your support each month to ensure that we have the tools we need in the months ahead?
At a time when so many are facing hardship and uncertainty, please join us in thanking our team of grassroots supporters for their commitment.
Their monthly contributions make it possible for us to continue to recruit Democrats to run in historically red and purple districts, provide support and training to hundreds of candidates and incumbents, and do everything we can to defend and grow our Democratic majority in 2020. If you haven’t already, sign up to join our team of recurring donors today.
Thank you for joining us in this fight.

"Dear Alex,
While the full impact of this crisis remains to be seen, at this very moment, thousands of Granite Staters are suffering from unexpected losses in income, concerns about their housing and childcare, and worries about keeping their families safe and healthy in the weeks ahead.
New Hampshire families are depending on leaders they can trust to respond to this crisis, who will help families get back on their feet, and support small businesses who are hurting.
In November, New Hampshire voters have the opportunity to choose the elected officials who will play a major role in the continued response to this crisis. Granite Staters deserve leaders in Concord who understand the challenges hardworking families face, and will always put them first: fighting for policies like paid family and medical leave, better access to quality and affordable health care, and fewer barriers to unemployment benefits.
A contribution of $20.20 a month to the Committee to Elect House Democrats will go a long way towards electing leaders who will put New Hampshire families first.
The stakes have never been higher. Contribute today to help us win in 2020.
Take care,
Committee to Elect House Democrats

"Alex–
The presidential primary just wrapped up in New Hampshire, but our work is just beginning.
Both Trump and Sununu will be back on the ballot this November – and they’re laser-focused on slashing our Democratic progress once and for all.
Voters in New Hampshire rejected the right-wing agenda in 2018 by flipping BOTH state chambers from red to blue. Now more than ever, we need to protect and grow our narrow Democratic majorities before it’s too late.
Alex, help defeat the Trump-Sununu agenda and elect Democrats in every corner of the state: Chip in $20 NOW >>
Raising the minimum wage. Fair redistricting. Paid family and medical leave. All of these issues–and so much more–are up for grabs this November.
We need to make the most of this opportunity. New Hampshire House Democrats have crafted one of the most ambitious agendas in state history, but none of it will happen if we lose the majority in November.
We need to protect our majority in Concord, Alex. Will you chip in $20 to support Democrats running across the Granite State?
Thank you,
NH House Democrats
