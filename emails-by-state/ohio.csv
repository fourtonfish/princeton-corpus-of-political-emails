Jane Timken,info@ohiogop.org,President Trump Needs You!  ,"Dear Alex,
As of October 1, the radical Democrats have raised MILLIONS of dollars in an effort to turn Ohio blue. Alex, now is not the time to sit on the sidelines.
President Trump DEPENDS on us to secure another victory. If proud patriots don't stand up and fight for conservative values, who will?
Our country cannot afford to go back to the radical extremism of the Obama/Biden era. A win for Sleepy Joe is a loss for our representative republic.
Alex, we only have 27 days until the election. Will you donate RIGHT NOW and make sure our war chest is stocked and ready for the final push towards Election Day?
SECURE VICTORY
It’s time for our proud Buckeye patriots to band together and show up for our president.
The country is depending on us, Alex. We don’t have much time left, and it’s crucial that we rise to the challenge.

Alex, we need to stand by our President now more than ever.
Even during a global crisis, the Democrats are focusing on dragging President Trump’s name through the dirt instead of working with him to get our country back on track.
President Trump is busy getting medical supplies for those who are working on the front lines, providing financial relief for small businesses in our community, and working around the clock with private sector partners to provide relief all over the nation.
On the other hand, Representative Tavia Galonski is busying herself trying to smear the Trump Administration instead of focusing on the health and safety of American citizens.
Alex, stand by President Trump by making a donation today.

Alex, will you help President Trump fight this enemy?

While President Trump and the White House Coronavirus Task Force are tirelessly leading our country towards relief and recovery, the Democrats are worried about spreading lies and pointing fingers.

Republicans have been working hard to deliver results for the American people, and instead of meeting us at the table, the Left prefers to throw their hands in the air and complain amongst themselves.
President Trump is doing everything he can to rebuild our economy and keep us on a path to real recovery, but because Kasich is still sore about losing in 2016, he’s decided to join the liberal whine parade at the Democratic National Convention.

This is it. The Republican National Convention is over, meaning the fight starts NOW. The battle to protect our conservative values begins TODAY.
President Trump made it clear: our freedoms, our jobs, and our way of life are at risk if Sleepy Joe and Kamala Harris are elected in November. We can’t let that happen, Alex.
That being said, we have to get to work. Will you donate today and send a message of strength that rattles the radical left? There’s only a few HOURS left until our end of month deadline.

HELP AMERICA THRIVE
We don’t have much time, Alex. President Trump is ready to kick into high gear and show the left what the silent majority can really do. Will you donate $100, $50, or $25 before 11:59 PM?

Jane Timken,info@ohiogop.org,Victorious   ,"Alex,
President Trump commanded the debate stage last night and walked all over Joe Biden who was asleep at the wheel. Poor guy just couldn’t keep up.
Sleepy Joe has spent OVER 45 YEARS in Washington. He’s catered to Wall Street, taken money from middle-class families, and hurt our small businesses. Now he’s running for President as a socialist radical Democrat buddied up with Nancy Pelosi and AOC. He even pledged to ban fracking and kill the oil industry, eliminating millions of American jobs and crippling our economy.
Biden has had DECADES to make the policy changes he talked about last night. But he's all talk and no action.
He’s just a confused career politician who is in way over his head.
But despite too many poor performances to count, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are leading in the polls.
I’m counting on you to help us stop them.
DONATE NOW
If last night showed us anything, it’s that President Trump is unquestionably the best candidate to lead our country forward. We need four more years of Making America Great.
With only 11 days left to the election, President Trump needs YOU now more than ever. Can he count on your support?
President Trump and the Republican candidates up and down the ballot have done their part. Now it’s time for you to do yours.
DONATE NOW
Thank you,
Jane Timken,
Chairman, Ohio GOP
P.S. With less than two weeks before election day, we need every patriot to stand up ASAP. We need to get out the vote, and time is running short to make a difference.

It’s vital to our economic health that we show support for strong, Republican leaders who know and understand the importance of keeping our businesses open and getting life back to normal.
We must keep our foot on the gas and our economy moving forward. That starts with giving conservative leaders everything they need to fight for Ohio workers.
Alex, will you join the fight to keep our economy strong?
FEED THE RECOVERY
The damage of COVID-19 won’t disappear right away – but we are moving in the right direction. President Trump and Ohio Republicans are working hard to get the economy growing again, but we can’t let Democrats in the D.C. Swamp stand in their way.
The future is bright when we feed a working, conservative mission. Take a stand with us today, protect the jobs we need, and keep Ohio a place where hardworking Buckeyes are free to provide for their families.

Jane Timken,info@ohiogop.org,The Land of Opportunity  ,"Alex,
It was clear to see after the first night of the Republican National Convention that our country is headed in the right direction.
President Donald Trump, Congressman Jim Jordan, and other Republican leaders were quick to remind us that America is the land of opportunity, the home of the brave, and the epicenter of personal liberty.
Now compare that to the doom-and-gloom attitudes of the Democrats. Does that sound like the America you know? Does that sound like the free and prosperous country President Trump has led these last four years?
We need to keep proud and uplifting Republicans in office. The future of American opportunity depends on it.
DEFEND FREEDOM
Last night, Congressman Jim Jordan listed the many accomplishments of President Trump’s administration the Democrats are too proud to acknowledge. Former Governor Nikki Haley reminded us that the United States’ standing in the world is stronger than ever before. Senator Tim Scott inspired us by echoing our shared belief that America is the bastion of opportunity and promise.
Democrats would rather America fail than admit they are wrong about President Trump.
Alex, just think of the stern warning issued by Cuban immigrant Maximo Alvarez who understands the dire threat socialism brings to our country. If the Democrats win, it will not end well for our people or our government.
Future Americans will look back at this election and know Republicans were the party who stood for freedom.
PROTECT OPPORTUNITY
This election is the choice between two opposites. If America elects Joe Biden and the Democrats, we will become a country beholden to its government. But if we stand strong and keep proud Republican leaders in office, we will have restored faith in individual liberty, family values, and the strength of local communities working together to keep our country great.
Donate today and help us preserve America as the land of opportunity for each and every one of us.

Jane Timken,info@ohiogop.org,"Joe Biden, Master of Illusions  ","Alex,
Joe Biden says that if you don’t vote for him, “You ain’t black.” But a look behind the smoke and mirrors shows that he hasn’t always had minority communities’ interests at heart.
Joe Biden says he can’t be racist because Barack Obama is one of his best friends, but he has touted his friendship with segregationist Dixiecrats like Herman Talmadge, John Stennis, and Jim Eastland. This was the same Jim Eastland who called African Americans an “inferior race” and joked about genocide.
Joe Biden called himself an advocate of Civil Rights on camera, but he opposed integrated busing in the 1970s, making it harder to enforce court-mandated school desegregation.
Joe Biden says black lives matter, but in 1994 he helped pass the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, which encouraged district attorneys to charge children as adults to fill prisons.
Joe Biden calls himself a friend to the black community, but he has made African Americans’ economic burden more difficult by notoriously coming out against public housing that many poor people depend on. He also tried to raise the Social Security age with disastrous consequences for the black community.
Joe Biden may try to hide his record behind the curtain, but a closer look shines a spotlight on his hypocrisy.
SAY NO TO JOE
Contrast Joe Biden’s record with the progress happening in America right now. Under the current administration, the unemployment rate among African Americans plummeted, reaching an all-time low of 5.4%. In 2018, the number of African Americans below the poverty line reached a record low of 20.8%.
Under our current president, we have focused on creating new opportunities for the disenfranchised, including more HBCU funding, school vouchers for minority students who need them most, and Opportunity Zones which attract businesses to disadvantaged neighborhoods. In addition, President Trump called on Congress to pass a nationwide family leave plan, secured historic levels of block grant funding to help low-income families access child care, and helped 40 million working American families by doubling the child tax credit.
We’ve also made great strides forward in the realm of criminal justice reform. The First Step Act, which President Trump signed in 2018, liberated numerous black men from mass incarceration. President Trump also posthumously pardoned boxing champion Jack Johnson, who had been wrongly imprisoned after a racially charged accusation. He granted clemency to Alice Marie Johnson, a 63-year-old grandmother who was sentenced to life behind bars for a non-violent drug offense. And he has done this with many others.
Contrast all this progress with the policies of both Joe Biden and previous Democrat administrations. We need to keep moving forward and creating economic opportunities for disempowered minorities.
Alex, don’t let Joe Biden’s lies hold America back. Donate today to support conservative leadership who will keep us moving forward.

A Liberal mob attacked Trump supporters at a Trump rally. Among them was the daughter of an Ohio Democratic elected official who was arrested by Toledo police because of her actions that night!
Cursing, yelling, and violence – it's all part of the Left's playbook. But we don't have to let them get away with it.
Will you fight back against the Left's cheap tactics?
Democrats resort to screaming because they can't face the facts: President Trump is good for America. Instead, they created a partisan witch hunt to stop our President from keeping his promises for another four years.
Will you send the Liberal mob a message they can't ignore?
FIGHT BACK →
If you see right through this charade, too, voice your opinions at the ballot box this year. It's up to Conservatives to stop the Left's poisonous campaign of hate, hypocrisy, and ignorance.

There are still several days left to cast your ballot. I urge you when you vote, to support Justice Sharon Kennedy and Justice Judi French.
Fran and I had the opportunity to greet President Trump when he visited Ohio last weekend. If we want our economy to grow, and if we want to see more jobs in Ohio and across this country - we must re-elect the President. And, if we want to see more conservative federal judges nominated to the bench, we must re-elect the President.

Did you see our email yesterday?
We are just 4 DAYS AWAY from the most important election of our lifetime and the radical left is still outraising us. Our Finance Team told me we are catching up, but we still have $7,412 to raise by the end of the day tomorrow to hit our LAST end-of-the-month goal.
It was a big decision, but we’ve decided to extend our 400% match through the end of the day again – and this is the last time we can do it. Can you help right now and make 4X the impact?
ACTIVATE EMERGENCY 4X MATCH DONATION
Chairman Timken asked us to give her a fundraising report on how we’re doing in the home stretch and we want to make sure your name is on it, Alex.
I know this is an ambitious fundraising goal, but we only set it because we have the best grassroots team in the nation.

Alex,
We’re down to the wire, and the left isn’t backing down. With just five days to go, Michael Bloomberg just poured another $15M into turning Ohio blue.
The Democrats may have billionaires, but that’s no defense against our army of grassroots patriots.
Alex, I know you’re getting tired of hearing from me. But if every person on our e-mail list gave just $5 right now, we would have the funds to WIN.
Can you help?
DONATE NOW
This should be an immediate call to action to ALL Conservatives who are still in this fight to protect President Trump and STOP a Liberal takeover by the dark money democrats.
Today is our last chance to make sure that does not happen, but I cannot do this without your support.
I’m authorizing a 400% match to QUADRUPLE YOUR IMPACT. It expires at midnight, so I can’t stress how important it is to have your support right now.
DONATE $5 = $20
DONATE $10 = $40

Hi Alex. Did you see President Trump is coming to Ohio? He's kicking off 2020 with a Keep America Great rally in Toledo and I wanted to let you know about a special way you can be part of it.
Before the rally, we're going to present President Trump with a 2020 Supporter List. By making a contribution, your name will be added to the list, meaning the president will see your name and know you're one of his top supporters.
Can we count on you to make a donation today and join the list of 2020 supporters? Every donation is important and valued.
With 2020 here, we're all hands on deck to make sure we have another big win in Ohio. And we can't do it without you.
You've been a strong Buckeye supporter in the past. The President should know you're still with him.
This is an opportunity I really don't want you to miss out on. Will you donate today so we can put you down on the 2020 Supporter List we'll be giving to President Trump?
Alex, thanks so much for your continued support. Have a wonderful day.

\- Dem impeachment investigator
The Hill, Dec. 9,2019
PROTECT TRUMP
Alex, the Democrats aren't showing signs of stopping. Neither should we.
Nancy Pelosi has instructed her Democratic thugs to proceed with drawing up phony articles of impeachment, despite not having impeachable evidence. The Left is rushing the impeachment process and denying President Trump the ability to exercise his basic rights because they know they have nothing to work with.
It's time to put an end to this madness. We Ohioans need to stand together and fight for our president. We can't let Nancy Pelosi, Adam Schiff, Jerry Nadler, and the rest of the House Democrats continue to make a mockery out of the Republican Party and the democratic process.
We're calling the Buckeye Battalion to action with the Impeachment Defense Fund!
Ohio Republican Party When you support the Impeachment Defense Fund, you'll be giving President Trump the support he needs to keep fighting. We don't have much time. The Democratic squad is hard at work to get President Trump out of office before Christmas.
Alex, show your support TODAY!

Alex, liberal socialists have made Ohio a target. The only thing standing between them and the future of our state… is you.
You're a true Buckeye warrior. A fighter who stands up for what you believe in. Now's your chance to fight back – before it's too late.
Join the Buckeye Firewall to become part of Ohio's last line of defense against the radical left. They're coming after our home. We can stop them only by coming together.
Be the Buckeye Firewall
Democrats think this is their year. But we stopped them once before. We sent President Trump to the White House. And we can do it again – but only if we stand together.
That means standing as a firewall against all Democrats can throw. Be part of the Buckeye Firewall and let's make it clear that there's no place in Ohio for their militant left-wing agenda.
Alex, will you stand up for Donald Trump again in 2020?
Be the Buckeye Firewall
At this very moment, Democrats are pouring millions of dollars into Ohio in an attempt to flip our state BLUE. But they can spend all they want. Ohio conservatives are tough… and we know what we stand for.
We're in the fight for our lives. This election will determine Ohio's future for generations to come. We can keep the Buckeye State red and preserve our way of life for our children and grandchildren, but we have to act now.
Get on board with the Buckeye Firewall to send Democrats a clear message: We won't let you radically transform this state. This is our home and we're ready to fight for it.

Jane Timken,info@ohiogop.org,A Party Without a Plan  ,"Alex,
The Democrats want to lead this country, and they don’t even have a plan.
We’ve made it through 3 days of the Democrat National Convention, and all they’ve talked about is how anti-Trump they are. There have been no real solutions or plans, but a convention only about being against Trump.
Just being against someone isn’t a platform in and of itself. That’s not leadership. If the Democrats can’t offer real leadership, why would we even waste time with them?
Join us today and donate for real leadership!
SUPPORT REAL LEADERSHIP
The Democrats DID choose to highlight one other focus on their dangerous contempt — they want to abolish the police.
So, we have a clear choice. On the one hand is a party that is defined solely by what it’s against. On the other hand, is leadership with a positive vision to restore our economy and rebuild our country.
Will you stand with Republican candidates today? It is obvious by this point that the GOP is the only party offering real leadership. Can you donate for conservative candidates? Any dollar you give will help build a brighter future for America.
GIVE NOW

Jane Timken,info@ohiogop.org,Dems want us to choose peace and order or equality  ,"Alex,
Months after the first protests began, Ohio families and businesses are still praying for an end to the violence.
But if Democrats had condemned the rioting and looting from the beginning, we wouldn’t have to keep praying.
Instead, Democrat leaders have created a false dichotomy in which we have to choose sides. Do we stand with police? Or do we fight for equality?
In reality, we can’t have one without the other.
Ohioans shouldn’t have to compromise on safety or equality. We need leaders that will bring the best balance of each. Will you donate today to help elect them?
DONATE
Democrats would have us believe that police officers are the antithesis of an equal society. But in reality, the opposite is true. We cannot ensure everyone receives equal treatment without our law enforcement heroes by our sides. In fact, we need them now more than ever.
Ohio needs strong law enforcement in the fight for equality. We don’t have to choose one or the other—but we can choose leaders who care about both.
DONATE
True equality means knowing you’re safe wherever you go. True equality means being treated the same as everyone else—especially in the eyes of the law. True equality goes hand in hand with a healthy, thriving law enforcement system.
Help us fight for true equality. Elect leaders who believe in law and order.

I know you weren’t watching Biden’s townhall last night, but he essentially said that if he wins the election, and if Amy Coney Barrett is confirmed, he would take action to expand the Supreme Court. Instead of following the rules of our constitution, he and Kamala would take matters into their own hands.

However, as we roll into 2020, it will only get harder from here. The Democrats will continue to push for impeachment. We need to rally together and fight back, Alex.
The head of the financing team just told me that we're short of our monthly goal by $5,387, and we only have a few hours left to reach it. That means we'll be starting 2020 short unless we reach this goal now.

Jane Timken,info@ohiogop.org,The Liberals are laughing at YOU  ,"More dirty tactics from the ""peace-loving"" Radical Left. Ohio Republican Party
Have you seen this, Alex?
This is what the liberal elites think of you and me.
They think we're stupid. Ignorant.
They laugh. They laugh at our support for President Trump. They laugh at our outrage at their liberal agenda – an agenda that hurts our families, raises our taxes, takes away our jobs, doctors, and freedoms.
They laugh at us.
I won't take it. We don't have to take this.
Fight back
We only have until MIDNIGHT TOMORROW to hit our first important fundraising goal of the year and ensure we have the resources to fight the Liberal Left's propaganda like this.
STAND UP TO THE LIBERAL ELITE >>
When President Trump wins in November, we'll have the last laugh, but we must start laying the groundwork for that victory now.
I need your help before it's too late.
Donate before our deadline tomorrow at midnight and join me in standing against the liberal elites.
Don't let these liberals win.
Sincerely,

Alex, the radical Left will never admit that our economy is thriving under President Trump's leadership.
President Trump has created hundreds of thousands of new jobs, dramatically lowered our nation's unemployment rate, and consistently stood up for our families, conservative values, and freedoms.
However, the radical thugs on the Left are dangerously rooting against our country's greatness and resorting to dirty tactics and witch hunts to impeach President Trump. We know who made America great again…
…But in order to keep moving our country towards prosperity we have to meet our goals. That's why we're counting on you to make a donation to keep our movement alive.
We'll even DOUBLE or TRIPLE match of your donation for the next few hours!
Public polling has revealed that President Trump's approval is actually the highest it's been since the impeachment charade began.
We're not backing down, and now is the time to fight back stronger than ever. President Trump needs our help so he can fiercely bounce back from this senseless attack by the liberals in Washington.
Alex, you only have a few hours left to donate and have

We are just 4 DAYS AWAY from the most important election of our lifetime and the radical left is still outraising us. Our Finance Team told me we are catching up, but we still have $7,412 to raise by the end of the day tomorrow to hit our LAST end-of-the-month goal.
It was a big decision, but we’ve decided to extend our 400% match through the end of the day again – and this is the last time we can do it. Can you help right now and make 4X the impact?

We’re down to the wire, and the left isn’t backing down. With just five days to go, Michael Bloomberg just poured another $15M into turning Ohio blue.
The Democrats may have billionaires, but that’s no defense against our army of grassroots patriots.
Alex, I know you’re getting tired of hearing from me. But if every person on our email list gave just $5 right now, we would have the funds to WIN.

This should be an immediate call to action to ALL Conservatives who are still in this fight to protect President Trump and STOP a Liberal takeover by the dark money Democrats.
Today is our last chance to make sure that does not happen, but I cannot do this without your support.
I’m authorizing a 400% match to QUADRUPLE YOUR IMPACT. It expires at midnight, so I can’t stress how important it is to have your support right now.

Alex,
Primaries may be over, but there’s no time to rest. The real work of helping President Trump win the election and defeating the Democrats begins now. November is coming, the Democrats are organizing, and we need to be prepared for the fight of our lives.
Chip into our victory fund today and we’ll match it! But hurry—this offer only lasts until 11:59PM TONIGHT.
DOUBLE MY DONATION
In 2016, Democrats failed to secure victory on Election Day. This time, they’re pushing Sleepy Joe Biden—another wishy-washy candidate with a shady past. But what they don’t realize is that their candidate is old news. We want to keep America great with four more years of President Trump.
Alex, will you show Dems that their time is up with $15, $10, or just $5 before April ends? Our team is standing by to match your donation.
YES, COUNT ME IN
You should be proud of the work you’ve done to help President Trump so far, Alex. Thanks to patriots like you, Ohio has remained strong against the Radical Left. We’re glad you’re on our team in this fight for the future of our country and our way of life.

After President Trump gave a rousing State of the Union address, Nancy Pelosi showed her true colors of disrespect by ripping up the speech – an absolutely disgusting display in front of the President and his honored guests.
Honored guests who included one of our last surviving Tuskegee Airmen, a child born at 21 weeks, two mourning families whose loved ones were kidnapped and murdered by terrorists, and a service member reunited with his family.
But she won't get to us.

We need to show her that her little stunt meant nothing.

This needs to end. NOW.
Alex, we can’t let these political games affect President Trump’s chance at reelection.

Jane Timken,info@ohiogop.org,Dems are running scared  ,"Alex,
We all know Dems are living in a fantasy world, but this is ridiculous.
Last Thursday, Nancy Pelosi suggested Biden shouldn’t even debate President Trump. To no one’s surprise, the sentiment was echoed by Biden campaign spokesperson Andrew Bates, who seems to think Sleepy Joe is exempt from decades-old traditions.
Both Pelosi and Bates clearly have no issues with foregoing an important part of the election. Neither of them seems to care that presidential debates provide voters with key information about the candidates, their stances, and their plans for America.
It’s clear that liberals are hoping to avoid the public humiliation of a debate with President Trump. Just more proof that we need conservative leaders who aren’t afraid to stand up for their beliefs. Will you donate to support them?
DONATE NOW
Not only do Pelosi and her gang want to cancel the debate, it’s obvious that Biden doesn’t want to stop in Kenosha during his campaign tour. Democrats expected him to visit following leftist-led riots that turned violent, but Joe bowed out. What is he hiding?
Pelosi, Biden, and their liberal friends can’t run away from their problems forever.
Ohio needs leaders who aren’t afraid to speak plainly, as President Trump has done over the last four years. Help send conservative fighters to Columbus by donating and standing strong with fellow Buckeye patriots.
DONATE
The debate will happen one way or another, Alex. It’s time to wake Democrats up from their fantasy world and show them what winning really looks like.

It’s no secret: this election will determine our destiny as a nation.
We CANNOT stand by and let Sleepy Joe and Radical Kamala take control of the White House after all that President Trump has done to Make America Great Again.
The most IMPORTANT DEADLINE of the year ends TONIGHT. If we don’t have the resources to fight during the last month of the election, we don’t stand a chance against the radical Left.

COUNT ME IN!
I don’t want to imagine what life will be like if Sleepy Joe takes the reins in January. 8 years of failed Obama-era policies was enough for me. Was it enough for you?

Jane Timken,info@ohiogop.org,BREAKING: Biden’s Emails  ,"Dear Alex,
We deserve to know the truth about Hunter Biden’s emails.
The Director of National Intelligence and the FBI have a federal investigation underway. Why haven’t you heard about it? Because the radical liberals in Silicon Valley are protecting the Bidens by keeping it out of your newsfeed.
President Trump has vowed to question Sleepy Joe on Hunter’s emails during the debate on Thursday night.
We deserve answers.
Alex, will you join Trump’s Truth Squad team?
DEMAND ANSWERS – SIGN THE PETITION NOW
Joe Biden claims that he had no knowledge of Hunter Biden's business dealings, but there is evidence to the contrary including payment cuts promised to “The Big Guy”. Shouldn't we know if U.S. relations and security are at risk?
Joe Biden and Hunter Biden must be held accountable if these accusations are true. The American people need and deserve to know the truth!
Sign your name today to demand these questions be answered. By signing your name now, you will send a clear message to President Trump that we have his back and want to know the truth.
SUPPORT PRESIDENT TRUMP – DEMAND ANSWERS NOW

I’ll be brief.
I just saw the most recent fundraising reports, and Democrats have committed to spending hundreds of millions of dollars in Ohio toward defeating our Republican ticket next week.
Right now, we don’t have the money to compete.
This is no longer a “politics as usual” situation, Alex. It’s personal.
If we don’t fully fund our digital advertising budget by the end of the week, we will not get our message in front of enough voters before Election Day.
Will you chip in right now and fund our DIGITAL DEFENSE FUND?
$10 REACHES 20 VOTERS
$25 REACHES 50 VOTERS
$50 REACHES 100 VOTERS
$100 REACHES 200 VOTERS
Out-of-state special interest groups have poured millions of dollars into Ohio to try to buy our elections. Are you going to let them?
We need all hands on deck for seven more days. Can you donate right now?

Thank you,

Alex,
With 2020 now upon us, we need to focus on our goals for the new year. The liberals are still pushing to remove President Trump. Their sham trial is going to the Senate in January.
The battle isn't over yet - we need to be ready, Alex. That's why I'm asking if you'll become a monthly donor through Election Day?

We need to help President Trump get re-elected on November 3rd to keep our movement alive. The country has seen more jobs, a better economy, and a return to conservative principles under President Trump's administration.
The Democrats are fighting with every trick they've got. We can't fall behind and let them win – become a monthly donor through Election Day to make sure we have the firepower to fight back.
SHOW YOUR 2020 SUPPORT

Jane Timken,info@ohiogop.org,Amy Coney Barrett  ,"Alex,
IT’S OFFICIAL. President Trump has chosen Judge Amy Coney Barrett to fill Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s vacant Supreme Court seat.
This is a BIG DEAL for our conservative values. With a majority on the Supreme Court, we can finally roll back the failed liberal policies from the Obama/Biden era.
The Democrats are FURIOUS with Trump for exercising his constitutionally guaranteed right as President, but they’re really taking their irrational anger out on our Republican Senators for pledging to hold a vote.
They already raised over $100M LAST WEEK – at a rate of over $100,000 per minute - to try and upend our Republican-held Senate majority in November.
Are you going to let them?
Alex, will you help me show the radical left we won’t be intimidated?
DONATE NOW
Judge Amy Coney Barrett is the perfect choice for Supreme Court Justice. She has proven experience, conservative values, and will uphold her oath to interpret the Constitution fairly and justly.
Now, it’s up to our Republican Senators to FILL THE SEAT and not be intimidated by the Democrats' war chest.
We have to fight back.
Can I count on you to combat the Democrats' growing fundraising advantage?
FIGHT BACK TODAY
Every 4 years, the fake news media will tell you that “this is the most important Election of our lifetime” … well Alex, they finally got it right this time.
Will you donate right now?

Jane Timken,info@ohiogop.org,“This would be a terrible crisis to waste.”  ,"Alex,
A few months have passed, and we’re proud to say we’re holding firm. Thanks to President Trump’s swift response, people are recovering and businesses are preparing to reopen. But the liberals would have you believe that America is cracking under the pressure of COVID-19—and that their agenda is the solution.
We’re calling on all patriots to speak out against this despicable behavior. Will you add your name to the list, too, Alex?
ADD YOUR NAME
Sleepy Joe, Hillary and her radical left friends saw this crisis as an opportunity. Instead of working with the Trump administration to bring aid to people that needed it, they played politics. Now they’re insisting they know what’s best for America, even after they wouldn’t lift a finger to help.
But we see right through them. That’s why we’re asking you to speak up and call out the left’s hypocrisy.
MAKE YOUR VOICE HEARD
Alex, we’ve been in this fight long enough to know that the Left will stoop to anything to manipulate innocent people. We can’t let this attempt to prey on vulnerable families go unpunished. It’s time we put a stop to this once and for all.
Will you stand up and fight back against the radical left who wants to undermine our President’s efforts to get America back on its feet?
FIGHT BACK NOW
Thanks to patriots like you, America is in good hands.

WATCH NOW!
Alex,
Ohio is in danger.
Radical Joe Biden poses a threat to our freedoms, and former Governor Kasich is standing behind him. Kasich plans to speak at the Democratic Convention this week to endorse Biden, turning his back on sound, conservative leadership.
Kasich is wrong. By endorsing Biden, he endorses massive tax increases, bigger government, and anti-second amendment legislation. We need your help to keep our conservative leaders strong in the fight to defend our nation. Stand with real conservative leadership. Stand with us.
SUPPORT A REAL LEADER
He claims to be a Republican, but Kasich continues to speak against President Trump and support extreme candidates who are not concerned with promoting Republican policies. Kasich has never been honest with us about his agenda, and betrayed conservative supporters at every turn.
Even though he once bragged about his NRA endorsement, Kasich now backs a liberal gun-grabber who plans to undermine our Constitutional rights. Not only that, he helped pass legislation banning the use of firearms and vetoed gun bills that would help us protect our families.
Kasich never worked for us; he’s always worked for himself. Can you donate today to help the Ohio Republican Party get sound conservatives elected who will actually support our principles and the security of our state and our nation?
LEARN MORE
With your help, we can re-elect President Trump and keep the liberal agenda out of the White House. Your generous contribution will push our conservative leaders forward, proving that Kasich is wrong to support radical Joe Biden.
Your donation will support the leaders who won’t turn their backs on us like Kasich did. Will you help the leaders we can trust to move Ohio forward?
DONATE TODAY
Thank you for supporting the leaders who will work hard to protect us.

Jane Timken,info@ohiogop.org,26 MILLION layoffs later ...  ,"Alex,
Twenty-six million Americans have been forced to file for unemployment. Livelihoods destroyed. Families are worrying about how they’re going to pay the bills.
With all this, did Nancy Pelosi make it a priority to replenish the Paycheck Program as quickly as possible for struggling small businesses?
No. Instead, she went on ""The Late Late Show"" to show off the $13-a-pint ice cream collection she keeps in her $24,000 fridge.
Alex, how do you believe Democrats handled this situation?
TAKE THE POLL >
There’s no way around this for Nancy Pelosi. It’s a fact: Today, millions of Americans have filed for unemployment because congressional Democrats led by Pelosi and Chuck Schumer blocked the replenishment of PPP until this week.
They blocked PPP while the program was on a path to run out. They blocked PPP after funding was depleted. And for an entire week, while working families across America asked themselves how they would make ends meet, Pelosi and Democrats continued blocking.
And all for what? Just to get some political “leverage.”
Alex, do you disagree or agree with Democrats' refusal to replenish PPP immediately?
TAKE THE POLL >>
It’s disappointing that Democrats who have been elected to look out for the American people in times of crisis put politics over lives when it mattered most. Thankfully, President Trump and congressional Republicans fought for PPP funding and won over Democrats’ opposition.
Unlike Pelosi, working Americans don’t have a cozy government paycheck for keeping the fridge constantly replenished with gourmet ice cream. When we needed PPP replenished, she and Democrats failed big.
Alex, let us know how you feel about Nancy Pelosi’s handling of small business relief.

Karl Rove,info@ohiogop.org,From The Desk Of Karl Rove   ,"Ohio plays such an important role in American politics. A perennial battleground, Ohio figures prominently in almost every presidential election. Today, the stakes are even higher.
That’s because Ohio is not just the frontline of the race for the White House: there’s also a fight for the Ohio Supreme Court. The new With that court’s conservative majority up for grabs in 2020, every conservative voter in Ohio must join the fight.
That is why I am writing to you today to tell you about Justice Judi French and explain why outside forces are so bent on defeating her.
You may know that, after serving as a justice for the past seven years, Judi is running hard for reelection. What you may not know is that she faces not only a liberal opponent, but also well-funded left-wing interest groups from outside Ohio. All these liberal forces are laser-focused on one issue – redistricting. Let me explain.
But liberal interest groups from outside Ohio have a different agenda. They want those lines drawn to benefit liberal Democrats. And if they can’t control Ohio’s legislature to do that, then they want to control the Ohio Supreme Court.
This is not wild speculation: simply Google “Eric Holder” and “redistricting” and you’ll find all you need to know about the Democrats’ plan.
In their official organization papers for the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, President Barack Obama and former Attorney General Eric Holder said the group’s goal is to “to favorably position Democrats for the redistricting process through 2022.” In other words: draw lines to elect more Democrats to Congress and the Ohio legislature.
And with backers like George Soros, this effort has serious financial muscle.
So far, Obama, Holder, and the NDRC have raised over $50 million to funnel into key state races in order to turn the tide of redistricting. So Judi faces a mountain of cash on the other side. This is a real threat to Ohio, and if Judi is defeated for reelection, it will have national ramifications.
In the end, this isn’t about party lines. It’s about choosing a judge who will make decisions based on unbiased, conservative principles, a judge who will apply strictly the law as it is written and not legislate from the bench. Judi French is that candidate.
There’s no debate that Judi is the best qualified to represent you on Ohio’s highest court. She has dedicated her career to public service for more than two decades, serving as a lawyer for a state agency, assistant attorney general, chief counsel to the Governor, and, for the past 15 years, a judge.
As an assistant attorney general, Judi represented the State of Ohio before the U.S. Supreme Court—twice. She defended Ohio’s school voucher program and helped ensure equal educational opportunities for all Ohio students.
As a justice, Judi has distinguished herself as a hard-working conservative with a heart for service. She has a passion for equal justice and never tires of finding ways to make our judicial system more accessible to everyone.
Judi French is someone you can trust to respect and uphold the law as a justice on the Ohio Supreme Court. She needs your help today.
Please contribute to Judi’s campaign. She’s working hard every day to earn victory this November. With your help, we’ll make sure she wins. Please give at the amount listed on your included donation form or whatever you can. Every contribution helps.
I don’t often lend my name to statewide races, but Judi French’s race is too important. Please support her—with your gift today and your vote Election Day. Thanks for your consideration of this fine conservative judge, and let her hear from you today.
Sincerely yours,
Paid for by Ohio Republican Party.

Alex, if you watched the debate, you saw that Sleepy Joe is in WAY over his head. It’s clear he’s looking to continue the Obama-era policies that tanked our economy and damaged our healthcare system.
If we want to continue winning, we need to show up right now and let President Trump know we are behind him 100%!
CHIP IN $10 >>
Sleepy Joe had plenty of opportunities in the debate to prove he’s the right choice for President, and he failed. Do you really want FOUR YEARS of that? We have come too far to let Sleepy Joe win in November and dismantle all of the progress that has been gained under President Trump’s leadership.

Jane Timken,info@ohiogop.org,This is a Wake-up Call	  ,"Alex,
Last week, Bernie Sanders suspended his Presidential campaign. Now, Democrats are waking up to the reality that they’ll be forced to settle for Sleepy Joe Biden, a wishy-washy candidate who has alienated voters in his own party.
Like Bernie, Joe wants to push his progressive views on Americans. That means more big government, higher taxes, and less freedom. And like Bernie, Joe will stop at nothing to destroy what President Trump has worked so hard to build over the last four years.
Alex, we need to show Joe there’s no place for his parasitic progressive politics in our country. Will you add your name to the list of patriotic Americans that are proud to stand with President Trump?
ADD MY NAME >>
Sleepy Joe insists he knows what's the best for America, but he and his supporters can't seem to get their story straight. Voters in his own party have abandoned him, so how can he expect an entire nation to rally behind him?
It’s time to tell Democrats exactly what we think about their lazy politics and their lazy candidates, Alex. Every dollar donated is proof that Ohio can do better than Sleepy Joe.
I STAND WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP!
The President has achieved real results for Americans and kept his campaign promises, while Joe merely chases the title of President.
We need to strike while the iron is hot and send the Dems a wake-up call. Ohio Republicans are wide awake and ready to go -- unlike Sleepy Joe.
Let’s make our voices heard.

David Pepper,info@ohiodems.org,It's the right thing to do,"Team,
Ohio Democrats believe that our democracy is stronger when more people participate in the process, so today we filed a lawsuit to permit county boards of elections to install multiple, secure dropboxes where voters can deliver their absentee ballots.
Many states -- including Republican-led states, like Georgia and Utah, and Democratic-run states, like Oregon and Colorado -- use voter dropboxes widely, with no controversy or partisanship. They cut out delays, don't require a stamp and reduce lines.
During unprecedented attacks by the president on the postal service, dropboxes are more important than ever -- so we were more than disappointed by the recent ban on all but a single drop box per county in Ohio.
We're proud to file this lawsuit today -- not because of politics, but because it's the right thing to do. People must be able to vote safely and securely in this critical election.
Ohio Democrats will never stop defending your right to vote, team -- if you're able, will you chip in today to join the fight for voting rights in Ohio?

ADD YOUR NAME: Sign this petition to urge the GOP to join Democrats in working to lower prescription drug costs.
Folks,
Donald Trump made big promises on the campaign trail to deal with rising prescription drug prices. But now that it's time to walk the walk, he's caving in to Big Pharma and turning his back on everyday Americans.
Ohioans across the state are struggling to keep up with skyrocketing drug prices -- and the problem is getting worse. The cost of insulin in the U.S. has tripled over the last decade, and as many as one in four patients are skimping on or skipping the insulin they need to survive.
Trump broke his promise to deal with rising drug prices -- so Democratic lawmakers in D.C. and in Columbus are taking action.
On the national stage, House Democrats are pushing to hold big drug companies accountable and lower drug costs for everyone. And in Columbus, Democratic legislators are fighting to cap out-of-pocket costs for insulin.
These bills that Democrats are putting forward would change so many lives, folks -- but we need to put pressure on the GOP to make them happen. Can you add your name to stand with Democratic lawmakers and join the fight against Big Pharma to lower prescription drug costs?
Sign on
It's simple -- Democratic lawmakers are taking action because no one should be forced to choose between paying for basic necessities and life-saving medication.
But we need your support -- add your name to call on Republicans to join Democratic lawmakers in the fight to reduce the costs of prescription drugs.

TRUMP WATCH
## Build Back Better for Racial Equality
This week Vice President Joe Biden announced the fourth and final pillar of his ""Build Back Better"" plan, which will help advance racial equity across the American economy. Biden recognizes that the COVID-19 crisis has pulled the blinders off and exacerbated racial disparities and inequities across our economy and our culture. That's why Biden's plan would work to remove barriers to participation in our economy, expand access to opportunity and enforce laws currently on the books to invest in an economy where everybody will be included on the deal.
Twitter
Biden's Build Back Better plan for racial equity is in stark contrast to Donald Trump's divisive rhetoric and feckless, chaotic coronavirus response.
""The coronavirus pandemic and its disproportionate impact on Black Ohioans is Exhibit A for why we have been saying that racism is a public health crisis,"" said Ohio Legislative Black Caucus President Stephanie Howse. ""Donald Trump has done nothing to address the concerns of Black Ohioans; in fact, his reckless and chaotic response to the coronavirus crisis has led to thousands of needless deaths, particularly in African-American communities. Trump's divisive rhetoric around police violence and aggressive response to largely peaceful protests has made Black Ohioans less safe in their homes and neighborhoods.
""Donald Trump's lame attempts to change the subject about police violence against Black Americans won't distract us. We see what his administration is doing to undercut fair housing. We see what his administration is doing to eliminate affirmative action. This election is life or death for Black Ohioans, and we will be turning out in record numbers to stop Donald Trump and elect Joe Biden this November.""

## Ohio Dems File Legislation to Stop Corruption
This week state Rep. Bride Rose Sweeney and state Rep. Allison Russo filed broad anti-corruption legislation that would require dark money groups to identify their funders and disclose their spending. The bill would also strengthen restrictions against foreign corporations and foreign governments influencing Ohio elections.
""One-party rule in Ohio has led to a culture of corruption. The allegations against Speaker Householder are only the most recent and staggering example,"" said Sweeney. ""Dark money groups with innocuous labels like 'Generation Now' have influenced our state politics for years. By making people and corporations put their names behind these organizations and disclose their contributions, we can begin to bring transparency and accountability back to our state government. Ohioans deserve no less.""
""Recent allegations involving the Speaker and House Bill 6 demonstrate just how necessary serious campaign finance reform is,"" said Russo. ""This bill will strengthen transparency and accountability so that dark money and corruption cannot subvert the will of the people who elected us to serve. Ohioans deserve better from their government, and this bill ensures the best interests of our constituents remain front and center.""

ODP Weekly Update,info@ohiodems.org,Ending the culture of corruption in the GOP-ruled Statehouse,"Dear friend,
The events of the past week are disturbing -- and yet, they are hardly surprising.
This week Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder and his co-conspirators were arrested, and the details of the criminal complaint tell the tale of operators who have been at this for a long time and know how to evade accountability for their corrupt actions.
We've been saying it for a long time -- the culture of state government under decades of GOP leadership is fundamentally one of corruption, kickbacks and pay-to-play. It's no wonder so many Ohio Republicans have refused to speak out against Donald Trump's blatant corruption and abuse of power, when that is precisely the status quo here in Columbus.
There are a few things that should happen immediately:
* Householder should step down, and if he won't, be expelled by his colleagues
* Any campaign accounts associated with Householder's criminal enterprise should be frozen
* Any elected official or candidate who took Householder's dirty money should offer an explanation to Ohio voters
Those officials who have defrauded the taxpayers and abused the people's trust must have a moment of accountability, whether that comes from the legal system or at the ballot box this November. Actually, let's make it both!
And the good news is -- while the wheels of justice turn, we can do something about it all ourselves: there are a little over 100 days remaining until Election Day. At the Ohio Democratic Party, we are focused like a laser on electing Joe Biden as our next president, picking up Statehouse seats, flipping the Ohio Supreme Court and ending the scourge of gerrymandering, which has enabled so much of the dysfunction we see in Congress and the corruption of the Ohio Statehouse.
But we need your help to do it!
I hope you'll join us for our upcoming Weekend of Action and our State Convention next Saturday. There is much work to be done, but Ohio Democrats are gearing up to take back our state.

TRUMP WATCH
## Trump's Broken Promises to Ohio Families
Our country is experiencing a caregiving crisis, which has only been exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic and Donald Trump's disastrous response. Trump has failed to deliver on his child care promises, doesn't understand the challenges working families face and has only made things worse for American families.
* Trump's failed response exacerbated the economic fallout from coronavirus, which created further hardship for parents who were already struggling due to Trump's broken child care promises.
* Trump failed to secure real progress on paid family leave and even scaled back paid family leave requirements during the pandemic.
* Trump is pushing all schools to fully reopen and threatening to withhold funding, but has no plan on how schools, teachers and caregivers can do so safely.
* As coronavirus ripped through nursing homes, Trump failed to provide facilities with needed resources and pushed ahead with efforts to relax regulations.
* Trump's coronavirus response has failed to look out for the physical safety and economic security of frontline health care workers.
* Trump's repeated efforts to eliminate the Affordable Care Act and slash billions from Medicaid pose a threat to long-term care for seniors and the well-being of their caretakers.
Twitter
After releasing a new plan to build a robust 21st century caregiving and education workforce earlier this week, Vice President Joe Biden gave a detailed address outlining how his plan will help build back better by supporting direct care workers, making child care and early childhood education more available and affordable and expanding access to home-based care for seniors and people with disabilities.

""Ohio has been under a one-party rule for decades and what we are seeing are the consequences of that undemocratic arrangement.

""Vice President Mike Pence's visit is too little, too late for the people of the Mahoning Valley,"" Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper said. ""The Trump administration has ignored the workers of GM Lordstown for years, starting with his very first day in office, when GM laid off more than 1,000 workers. The workers of GM Lordstown begged Donald Trump to do something to help them for years -- for years. He ignored their pleas. And then when the plant was finally shut down, Donald Trump had the audacity to go on Twitter and blame the workers and their union leaders.""
Facebook
""It remains to be seen if this project will become what has been promised. I hope it does because the last thing the people of the Mahoning Valley need is more broken promises. Donald Trump told Ohioans, 'don't move, don't sell your house.' But that's exactly what so many working families had to do.""

Congresswoman Joyce Beatty,info@ohiodems.org,America is ready for a Black woman to serve as vice president,"Dear fellow Ohio Democrats,
I woke up this morning feeling more hopeful than I have in far too long.
Tonight, Kamala Devi Harris will make history as the first Black woman and Asian-American woman to accept the vice presidential nomination of a major party. Little Black girls around the country will watch on TV as someone who looks like them proves they can do anything. Be anything. Achieve anything.
As a Black woman in government myself, I know all too well the barriers and hurdles that trailblazers face. Just a few months ago, I was pepper sprayed by police at a Black Lives Matter protest when simply doing my job by showing up for my constituents. The Black women who came before me faced even greater threats, but continued pushing on -- because that's what Black girls do. We eat ""no"" for breakfast, like Kamala says.
America is ready for a Black woman to serve as vice president -- in fact, it is long overdue -- but breaking this barrier and defeating Donald Trump is going to require each and every one of us to get off the sidelines.
I'm inviting you today to step up with me and get this done -- can I count on you to chip in $10 to elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris?

I'm so proud of Kamala, and I can't wait to see her tonight and to pay tribute to all of the Black women on whose shoulders we stand. We owe them everything.
I'm Joyce Beatty, and I approve this message.

One Year After GM Layoffs Begin, Trump Lies About a Blue-Collar Boom
Donald Trump touted a ""blue-collar boom"" during his State of the Union address -- but Ohio lost thousands of blue-collar jobs last year, and this week was the one-year anniversary of General Motors beginning involuntary layoffs of thousands of workers, leading to the shuttering of their Lordstown factory.
Facebook
Share on Facebook Share on Twitter
""Donald Trump thinks that closing GM Lordstown 'doesn't really matter,' and he has certainly acted that way, as he's been to Ohio six times in the past year and has never once come to Lordstown to look the workers and community members in the eye,"" said Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper. ""There is no 'blue-collar boom' happening in Ohio. It's the exact opposite. We've lost thousands of blue-collar jobs over the past year, and Trump's trade war by tweet has harmed Ohio manufacturers, farmers, small businesses and consumers. The Federal Reserve found that Trump's failed trade policies backfired on manufacturing. On top of all that, Trump's tax scam actually encourages corporations to outsource jobs.
""Don't be fooled by Donald Trump's State of the Union lies about the economy. Many parts of Ohio that are heavily dependent on manufacturing are struggling with job losses. Trump keeps breaking his promises, and Ohio workers are paying the price.""
Tweet
Last year was the worst year for Ohio's job growth since 2009, and the Buckeye State lost 1,700 manufacturing jobs and 9,000 construction jobs between December 2018 and December 2019. Just today we learned that the nation lost 12,000 manufacturing jobs last month.

Protecting the Right to Organize
This week state Reps. H. Gilson Blair and Brigid Kelly celebrated the U.S. House's passage of the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act. Blair and Kelly have introduced a resolution calling on Congress to pass this legislation, which would give millions of workers additional protections to organize and negotiate for better pay, better benefits and safer working conditions.
Facebook
""I am pleased that the U.S. House of Representatives passed the PRO Act,"" Blair said. ""We urge the U.S. Senate to quickly follow suit. This act will strengthen our nation's economy by supporting working families and leveling the playing field for economic development.""
Tweet
""The PRO Act is a long overdue step to make a more level playing field for workers. When hard-working people join together and negotiate for a better life, it builds a stronger economy, a stronger state and a stronger nation,"" said Kelly. ""I now urge the U.S. Senate to stand with workers and pass this legislation quickly.""

David Pepper,info@ohiodems.org,Protecting your right to vote,"Dear team,
Ohio's primary election was supposed to be over one week ago. Instead, hundreds of thousands of Ohioans who expected to vote on Election Day are stuck in limbo, wondering if and when they'll get the chance to make their voices heard.
Let's be clear: we supported Gov. Mike DeWine's decision to close Ohio's polling places last week for in-person voting -- they simply weren't safe for poll workers or voters. But the precedent of a postponed election is a dangerous one, and we were deeply troubled when some Republicans began immediately calling for the primary election to be closed after Tuesday ... even though voters were barred from the polls.
That's why we went to court. To defend democracy and protect your right to vote. To set the precedent that elections and our democracy must move forward even in difficult times.
We believe that no Ohioan should have to choose between exercising their civic duty or protecting their health.
That's why our attorneys are arguing for an extension of the primary and wide vote-by-mail opportunities before the Ohio Supreme Court this week (and our Democratic legislators are doing the same in the Statehouse).
Ohio Dems are fighting hard for you, but we need your help -- can you pitch in $5 right now to sustain our legal fight?
We know this is a difficult time for many families and individuals, but this is a critical moment. If you can't make a contribution right now, we hope you'll stay engaged in the coming weeks as we ramp up our organizing efforts (while staying safe and at home!) for 2020.
But if you're in a position to help our cause, here's the link to chip in: [[URL REDACTED]]

ODP Weekly Update,info@ohiodems.org,Looking out for one another,"Dear folks,
I wanted to provide a short update on how we are adjusting and operating in light of the coronavirus crisis and the rapidly changing conditions it is causing.
For us, and we hope for you, priority one must be protecting health -- of voters, volunteers, staff and the public at large. At this critical moment, we all have a responsibility to flatten the curve of the spread of this virus. At the same time, we continue to have a duty to protect the right to vote in the upcoming election and the responsibility to support our candidates, at every level, as we head into the fall campaign season.
Weighing those factors, here are several key areas we are addressing.
Polling Locations
Almost 130 polling locations have been closed because they house vulnerable populations. Replacement locations are being identified, and we are working to contact the non-resident voters -- by mail and/or phone -- to inform them of their new polling places. These locations will also be posted on [[URL REDACTED]] as quickly as possible. Finally, we will send volunteers out on Primary Election Day to ensure that signs are in place at each closed polling place that inform voters where the new polling place is located.
How you can help: Encourage people to go to [[URL REDACTED]] to confirm their polling location.
Voting Early
Given the general worry about long lines and large-scale interactions, we are strongly encouraging people to vote early. Early in-person vote locations are generally less crowded, and absentee ballots will be counted as long as they are postmarked by Monday, March 16, or returned in person to your county board of elections by Tuesday, March 17, at 7:30 p.m.
How you can help: Encourage people to vote early -- find out more at [[URL REDACTED]]
Poll Workers
There is currently a troubling shortage of poll workers, particularly as more senior poll workers opt out. Fewer poll workers could result in long lines and other problems. To the extent younger folks are willing, we are asking them to serve as poll workers on Primary Election Day. Hundreds have already answered the call. Click here to sign up to work the polls on Primary Election Day. You'll get to be a part of our democratic process and even earn a little extra cash.
Facebook
If you encounter challenges or problems regarding voting in your community, please reach out to Voter Protection Director Gretchen Bennett at [[URL REDACTED]]
Look Out for One Another
More broadly, global health crises like the COVID-19 outbreak remind us of the importance of looking out for one another and using common sense to keep our communities safe. Besides frequently washing your hands and staying home when you're sick, there are several actions you can take to show support to your community:
* Call your neighbors and loved ones who are at greater risk (if they are older or have pre-existing illnesses).
* Donate to your local food bank to help out folks who are experiencing food insecurity (click here to donate to the Ohio Association of Food Banks).
* If using home delivery services, tip well! If you have to discontinue a cleaning service or child care, continue to pay these service workers as you would normally, if you are financially able.
Ohio can be an example to the rest of the country of how to respond to pandemics -- so let's listen to public health experts and do our part to flatten the curve.
Stay safe,
David Pepper

TRUMP WATCH
Trump Is Fumbling the Coronavirus Response
Instead of providing solutions that would help American families, Donald Trump's address to the nation was filled with inaccuracies, sowed confusion among Americans and failed to provide solutions to critical problems, such as insufficient testing.
Trump continues to irresponsibly downplay the danger to Americans, and he has seized on the crisis to push his own political agenda.
Twitter
Even as the coronavirus spread, Trump proposed cutting funding to Health and Human Services, the Centers for Disease Control, the World Health Organization and global health programs. Trump eliminated critical staff who would have been responsible for leading the U.S. response to deadly pandemics, and the NSC's director for medical and biodefense preparedness remains unfilled.
Twitter
Meanwhile, the Trump administration is backing a lawsuit to overturn the Affordable Care Act, has failed to offer clarity on whether coronavirus testing will be classified as a guaranteed ""essential health benefit"" that insurers must cover, and has expanded ""junk"" insurance plans that don't have to cover these benefits.
OHIO DEMS IN THE HEADLINES
Workers Need Paid Sick Leave
Ohio House Democratic lawmakers announced their support of a plan by U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown and Senate Democrats to create a temporary federal paid sick leave program that would lessen the economic impact of a widespread coronavirus outbreak.
Facebook
The Paid Sick Days for Public Health Emergencies and Personal Family Care Act would require all employers to allow workers to accrue seven days of paid sick days and to provide an additional 14 days available immediately in the event of any public health emergency, including the current coronavirus crisis.
Facebook
""Best practices, like washing hands and staying home from work if you're sick are our first and best line of defense to contain the spread of the Covid-19 coronavirus. However, the fact remains that too many Ohioans are living paycheck-to-paycheck and simply cannot afford to stay home from work for an extended period of time,"" House Democratic Leader Emilia Strong Sykes said. ""That's why we urged the governor earlier this week to release emergency funding to lessen the economic impact on working families, and why we echo that call today, urging the swift passage of emergency legislation offered by Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown. This is a public health crisis as well as an economic crisis -- and we need to act immediately and urgently to protect both the physical and economic health of everyday Ohioans.""

Trump Broke His Promises to Ohioans -- And Now He's Lying About It
During his Toledo rally last night, Donald Trump claimed that Ohio had its ""best year economically"" -- but that was a bald-faced lie. Here is the truth: Since January 2019, Ohio has lost more than 4,000 jobs. Trump also lied about bringing ""a lot of car companies into Ohio"" -- which must be news to the laid-off workers of GM Lordstown.
Tweet
Ahead of his speech, Ohio Democrats held a news conference to call out Trump's broken promises.
Facebook
Share on Facebook Share on Twitter
From the Toledo Blade:
Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper said there was only one reason for the president to visit Ohio so much during his last campaign and come back to the state to kick off his 2020 campaign.
""Our state is in play,"" he said.
Mr. Pepper was part of a group of Democratic leaders, candidates for office, and local stakeholders who came together mid-morning Thursday for a news conference to highlight what he calls President Trump's broken promises and failed policies.
Jobs -- specifically in manufacturing and agriculture -- education, healthcare, and trade have all been negatively affected by the president's policies, Mr. Pepper said, and Ohioans specifically have been forced to bear the consequences.
State Rep. Lisa Sobecki (D., Toledo) said medical costs for many families have gone up despite President Trump's promise to lower healthcare prices. Thousands of Ohioans -- including children -- have also lost access to health insurance, she said.
Sheena Barnes, Toledo Public Schools board member, emphasized the debt that many graduates are under and how that's stagnating the progress they could be making.
""Ohio graduates can't focus on the future if they can't pay for it,"" she said.

Ready ... Set ... Caucus!
This week thousands of Ohio Democrats participated in 16 caucuses across the state to elect district-level delegates for the 2020 Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee. This year more than 3,000 Ohioans applied to run for delegate -- shattering the previous record of 800 in 2016.

The results of Ohio's presidential primary on March 17 will determine the number of delegates each presidential candidate is allocated in each congressional district and statewide.
Ohio will have a total of 153 convention delegates and 11 alternates, evenly divided between men and women, with diversity goals for African Americans, Hispanic/Latinos, Native Americans, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, LGBTQ+ folks, people with disabilities, veterans and young people (age 18-36).
Congrats to everyone who won the opportunity to attend the convention as a delegate!

David Pepper,info@ohiodems.org,Fighting to save the primary,"Dear Ohio voter,
The past 24 hours have been a whirlwind here in Ohio. We hope and trust all are staying safe amid the crisis.
While Ohioans could not cast their ballots in person today, the election must move forward -- so Ohio Democrats today filed an action with the Ohio Supreme Court to preserve Ohio's Primary election, and allow it to be extended forward.
Without action, the risk is that the only votes that will count will be the ones already cast, since Election Day has ended without action from the General Assembly (and only a legislative act or a court order can set the date of a primary election). Some are already making this argument.
That outcome would be the height of injustice -- so today we filed a suit with the Ohio Supreme Court to ensure that all eligible Ohio voters are able to exercise their right to vote safely in this primary, and we proposed a reasonable extension of mail voting and direct ballot drop-off opportunities at county election boards to get this done.
And rest assured to any voter who planned to cast their ballot today -- we will fight like hell to ensure that you have an opportunity to make your voice heard in this critical election.
Continue to stay safe and healthy, and we will provide more information shortly.
Thank you,
David

Joe Biden holds a slight lead in Ohio -- chip in now to solidify Biden's lead by funding our digital ads.
Great news, team --
This thing is SO CLOSE.
But because of grassroots supporters like you, Joe Biden holds a slight lead in a new poll of Ohio voters.
Just a year ago, pundits were ready to write off Ohio as a forever-red state -- and now, Ohio could decide the whole damn thing (pardon my language).
One key reason: Ohio counts and announces our absentee votes first. So when Trump suggests he'll challenge the results in other states, a blue Ohio ends it -- the Trump presidency, and the drama.
Facebook
My team is planning major ad buys to voters across Ohio to remind loyal Democrats to vote early AND persuade voters who are still on the fence to support Biden. You see, in Ohio, you have to both persuade folks and turn out your base in order to win, so that's exactly what we're doing.
But effective ad campaigns are expensive, and we need to raise $30,000 to get these ads up and running.
Early voting opens in just 12 days, so we have to move quickly -- will you chip in $10 today to turn Ohio blue and end the Trump presidency?

There couldn't be more at stake -- which is why we can't leave any votes on the table. We need to go all out.
We crunched the numbers this morning, and it looks like we need to raise another $15,000 in the next 48 hours to fund our remaining digital ads.
I hate asking for money, but with the White House, the Ohio Supreme Court and the Statehouse majority at stake, we can't afford to let off the gas pedal now. Can I count on you to chip in $10 right now to fund our ads for the next 10 days?

Thanks so much for being on this team -- now let's go win this thing!

## Trump Threatens Social Security in Executive Order
As we celebrate the 85th anniversary of President Franklin D. Roosevelt signing the Social Security Act into law today, Donald Trump is threatening the program, which provides income and security to nearly 2.4 million Ohioans.
Ohio Dems
""Donald Trump is breaking his promise to 'save our Social Security' with a proposal that 'is a threat to Social Security no matter how he casts it,'"" said Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper. ""This is not the first time Trump has attacked Social Security. Since he's been in office, Trump has proposed and supported cutting Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. Trump's last budget proposal cut Social Security programs by $26 billion and slashed funding for the Social Security Administration, which helps retirees and people with disabilities get the support they need and have earned.
""After 85 years, Social Security still works for the American people. Joe Biden knows it provides peace of mind and the ability to retire with dignity for millions of Americans, and he will fight to preserve and strengthen it. He would never undermine the Social Security trust fund, as Donald Trump is trying to do. Trump promised to protect Social Security, but Ohio seniors and families are paying the price for Trump's broken promises.""

## Ohio Democrats Call for Cohesive Back-to-School Plan
This week state Rep. Phil Robinson criticized Gov. Mike DeWine on the lack of a statewide plan to address school reopenings.
Twitter
""Instead of rolling out a statewide, back-to-school plan, the governor continues to shift the difficult decisions to the school districts who then shift the decisions to the parents to somehow choose between their child's health, their own health and their employment,"" Robinson said.
""What is actually happening as a result of no statewide intervention is we are deepening the economic divides in our society, perpetuating a system of haves and have nots. Those who have the means to do remote learning and keep their children healthy, can. Those working parents who rely on in-person instruction so they can hold down a job, cannot.""

Since Mike DeWine took office in January, he has signed one unconstitutional abortion ban and zero bills to deal with gun violence, pushed forward with punishing and self-defeating Medicaid work requirements, diverted millions of dollars from public schools to private school vouchers and stood by as more than 4,000 jobs have left Ohio.

""All the rhetoric in the world can't change the sad reality that 2019 is on track to be the first year since 2009 -- the height of the Great Recession -- that Ohio has lost jobs,"" said Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper. ""As Ohio struggles economically, rather than pursuing reforms and investments to lift Ohio's flagging economy, Mike DeWine and the Ohio GOP have dedicated most of their energies to doing the bidding of right-wing extremists and special-interest groups.""

For nearly two years, we have been telling folks not to count out Ohio.
This week, it feels like people are finally starting to believe.
Yesterday we saw not one, not two, but *three* polls from the Buckeye State showing Joe Biden ahead of Donald Trump. This thing isn't over, not by a long shot, but it's going to be close -- just like we've always said.
Now all eyes will once again be on Ohio, as the first presidential debate comes to Cleveland next week. Our Ohio 2020 Victory coordinated campaign is hosting a virtual debate watch party on Tuesday night -- click here to join in the pre-debate program and watch with candidates, grassroots volunteers and activists from across the state. (There will be a few special guests, too.)
I'll be sharing my thoughts about Ohio as a battleground state and real-time reactions to the debate via text with those of you who are interested. Text DEBATE to 79229 to sign up for my debate insights, and I'll even answer a few of your questions, as well.

## Ohio Workers Call Out Trump's Broken Promises
Before Donald Trump's visit to the Buckeye State this week, Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur, Ohio Democratic Party Vice Chair Rhine McLin, Ohio Farmers Union President Joe Logan and International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 8 Membership Development Director Josh Abernathy called out Trump's broken promises to workers and farmers in a virtual news conference on Monday.
Facebook
From Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur:
""And Donald Trump has broken his promises to Ohio workers; in his speech in Toledo back in 2016, I'll quote him, he said, 'New factories will come rushing to our shores.' Well, guess what? Our trade deficit is bigger than ever, and his policies have actually accelerated offshoring and the loss of American manufacturing jobs ... If you look at Trump's tax scam he gave away billions to big corporations, but actually what they've done is continued to outsource ...""
Twitter
From Ohio Farmers Union President Joe Logan:
""What (Trump) has done was to break apart the network of international markets for agricultural commodities and virtually decimate our market for soybeans. The billions of tons of soybeans that we used to send to China ... are still going to China, but they're coming from Brazil.""

## Let's Make It Count, Ohio!
The Ohio Democratic Party is bringing together Ohio icons and friends of the Buckeye State including Ohio State football legend Archie Griffin, television star Ed O'Neill, rocker and music producer Todd Rundgren and comedian Phoebe Robinson for its ""Make It Count"" campaign to encourage Ohioans to vote early this election season.
Facebook
""We're thrilled to partner with these iconic Ohioans and friends of the Buckeye State on our Make It Count campaign, our biggest and most robust early voting program ever,"" said Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper. ""Ohio Democrats have always believed our democracy is stronger when everyone counts and every vote is counted. Donald Trump is trying to bully his way through this election because he is afraid he's losing, and Ohio Republicans are helping him every step of the way. However, Ohioans will not be deterred or dissuaded from voting -- huge numbers of Ohio voters have already requested a vote-by-mail ballot. Whether we are black or white, young or old, Ohioans are coming together this election season to make their voices heard and make it count.""

Gretchen Bennett (ohiodems.org),info@ohiodems.org,What happened in Georgia yesterday,"The circumstances of yesterday's election are by design, not by coincidence. Ohio Democratic Party
Team,
What happened in Georgia yesterday makes my blood boil, and it should infuriate anyone who cares about the right to vote.
Long lines.
Shortages of ballots.
Mysteriously missing voting machines.
This is what happens when Republican officials play politics with the right to vote, and one of our most prominent Ohioans noticed something interesting about those long lines and missing voting machines.
Lebron James tweet
The circumstances of yesterday's election are by design, not by coincidence, and this dysfunction isn't just exclusive to Georgia. It has happened here in Ohio (remember Ken Blackwell and 2004?) -- and Ohio Republicans are trying to do it again.
Secretary of State Frank LaRose is currently pushing for ""consolidation"" of in-person polling locations. That's just another way of saying he wants to close polling places, and it's a recipe for long lines on Election Day. Ohio Republicans are also trying to make it harder to vote by mail.
All of these barriers would impact African-American voters disproportionately, and the GOP is well aware. A Republican county chair in Ohio even confessed their motives a few years back, writing: ""I guess I really actually feel we shouldn't contort the voting process to accommodate the urban -- read African-American -- voter-turnout machine."" (Sometimes Republicans actually say the quiet part out loud.)
Republicans are trying to make it harder to vote here in Ohio -- and with the most important election of our lifetimes now less than five months away, we can't afford to let them get away with it.
My team is fighting hard to ensure Ohio's election is safe, fair and accessible to all, but we need your help -- will you chip in $5 right now to protect the right to vote?

Ohio Democrats,info@ohiodems.org,Sign on to this petition,"Don't let right-wing extremists drown out your voice -- sign on to tell Gov. DeWine that you support only a responsible reopening of Ohio.
Folks--
The last few days have been deeply troubling in Ohio, as a small group of right-wing extremists attempt to drown out the voices of the rest of us who value public health and safety.
These extremists have gathered at the Ohio Statehouse for weeks in order to pressure Gov. Mike DeWine into reopening Ohio more quickly. And yesterday, these extremists went a step further by openly carrying firearms in front of Dr. Amy Acton's private home.
This menacing behavior is designed to intimidate and must not be tolerated. This group wants to pressure our leaders into an unsafe reopening of the state, even when most Ohioans disagree.
As the rest of us practice social distancing, we cannot allow these extreme voices to be the only ones our state leaders hear. The voices of frontline workers, those most vulnerable to COVID-19 and everyday Ohioans must also be heard.
That's why Ohio Democrats favor a responsible reopening to Ohio -- moving forward only once widespread testing is implemented, masks are required in public, workers are fully protected and child care options are available.
We believe in reopening responsibly because we stand with America's essential workers, whether they work in a hospital, nursing home or a grocery store, drive a tractor trailer or transit bus, deliver packages or keep our communities safe and our workplaces clean. They should not bear the cost of reopening irresponsibly.
We believe in reopening responsibly because we stand with the parents currently facing the impossible choice between reporting back to work or staying home to care for their children.
And we believe in reopening responsibly because we stand with science, which tells us that reopening too early will likely cause a second spike in cases -- which will ultimately cost even more lives and jobs in the long run.
Folks, any plan to reopen the state cannot move forward without making the safety and well-being of Ohioans the No. 1 priority.
Don't let the extreme voices drown out the vast majority of Ohioans -- add your name to this petition if you support only a responsible reopening of Ohio.

TRUMP WATCH
Trump Still Wants to ""Terminate"" the Affordable Care Act
The coronavirus pandemic has claimed the lives of more than 70,000 Americans, but the Trump administration and Republican officials are still fighting to rip health coverage away from more than half a million Ohioans who are covered under the Medicaid expansion, take protections away from nearly five million Ohioans with pre-existing conditions and put as many as one-fourth of Ohio's hospitals at risk for closure.
Twitter
""Since Donald Trump came into office, Ohio's uninsured rate has gone up, and the number of uninsured Ohio kids has surged, and that was before the coronavirus crisis hit our shores,"" said Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper. ""Trump and the GOP have never had a plan for health care -- this lawsuit is the Republican plan. Even after more than 70,000 Americans have died from COVID-19 and more than one million cases have been confirmed, Republicans will not stop in pursuit of their goal of overturning the Affordable Care Act and taking away coverage from millions of Americans.""

Ohio Dems Stand with Science and Protecting Ohioans
This week Ohio House Democrats stood united against legislation that would limit the ability of Ohio's Health Director Dr. Amy Acton to protect public health during the coronavirus outbreak.
Facebook
""Lawmakers were called back to Columbus this week not to discuss paid family leave or to address child care concerns,"" said Ohio House Democratic Leader Emilia Sykes. ""We didn't hear any testimony on bills related to expanding broadband access or protecting workers in the workplace. As everyday Ohioans struggle to pay their overdue bills at the beginning of yet another month in quarantine, we didn't move quickly to ensure they could stay in their homes or keep their utilities connected. No, Republicans brought us back only to hamstring the state's health director during a public health crisis. This is disgraceful abuse of power and unnecessary use of government bureaucracy to slow down a process that will always need to be swift.""

David Pepper,info@ohiodems.org,"If we lose these races, we could lose Ohio for another decade","There's so much at stake this year. Ohio Democratic Party
Karl Rove is back, friends.
And this time he's in Ohio, meddling in our state Supreme Court races for 2020. And why would Karl Rove care about the Ohio Supreme Court?
One word: gerrymandering.
Ohio Republicans are desperate to rig Ohio's districts for another decade, but if we win the state Supreme Court races on the ballot this year, we can stop them.
If you want to fight back against Karl Rove's attacks and end gerrymandering in Ohio once and for all, chip in whatever you can now to our Supreme Court Fund.
In 2010, national Republicans and right-wing special interests came up with a plan called REDMAP to dump dark money into state races that would influence redistricting for the coming decade. Here in Ohio, they took back control of the legislature and statewide offices and proceeded to draw the most gerrymandered map in the state's history.
The legal challenge to those gerrymandered districts ended up before -- you guessed it -- the Ohio Supreme Court, which voted 4-3 to uphold the maps.
In 2020, we have the opportunity to take a 4-3 majority on the Supreme Court and ensure the legislature draws fair maps -- which is what clear majorities of Ohioans voted for when they backed redistricting reform not once, but twice.
That's what Karl Rove and national Republicans are so afraid of -- an Ohio Supreme Court that will stand up for everyday Ohioans.
Our candidates, Judge John P. O'Donnell and Judge Jennifer Brunner, are running strong races. They can win, but the dark-money attack ads are coming fast. We need to be able to respond.
We've raised more than $40,000 online in the past week, but we really need another $13,000 to fill our budget gap and keep our digital ads running through Election Day.
Can we count on you to support our Supreme Court Fund right now? Every few bucks makes a big difference.
Let's win this (and defeat Karl Rove),

TRUMP WATCH
Democratic Turnout Beats GOP Turnout in Ohio Primary Election
For the first time in 12 years, Democratic turnout outpaced Republican turnout in a presidential primary election in Ohio, as Democrats continue to make significant gains in formerly deep-red suburban strongholds.
Facebook
Even with more than 200,000 absentee ballots still outstanding, Democratic turnout was 25 percent higher than GOP turnout.
On a conference call with reporters this week, Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper said, ""It doesn't mean that we're guaranteed to win. We're a close state but it puts us in a much better position to win than we've been in any year since '08. We are now in the mix as a swing state in a way that we weren't.""
This follows on the heels of two consecutive polls showing Joe Biden in the lead in the Buckeye State.
""President Donald Trump is currently struggling in Ohio, suggesting his path to a second term may be very difficult,"" according to a USA Today column by three political science professors, who note the president's falling poll numbers in the state and growing concerns amongst Ohioans about the impact of the coronavirus crisis.

Ohio House Dems Demand Provisional Ballots Be Counted
This week state Rep. Paula Hicks-Hudson, state Rep. Michele Lepore-Hagan and state Rep. Bride Rose Sweeney sent a letter to Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose demanding that provisional ballots cast on Tuesday be counted. Mail delays and confusion around the primary changes left some Ohio voters without a vote-by-mail ballot and no choice but to vote a provisional ballot in person on Tuesday.

Kirstin Alvanitakis,info@ohiodems.org,We need to be ready,"Hi,
I just looked back at all of the things Mike DeWine did in his first year in office, and despite all you hear about how ""moderate"" he is -- DeWine's agenda has been a dream come true for right-wing extremists.
Here's just a sampling of DeWine's ""accomplishments"":
* Signed into law one of the nation's most restrictive abortion bans
* Millions in funding for fake health clinics that shame and lie to women
* Nothing done to stop the epidemic of gun violence and a broken promise to gun safety advocates after Dayton
* Millions of dollars taken out of public schools to fund private school vouchers
* New rules designed to kick Ohioans off their Medicaid health coverage
On top of all that -- Ohio has lost more than 4,000 jobs since DeWine took office in January.
DeWine might have the right-wing special interests on his side, but we have grassroots supporters like you. Every dollar that you chip in helps us fight back against DeWine's agenda -- and with one extreme bill after another this year, we need all hands on deck.

Throughout DeWine's first year in office, Ohioans have been struggling -- but instead of fighting for reforms and investments to lift up our communities, Mike DeWine and the Ohio GOP have spent most of their time doing the bidding of right-wing extremists and special interest groups.
I can only hope that in 2020, Gov. Mike DeWine will spend more energy lifting jobs and wages for everyday Ohioans and far less doing the bidding of right-wing special interests -- but if not, we need to be ready to fight back.

Jim Jordan Alert (via OH Dems),info@ohiodems.org,(sigh) Jim Jordan's back in the spotlight,"It's official -- Jim Jordan has been chosen as one of Donald Trump's ""personal warriors"" for the impeachment trial.
POLITICO
So what does that mean exactly? Well essentially, Jim Jordan has been tasked with going on Fox News to spew whatever lie Trump is pushing that day.
And after his performance during impeachment hearings in the fall -- complete with interrupting, yelling and spreading misinformation -- it's no surprise that Trump is propping up Jordan as one of his personal puppets.
Jordan proved during hearings in the fall that he'll say or do whatever Team Trump wants.
That's why Ohio Democrats are keeping up the heat on Jim, to make sure he is held accountable in his home state and home district.

But we need your help -- can you chip in $15 to our voter protection operation?
Hi team -- it's nice to meet you!
My name is Vashitta Johnson, and I recently joined the voter protection team here at the Ohio Democratic Party.
I woke up this morning feeling inspired. There was massive voter turnout in Super Tuesday states last night -- Virginia saw double the Democratic turnout from 2016 -- and voters across the country sent a clear message to the GOP that we're ready to win come November.
At the same time, we're still seeing the effects of Republican policies, such as cutting down on polling locations, that make it harder for many Americans to vote. Some voters in Texas waited nearly seven hours to vote last night. And very often, these policies fall hardest on communities that traditionally vote Democratic -- African Americans, Latinos and college students. It's unacceptable.
And that's why I'm here. We at the ODP voter protection team are working around the clock to monitor early voting locations and Primary Election Day polling places to ensure that every eligible Ohio voter is able to cast a ballot on March 17.
Voter protection is incredibly important work, and we need you on this team. Send Republicans a message that making it harder to vote is unacceptable -- click here to chip in $15 to help us protect the right to vote.

Ending the scourge of gerrymandering in Ohio is within reach this year, but we need grassroots support to get it done.
Will you chip in $10 -- or whatever you can -- to elect a Democratic majority on the Ohio Supreme Court and end gerrymandering?
Donate
Team --
If you've been following Ohio politics for a while, you probably know that we're ranked as one of the most gerrymandered states in the country.
Maps like this ...
CBS poll
... are why we have members of Congress like this:
CBS poll
So how do we unrig the maps and ensure fair districts in 2022?
The Ohio legislature will draw the new map -- so first, we need to elect more Democratic members of the Ohio House and Senate.
But after the new lines are drawn, the Ohio Supreme Court will be the court to review any new attempt to create unfair legislative maps.
And this year, for the first time in decades, we have the opportunity to flip two seats and take a 4-3 majority on the state Supreme Court. These two races will have implications for redistricting, for workers' rights, for health care and so much more.
Both of our candidates -- Jennifer Brunner and John P. O'Donnell -- are ahead in polls, meaning that the end of gerrymandering is within our grasp. However, the other side knows it too, and corporate special interests are already signaling they intend to dump huge amounts of money into these races.
We need your help to get our Democratic candidates across the finish line -- donate $10 (or $100 -- whatever you can) right now to our Ohio Supreme Court Fund.

The final minutes of the debate in Cleveland last night could not have been more troubling. Donald Trump refused to say whether he'd accept the results of the election if it's close.
Still, there's one major obstacle that can stop Trump's plan: Ohio.
Facebook
Trump doesn't have a path to 270 Electoral College votes without us, and Ohio's absentee ballots are counted and announced first, so nearly all of our results come as early as Election Night. So while Trump is depending on the chaos of counting ballots for weeks, an early and blue result in Ohio ends the Trump presidency (and any chaos he tries to stoke).
I just talked to my finance team, and it looks like we need to bring in $10,000 before tonight's end-of-quarter deadline to keep our program on track and increase Biden's one point lead in Ohio. Will you pledge $10 -- or whatever you can -- to the campaign to turn Ohio blue?

We lost two giants -- former Federal Sixth Circuit Appellate Judge Nathaniel Jones and Hamilton County Commissioner Todd Portune.
Dear friend,
Last weekend was a tough one for Greater Cincinnati and all of Ohio.
We lost two giants -- former Federal Sixth Circuit Appellate Judge Nathaniel Jones and Hamilton County Commissioner Todd Portune.
I was honored to have clerked for Judge Jones, who served as a mentor and friend ever since that clerkship. Todd and I served together at the Hamilton County Commission, and in addition to our partnership there, worked on a variety of public issues before and after.
Both men helped to shape my life and outlook on public service in so many ways. And they did the same for many others.
From his childhood days in Youngstown, Judge Jones rose to become a true giant of the law and for justice, both in our country and internationally. But he never forgot where he came from, he never lost his humility and kindness, and never stopped mentoring and inspiring an entire family of law clerks who had the honor of working for him over the years.
As for Todd, it's safe to say that no individual had a larger impact shaping policy in Hamilton County and Greater Cincinnati in the past 30 years. He made a difference on everything from infant mortality to transportation to infrastructure, as well as on the daily acts of constituent service that have such an important impact on people's lives. But his greatest legacy may be the personal courage he showed in battling one physical challenge after another. He inspired so many that as tough as things get, you can keep fighting through it all.
Both men will be missed, but both will continue to inspire as we also aim to provide public service and persevere in a difficult time.
Given the events of this week, we hope you'll continue to stay involved.

Ohio Democrats Call Out Trump's Broken Promises on Health Care
Ohio Democrats toured the Buckeye State this week, making stops in Ironton, Chillicothe, Marietta and Ravenna, to call out Donald Trump's broken promises on health care, as Ohio saw its uninsured rate jump in 2018 and the number of uninsured kids rose by 28 percent from 2016 to 2018.

Democratic Lawmakers Slam GOP's Failed Leadership, Betsy DeVos's Meddling in Voucher Debate
The last time Betsy DeVos tried to influence Ohio education policy her political action committee was found to have violated Ohio election law and was fined $5 million -- which the PAC never paid -- but Ohio Republicans who are trying to expand private school vouchers are seeking Betsy's counsel once again.
""The influence of billionaire Betsy DeVos -- and her PAC's big campaign checks -- are a major reason why Ohio's charter school system expanded so rapidly and with so little oversight,"" said Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper. ""Ohio taxpayers have been left on the hook for tens of millions of dollars from scam charter schools like the Electronic Classroom of Tomorrow, and now Betsy is advising Ohio Republicans once again about how to take public resources and give them away to private schools that are almost completely unaccountable to taxpayers. It's a farce.""

Across the state, vouchers have exploded, draining millions from school districts and forcing local tax hikes, but Ohio Republicans have failed to resolve the issue.
""It's easy to mess things up, but harder to fix them, and once again, it's Democrats who've had to come bail out failed leadership from Statehouse Republicans,"" said Ohio House Democratic Leader Emilia Strong Sykes. ""Democrats have been at the table ready to make a deal, but at the end of the day, the responsibility lies with our colleagues in the supermajority to get along. By kicking the can down the road, it's our children who will suffer.""

You likely saw the news that Bernie Sanders suspended his campaign for president yesterday.
As we move forward to the next stage of the most important election of our lifetime, it's important to take a moment to thank Bernie Sanders and his team for inspiring folks across the country and here in the Buckeye State to get involved in politics. His movement brought new people into the fold, moved the conversation forward in so many important ways and energized a generation of voters. Our party is stronger because of it.
To echo the senator's comments yesterday: in the coming months, we must join together and stand united in the fight of our lives against Donald Trump.
Twitter
Friend, he's right -- it's time to finish the job and send Donald Trump packing.
Now more than ever, we need a change of leadership in the White House.
Our current public health crisis has only further exposed how woefully unfit Donald Trump is to lead our nation. He ignores science, ignores facts, tries to silence anyone who dares to disagree with him. Leaders in Ohio are working across party lines to find solutions, but meanwhile Donald Trump is playing politics with our lives.
We're up against the most dangerous president this nation has ever seen -- and ending the Trump presidency can and will happen right here in Ohio.
But we can't do this without you. Chip in today to the Defeat Trump Fund and own a piece of the movement to end the Trump presidency in Ohio.

We're now in the home stretch, with less than 10 weeks to go until Election Day. Since the spring, we've all been coping with how to campaign during a pandemic with the hope that the coronavirus crisis would abate.
Unfortunately, this president has so botched the job that we're still seeing about 1,000 new cases every day in Ohio, and we still do not have enough testing and contact tracing to stop the spread. Even though Donald Trump is trying to pretend that the coronavirus crisis is over -- throwing an illegal party on the White House lawn with no social distancing and very few masks -- the crisis is still very much here.
We have less than 40 days until early in-person voting opens, and the Ohio Democratic Party is focused like a laser on doing whatever it takes to ensure every eligible Ohio voter that wants to cast their ballot safely and securely has the opportunity to do so and that their ballot will be counted. I'm proud to report that our organizing team brought together more than 2,000 grassroots volunteers and activists for more than 150 convention watch parties last week. Let's keep that momentum going:
Twitter
Meanwhile, this week's Republican National Convention was a parade of endless lies. One of the most egregious was when Vice President Mike Pence tried to claim that Trump saved Lordstown. Watch as this Lordstown teacher sets the record straight:
Facebook
Time and time again, Donald Trump has broken his promises and attacked Ohio workers -- first at Lordstown and now at Goodyear. We will keep holding Trump accountable for his reckless attacks on Ohio workers:

## Health Care in Crisis Under Trump
As one speaker after another distorted Donald Trump's record on health care during the Republican National Convention this week, the Ohio Democratic Party held a virtual roundtable with Dr. Arthur Lavin of Doctors Organized for Health Care Solutions, Dr. Beth Weinstock of the Physicians Action Network and Colleen Bowman, the mother of a childhood cancer survivor, to discuss America's health care crisis under Trump.
#### From Chairman David Pepper:
""Donald Trump has clearly, tragically, unnecessarily failed to contain COVID-19 because he didn't listen to experts, he didn't take it seriously and he didn't have a plan. And if that wasn't bad enough, now and still he wants to repeal health care for millions, including protections for people with pre-existing conditions, during a pandemic.""
DNC War Room
#### From Colleen Bowman:
""... when [Donald Trump] says, 'I'm going to protect pre-existing conditions' or 'I'm going to sign an executive order protecting pre-existing conditions,' there's a large population of people who thinks, OK well then that means that's protecting pre-existing conditions, not understanding that if the [Affordable Care Act] falls, there is no protection there because there isn't a plan.""
#### From Dr. Arthur Lavin:
""We know that Joe Biden knows how to stop pandemics. He led the world with Obama on the last one, stopped the pandemic from spreading here, for Ebola. And if he's elected he can stop this pandemic in its tracks in six weeks.""
#### From Dr. Beth Weinstock:
""I have had patients say things like, 'No one knows what the right thing is to do. And they're all saying different things.' And then I say, 'No, no people are saying the right thing to do -- you need to wear a mask.' But because of this mixed messaging -- and irresponsible messaging -- people are then choosing to not pay attention to any of it.""

## Voting Safely and Securely in a Pandemic
This week the Ohio Democratic Party filed a lawsuit in state court to permit county boards of elections to install multiple secure dropboxes for the return of absentee ballots.
""Expanding the availability of secure voter dropboxes within Ohio counties would make an enormous difference for safe, secure and easy voting in Ohio, as well as eliminate delays in boards receiving ballots through the mail system,"" said Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper.
Twitter
State Sen. Sandra Williams and state Sen. Nickie Antonio applauded the suit.
""With only one dropbox per county, many Ohioans will be forced to drive long distances to return their ballot, if they can find transportation during a pandemic at all,"" said Williams.
""There is nothing in the Ohio Revised Code requiring only one ballot dropbox per county. Frank LaRose made this rule himself, then refused to share the legal opinion he used to do it,"" said Antonio. ""This forces us to assume he unilaterally changed Ohio law, which the Secretary of State is not permitted to do. This lawsuit is not only warranted, it's necessary.""

I'll be honest with you: the election is looking really close in Ohio. Voters are turning out in record numbers for early voting, but there are still lots of Democratic supporters who haven't made it to the polls yet.
Around this time of year, some folks just need a little push -- a friendly voice on the other end of the line, telling them that their voice matters, that their vote matters.
Can YOU be that voice on the other end of the line? Sign up now:

I'm crunching the numbers for February, and I have bad news: it looks like we're coming up short of our online fundraising goal for this month.
It makes sense -- after all, February is the shortest month of the year. But if we fall behind now, I'm worried that we won't be able to catch up. And with the White House, the Ohio Senate and House, the state Supreme Court and so much more on the line this year, the stakes have never been higher.
Luckily, it looks like catching up is juuust within reach if 17 people from 43003 pitch in $5 -- or the price of a cup of coffee.
Can you chip in the price of a cup of coffee to help us turn Ohio blue?
Look, I love coffee as much as the next person -- but when it comes to saving our democracy, it's worth it!

This week Biden traveled to Toledo, where he delivered remarks outside United Auto Workers Local 14.
In his remarks, Biden made clear that he will fight for workers in Toledo and across Ohio and laid out how the Biden-Harris ticket will stand with workers, stop the pandemic and build back better.

Biden then traveled to Cincinnati for a Get Out the Vote Early Vote event, where he encouraged Ohio voters to make their plan to vote.

Today marks only 18 days left until Election Day, and recent polls continue to show VP Joe Biden and Donald Trump in a dead heat in Ohio -- with the most recent Quinnipiac poll showing Biden up by one.

## Pence Parachutes Into Ohio For Pep Rally
Ahead of Mike Pence's arrival in Columbus this week, Democrats and health care workers mourned the loss of more than 5,000 Ohioans to COVID-19 and called out Donald Trump's failed, incompetent response to the pandemic.
Congresswoman Joyce Beatty said, ""It's a sad day, but they're desperate. I'm very fearful that we will see what we've seen at other rallies: a lot of photo ops, very few masks if any.""
Twitter
Dr. Anita Somani slammed the Trump administration's continued attacks on the Affordable Care Act -- even in a pandemic -- saying, ""If we overturn the ACA here in Ohio, health coverage would be impacted for 740,000 folks, with as many as 5 million Ohioans who have pre-existing conditions being affected.""
Twitter
In a statement, Chairman David Pepper said, ""Pence is parachuting into Columbus for a photo op. We don't need more super-spreader pep rallies from this failed administration.""

Voting Rights Alert (via Ohio Dems),info@ohiodems.org,Stop this new attack on voting rights 🚨,"Well, team --
It looks like the Ohio GOP is trying to make voting harder. Again.
Ohio Republicans are hoping no one will notice as they rush to pass a bill that would make it harder to vote in person AND vote by mail during a global pandemic.
They're taking the chaotic, confusing primary election and using it as a blueprint for this November. If their bill passes, it would eliminate the final three days of early voting, end the past practice of mailing an absentee ballot application to every registered Ohio voter and prohibit the state from using federal funds to pay for prepaid postage for absentee ballots.
The plan also makes it nearly impossible for the governor and health director to ensure the safety of voters if we have another spike in coronavirus infections.
We should not be making it harder and less safe to vote in the middle of a global pandemic, full stop.
Can you take five minutes right now to make two calls to help us stop this bad bill? Click here for more information and a quick call script.

Trump's Toxic Health Care Agenda Puts Americans at Risk
Three years ago this week, Donald Trump lamented, ""Nobody knew health care could be so complicated."" It's obvious that we have a president who is completely unprepared to deal with the issue of health care, and now he's confronting a real crisis -- a potential pandemic.
There are things we can all do to prepare for a potential coronavirus outbreak. In Scientific American, Professor Zeynep Tufekci suggests: ""get a flu shot, if you haven't already, and stock up supplies at home so that you can stay home for two or three weeks, going out as little as possible.""
Twitter
Still, the Trump administration's incompetent coronavirus response is putting our nation at risk. The president seems more concerned about the stock market than the health and welfare of millions of Americans.
Facebook
In 2018, Trump fired his pandemic response team, and he has proposed cuts to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health.
Tweet
He appointed Vice President Mike Pence to lead the Coronavirus Task Force, but when Pence was governor of Indiana, there was a massive outbreak of HIV infections in rural Indiana.
Tweet
Despite Trump's claims that a vaccine is being developed ""rapidly,"" a national health expert says it will be 12-18 months before it will be available to the public. Even then, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar -- a former lobbyist for Big Pharma -- can't promise the vaccine will be affordable for Americans.

Bringing Down Prescription Drug Costs
There's a clear contrast between Donald Trump and Ohio Democrats on the issue of prescription drug costs. Trump made big promises to ""get those prescription drug prices way down,"" but he has failed to deliver. In contrast, Democratic lawmakers are pushing forward with proposals that would bring down the costs of prescription drugs for millions of Americans.
Facebook
This week Ohio Capital Journal highlighted legislation by state Rep. Beth Liston and state Rep. Kristin Boggs that would cap the cost of insulin at $100 a month for patients.

ODP Weekly Update,info@ohiodems.org,The worst unemployment rate since the Great Depression,"TRUMP WATCH
Ohio Workers Paying the Price for Trump's Failed Coronavirus Response
More than one million Ohioans have lost their jobs since the coronavirus crisis erupted, and the national unemployment rate has reached a level not seen since the Great Depression -- the consequences of Donald Trump's failure to prepare and a fragile economy that was vulnerable to a disastrous crash once the pandemic hit.
Facebook
""Ohio lost 12,500 jobs from January 2019 to January 2020, and that was before the coronavirus crisis hit,"" said Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper. ""Donald Trump lied when he promised Ohioans that their jobs were 'all coming back' and 'new factories will come rushing onto our shores.' Donald Trump lied when he said 'Ohio just had the best year economically in the history of your state.' No one should believe Trump when he says that the jobs lost because of the coronavirus 'will all be back and they'll be back very soon.'
""It didn't have to be this way. Donald Trump constantly downplayed the coronavirus threat and didn't take it seriously enough. His slow and chaotic response made things worse, and he's failed to deliver on his promises, just as he did with Lordstown, with trade and with health care. Working Ohioans are continuing to pay the price for Trump's broken promises.""

Ohio Dems Fight to Protect Workers
Ohio Senate Democratic Leader Kenny Yuko is calling for more coronavirus testing in all Ohio prisons and nursing homes, saying, ""Ohio's essential workers deserve every possible safety measure. This is especially critical in facilities where residents are confined together and distancing is nearly impossible.
""We've seen how quickly this virus spreads through nursing homes and prisons, yet frontline workers enter these buildings every day to do their jobs without complaint. The least we can do is provide adequate testing.""
Facebook
Twitter
State Rep. Lisa Sobecki and state Rep. Kristin Boggs testified this week in support of legislation that would allow employees infected by COVID-19, while working, to file Workers' Compensation claims.
""In many cases, Ohioans faced uncertainty and risked their health, and the health of their families, to continue to work 'essential' jobs. For example, Becky Buckeye on Alexis Street, working at a grocery store, was asked to step-up during the midst of a crisis where there was not adequate testing and PPE,"" said Sobecki. ""When Becky contracts COVID-19 because she was working outside of the home, just like in many other circumstances, she should be able to file a claim for Workers' Comp.""
""Those working on the frontlines during this pandemic have been heroes,"" said Boggs. ""The state deemed these employees essential to keep Ohio running. After sacrificing their health to keep Ohioans safe, fed and supplied, they should not have to fear the economic consequence of contracting COVID-19.""

David Pepper,info@ohiodems.org,"It takes two minutes, folks","I saw red yesterday, team.
In a major blow to voting rights, Secretary of State Frank LaRose banned county boards of elections from providing multiple secure dropboxes for voters to return their absentee ballots.
This directive is yet another thinly veiled attempt to make voting less accessible in Ohio, and LaRose is punishing boards of elections for trying to make it more convenient for voters to cast their ballots safely and securely during a global pandemic.
We need to pressure Frank LaRose NOW before it's too late -- will you pick up the phone and call on LaRose to reverse his directive?

Trump Is Breaking His Promise on Medicare and Social Security
Donald Trump has broken his promises to Ohioans on the economy, health care and student debt -- and now he's going back on his campaign pledge to ""save our Social Security"" and ""save our Medicare"" by opening the door to cuts.
Facebook
Share on Facebook Share on Twitter
""Donald Trump's comments today are straight out of Mick Mulvaney's playbook,"" said Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper. ""Trump's chief of staff likes to call Social Security 'welfare,' even though it is an earned benefit that working people pay into, and Mulvaney has been pushing for Social Security and Medicare cuts going back to his time in Congress as a Freedom Caucus extremist. For Ohio, cuts to Social Security and Medicare would be devastating. Nearly 2.4 million Ohioans receive Social Security insurance benefits -- totaling more than $3 billion every month. Medicare provides health coverage for nearly 2 million older Ohioans and hundreds of thousands of Ohioans with disabilities.""

In June 2016 at a speech in St. Clairsville, Ohio, Trump said, ""We're going to save our Social Security. We're going to save our Medicare. Others want to cut. We're going to save so much.""
Since he's been in office, Trump has proposed and supported cutting Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. Trump's last budget proposal cut Social Security programs by $26 billion and slashed funding for the Social Security Administration, which helps retirees and people with disabilities get the support they need and have earned.

It's Time to Raise the Wage
This week state Rep. Brigid Kelly testified on her bill to raise Ohio's minimum wage to $15 an hour, impacting 2 million workers in the Buckeye State.
Kelly emphasized how this legislation would benefit workers, families and communities -- as well as the state budget: ""It's also good for taxpayers because when people can make a decent living, it means they can take care of themselves, they can take care of their family's and they're less dependent on other forms of assistance.""

While Democratic lawmakers at the Ohio Statehouse work to pass legislation to raise the wage, labor groups are also pushing for a fix at the ballot box. Ohioans For Raising the Wage is advocating for a constitutional amendment that will increase the state's minimum wage to $13 an hour.

TRUMP WATCH
## Your Health Care Is On The Ballot
This week Ohio Democrats highlighted what's at stake in the 2020 presidential election, as Donald Trump continues to attack the Affordable Care Act in the courts. Trump's toxic health care agenda is putting coverage at risk for five million Ohioans with pre-existing conditions.
Ahead of the vice presidential debate on Wednesday, the Ohio Democratic Party conducted a virtual roundtable with Ohio Democratic Party Vice Chairwoman Rhine McLin, Ohio Legislative Black Caucus President Stephanie Howse and Cincinnati mother Antroinette Worsham to call out the Trump administration's failures on health care and the coronavirus crisis, which have disproportionately impacted the African-American community.
From state Rep. Stephanie Howse:
""Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have a different vision for America that is focused on listening to science and working in partnership and not having this adversarial relationship with people who are partners that can help us solve and close this health disparity gap that we are seeing across America, but especially in our Black community. We can't afford three more months, let alone four more years of Donald Trump. His incompetence is playing out, and it has led to deadly consequences.""
From Antroinette Worsham, when asked about Donald Trump's comments at the presidential debate, claiming insulin is ""so cheap it's like water"":
""Oh my god. You know, Trump, he impacted the diabetes community when he said that. We know that insulin is not cheap as water. More and more Americans are dying because they cannot afford their insulin. It's not just in the Black community, it's not just in the white community, it's not just in the Latino community, it's not just in the Hispanic community. Insulin is very expensive in America.""
Sen. Sherrod Brown also focused on health care this week, sharing the stories of Ohio families who fear what will happen if the U.S. Supreme Court overturns the Affordable Care Act.

## Ohio Needs New Supreme Court Justices
Ohio Supreme Court Justices Judi French and Sharon Kennedy are being called to account for their ruling against a child sexual assault victim in a new ad campaign that launched this week on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and other digital platforms, targeting Ohioans as they begin voting.
""Justices Judi French and Sharon Kennedy have both ruled against victims of horrific child abuse and sexual assault and denied them the full measure of justice,"" said Ohio Democratic Party Communications Director Kirstin Alvanitakis. ""As Ohioans are heading to the polls in record numbers for early voting, it's important they know what's at stake. Ohio needs new Supreme Court justices to protect victims of rape and abuse. We need to elect Judge John P. O'Donnell and Judge Jennifer Brunner.""

## Trump Attacks Ohio Workers (Again)
When General Motors shuttered its plant in Lordstown, Donald Trump took to Twitter to attack the workers and their leaders, and now Trump is lashing out on Twitter again, attacking a company that has been based in Ohio for 125 years and employs thousands of Ohio workers.
Ohio Dems
""Donald Trump promised to bring jobs back to Ohio, but we lost more than 12,000 jobs last year -- and that was before the coronavirus crisis hit our shores,"" said Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper. ""Trump's reckless handling of the coronavirus threat has cratered our economy, and his tax scam actually encourages companies to ship jobs overseas. While Goodyear has been forced to furlough thousands of workers and close factories because of the coronavirus crisis that Trump failed to address, another Akron plant just last week announced it is closing and laying off workers as it moves operations to Mexico.
""Rather than extend a helping hand, Trump is kicking Ohio when it's down and attacking union-made products and the Ohio workers who make them. We need a president who will fight for Ohio workers, not mouth off on Twitter. That's why we have to send Joe Biden to the White House in November.""
Ohio Democrats are proud to stand with the workers of Goodyear.

David Pepper,info@ohiodems.org,Nothing short of reckless,"I didn't think it could become any more clear that Trump is unfit to be president of the United States -- but his response to the coronavirus outbreak has been truly appalling.
These are difficult times, but electing a Democrat to the White House has never been more imperative, and Ohio is a must-win if we want to end the Trump presidency.
I wouldn't ask if it wasn't important -- can you chip in $5 to the Defeat Trump Fund?
Team,
In crises like this, we look to the government at all levels for leadership and guidance as we try to keep our loved ones and communities safe and navigate the disruption to our lives.
That's why it's been so refreshing to see local and state leaders in Ohio listen to experts and work together across party lines to protect Ohioans -- and why it's been so frustrating to see Donald Trump pass the buck at every opportunity.
Donald Trump's response to this pandemic has been nothing short of reckless. He ignored warning after warning and failed to prepare for months, making the coronavirus outbreak much worse in the U.S. than any other place in the world.
People across the country are getting sick on his watch, nurses and doctors are forced to treat patients without necessary protective gear, millions of workers are losing their jobs -- all because Donald Trump didn't take the coronavirus seriously, and still can't seem to manage a comprehensive response.
Now more than ever, we need to come together and fight to elect a Democratic president in November -- a president who puts the country first, a president who takes the job seriously, a president who listens to experts and not his son-in-law or Rudy Giuliani.
And that fight is happening right here in Ohio -- the ultimate bellwether state. When we turn blue in November, the Trump presidency is over.
If you are able, can I count on you to donate $5 to the Defeat Trump Fund and ensure that we elect a Democrat to the White House in November?
Ending the Trump presidency has never been more important, and every dollar you pitch in goes directly to our fight to turn Ohio blue.

First things first -- click here to check your voter registration and confirm that it's up to date. Republican voter purges have removed hundreds of thousands of registered Ohioans from the rolls in the past year, so take two minutes to make sure your registration is active.
Next -- you likely know someone who isn't registered to vote at their current address. Do you know a 17-year-old who will be 18 before November? They can register and vote in the primary. Do you know someone who moved recently? They need to re-register at their new address to vote in the primary.

Americans all across the country are fighting for racial justice and an end to white supremacy by protesting. Here in Ohio, protestors are marching in cities big and small. But this fight does not end with justice for George Floyd, Breonna Taylor or Ahmaud Arbery -- racism must be fought with legislation as well. It must be fought in every aspect of our lives.
The Ohio Democratic Party is currently hiring for several jobs. We want to have a diverse workplace with folks being able to bring their individual experiences to the table.

TRUMP WATCH
The Ohio Democratic Party today released a new video contrasting Donald Trump's lies and broken promises with the disastrous economic reality in the Buckeye State, where over the last 11 weeks nearly 1.3 million workers have filed for unemployment -- that's more than the last three years combined.
Facebook video
""Last year was Ohio's worst year for jobs since the Great Recession -- and that was before the coronavirus crisis hit,"" said Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper. ""More than one million Ohioans have lost their jobs in less than three months because of Donald Trump's chaotic mismanagement of the coronavirus crisis, and Donald Trump has the audacity to call that some sort of victory. But his callousness is no surprise -- Trump said it didn't matter when General Motors announced it was closing its Lordstown factory, which led to the loss of thousands of jobs. This was after he told the people of the Mahoning Valley not to move or sell their houses. Donald Trump keeps breaking his promises, and working Ohioans are the ones paying the price.""
The video also focuses on Trump's heinous remarks on George Floyd and contrasts them with those of Congresswoman Joyce Beatty, who was pepper-sprayed last weekend while trying to de-escalate a confrontation at a peaceful demonstration in Columbus.
Facebook video
""When the nation is on fire, and you have the person who should be the Commander-in-Chief fanning the fire, it's just awful. But, however sad to say, not surprising,"" said Congresswoman Joyce Beatty. ""This is the same man that has made so many racial statements, 'when the looting comes the shooting,' when Puerto Ricans were devastated he threw them rolls of paper towels, when athletes were kneeling he called them S.O.B's, he went across the street to take a photo-op, with a Bible, and yet people were harmed who were protesting peacefully, and the list goes on.""

OLBC is Fighting Racism
The Ohio Black Legislative Caucus this week spoke in support of considering a bill that would declare racism a public health crisis. Amid a pandemic that disproportionately affects Black Ohioans and protests against racist police violence, this resolution would require lawmakers to look at all legislation through a racial equity lens, among 15 other points.

Gretchen Bennett (via Ohio Dems),info@ohiodems.org,This would be a disaster for voting rights,"This email is long, but it's really important and I hope you'll read until the end.
But if you're short on time, you can click here to skip ahead and chip in $5 to protect the right to vote in Ohio.
Dear team,
No one can accuse Republicans of letting a good crisis go to waste, and they have not missed an opportunity during the coronavirus pandemic to push forward their own extremist agenda -- whether it's slashing taxes for the wealthy, attacking the Affordable Care Act or cutting food assistance.
Here in Ohio, we have a troubling new development. Republicans are using this crisis to make it harder for Ohioans to vote.
Here's a quick history lesson. In 2004, Ken Blackwell was the Ohio secretary of state. He tried every trick in the book to disenfranchise eligible voters, and unfortunately it worked. During the 2004 presidential election, some Ohioans waited in line up to 10 hours, and perhaps more than 170,000 would-be voters left before casting a ballot.
The 2004 election in Ohio was universally acknowledged as a disaster, so much so that bipartisan legislation was passed -- and signed into law by a Republican governor -- to update our state's election laws and address many of the issues that arose.
Then in 2008, Ohio went blue for President Barack Obama. And ever since, Ohio Republicans have been trying to roll back the reforms we made to our election laws.
One of the most urgent issues that arose in 2004 was a shortage of voting machines in majority African-American and university precincts -- so we put it in state law that each precinct must have at least one voting machine for every 175 registered voters in that precinct.
Now, Secretary of State Frank LaRose -- who brought in Ken Blackwell to oversee his transition and help staff up his office, the very same Ken Blackwell that completely bungled election oversight in 2004 -- could roll back that very protection. In recent weeks, as part of a package of so-called ""reforms,"" LaRose is now pushing for consolidation of in-person polling locations in November -- meaning that fewer polling places will be open.
And to be abundantly clear, this would be a disaster for voting rights.
If Republicans consolidate polling places -- at LaRose's urging -- Ohioans could experience the 2004 Ken Blackwell days again, when overcrowded polling locations and hours-long lines made Ohio a national case study on how not to run elections.
Going backward on voter protection right now is troubling for a lot of reasons -- but first and foremost, why would we want to allow for a shortage of voting machines and therefore cause long lines at the polls, when we're dealing with a crisis that makes waiting in those long lines a deadly threat to public health?
At this critical moment, Ohio Democrats are leading the fight to protect the right to vote. We believe that our democracy is stronger when more people participate in the process, so we're working around the clock to make voting more accessible and fair.
This work is essential, but it isn't possible without your support -- can you chip in $5 to protect voting rights in Ohio?
Thanks,
Gretchen

David Pepper,info@ohiodems.org,How you can help end gerrymandering,"Statehouse Republicans are trying to turn lies into laws, folks. Let me tell you why they're getting away with it and how you can help us stop them.
All year, the Ohio GOP has been attacking reproductive freedom, and right now, they're hard at work on a bill that would criminalize abortion.
If this bill passes, the penalty for having or performing an abortion in Ohio could be life imprisonment or even death -- and doctors would be required to try to reimplant ectopic pregancies in the uterus (which is, um, not medically possible).
Now abortion is still legal in Ohio -- but Republican legislators aren't showing any sign of slowing down. Just this week, they moved forward with legislation to give tax credits (ahem, your tax dollars) for donations to fake health clinics that lie to women.
How are these kinds of extremist bills possible? Well, Ohio has been gerrymandered and carved into pieces to give the GOP an unfair electoral advantage. But in 2020, we have a chance to change everything.
There are two seats open on the Ohio Supreme Court, and if we can elect two justices who will stand up for fair districts, we can end the scourge of gerrymandering -- once and for all.
We're working hard to build a powerful program for 2020, and we need you to be a part of it. Make *any* recurring donation (or chip in $15 right now) and we'll send you a personalized membership card to thank you for investing in your state party.

This is a rigged system we're talking about, folks -- half of the Ohio population voted for Democrats in the 2018 election, but Republicans have drawn districts so they still hold a supermajority in the Statehouse.
Now if they want to win primaries and please dark money interest groups, GOP lawmakers have to go further and further to the right -- and because most Ohio Republicans are protected by gerrymandering, their Democratic challengers face an uphill battle in trying to hold them accountable.
But 2020 presents a chance to ultimately end gerrymandering by putting two more Supreme Court justices on the bench and electing state legislators who will stand up for fair districts.
Your investment in the Ohio Democratic Party is critical to winning at every level in 2020. Renew your membership to the party with *any* recurring donation (or a $15 gift) and you'll get a membership card as our thank you.

David Pepper,info@ohiodems.org,Rob Portman is betting you'll forget about this,"Team,
The votes are in -- and Rob Portman just voted to acquit Donald Trump, only days after refusing to hear from witnesses or consider new evidence.
But unlike any other U.S. Senator, Portman also played a direct and active role in helping disseminate a bogus cover story to conceal the president's illegal actions. He's carried water for Trump on the Ukraine scandal since day one, and his conflict of interest here is obvious -- but Portman chose to pose as an ""impartial juror"" in Trump's trial anyway.
Portman has tried to fly under the radar, but we've held him accountable at every step of the way -- and that's what we'll continue to do as your state party.
But we can only continue the drumbeat against Portman with your support. Make a recurring donation of any amount (or a one-time gift of $15) and become an official member of the Ohio Democratic Party.

""Ohioans are desperate for relief from the burden of ever-escalating drug prices, but all Donald Trump has done is offer one broken promise after another,"" said Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper. ""In January 2018, Trump pledged to 'get those prescription drug prices way down.' Since that time, prescription drug prices have continued to rise. Meanwhile, Trump is kowtowing to Big Pharma and flip-flopping on his campaign pledge to allow Medicare to negotiate directly with the drug companies on prices, as the Lower Drug Costs Now Act would do. Ohio families are literally paying the price for Donald Trump's broken promises.""

To highlight this critical issue, the Ohio Democratic Party is launching a digital campaign featuring Cass, an Ohio mom whose son has Type 1 diabetes, and John Kennedy, a 2018 Ohio House candidate and ultra-marathoner who ran 142 miles from his home to Columbus to raise awareness of the high cost of insulin and other prescription drugs.

Ohio Democrats at the state and federal level are working on solutions to the skyrocketing cost of insulin. This week Congresswoman Joyce Beatty introduced the End Price Gouging for Insulin Act to lower the cost of insulin for 7.4 million Americans.

Democratic legislators at the Ohio Statehouse are working to address this issue, as well. State Rep. Beth Liston, state Rep. Kristin Boggs, state Sen. Hearcel Craig and state Sen. Nickie Antonio have introduced the Insulin Affordability Act to cap out-of-pocket costs for insulin at $100 a month.

Subject: Our strategy to win
Dear team,
Despite the crisis we're in, democracy must continue -- and the importance of ending the Trump presidency this year is more clear than ever.
But in the interest of public health, we're moving our campaign completely online for the time being.
So what exactly does that mean?
We've canceled all in-person organizing events for the foreseeable future -- and instead, we're focusing exclusively on winning this election online. Using innovative campaign tools, we've already reached hundreds of thousands of voters through digital ads, trained grassroots activists online and held a virtual town hall with hundreds of volunteers.
We're using the newest online tools and strategies to run our campaign to turn Ohio blue -- all while keeping our volunteers and voters safe at home. But those tools cost money.
The Ohio Democratic Party is prepared to win this election -- but we need your help in order to scale up our operations, just as we would any presidential year.
If you're in a position to help our cause, can you chip in $5 to the Ohio Democratic Party?

Rhine McLin,info@ohiodems.org,Stand up and speak out,"The pain and trauma that black folks are feeling across our nation is real. Ohio Democratic Party
Dear friend,
The murder of George Floyd has led to demonstrations to demand justice across the country. We have witnessed here in Ohio the unprovoked killings of Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old child in Cleveland, and John Crawford in Beavercreek.
In Columbus this past weekend, my friend Congresswoman Joyce Beatty joined protesters alongside Columbus City Council President Shannon Hardin and Franklin County Commissioner Kevin Boyce. The scene was peaceful, but understandably tense, and while trying to de-escalate a confrontation, the three elected officials were pepper sprayed by police officers.
Facebook
And just a couple of weekends ago, House Democratic Leader Emilia Sykes herself received a call from an unknown man calling from her father state Sen. Vernon Sykes' phone number, threatening his life unless she stepped down.
Facebook
The pain and trauma that black folks are feeling across our nation is real. I feel it for our children, our grandchildren, our nieces and nephews -- all the young people in our lives who are looking to us for answers. My own father was a sit-in protester during the civil rights movement before he later served in the army and elected office, and it hurts my heart to think that his work is still unfinished all these years later.
The other side wants us to think that everything is hopeless, that violence must be met with violence, that we all should adopt an us-against-them attitude, that we can't change anything.
But as Americans, as Ohioans, as people, we are better than that. We must address systemic racism for all non-whites, attacking the policies that affect education, housing, health care and social justice. Now is the time to stand up and speak out.
As the first woman to serve as Ohio Senate Minority Leader and mayor of Dayton, I understand the challenges facing our cities' leaders right now. But we must change our policies and laws so that law enforcement agencies are fully accountable to the public and the communities they are sworn to protect.
This is the time when all people must take a stand. We can begin by registering to vote, pledging to vote and being an educated voter. In the words of Fannie Lou Hamer, ""I am sick and tired of being sick and tired.""
And the State of Ohio must join us in declaring racism to be a public health emergency -- a crucial step in moving forward in the fight for equality.
Add your name to join us in calling on Gov. Mike DeWine to support the resolution to declare racism a public health emergency.
In solidarity,
Rhine

Sherrod: ""Trump Sold People Phony Populism ... Then He Betrayed Them""
Sen. Sherrod Brown led a roundtable discussion today on the need for Vice President Joe Biden's newly announced economic recovery plan.
Facebook
Brown was joined by Ohio AFL-CIO President Tim Burga, United Steelworkers Local 979 President Dan Boone and Mahoning-Trumbull AFL-CIO Labor Council Sergeant at Arms Jaladah Aslam, who reinforced how Biden's plan for will bolster working families, create jobs, raise wages and help America Build Back Better.

Brown contrasted Biden's plan with Donald Trump's betrayal of Ohio workers: ""Trump sold people phony populism to make them think he was on their side, then he betrayed them. Go no further than the Mahoning Valley. He told workers, 'Don't sell your homes, these jobs will be back,' and they weren't. He did nothing.""

Local Leaders Protect the Health and Safety of Ohioans
As coronavirus cases have spiked in the Buckeye State and health experts attribute the increase to ""people ... not wearing masks,"" local leaders have taken action to protect the health and safety of Ohioans by requiring face coverings in public in their communities.
Facebook
""We are incredibly proud of the Ohio leaders who are following the science and listening to experts who are advocating for public mask requirements to slow the spread of the coronavirus,"" said Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper. ""We should not wait until we are the next Arizona or Texas and our hospitals are stretched to the breaking point before taking decisive action to protect the health and safety of Ohioans -- lives are at stake.""
Twitter
Twitter
Twitter
""This shouldn't be a partisan issue. Unfortunately, it seems that most Ohio Republicans are taking their cues not from the vast majority of Americans who support wearing face masks to protect public health or our GOP governor, but from the president, who refuses to wear a face mask, refuses to practice social distancing and holds rallies in crowded settings. Donald Trump is increasing the chances that many more Americans will die from the coronavirus, and he's doing it because he thinks it will help him politically.""

Ohio Dems HQ,info@ohiodems.org,[ACTION] Combat misinformation about early voting,"Hey folks,
The Ohio Democratic Party wants to make sure every eligible Ohioan knows how to cast their ballot safely this year, which is why we kicked off our ""Make It Count"" campaign this week. We deployed a brand-new website, news conferences, digital ads and more to spread the word about early voting in Ohio -- and we're just getting started!
It's the most robust early vote campaign we've ever run, because we know our success in getting Democrats to vote early this year will likely be the difference between winning and losing Ohio.
In the face of vicious misinformation attacks by Donald Trump and others, we need to spread the word about voting early as widely as we can. Will you share our Facebook post below to get the word out?

Hi folks,
Like many of you, I am heartbroken by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's passing. I'm also more frustrated than ever by the hypocrisy of the Republican Party as they try to push through a new justice when people have already started voting.
However -- this is no time to throw in the towel, folks. It's time to roll up our sleeves and get to work, because state legislatures are going to matter more than ever.
You see, statehouses are going to become the front line of defense against SCOTUS rulings. If Republicans are going to play dirty -- and they will -- it's up to us to ensure that LGBTQ+ rights, reproductive freedom and the dignity of work are protected in Ohio.
And we can only do that if we send the Ohio GOP packing this November.
Ohio Republicans have proven time and again that they won't change. From Rob Portman's blind support for Trump's SCOTUS nominee to the Ohio House GOP's vote to keep Larry Householder in office, Ohio Republicans continue to show their true colors. We have to vote them out.
Can you kick in a few bucks right now to expand our control in the Statehouse and support Ohio Democrats up and down the ballot?

Ohio Dems HQ,info@ohiodems.org,A despicable political stunt,"Team --
Ohio House Republicans voted just last week to limit the ability of Dr. Amy Acton to protect public health during the coronavirus outbreak.
It was a pretty despicable political stunt, and it's abundantly clear that Statehouse Republicans are following Donald Trump's lead by defying the recommendations of scientists and public health experts.
So the Ohio Democratic Party took matters into our own hands and launched an ad campaign this week -- we're calling out five GOP lawmakers who voted against Dr. Acton.
We need to raise $5,000 to keep our ads running. Can you chip in $10 -- or whatever you can -- to help us hold these out-of-touch Republicans accountable?
Ohio House Republicans
Each of these members occupy swing districts that we can win this November -- and their reckless vote is way out of step with their district.
But we need your help to spread the word and unseat them this year.

David Pepper,info@ohiodems.org,"This is a big deal, folks","BREAKING: The DNC is investing big in Ohio ahead of November.
Continue reading below to learn why you should too --  or click here to chip in now.
Team,
We just got really exciting news here at Ohio Dems HQ -- the Democratic National Committee announced they're investing big in Ohio this year.
This is a huge deal for a lot of reasons -- not only does it mean we'll have additional resources, it also proves what we've known all along: Ohio is a battleground state.
With so much on the line in 2020, national organizations are prioritizing states where:
1. Donald Trump is on the ropes
2. There are important down-ballot contests (like our Ohio Supreme Court races)
And when you look at the numbers, it makes sense why groups like the DNC and Swing Left are targeting Ohio.
Since Trump took office, his net approval in Ohio has decreased by 16 percentage points, and it's no wonder why -- his failed policies and broken promises have hurt workers, farmers, small businesses and consumers. What's more, his toxic agenda has driven huge numbers of women -- including in former GOP strongholds -- to support Democrats up and down the ticket.
Not only is Ohio the state that will stop Donald Trump, we also have two Ohio Supreme Court races that could flip the court's current GOP majority -- effectively ending the gerrymandering that Republicans have used to their advantage for years.
And with an incredible slate of Statehouse candidates this year, ending the gerrymandered GOP supermajority is in our reach.
However -- even with the support of national groups, we're fighting an uphill fundraising battle against the Ohio GOP, who can snap their fingers and get big money from special-interest groups and fat-cat donors.
So ahead of tonight's Democratic debate, I'm asking: can you pitch in $10 right now to help us flip Ohio from red to blue?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:

You know it. I know it. The DNC knows it. Ohio is a battleground state -- so let's go win this thing.

Subject: We need to be ready
Hi,
I just looked back at all of the things Mike DeWine did in his first year in office, and despite all you hear about how ""moderate"" he is -- DeWine's agenda has been a dream come true for right-wing extremists.
Here's just a sampling of DeWine's ""accomplishments"":
* Signed into law one of the nation's most restrictive abortion bans
* Millions in funding for fake health clinics that shame and lie to women
* Nothing done to stop the epidemic of gun violence and a broken promise to gun safety advocates after Dayton
* Millions of dollars taken out of public schools to fund private school vouchers
* New rules designed to kick Ohioans off their Medicaid health coverage
On top of all that -- Ohio has lost more than 4,000 jobs since DeWine took office in January.
DeWine might have the right-wing special interests on his side, but we have grassroots supporters like you. Every dollar that you chip in helps us fight back against DeWine's agenda -- and with one extreme bill after another this year, we need all hands on deck.

Throughout DeWine's first year in office, Ohioans have been struggling -- but instead of fighting for reforms and investments to lift up our communities, Mike DeWine and the Ohio GOP have spent most of their time doing the bidding of right-wing extremists and special interest groups.
I can only hope that in 2020, Gov. Mike DeWine will spend more energy lifting jobs and wages for everyday Ohioans and far less doing the bidding of right-wing special interests -- but if not, we need to be ready to fight back.

So here's your New Year's resolution for 2020: do your part to turn Ohio blue by volunteering with the Ohio Democratic Party.
VOLUNTEER >>
Happy New Year! And buckle up -- 2020 will be the most important year of our lifetimes.
On our ballot this November, Ohioans will have a simple choice with a lifetime of consequences. And when I say lifetime, I don't just mean yours or mine -- I mean our kids and grandkids, who will continue to face the consequences of this election throughout their lifetimes.
This year is particularly consequential because if we turn Ohio blue in just 307 days, we accomplish two things:
* First, we end the Trump presidency. Without Ohio in his column, he's done, along with his entire witch's brew of damaging, corrupt and downright un-American policies.
* Second, we end gerrymandering. When we elect Ohio Supreme Court justices and Statehouse candidates who are committed to the system of fair districts now called for in the Ohio Constitution, the most poisonous part of Ohio politics today will be eliminated forever -- and with it will go so much of the right-wing extremism that has haunted Ohio for the past decade.
One election can stop the Trump presidency and end gerrymandering. And here's the best news: we can do it!
2018 and 2019 have seen a major shift in Ohio politics -- with energized cities, ever more blue suburbs (which used to be Republican) and rural voters giving Democrats a second look after paying the price for Trump's broken promises.
But here's the thing: we can only cross the finish line with your help.
Make your New Year's resolution count this year -- add your name here to volunteer with the Ohio Democrats in 2020.
This election will define our country for generations, and we hope we can count on your help.

A deeper dive into the poll numbers finds that the economy is the number one issue with Ohio voters, which makes sense -- Ohio has lost thousands of blue-collar manufacturing and construction jobs over the past year, despite Trump's empty promises on the campaign trail.

Ahead of Vice President Mike Pence's visit to Ohio this week, Congressman Tim Ryan, Ohio Federation of Teachers President Melissa Cropper and United Steelworkers leaders called out Donald Trump's broken promises to Ohio workers.

Over the weekend Donald Trump was slammed for his lies about saving the American auto industry (he didn't) and new auto plants being built in Ohio (they aren't).

""Donald Trump thinks he can play Ohioans for fools,"" said Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper. ""The last time he parachuted into northwest Ohio, he promised that our future 'never ever looked brighter.' Eight months later, thousands of Ohioans have lost their lives to COVID-19, working families are picking up the pieces of a shattered economy and Trump's incompetence is only making things worse. Ohioans don't need a revolving door of empty promises, we need leadership that delivers -- that's Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.

OHIO DEMS IN THE HEADLINES
## Victory on Dropboxes Delayed by Frank LaRose
This week the Ohio Democratic Party won a legal victory in the fight to allow county boards of elections to install multiple secure dropboxes for the return of vote-by-mail ballots.
""We are pleased the court agreed with our argument that nothing in Ohio law prohibits the installation of multiple dropboxes in a county,"" said Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper. ""The secretary of state's directive banning multiple dropboxes is arbitrary and unreasonable, especially during a global pandemic when many more Ohioans want -- and need -- options for delivering their absentee ballots. It's time for Frank LaRose to stop with the theatrics and stalling tactics and let county boards of elections make it more convenient for Ohioans to vote.""
Twitter
Sen. Sherrod Brown, Congresswoman Joyce Beatty, Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur, Congresswoman Marcia Fudge and Congressman Tim Ryan sent a letter to Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose urging him to comply with the court's ruling.
""Time and again, failures to use your authority to make it easier for people to vote have put Ohioans at risk, including your refusal to prepay postage on ballots or allow multiple drop boxes in each county. It is your responsibility to exercise your authority to make it easier for Ohioans to vote safely. That is why we urge you to follow the Franklin County Common Pleas Court ruling and not waste taxpayer resources in mounting an appeal,"" wrote the lawmakers.
Twitter
Cuyahoga County Democratic Party Chairwoman and Cuyahoga County Councilwoman Shontel Brown called out LaRose's ""very intentional actions to make voting harder for some of our most vulnerable voters in our county.""

Sherrod Brown is encouraging Ohioans to apply for open positions with the 2020 Census: ""As we enter the next decade, it is critical that all Ohioans are accounted for in the 2020 Census.

Trump's Attacks on Health Care Continue
This week Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper joined Senate Democratic Leader Kenny Yuko, Sen. Nickie Antonio, Rep. Bride Rose Sweeney, Rep. Jeff Crossman, Cuyahoga County Councilwoman and Democratic Party Chairwoman Shontel Brown, Cleveland City Councilman Blaine Griffin and Cleveland City Councilman Matt Zone to discuss how Donald Trump's broken promises on health care are hurting Ohioans.

What's Trump's latest lie on health care? Earlier this month he told the nation's governors, ""We're not decreasing Medicaid."" That's simply not true.
Trump's new budget plan cuts funding for Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act by $1 trillion over the next decade. It would eliminate the health care law's enhanced federal matching funding for Medicaid expansion \-- which would likely lead to many Republican-led states, like Ohio, ending it altogether. Evidence shows that Medicaid expansion saved the lives of about 1,500 Ohioans just from 2014 to 2017.
On top of that, the Trump administration is bringing back Medicaid block grants, which would reduce coverage, health services and financial security while raising costs.
Twitter
Also this week, U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown called out Trump's lie about protecting people with pre-existing conditions.
Twitter
Dr. Donald Nguyen also weighed in on Trump's broken promises on health care in the Clermont Sun this week, writing, ""Fasten your seatbelts for 2020, the voters will have to fight again to preserve a life-saving provision of the Affordable Care Act. The facts are clear: Democrats will protect people with pre-existing conditions, while Donald Trump will put health coverage in jeopardy for millions of Ohioans.""

David Pepper,info@ohiodems.org,Last night,"Dear folks,
Despite the challenging circumstances of the primary, it was great last night to see Ohio Democrats really step up.
We saw dramatic increases in Democratic turnout in former GOP suburban strongholds, and for the first time in 12 years, more Democratic ballots were cast in a presidential primary than Republican ballots -- nearly 200,000 more, and counting.
And now that the primary election is officially behind us, we can focus 100 percent of our energy on the incredibly important work of defeating Donald Trump and electing Democrats up and down the ballot in November.
Ohio Democrats are more energized than ever -- but the Republicans have a massive fundraising advantage, and after a drawn-out primary season, we need to catch up.
So I have to ask: if you're in a position to help, can I count on you to chip in $7 to turn Ohio blue?
The Ohio Democratic Party is proud to be powered by the people, but our dependence on grassroots supporters means that we rely on folks reading emails like this one to chip in whenever possible.

ODP Weekly Update,info@ohiodems.org,Who the heck does he think he is?,"Dear friend,
It's not often that I'm shocked by something that Donald Trump said or did. However, the new reports about what the president has said about our veterans -- some who gave all in service to our country -- are truly shocking. Calling our servicemen and women ""losers"" and ""suckers"" is beyond the pale.
Today Joe Biden responded to Trump's remarks:
""When my son was an assistant U.S. attorney and he volunteered to go to Kosovo while the war was going on as a civilian, he wasn't a sucker. When my son volunteered and joined the United States military as the attorney general, and went to Iraq for a year, won the Bronze Star and other commendations, he wasn't a sucker. The service men and women he served with, particularly those that did not come home, were not losers. If these statements are true, the president should humbly apologize to every Gold Star mother and father and Blue Star family that he's denigrated and insulted. Who the heck does he think he is?""
One of our Ohio Vets for Biden, Don Moss, responded with his own video:

I'm proud of the many Ohio Democratic officials and candidates who have served in the military. We appreciate their service. Our gratitude will never be enough.
Wishing you and your family a restful and restorative Labor Day weekend,

TRUMP WATCH
## Trump's Coronavirus Failure Unites Ohio and Michigan
One day after the Ohio State Buckeyes would have played their first football game of the season, the Michigan and Ohio Democratic Parties held a virtual news conference with College Democrats. On the call, Congresswoman Debbie Dingell and Columbus City Attorney Zach Klein were joined by College Democrats President Matthew Nowling and students from the University of Michigan and The Ohio State University to highlight how Donald Trump's reckless and chaotic response to the coronavirus crisis has hurt one of college football's great rivalries and devastated Ann Arbor and Columbus small businesses.
Tweet
""The reality at the end of the day is the president has failed to recognize and appreciate the severity of the coronavirus and the spread of COVID-19 in our community,"" said Columbus City Attorney Zach Klein. ""And as a result, people are losing jobs, people are dying, people are getting sick, but also our economy is failing and we have no football. All of that is because of failed presidential leadership. The economy is COVID and COVID is the economy. Until the President of the United States recognizes it for what it's worth and takes it seriously, recognizes that it's not a hoax, that we should be wearing masks, and putting together a national comprehensive plan, not only are we not going to have football, we're not going to be able to have the economic rebound for the families that deserve it that want to put food on their table for their kids.""
""I was born and raised in Columbus, Ohio and am an ardent Ohio State fan,"" said College Democrats of America President Matthew Nowling. ""Our rivalry will continue after we fire Donald Trump in the fall and this virus ends, but it didn't have to be this bad. Trump left states to fend for themselves and tweeted out conspiracy theories and this ineffective leadership has hurt students on college campuses. If we had leadership who listened to the science, I could have been gearing up to tailgate tomorrow instead of reading about the terrible toll this virus has had on our country.""

David Pepper,info@ohiodems.org,Donald Trump has opened the door to Medicare and Social Security cuts,"Folks,
I know the country is focused on impeachment right now, but I wanted to make sure you didn't miss this -- while he was in Davos this week, Donald Trump gave an interview in which he opened the door to cutting Medicare and Social Security.
That's a big change from what Trump promised back in 2016 in a speech in St. Clairsville, where he said, ""We're going to save our Social Security. We're going to save our Medicare. Others want to cut. We're going to save so much.""
It's one more broken promise -- and it's one more reason we can't afford a second term of Trump.
Ohioans depend on these insurance programs to retire with dignity. Can you add your name to this petition and stand up for Social Security and Medicare?
Further cuts to Social Security and Medicare would be devastating for our state. Nearly 2.4 million Ohioans depend on Social Security, and Medicare provides health coverage for nearly 2 million older Ohioans and hundreds of thousands of Ohioans with disabilities.
Senate Republicans who have discussed it with the president say he has called it a ""second-term project."" That makes it clear what's at stake in 2020 -- if Trump wins a second term, he will cut Medicare and Social Security, hurting millions of retirees and Ohioans with disabilities.
We need to hold Trump accountable for his broken promises. Click here to add your name to call on Trump and Ohio Republicans to stand up for Medicare and Social Security:

Mike Pence is in Ohio today -- which is no surprise, given that polls show Donald Trump is in trouble in the Buckeye State.
Can you chip in $5 right now to send the Trump administration packing this November?
Mike Pence is coming to Ohio today.
And he's coming to my neck of the woods, Lordstown, for a photo op that is too little, too late.
On the very first day of Donald Trump's presidency, General Motors laid off more than 1,000 workers at their Lordstown factory, and the layoffs continued until the plant finally closed last year.
The workers begged for help for years, and all Trump did was fire off a bunch of tweets attacking the workers and their leaders. He then signed the GOP tax scam that gave GM a massive tax break, and did nothing as they closed their Lordstown plant and decided to build their new Blazer SUV in Mexico.
Trump told the people of the Mahoning Valley, 'Don't move, don't sell your house' -- but for thousands of workers, they had to do just that.
It breaks my heart to see how Donald Trump has broken his promises to my friends and loved ones and neighbors. My grandfather, Papa Ron, worked for GM for decades, and he has been devastated to see what's happened to the community he loves.
I've seen firsthand the implications of Donald Trump's actions -- which is exactly why I'm in this fight to take back the White House.
I'm all in to end the Trump presidency, but I need your help, team -- will you chip in $5 right now to turn Ohio blue this November?
Trump's team knows they're in trouble (the Quinnipiac poll yesterday showed Biden ahead of Trump by one point in Ohio!) -- so they're going to dump millions into our state.
The GOP may have special interests and Wall Street on their side, but we have grassroots support on ours. Can you make a contribution today to fund the campaign to turn Ohio blue?

I'm a true believer that there is no higher form of public service than stepping up to run for office, and then representing and serving your community once you get there.
So today, on the last day to file petitions to run in 2020, I couldn't be more excited about the Democrats who are putting their names on the ballot -- and I'm proud that the candidates running for office in every corner of Ohio reflect the diversity of our party and our state. Here are some of their filing photos:
Filing photos
The Democratic ticket for 2020 is an incredible group of champions for working families -- and whether they're running for the first time or gearing up for re-election, we're committed to making sure that all our candidates have what they need to succeed.
But equipping candidates with the skills and information they need to run and win isn't easy -- and frankly, it doesn't come for free. The Republican Party can snap their fingers and get big money from their lobbyist friends and special-interest groups to fund their campaigns, but we depend on grassroots donors -- folks who are reading emails  just like this one.
Electing these Democrats (and so many more!) is a team effort, and we need you on our side, . Help us pave the way for victory in 2020 -- if you chip in *any* monthly donation (or make a $15 gift), we'll send you a personalized 2020 membership card.

Despite the crisis we're in, democracy must continue -- and the importance of ending the Trump presidency this year is more clear than ever.
But in the interest of public health, we're moving our campaign completely online for the time being.
So what exactly does that mean?
We've canceled all in-person organizing events for the foreseeable future -- and instead, we're focusing exclusively on winning this election online. Using innovative campaign tools, we've already reached hundreds of thousands of voters through digital ads, trained grassroots activists online and held a virtual town hall with hundreds of volunteers.
We're using the newest online tools and strategies to run our campaign to turn Ohio blue -- all while keeping our volunteers and voters safe at home. But those tools cost money.
The Ohio Democratic Party is prepared to win this election -- but we need your help in order to scale up our operations, just as we would any presidential year.

David Pepper,info@ohiodems.org,An update on the Democratic National Convention,"Folks --
The coronavirus pandemic is continuing to impact all of us. We don't know when our lives will go back to normal, so we make contingencies and move forward as best we can.
The Democratic Party is making those same sorts of plans in preparation for our convention in Milwaukee this August. At this time, we don't know what the convention will look like, but the planners are looking at all options.
This week the Democratic National Committee took action to ensure the convention is safe and guarantee that we can accomplish all official business without putting our delegates' health at risk. The DNC is working to ensure all delegates will be able to cast ballots and fulfill their duties, regardless of their ability to travel and participate in person.
With that in mind, I want to make sure that each of you has the opportunity to apply to be a part of the 2020 Democratic National Convention. When I became chair, I pledged that we would be open and transparent, and this email is part of that commitment.
Earlier this year, more than 3,000 Ohio Democrats filed to run for 89 district-level delegate positions, and the final allocations of those delegates will be announced soon, once the final canvass of Ohio's primary election is complete. In addition to the district-level delegates, Ohio will have 18 pledged ""PLEO"" (party leaders and elected officials) delegates and 29 at-large delegates at the statewide level. Whatever format the convention ultimately takes, delegates will still have an important role to play in this historic election.
The deadline to apply to serve as a statewide delegate -- either PLEO or at-large -- is Friday, May 29, at 4 p.m. Click here to apply now.
One final note about convention delegates -- because of an agreement between the Biden and Sanders campaign, Ohio will have statewide delegates representing both campaigns. This also means you should indicate which candidate you support when you fill out your application.
If you would like to serve as a PLEO or at-large delegate for Biden or Sanders, click here and apply before the May 29 deadline.
Thank you for your support,
David

Hi team,
It's nice to meet you! My name is Matt, and I'm a fellow at the Ohio Democratic Party this summer.
I was just 17 years old back in 2016, so I didn't have the chance to cast a ballot that year. In the four years since then, I've watched as Donald Trump has ruthlessly attacked college students, LGBTQ+ folks and people of color -- that's me and my friends and family. And that's why I've been dedicating my summer to working for the state party to expand its outreach to young voters.
As a student at Denison University and as president of the College Democrats of Ohio, I've seen firsthand the energy among college students in Ohio this year -- folks are ready to take back the White House!
And if every young person eligible to vote participates in this year's election, Donald Trump is ancient history -- which is precisely why the Ohio Dems are working hard to get as many young Ohioans registered to vote as possible before November.
We've set an ambitious goal of registering thousands of young Dems across the Buckeye State, but we need your support -- will you invest $20 right now in getting young folks registered to vote?

Young people can and will be the reason why Ohio flips this year -- so we're running digital ads, hiring organizers and utilizing the newest tools to get as many young folks engaged in the process as possible.
Being the Midwesterner I am, I hate to ask for a favor, but we can't do this without you -- click here to chip in to our voter registration efforts.

David Pepper,info@ohiodems.org,Donald Trump's campaign is investing big in Ohio,"Hi folks,
Did you hear? Donald Trump is coming back to Ohio today for his very first campaign stop of 2020.
Trump came to Ohio five times in 2019, and it's clear why he keeps coming back: our state is in play because of his broken promises and failed policies.
Ohio has lost more than 4,000 jobs since January 2019. We've seen factories across Ohio -- including the GM plant in Lordstown -- shut down. We've seen steel plants laying off workers. We've seen the uninsured rate go up. We've seen prescription drug prices continue to skyrocket. We've seen farmers struggle as soybean prices have fallen. Ultimately, it's Ohio workers who are paying the price for Trump's broken promises.
Trump's team knows that Ohio is key to winning this year, so they're investing big on digital ads in the Buckeye State. But we can't afford to let them keep blasting out their lies and misinformation -- we need grassroots supporters like you to help us hold Trump accountable.
Every dollar that you chip in goes directly to our mission to turn Ohio blue. Click here to chip in and own a piece of the fight to end the Trump presidency.

As the Ohio Democratic Party's voter protection director, I've been on the ground for two months, working to prepare for a November general election with record turnout.
Then the coronavirus pandemic hit ... and in-person voting was canceled, the primary postponed.
Now we have to help thousands of Ohio voters -- many of whom have never voted by mail -- with the process of applying for, filling out and returning absentee ballots ahead of the new April 28 deadline.
Honestly, this isn't something we planned for, but with a voter protection team already in place, it's now the No. 1 priority because it's my responsibility to ensure that no Ohio voter is disenfranchised.
At this critical moment, can you donate $5 to help us protect the vote in Ohio?
For this year's general election, we have to be prepared in case November also presents a challenging environment for voters -- and simply put, every donation we receive will support our fight to ensure that the right to vote is protected across the Buckeye State.
I know this is a tough time for many folks, but every few dollars makes a difference.
If you are in a position to support our program, can you chip in $5 today?
Thank you for your generosity at this time,

What we do here in Ohio over the next 16 days will determine our country's future. I believe in the people of this great state -- and Ohioans are already turning out in record numbers to defeat Donald Trump.
But we need your help to keep going, which is why I'm emailing you today. Can you chip in $10 right now to help Ohio Democrats?
Trump's billionaire pals and right-wing dark-money groups are going to do everything they can to bail him out. They tried to take me out in 2018, and they lost. Ohioans don't like corporate special interests trying to buy their state.
We can win Ohio. We can elect Joe Biden and build our country back better by fighting for the dignity of work. We can reject Donald Trump's phony populism and defeat his anti-worker agenda.
But we can only get across the finish line if we give this fight everything we've got for the next 16 days. If you're able to, will you donate now to defeat Donald Trump and elect Democrats across Ohio?

Protecting Ohio Workers
State Rep. David Leland and state Rep. Lisa Sobecki this week announced plans to introduce legislation to protect at-risk workers from being forced to choose between returning to unsafe working conditions or losing unemployment benefits. The proposal is the latest effort from House Dems to improve the safety and security of Ohio workers amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
Facebook
""Workers on the front lines have been exposed to the most serious consequences of this virus -- someone needs to be looking out for them,"" said Leland. ""No person should have to choose between their livelihood and their life.""
""Working men and women are faced with an impossible choice: either go back to work and risk the health of their families, or lose access to their unemployment insurance,"" said Sobecki. ""They shouldn't have to make that choice. We should respect the dignity of their individual choice to protect their families during this unprecedented pandemic.""

You're an important member of the team, so I'll be completely honest with you: fundraising has been pretty difficult lately.
With all of our in-person events cancelled for the foreseeable future, we just aren't able to raise money in conventional ways right now -- which means that we're relying on online donations more than ever.
I hate to ask for money during times like these, but the truth is, these past few months have truly emphasized the urgency of ending the Trump presidency. Donald Trump failed to take the coronavirus outbreak seriously, and now Ohioans are paying the price.
Our May fundraising deadline is right around the corner, and our goal is just within reach if 417 Ohioans make a donation. Folks, can you chip in $5 to the Defeat Trump Fund?
If we're going to turn Ohio blue, we have to reach both the Obama-Trump voters and the folks who stayed home in 2016 -- which means hiring a lot of organizers. And with less than six months until Election Day, we need to stay on track with fundraising so that we can make these hires as soon as possible.
Friend, I'm asking you directly -- can you become one of the 417 people who gets us across the finish line before the deadline?

Trump Is Lying Again -- This Time About Health Care
Last week when he was in Toledo, Donald Trump lied about Ohio's struggling economic situation -- the Buckeye State has lost thousands of jobs since January 2019 -- and this week he doubled down on his health care lies, despite the fact that he is supporting a lawsuit that puts coverage at risk for 4.8 million Ohioans with pre-existing conditions.

Share on Facebook Share on Twitter
""Donald Trump is lying when he says he wants to protect Americans with pre-existing conditions,"" said Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper. ""The truth is this: he is backing a lawsuit that jeopardizes health care for 4.8 million Ohioans with pre-existing conditions. Trump's constant attacks on the Affordable Care Act are already taking a toll on the Buckeye State, as Ohio was one of eight states that saw its uninsured rate jump in 2018. One group that has been particularly hard hit is Ohio kids -- 12,000 more children went without health coverage in 2018, compared to two years prior.
""It's been one broken promise after another from Donald Trump, and Ohio families and kids are paying the price.""

TRUMP WATCH
Saving Lives Will Save The Economy
This week the Clermont Sun published an op-ed from Chairman David Pepper on how chaotic Donald Trump's response to the coronavirus outbreak has been -- and how the pandemic has exposed the underlying weakness of our economy.
From the op-ed:
""Trump and too many others' response to the coronavirus was to dismiss it -- all while some of them were busy adjusting their stock portfolios. We lost precious weeks to prepare, even though GOP leaders in Washington knew it was going to be bad. This is just one more example of how the wealthy and well-connected game the system to their advantage, and too many Americans are stuck with only bad options -- go to work if you're sick because you don't have paid leave or stay at home and lose your income.
""Starting right now and moving forward, we need paid sick and family leave for all workers. If we're going to consider the workers who stock our shelves and clean our offices to be essential -- and they are -- then those workers deserve the right to paid leave. We also need more protections to ensure workplaces are safe. Even now, some workers in Ohio are being forced to endure unsafe conditions, with state leaders telling them it's on them to inform their local health department. And one plain reality is that making it easier for workers to organize would go a long way toward improving wages, workplace safety and benefits.
""Another thing that has been made crystal clear during the coronavirus pandemic is that Donald Trump doesn't care about working people, only how their sacrifices can boost the stock market and prop up his re-election prospects. Nurses and doctors are going to work with bandanas and homemade masks to protect them from infection, and Trump's response is to blame governors and local leaders. If we somehow manage to get out of this crisis, we can rebuild our economy -- but not if Trump gets four more years in the White House.""

TRUMP WATCH
Trump's Cuts Are Hurting the Great Lakes
Fifty years after Richard Nixon proposed the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency in the wake of the Cuyahoga River catching fire, budget cuts by Republican leaders at the federal and state levels are hurting the Great Lakes, according to a new report by the Environmental Law and Policy Center.
Facebook
""Since Donald Trump took office, Clean Water Act enforcement has plummeted, and polluters are getting the message that Trump's EPA won't hold them accountable,"" said Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper. ""The Great Lakes provide one-fifth of the planet's supply of freshwater, and Lake Erie helps to support more than 100,000 tourism jobs in the eight counties that border the lake. Rob Portman likes to tout all he supposedly does to help Lake Erie, but huge algae blooms that endanger drinking water supplies and hurt tourism continue to happen nearly every year. Portman cares about photo ops and taking credit, but his support for an administration and EPA wreaking havoc on Lake Erie is his real record.""
""Dave Joyce's claims that he has tried to protect Lake Erie are nothing more than political spin,"" said Hillary O'Connor Mueri, Ohio native, Navy combat veteran and Democratic nominee for OH-14. ""Trump's policies are killing Lake Erie, and that equals killing thousands of jobs in Ohio's 14th Congressional District, while Dave Joyce lets it happen. We need a representative in Washington who will fight for those jobs -- not just his own.""

Ryan Wants Guaranteed Monthly Payments for Americans
As our nation struggles with the health and economic impact of the coronavirus crisis, Congressman Tim Ryan has introduced the Emergency Money for the People Act to provide additional income to most Americans. Ryan's proposal would supplement the one-time payment of $1,200 included in the CARES Act and guarantee a monthly payment of $2,000 to all Americans over 16 making under $130,000 a year.
""A one-time payment is simply not enough to sustain most Americans for the length of this crisis,"" wrote Ryan. ""One of the most important things we can do right now is to put cash in the hands of average hard-working Americans. Consumer spending makes up roughly 70 percent of U.S. gross domestic product, so how will our small businesses survive if their customers don't have money in their pockets? The old strategies have failed us. This is an unprecedented crisis, and it is time for government to respond in an unprecedented way.""

NEW Quinnipiac poll of Ohio:
Biden: 48%
Trump: 47%
Joe Biden holds a slight lead in Ohio -- chip in now to solidify Biden's lead by funding our digital ads.
Great news, team --
This thing is SO CLOSE.
But because of grassroots supporters like you, Joe Biden holds a slight lead in a new poll of Ohio voters.
Just a year ago, pundits were ready to write off Ohio as a forever-red state -- and now, Ohio could decide the whole damn thing (pardon my language).
One key reason: Ohio counts and announces our absentee votes first. So when Trump suggests he'll challenge the results in other states, a blue Ohio ends it -- the Trump presidency, and the drama.
Facebook
My team is planning major ad buys to voters across Ohio to remind loyal Democrats to vote early AND persuade voters who are still on the fence to support Biden. You see, in Ohio, you have to both persuade folks and turn out your base in order to win, so that's exactly what we're doing.
But effective ad campaigns are expensive, and we need to raise $30,000 to get these ads up and running.
Early voting opens in just 12 days, so we have to move quickly -- will you chip in $10 today to turn Ohio blue and end the Trump presidency?

Rob Portman says he's backing Donald Trump because he ""cannot believe the change we have seen in terms of our economic growth.""
Um... what? I don't know what economy Rob Portman is talking about, but here in Ohio, 2019 was our worst year for job growth in a decade. We lost thousands of jobs in manufacturing and construction, and farm bankruptcies were the highest they've been in 10 years.
Either Rob Portman doesn't care that Trump's economy is bad for Ohioans, or he's pretending not to notice -- but either way, he's proving once again that he's too busy trying to please Donald Trump to give hard-working Ohioans the time of day.
The senator has shown where his loyalties lie -- and they're clearly not with the people of Ohio. Donate $22 to the Defeat Portman Fund to help us unseat this guy in 2022.

Ohio Election Update (via OH Dems),info@ohiodems.org,How to cast your ballot in Ohio's primary election,"Hey there --
Were you planning on voting on Primary Election Day? Good news! The Ohio General Assembly has extended the deadline for voting by mail until Tuesday, April 28, so you still have a chance to cast your ballot.
(If you already voted, either early in person or by mail, don't worry! Your vote has been secured and will be counted on April 28.)
If you've never voted by mail, we will explain the process. Here's how you can ""Stay Home -- And Vote""...
1. Request an absentee ballot. You need to send in an application for an absentee ballot in one of two ways: by mail or in person at your county's board of elections. To get that absentee ballot application, you have three choices: you can 1) call your board of elections and ask them to send you an absentee ballot application; 2) fill out the application online (click here) and mail it in; 3) if you don't have access to a printer, you can handwrite your application and mail that in (click here to learn more). Do this right away, so you can get your absentee ballot as soon as possible.
2. Fill out your absentee ballot. You can do this from the comfort of your couch -- pants are optional! Click here for a list of candidates endorsed by the Ohio Democratic Party.
3. Return your absentee ballot. You can do this one of two ways -- by mail or in person. The postage for your absentee ballot will be prepaid (no stamps!), but if you would like to drop it off at your county board of elections, many will have secured drop boxes outside -- great for those who are social distancing.
4. Track your ballot. This is how you can be confident your vote will be counted. You can go online to find out the status of your absentee ballot -- if your application was received, if your ballot was mailed and if your ballot was received. Click here to track your ballot. If you have questions about the status of your ballot, call your county's board of elections.
Voting from home is easy -- but you can't wait to act. Get it done today. Call your county board of elections to request an absentee ballot application or download, print and mail your application right now.
If you mail your absentee ballot back, it must be postmarked no later than Monday, April 27 -- or you can return it in person to your county board of elections up until 7:30 p.m. on Tuesday, April 28.
Got questions? Reply to this email or call our Voter Protection Team at 1-833-DEM-VOTE (833-336-8683).

ODP Weekly Update,info@ohiodems.org,Black. Lives. Matter.,"Dear friend,
The events of recent weeks have been disturbing, infuriating and heartbreaking all at the same time.
The grim milestone of 100,000 Americans dead from COVID-19, an epidemic that has disproportionately impacted people of color ... the horrific killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery before that ... the racist harassment of Christian Cooper in Central Park ... unarmed protesters treated far differently than armed protesters only weeks before ... violent threats against Ohio House Democratic Leader Emilia Sykes and her father, Sen. Vernon Sykes ... journalists being arrested and handcuffed live on national television.
Some of these horrors are new, yet much of it feels sadly familiar.
When I entered politics, Cincinnati had just undergone a period of trauma that had placed us on the international map in the worst of lights. After struggling for some time, the community came together and worked hard to address many of the underlying issues that had sparked our problems, including systemic reforms in the policing of our city. And no doubt there's still much work to do here.
But the lesson also couldn't be more clear: reform without accountability doesn't count for much. Reform without accountability is not justice.
There must be immediate justice for George Floyd and his family. For Ahmaud Arbery and his family. For Breonna Taylor and her family.
Racism and violence have been intertwined with our nation's history since its inception. At our best moments, we have had leaders who have appealed to the better angels of our nature.
At this moment, we have a president who has chosen to fan the flames of violence and hatred and anti-Semitism and misogyny and racism. His moment for accountability is coming this November because America cannot survive another four years of this.
However, America requires much more than change in the Oval Office. We need to demand accountability at every level of government, no matter our political party. If we believe that Black Lives Matter -- and I do -- then we must demand that our elected officials uphold that credo.
Valuing Black lives demands that we confront how racism impacts our society and how it subtly shapes public policy. Across Ohio, we have public servants who are taking up this fight. This month the Franklin County commissioners declared racism a public health crisis. Cleveland City Council is considering similar action. Leader Sykes, Ohio Legislative Black Caucus President Stephanie Howse and their colleagues have challenged the DeWine administration to do more to address the disparate impact of coronavirus on African-American Ohioans.
It's on all of us -- not just our African-American friends, partners and colleagues -- to do more to address structural racism.
And as President Barack Obama wrote today, as we ultimately emerge from the deep damage done by this pandemic and this nightmare of a presidency, our goal cannot be to get back to ""normal."" ""Normal"" is too painful, too unfair and too unjust for too many Americans. Our new normal must strive for far better for everyone.

Trump Administration Is Failing Seniors
The Ohio Democratic Party hosted a virtual roundtable discussion this week with state Rep. Stephanie Howse, Ohio Alliance for Retired Americans President Norm Wernet and Council on Aging of Southwestern Ohio Board of Trustees Member Cathy Crain to discuss the devastating impact of the coronavirus crisis on Ohio seniors.
* After nearly 30,000 Americans had died of COVID-19 in nursing homes, the Trump administration finally recommended mass testing of long-term care residents and workers earlier this month -- but failed to provide any funding to do it.
* Despite the massive coronavirus outbreak, the Trump administration is still pushing to remove infection control regulations on the nursing home industry.

OHIO DEMS IN THE HEADLINES
Making It Safer and More Convenient to Vote
This week state Sen. Nickie J. Antonio and state Sen. Sandra Williams announced they will soon introduce legislation to reform Ohio's vote-by-mail process, improve Election Day procedures and streamline voter registration to increase voter participation.
Twitter
""We need to restore trust in the election process as we saw the inadequacies and confusion during the primary election,"" Antonio said. ""We cannot go back to the days of long lines and limited in-person voting machines, especially during the time of COVID-19. This legislation will ensure access and fairness in our elections.""
The senators want Ohioans to be able to request their absentee ballot online. In addition, their proposed legislation would harmonize Ohio's voter registration process by allowing those who register online to provide the same information as those who fill a paper registration form -- either the last four digits of their Social Security number or the number of their driver's license/state ID card, instead of both.
The plan would also require that every registered voter in Ohio receive an absentee ballot application, including a prepaid return envelope, before any election going forward. In the event that in-person voting is restricted in any way, every registered voter would also be sent an absentee ballot, bypassing the request process entirely.
""It is important to establish policies that will give county election boards more flexibility to do what is best for their communities and ensure every citizen has access to the ballot box,"" Williams said. ""Voter access, without overly-complicated procedures, is vital to strengthening and safeguarding Election Day in Ohio.""
Facebook
The bill would also allow counties to have multiple secure drop boxes; authorize Boards of Elections to mail provisional ballots to voters and require school buildings to be closed on Election Day for general elections. Contrary to recent suggestions by some elections officials to reduce the ratio of DRE voting machines to registered voters and precincts, this legislation will uphold the current ratios that have been in statute since 2006.

Subject: It takes two minutes, folks
Dear team,
The presidential race is close in Ohio. Like, really close.
And with so much on the line this year, we can't afford to leave any votes on the table, which is why the Ohio Dems are kicking off the most robust early vote campaign we've ever waged -- our ""Make It Count"" campaign. We're reaching out to Democrats through digital ads, mail and more to push back against misinformation about voting by mail and fire up Ohio voters to cast their ballots early.
The bottom line is: Our success in getting voters to vote early will likely be the difference between winning and losing Ohio. It's that important.
A generous donor has agreed to match donations to our ""Make It Count"" campaign (this is not a gimmick -- this is a real-life person!), which means that every grassroots donation will actually be worth double the amount.
So if you're able to, can I count on you to chip in to the Ohio Democratic Party's most robust early voting program ever?
Donate $10 (matched = $20)
Donate $25 (matched = $50)
Donate $50 (matched = $100)
Donate $100 (matched = $200)
This always has been and always will be a team effort -- and I'm so glad you're part of this, friend.

TRUMP WATCH
Trump's Disastrous Five Years
In the five years since Donald Trump went down the escalator at Trump Tower to kick off his presidential campaign, Ohio has lost nearly 675,000 jobs and had its worst year for jobs since the Great Recession in 2019 -- long before the coronavirus crisis hit.
Twitter
""Donald Trump is desperately trying to take a victory lap on the economy, but what he fails to mention is that 2019 was the worst year for jobs in Ohio since the Great Recession,"" said Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper. ""On the day of Trump's inauguration, the General Motors plant in Lordstown laid off thousands of workers, and the factory eventually shut down early last year. First, Trump told Ohioans that their jobs were 'all coming back,' imploring them, 'Don't move, don't sell your house.' Then Trump said that Lordstown's closing 'doesn't really matter,' even though Ohio lost thousands of manufacturing jobs last year. As GM was laying off thousands of workers across the country, they actually got a rebate on their federal income taxes thanks to the Trump tax scam. And as Trump has relentlessly attacked the Affordable Care Act, we have seen the number of uninsured Ohioans increase, despite Trump's pledge that there would be 'insurance for everybody.' Time and time again, Donald Trump has broken his promises, and working Ohioans are paying the price.""

Trump has lied to and failed the American people over and over again. From jobs to health care to racial justice, Trump has only made things worse.

""I applaud this decision by the Supreme Court. However, while today's ruling is significant, it is not the solution to provide full LGBTQ equality. Now more than ever, we need to pass the Ohio Fairness Act, which reaffirms that LGBTQ people should be able to work, live and play without discrimination.
Twitter
""It is time for Ohio to take a stand and affirm that it welcomes all workers and families, including those from the LGBTQ community. The Ohio Chamber of Commerce and almost 1,000 businesses agree that if we want to re-energize Ohio's economy, we need to pass the Ohio Fairness Act.""

David Pepper,info@ohiodems.org,Back on track,"Dear team,
The Ohio Democratic Party never anticipated investing this much money (or time!) in voter outreach for our state's primary -- but with a new vote-by-mail deadline, we knew that spending some extra cash in order to spread the word was the right thing to do.
But once this primary is over, it looks like we're going to start the general election season with less cash on hand than we expected.
Election Day is in exactly 200 days. Can you chip in $20 -- or however much you can -- to help us get back on track?
With a lifelong public servant like Joe Biden at the top of the ticket and an incredible slate of down-ballot candidates, we have a real opportunity to heal our country and make it stronger than ever.
But because Republicans have had a head start of more than three years in this race, we have a lot of work to do to catch up -- and that starts with grassroots supporters like you.
Can you chip in today to help us catch up to the GOP's fundraising haul?

The presidential race is close in Ohio. Like, really close.
And with so much on the line this year, we can't afford to leave any votes on the table, which is why the Ohio Dems are kicking off the most robust early vote campaign we've ever waged -- our ""Make It Count"" campaign. We're reaching out to Democrats through digital ads, mail and more to push back against misinformation about voting by mail and fire up Ohio voters to cast their ballots early.
The bottom line is: Our success in getting voters to vote early will likely be the difference between winning and losing Ohio. It's that important.
A generous donor has agreed to match donations to our ""Make It Count"" campaign (this is not a gimmick -- this is a real-life person!), which means that every grassroots donation will actually be worth double the amount.
So if you're able to, can I count on you to chip in to the Ohio Democratic Party's most robust early voting program ever?
Donate $10 (matched = $20)
Donate $25 (matched = $50)
Donate $50 (matched = $100)
Donate $100 (matched = $200)
This always has been and always will be a team effort -- and I'm so glad you're part of this, friend.

Kirstin Alvanitakis (via Ohio Dems),info@ohiodems.org,Billionaire Betsy,"The Federalist Society? Really? Ohio Democratic Party
Betsy DeVos is hobnobbing with her conservative pals in Ohio today while neglecting to work on any sort of plan to safely re-open schools this fall. I'm not surprised one bit -- this is exactly what happens when your Secretary of Education detests public education.
Ohio Democrats are working around the clock to end the Trump presidency (and send Billionaire Betsy packing) -- but we need your help. Will you chip in $5 right now to turn Ohio blue?
Hey team,
Did you hear? Education Secretary Betsy DeVos is participating in a closed-door video chat with the Federalist Society in Ohio today to tout how the Trump administration rolled back guidelines designed to protect victims of sexual assault and harassment on campus.
As she holds her virtual event, she's hiding from public school teachers, students and parents who want to know why the Trump administration is pushing to fully reopen schools -- and threatening to withhold funding from school districts that don't comply.
Yep, you read that correctly.
What Betsy DeVos and Donald Trump don't understand is, of course teachers and students want to return to schools -- but not at the cost of thousands of lives. And now, teachers are stuck between a rock and a hard place as the Trump administration forces them to choose between safety and funding, with absolutely no guidance.
Sherrod Brown always says the Trump White House looks like a retreat for Wall Street executives -- and you can look no further than Billionaire Betsy to see what will go wrong when right-wing ideologues with no experience in public education are put in charge. Trump and his cronies have proven themselves time and again to be the worst people to lead us through this crisis.
I'm ready to put Joe Biden (and Dr. Jill Biden) in the White House -- but recent polls show Biden and Trump virtually tied, and we need all hands on deck. Can you chip in $5 to flip Ohio blue this November and end the attacks on our public schools?
Thank you for being a part of this fight,

ODP Weekly Update,info@ohiodems.org,Trump's lies have consequences,"Dear friend,
Ohio Democrats take pride in always protecting voting rights. Several months ago, our close review of Ohio law made it clear to us that the Secretary of State was actually in violation of Ohio statute by rejecting electronic or online applications for absentee ballots (something many other states allow). So we went to court.
Late this afternoon, the court agreed with us, granting us a preliminary injunction to allow voters to apply for a vote-by-mail ballot electronically.
This is a big win for Ohio voters, providing a fast, easy and modern way for voters to request an absentee ballot. We are pleased the court agreed with our argument that not only does Ohio law permit voters to request absentee ballots electronically, but that the Secretary of State's policy rejecting such applications violated Ohio law.
It looks like Secretary of State Frank LaRose (who for two years has claimed he supports online applications but, incorrectly, that Ohio did not allow them), will appeal the decision. Disappointing to say the least.
We will keep up this fight, and the others we are waging, to support Ohioans' voter rights.
Keeping up the fight is part of the American tradition, something that is especially poignant today, the 19th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks. The memory of that horrific day is seared into my mind, but I can't forget the moments of hope and unity that came in the days that followed.
It's impossible not to compare that moment with the crisis we're facing now.
Vice President Joe Biden shared his thoughts on today's commemoration:
""Now, as then, our heroes are ordinary people doing extraordinary things: nurses and doctors; delivery drivers and grocery clerks; public transit workers and educators; regular Americans thrust into courageous acts of sacrifice and service. Now, as then, we owe it to them to come together as a nation -- so that Americans can once again do what we did so bravely nineteen years ago: turn from tragedy to purpose, rebuild our lives, and begin, in time, to heal.""
It is my deepest hope that America can truly come together as a nation, to fight the coronavirus threat, to deal with an unprecedented economic crisis and to push back against a rising tide of hatred and divisiveness.
This election is about the future of our nation. It is so important, and we must do everything we can to ensure maximum participation.

TRUMP WATCH
## Trump's Lies Have Consequences
This week -- as we approach the cataclysmic milestone of nearly 200,000 Americans dead from COVID-19 -- we learned how Donald Trump worked to conceal the facts about the coronavirus threat from the American people. Trump lied and downplayed the crisis for months, despite knowing how deadly it was. It's a stunning act of betrayal.
Tweet
Trump and the White House can't spin this: Trump is on tape admitting in his own words that he knew the virus was ""deadly,"" but that he was ""playing it down."" Trump's lies didn't prevent panic; they cost an untold number of lives and caused devastating economic harm.
OHIO DEMS IN THE HEADLINES
## ""A Modern-Day Poll Tax""
Congresswoman Joyce Beatty, Congresswoman Marcia Fudge, Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur and Congressman Tim Ryan sent a letter this week to Secretary of State Frank LaRose urging him to use his existing authority to provide prepaid return postage on ballots and ballot applications to help eliminate voting barriers and ensure a free and fair election in November.
""In an election where many citizens' only practical option is to vote by mail, forcing Ohioans to pay postage in order to exercise this right is akin to a modern-day poll tax. Nothing in the Ohio code prohibits you from prepaying return postage on both ballot application forms and ballots themselves,"" wrote the lawmakers.
The lawmakers also demanded that LaRose work with the U.S. Postal Service to guarantee ballots that originate in Ohio are delivered on time, with visible postmarks and do not succumb to delays and cost-cutting measures -- which could endanger timely delivery of vote by mail ballots.

Four days to go.
At the Ohio Democratic Party, it's been four years of hard work as we've worked to get to this point, putting Ohio back on the map as a battleground state.
We couldn't have done any of it without the tremendous support of our grassroots volunteers and donors. YOU are the reason why the presidential campaigns are battling it out in the Buckeye State with four days left to go until Election Day. So here we are.
So thank you -- and I'm also asking you to dig a little bit deeper just one more time to help us send Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to the White House, put Judge John P. O'Donnell and Judge Jennifer Brunner on the Ohio Supreme Court and elect Democratic candidates up and down the ballot. There are lots of volunteer opportunities at the end of this newsletter and at [[URL REDACTED]]
Many voters still need to get their absentee ballots in, and others need to be inspired to vote on Election Day. Your call or text might make the all the difference.
And if you're looking for a way to help out on Election Day, we need poll greeters to help with sample ballot distribution in the following counties:
* Cuyahoga
* Franklin
* Hamilton

* Delaware
* Trumbull

## Don Jr. Can't Spin Trump's Broken Promises
Donald Trump Jr.'s visit to Youngstown on Monday was the first time a Trump has set foot in the Mahoning Valley since three years ago when the president told Ohioans, ""Don't move, don't sell your house"" -- and then General Motors decided to shut down their Lordstown factory, leading to the loss of thousands of Ohio jobs.
Twitter
""Haven't the people of the Mahoning Valley suffered enough? Working families across the region have lost their health, lives and livelihoods because of Donald Trump's four years of chaos and incompetence,"" said Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper. ""Now, his own administration is admitting they have no intention of getting this pandemic under control. But instead of receiving urgently needed help, folks in the Mahoning Valley have to hear from a guy born with a silver spoon in his mouth, who flouted the state's mask mandate the last time he was here in our state. Ohioans deserve better -- that's why we're turning out in record numbers to elect Joe Biden and end the nightmare of the Trump presidency.""

Ohio Officials Say Voting By Mail Is Safe, Debunking Trump's Claims
Even as Donald Trump continues to push debunked conspiracy theories about voter fraud, Gov. Mike DeWine is assuring Ohioans that the state's primary election -- which will be concluded primarily by vote-by-mail -- is safe. In fact, Trump has utilized absentee voting himself to vote in Florida.

DeWine also is saying that he has no concerns about ""any kind of fraud"" with the state's vote-by-mail primary election.

Beatty's Votes Help Bring Back $62M To Address Coronavirus Crisis
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Federal Transit Administration recently announced that several local community health centers, Central Ohio Transit Authority, the city of Columbus and Franklin County have received a total of more than $62 million in federal funds to improve response efforts to the coronavirus.
Funding was made available through the Emergency Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act and the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, two pieces of legislation supported by Congresswoman Joyce Beatty.
""As the representative of Ohio's Third Congressional District, I am fighting hard to secure the much-needed federal resources to ensure that hard-working Ohioans, families and small businesses come first during this public health crisis,"" Beatty said. ""I was proud to support all three comprehensive COVID-19 response bills, but I am even prouder of the many people in central Ohio who are working tirelessly on the front lines in the ongoing battle against the virus.

I wanted to make sure you saw this, team -- as Donald Trump conspires to defund the USPS and spreads conspiracy theories about voting by mail, we're taking the fight for voting rights to court.
Facebook Live
Here's why: the most recent primary election proved that Ohio's current vote-by-mail process -- where voters must first mail in an application to request an absentee ballot -- is not enough. It's not going to cut it.
You see, the current process requires voters to first send an absentee ballot request through snail mail, then wait for their ballot to arrive in the mail, then mail the ballot back. If that sounds like a whole lot of waiting to you, you're right -- there were sadly quite a few primary voters who did not get their absentee ballots in time to return them, or whose ballots never arrived at all.
In the midst of a pandemic, we have an obligation to do everything in our power to ensure that voting by mail is convenient and safe -- so we just filed a lawsuit to require county boards of elections to accept absentee ballot applications electronically. Not only would this lessen the burden on voters, it would also alleviate some of the pressure on the postal service.
This lawsuit is just the beginning, team -- we're launching a full campaign to help Ohioans vote by mail this fall. Chip in now to support our Early Vote Protection Project.

Trump's Reckless Trade Policies Hurt the Economy
Donald Trump's trade war by tweet is hurting our economy. Now Trump's own chief economist is admitting it.
Facebook
This isn't the first time an organization has sounded the alarm about Trump's reckless trade policies. The Federal Reserve found the president's trade policies have backfired on manufacturing.

Here in Ohio, Trump's failed trade policies have harmed manufacturers, farmers, small businesses and consumers. Farm bankruptcies were up 20 percent nationwide in 2019, and in Ohio, we saw the highest number of Chapter 12 filings in a decade.

Ohio Supreme Court in the Spotlight
In a decision announced last week, Ohio Supreme Court Justices Melody Stewart and Michael P. Donnelly sided with the law and voted to protect a worker from retaliation by her employer.
Unfortunately -- in yet another example of how the Republican justices on the Ohio Supreme Court routinely vote to protect powerful special interests over the people -- the GOP majority chose to side with the restaurant owner, who fired the employee after she complained he was underreporting her income to the state.

""Well, the 'drama' that Ms. House caused was calling out her employer for violating state unemployment compensation law.

Instead of protecting a worker from retaliation, the GOP justices all sided with her employer, who allegedly attempted to cover up its misdeeds by asking her to lie to the state about the circumstances of her firing and offering her an under-the-table payoff. That's outrageous. In 2020, we need to elect new justices who will stand up to the powerful special interests that have unduly influenced the Ohio Supreme Court for decades.""
Stewart and Donnelly won election to the court in 2018. Donnelly is heading up a new Ohio Supreme Court task force on wrongful convictions, and Stewart recently was the featured speaker at the Ohio Supreme Court's Black History Month event.

OHIO DEMS CONDEMN CYBER EXPLOITATION
A month ago, the nation saw a horrific example of cyber exploitation in the case of former Congresswoman Katie Hill, who was targeted by her ex-husband. Led by the Ohio Democratic Party Chair David Pepper, the national organization of state Democratic parties (the Association of State Democratic Chairs) recently passed a resolution condemning cyber exploitation. The Ohio Democratic Party and other state parties are committed to support candidates and officeholders who are the targets of such abuse and to hold perpetrators accountable.

But here's what we need to remember: the outcome is still very much in our hands. Whether we pull ahead or fall behind in the next 85 days is up to every single person on this team, and with so much at stake this year, we can't afford to sit back now.

Chip in $25 now to elect Jennifer Brunner and John O'Donnell to the Ohio Supreme Court.
Team --
Eight days before an election -- as millions of Americans have already voted or are voting \-- Mitch McConnell just rushed through the confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett to the U.S. Supreme Court.
Now it's OK to be frustrated. It's OK to be angry.
What Mitch and Donald Trump have done is a complete subversion of democratic norms and a gross abuse of power, but they are hoping we get frustrated and give up.
We can't let them win. In the end, Ohio voters must have their say.
And with an extremist right-wing majority on the nation's highest court, flipping control of the Ohio Supreme Court is more important now than ever. We're two seats away from holding a Democratic majority on the court, which would mean a last line of defense for voting rights, reproductive freedom and workers' rights in Ohio.
Republicans also know exactly how much is on the line, which is why Karl Rove and special interest groups are funneling hoards of cash into this race. But with Democrats Jennifer Brunner and John O'Donnell tied or ahead in recent polls, we have a real shot at winning control of the state's highest court for the first time in decades.
In Ohio, electing a Democratic majority to the Ohio Supreme Court is the most impactful, IMMEDIATE action you can take against the confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett, so I have to ask: will you chip in $25 right now to the Ohio Democrats' Supreme Court Fund?

Jim Jordan raised $1.4 million in just three months after his bullying behavior during Donald Trump's impeachment hearings.
And it turns out that while he was making a huge ruckus, he wasn't doing his actual job. Just this morning, Ohio Capital Journal reported that Jim Jordan didn't introduce a single bill in Congress last year. Not. One. Bill.

David Pepper,info@ohiodems.org,Last night in Wisconsin,"Hey,
We saw last night that despite the GOP's shameful attempts to suppress the vote, Wisconsin Democrats prevailed in their fight to elect Judge Jill Karofsky to the Wisconsin Supreme Court.
These statewide judicial races are critical, and Democrats proved last night that we CAN win -- even when Republicans play politics with voters' lives during a pandemic.
Looking ahead to November, we have the same opportunity here in Ohio. Two seats on the Ohio Supreme Court are up this year, and if we win them, our candidates will join the two justices we elected in 2018 -- achieving a Democratic majority on the court for the first time in decades.
Both of our candidates have been ahead or tied against the Republican incumbents in every poll. But the other side is extremely well-funded -- and we need your help.
As little as $5 makes a difference as we gear up to elect two new Democratic justices to the Ohio Supreme Court this year. Can I count on you to contribute to our cause?
In 2018, the statewide vote totals in Ohio's legislative elections were about 50-50, but Republicans have rigged the lines to give them overwhelming majorities in the Ohio House and Senate.
Electing two Democrats to our state's highest court is our best shot at a level playing field in Ohio. When new districts are drawn next year following the census, we need a Democratic majority on the court that will ensure that the new map is fair and represents our state accurately.
You see, this isn't just about winning this year -- this is about making Ohio competitive for the next decade.
Donating to the Ohio Democratic Party is an investment in winning long term in Ohio. Your support will define politics in Ohio for years to come -- click here to donate today.

ODP Weekly Update,info@ohiodems.org,Donald Trump's closing argument,"TRUMP WATCH
## Ohio Moms Call Out Trump's Attacks on the Affordable Care Act
Donald Trump's closing argument to the American people is a demand that the U.S. Supreme Court overturn the Affordable Care Act, ripping health coverage away from tens of millions of Americans and ending protections for as many as 133 million Americans with pre-existing conditions.
Twitter
Ahead of Vice President Mike Pence's visit to Cincinnati on Wednesday, the Ohio Democratic Party hosted a virtual roundtable with Ohio moms and grandmas to discuss how their families would be negatively impacted by the loss of the Affordable Care Act.
Massillon Mayor Kathy Catazaro-Perry criticized Trump and Pence for not taking the coronavirus pandemic seriously, saying, ""What Donald Trump says matters. We should be looking up to our president, and when he refuses to wear a mask or makes fun of those who do, people take that as a signal. When Mike Pence is at a rally and half of the people aren't wearing masks or social distancing, people take that as a signal, and it puts our communities -- all of our communities -- at risk.""
Twitter
""We are in the middle of a pandemic,"" said Reynoldsburg Councilwoman Meredith Lawson-Rowe. ""Taking away insurance from families -- the least of us -- is devastating, and it's irresponsible. Just think, there are parents working two and three jobs, and they still cannot afford adequate health care. That is just unspeakable.""
Twitter
When asked what she would tell people to persuade them to vote for Joe Biden, Lithopolis Councilwoman Amber Daniels said, ""So if I was talking to a neighbor or a community member, I would say, 'You know if you truly love my children, a way that you can prove that to us is that you can wear your mask, you can socially distance and you can protect the ACA. You can vote for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.'""
Twitter
Delaware County mom Melanie Farkas said, ""We all deserve a chance to be healthy and have health care that helps us continue to be healthy, and there's a really clear choice of a candidate who actually has a plan to continue the benefits of the ACA and improve them. Trump has no plan, even though he claims that he does. He's done nothing except try to get rid of the ACA for four years.""

I hope this email finds you safe and healthy.
Tonight marks the first end-of-quarter fundraising deadline of 2020 -- and I know deadlines like these are on the back burner during difficult times.
But with so much on the line this November, our fight to turn Ohio blue can't stop.
Competing with the GOP fundraising machine is already a challenge when you're up against Donald Trump and his lobbyist friends -- but it's even tougher with in-person events canceled for the foreseeable future, like our legacy dinner. Now more than ever, the Ohio Democratic Party is counting on online donations from grassroots supporters like you.
If you are unable to donate at this difficult time, I completely understand, and I hope you'll keep watching your email for other ways to help elect Democrats.
But if you are able to help our cause, I hope you'll become one of the 15 people from Ashley who can help us reach our end-of-quarter goal.
Click here to chip in $10 and fund the essential work we're doing to turn Ohio blue this November.
We have a president who spent weeks downplaying the coronavirus threat and now spends most of his time tweeting lies, feuding with governors and attacking front-line heroes, rather than taking action to help our brave medical professionals who are fighting this deadly pandemic. The stakes have never been higher -- and your support means so much to us.

Trump has abused his power by shaking down Ukrainian leaders to boost his 2020 campaign, and he's been able to do so with total, lock-step support from the Republican Party.
And some of his loudest defenders throughout these proceedings have been Ohio's GOP members of Congress.
But we can't impeach Jim Jordan.
We can't impeach Rob Portman.
We can't impeach Brad Wenstrup, Steve Chabot or Mike Turner, who have embarrassed our state on a national stage with their pandering displays of loyalty to Trump.
No, the only way to defeat Ohio's Trump enablers is at the ballot box.

George Clark,info@ohiodems.org,"Hey, can you register voters this weekend?","Hey folks,
It's so hard to believe that Ohio's primary election is right around the corner (early voting begins next week)!
The deadline to register to vote in the primary is this upcoming Tuesday -- which means this is the last weekend to register new voters and re-register purged voters before the deadline.
I'm reaching out today to ask you to register voters with Ohio Democrats in your community this weekend. Click here to find an event near you!
WHO: Ohio Dems and you
WHAT: Registering voters
WHEN: Saturday, Feb. 15 and Sunday, Feb. 16
WHERE: Communities across Ohio
RSVP >>
Registering voters is the most impactful action you can take this weekend to build the infrastructure to take back the White House in November -- so let's work together to make sure that Democrats across Ohio are registered and ready to vote.
Thanks for your help,
George

George Clark,info@ohiodems.org,I'm a proud product of Ohio public schools,"Dear friend,
I am a proud product of Ohio public schools. Growing up near Youngstown, I attended public schools from kindergarten through high school, then went on to attend Ohio's largest public institution: the Ohio State University.
I still think back to how many of my teachers have shaped my life in such big ways, and I know that I am better off because I had access to such a great education -- which is why I believe that all children in Ohio should have access to the best public schools possible. But I need your help, because Ohio public schools are under attack.
Republicans in Ohio have fought tooth and nail for years to privatize education, taking more resources away from public schools to fund private school vouchers -- essentially taking taxpayer dollars and funneling them directly to private schools.
And the problem is getting worse. A recent expansion of the school voucher program in Ohio will cost public schools more than $1 billion.
Taking money away from public schools means that the kids who do depend on public schools for quality education will have access to fewer teachers, fewer books -- the list goes on.
Can you add your name to this petition and show support for public education?

David Pepper,info@ohiodems.org,A major victory for voting rights,"Ohio voters just won in court for the second time in less than a week, team.
A judge ruled today in our lawsuit against Secretary of State Frank LaRose that county boards of elections in Ohio are permitted to install voter dropboxes in multiple locations around each county. The court found that LaRose's directive banning more than one drop box was arbitrary and unlawful.
It's a big win for safe and easy voting. We will do all we can to ensure it is sustained and enforced.
This is a tremendous victory, but we know that the GOP's attacks on voting rights won't stop here -- and with so much on the line this year, this fight is more urgent than ever.

Because of your support, we're launching new ads in Ohio to counter Donald Trump's lies.

It's good news and it's bad news, team. The good news is Trump is clearly more terrified than ever that he'll lose Ohio, and thus the presidency -- but the bad news is, swing voters across the state will be barraged with Trump ads.
We need to get our message across to swing voters who have moved in our direction in recent months before it's too late -- or we risk Trump winning them back over with his lies.
The more folks we reach, the less impact Trump's ads will have, so I have to ask -- can you pitch in $10 or more before tonight's critical fundraising deadline?

Subject: Holy moly
Hey team,
Holy moly! Donald Trump dropped more than $800,000 on television ads in Ohio last week.
That's a lot of money, which means Trump HQ is clearly terrified they're losing Ohio. And they're right to be terrified -- recent polls show that Democrats are more energized here, and that Joe Biden has pulled ahead.
However -- if we don't respond, we'll see the Buckeye State swing back in his favor. That's why we're launching a digital ad campaign so that every swing voter who sees Trump's ads will hear from us about the trail of broken promises and reckless, failed policies he's left in his wake.
But here's the problem: we just don't have the same budget as the GOP. Trump can ask his billionaire friends to write a check on a whim, but we rely on grassroots donations from the folks we're fighting for -- everyday Ohioans.
In comparison, $10 might not sound like a lot, but you see, every $10 in targeted digital ads reaches about 20 swing voters (and gets us another step closer to winning this November).
I hate to ask, but it's so important, folks -- can you pitch in $10 or more to help us reach more swing voters?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
$10 = 20 swing voters reached
$20 = 40 swing voters reached
$50 = 100 swing voters reached
$100 = 200 swing voters reached

* Kate Schroder's race \-- she's taking on Steve Chabot in Ohio's 1st Congressional District -- was moved to ""Toss-Up"" status by the Cook Political Report.
* Alaina Shearer \-- who is challenging Troy Balderson in Ohio's 12th Congressional District -- outraised Balderson 3-1 last quarter, and her race was another one shifted toward Democrats by the Cook Political Report.

Before the coronavirus crisis hit, we would have been in Milwaukee this week for the Democratic National Convention. Heeding the advice of public health experts, the DNC wisely decided to move back the convention and make it largely virtual. But that doesn't mean it won't be an engaging experience for our delegates and grassroots activists -- we're planning some great events that you won't want to miss.
We're also looking forward to an amazing State Convention on Saturday, Aug. 1.

## ""Callous and Clueless""
This week Education Secretary Betsy DeVos made a virtual visit to Ohio, but she is pushing to reopen schools without ensuring the safety of our students, teachers, staff and parents.
The Ohio Democratic Party held a Zoom roundtable with public education leaders to push back on Donald Trump's failed coronavirus response and the administration's threats to take away resources from schools that don't fully reopen.
Facebook
Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper was joined by Ohio Education Association President Scott DiMauro, Ohio Federation of Teachers President Melissa Cropper and College Democrats of Ohio President Matt Nowling, who slammed Betsy DeVos' reckless plan to reopen schools.
Twitter
""I guess two words come to mind: callous and clueless. Secretary DeVos's comments about just utterly disregarding the health and safety threat that reopening schools without clear public health guidance imposes was actually pretty shocking,"" said DiMauro. ""We know that if the opening of the schools isn't done right, it's going to be a disaster.""
Cropper added: ""And while [DeVos is] talking about reopening schools and offering no plan, she is also not talking to any educators in this state, although she's making a personal appearance virtually to talk to the Federalist [Society].""

## Ohio Dems to Frank LaRose: Don't Wait on Legislature, Act Now
Sen. Sandra Williams and Sen. Nickie Antonio this week urged Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose to take action and make improvements to Ohio's voting system, without waiting on the GOP-dominated legislature.
Twitter
Also this week state Representatives Paula Hicks-Hudson, Michele Lepore-Hagan, Catherine Ingram and Bride Rose Sweeney encouraged LaRose to use federal funding to pay for return postage on absentee ballots and applications.
Sweeney said, ""While the global pandemic rages on, voters are growing more fearful and he's playing 'Mother may I' with a GOP-led legislature that is uninterested in helping voters.""

Jim Obergefell,info@ohiodems.org,Five years of marriage equality,"I didn't set out to make history; my partner John and I simply wanted our marriage to be recognized. Ohio Democratic Party
Friend --
Today marks five years since I stood on the steps of the U.S. Supreme Court after the decision came down in Obergefell v. Hodges, making marriage equality the law of the land.
I didn't set out to make history; my partner John and I simply wanted our marriage to be recognized. Getting married was the one thing we could do to love, honor and protect each other even after he passed away from complications due to ALS. I feel so humbled that my fight for him and for our marriage helped create a legacy in his honor -- a legacy of fighting for equality.
Last week, our movement received another victory when the Supreme Court affirmed that workplace discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity is prohibited under federal civil rights law. But we are far from having won this fight -- and if Donald Trump is re-elected to another four years, there is no telling what damage will be done to the progress we've made.
Donald Trump has already proven he will do whatever it takes to roll back progress made in the LGBTQ+ movement -- including a trans military ban, ending Obama-era non-discrimination protections, using Title IX to discriminate against trans students, the list goes on. Another four years of Trump would mean countless more anti-LGBTQ+ federal judges on the bench -- and you can bet that victories like last week's will be a thing of the past.
The fight for LGBTQ+ equality continues with taking back the White House this year, -- and recent polling shows that if Trump loses Ohio, it's all over for his presidency. That's why I'm humbly asking you today: Will you pitch in to the Ohio Dems' Defeat Trump Fund?
I couldn't be more proud of the strides our community has taken since I stood in front of the Supreme Court five years ago -- but we've worked too hard to lose the progress we've made in another four years of Donald Trump.
Chip in now to take back the White House: [[URL REDACTED]]

Organizers
Even though this campaign has been unlike any other we've seen in our lifetimes, we are continuing to ramp up for Election Day -- which is now just 123 days away. Many of the events we look forward to in a presidential campaign are changing because of the coronavirus crisis, but the great thing is that we are now able to make them more interactive and inclusive for everyone to participate.
First of all, our State Convention -- when we elect the 18 Ohioans who will serve as our Democratic presidential electors -- will be happening on Saturday, Aug. 1. We're still in the planning stages of what will now be a virtual event, but we already have a number of amazing guests set to speak. So save the date now for our State Convention!
Secondly, we are looking forward to a phenomenal Democratic National Convention, when delegates from across the nation and around the globe will nominate Joe Biden to become our next president. The convention will be anchored every night in Milwaukee and will include four nights of programming, starting on Monday, Aug. 17. In addition, there will be virtual events, with opportunities for grassroots activists and volunteers to be a part of the experience.

## Ohio Coronavirus Cases Surge
With more than 1,300 new cases reported in Ohio on Thursday, the coronavirus crisis is surging in the Buckeye State and across the country, but Republican leaders in Washington and at the Ohio Statehouse have dismissed science and public health experts and politicized the pandemic response.
Twitter
The Ohio Democratic Party hosted a virtual roundtable discussion to discuss the recent surge in coronavirus infections in Ohio with state Rep. Allison Russo, a health care policy expert; Dr. Rachael Morocco, a pediatrician running for Ohio House District 67 in Delaware County; Dr. Ean Bett, a family medicine physician and member of the Physicians Action Network; and Dr. Anita Somani, an ob-gyn and past president of the Columbus Medical Association.
Twitter
Every speaker emphasized the importance of wearing masks in public to prevent further spread -- but Donald Trump has politicized the issue, asserting that wearing a mask is a political statement against him.
""As Dr. Fauci warns we could soon see 100,000 new coronavirus cases every single day and the CDC says the coronavirus outbreak is spreading too rapidly in the U.S. to bring it under control, the Trump administration has basically given up on trying to fight the pandemic,"" said Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper.

## Ohio Dems Call Out Trump's Lies on His Visit to the Buckeye State
Ahead of Donald Trump's visit to the Buckeye State this week, the Ohio Democratic Party held a virtual roundtable with Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur, Cleveland City Councilman Blaine Griffin and United Steelworkers Local 979 President Dan Boone to highlight the president's failed policies and broken promises to working Ohioans.
Twitter
""He's coming for the press to cover him for a photo op ... he's going to deal with his wealthy friends that he rewarded so highly in the tax bill that has harmed the middle class in our country,"" said Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur. ""Now, here's a few things that he's not doing. He's not putting America first, and he's certainly not helping Ohio.... This is a serious time for Ohio. I support Joe Biden so strongly because he has the experience and the good measure to help lead our country forward domestically and internationally.""
Twitter
""The president promised to do this big infrastructure package,"" said United Steelworkers Local 979 President Dan Boone. ""It would revitalize the steel industry, and we're gonna make it in America, and we're still waiting for that to happen.""

## Ohio Dems Fighting to Make Voting Safer and Easier
Last week, the Ohio Democratic Party filed a lawsuit to allow Ohio voters to request an absentee ballot electronically, and now the party is encouraging Secretary of State Frank LaRose to allow additional secure dropboxes to be placed across the state. Currently there is only one dropbox per county.
Both of these actions would make voting by mail drastically easier -- which is of the utmost importance during a pandemic. Requesting an absentee ballot online would stop voters from having to mail in an application, wait for a ballot to be returned and then mail in their ballot. Dropboxes would also reduce this waiting period allowing folks to simply drop off their ballot.
Twitter
LaRose is opposing the lawsuit to allow applications to be completed online, and he's wasting time by asking Attorney General Dave Yost for an unnecessary legal opinion.

Donald Trump's impeachment ""trial"" has been a total cover-up by the Senate Republicans -- including Rob Portman -- who are scared of Trump and complicit in his misdeeds.
But it's also more clear than ever that we can't count on Republicans like Portman or Mitch McConnell to look out for our country's best interests and hold this president accountable. We have to vote them out.
Every. Single. One.
It's time for each and every one of us who love democracy to step up and join the fight to stop Trump and his enablers in the GOP. That's why I'm asking everyone to chip in now -- whatever you can -- and become an official, card-carrying member of the Ohio Democratic Party.

ODP Weekly Update,info@ohiodems.org,The Trump Recession,"Dear friend,
This week in Georgia we saw a preview of what could happen this November if we don't prepare for an unprecedented general election -- an election conducted as we cope with a second wave of coronavirus infections, an election undermined by misinformation coming from the Oval Office, and an election that could easily see record-high turnout.
All of that could happen -- but Ohio Republicans are doing little to address these realities. In fact, they're making things worse.
Rather than passing legislation to make it safer and more convenient to vote, the Ohio House GOP instead rammed through a bill that would make it more difficult to vote by mail, as well as restricting the authority of public officials to ensure a safe election. Only at the last minute, thanks to public outcry, did even worse provisions get removed.
In contrast, Democratic legislators in the Senate and House are pushing for reforms that would make it more convenient and safe for Ohioans to cast their ballots this fall, both in person and by mail. We strongly support these proposals, including Senate Bill 323, which would stop any attempt to ""consolidate"" polling places, which was one of the root causes of the problems in Georgia.

Congresswoman Marcia Fudge has been a stalwart champion for voting rights, and this week she held a hearing on what happened during this year's primary elections and how the federal government can help prepare for the 2020 general election.

TRUMP WATCH
As Donald Trump tries to push false claims about the economy, the Ohio Democratic Party is pushing back, releasing a new video on the ""Trump Recession"" -- which was officially declared as starting in February, but began much sooner in the Buckeye State, which lost 12,500 jobs last year.
Twitter video
""More than 1.3 million Ohioans have filed for unemployment in the last three months, and Donald Trump is desperately trying to take a victory lap,"" said Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper. ""Trump is hoping no one notices that 2019 was the worst year for jobs in Ohio since the Great Recession, and our state lost thousands of manufacturing jobs last year -- long before the coronavirus crisis hit. Farmers are struggling because of Trump's reckless trade war, and hospitals are closing as Trump continues to attack the Affordable Care Act. Time and time again, Donald Trump has broken his promises, and working Ohioans are paying the price.""
In January, Trump came to Toledo and claimed, ""Ohio just had the best year economically in the history of your state."" That was a lie.
The facts are clear that Ohio's economy has struggled ever since Trump took office.
* Last year was Ohio's worst year for job creation since 2009 -- the height of the Great Recession.
* From January 2019 to January 2020 -- even before the coronavirus crisis hit and decimated the economy -- Ohio lost 12,500 jobs, including 6,000 jobs in manufacturing.
* Many parts of Ohio that are heavily dependent on manufacturing are struggling with job losses.
* Chapter 12 family farm bankruptcies went up by nearly 20 percent last year, and Ohio's farm bankruptcy filings were at a decade-high level in 2019.

Racism Is a Public Health Crisis
As protests across Ohio and the nation have made clear, we must finally take on the racism that has afflicted our nation from its founding and all of the persistent and pervasive impacts that result from structural racism. Democrats across Ohio have led the charge, leading communities to declare that racism is a public health crisis. From Congress, to the Statehouse, to large counties such as Franklin, to our cities and suburban communities, so many have stepped up to make this important statement and call for reforms that address racism.

Trump's Rolled Over for China
Donald Trump has failed to protect Americans' health and livelihoods from the coronavirus pandemic, and now he's trying to shift blame onto China.
There is no question that China must be held accountable -- but Trump has proven that he's not capable of doing that. He spent weeks and weeks offering absurd flattery of China and unwarranted praise for its transparency as the crisis developed.
Twitter
Trump points to his China travel ban as proof he took the coronavirus crisis seriously. However, more than three dozen countries had already restricted travel from China before he acted. After Trump's travel ban, more than 40,000 people continued to fly into the U.S. from China.
Twitter
Contrast Trump's praise for China and ineffective travel ban with Vice President Joe Biden, who warned in February, ""I would not be taking China's word for it. I would insist that China allow our scientists in to make a hard determination of how it started, where it's from, how far along it is. Because that is not happening now.""
Instead of holding China accountable and prioritizing Americans' health, Trump rolled over for China and got played on both trade and the epidemic that has halted the U.S. economy and killed or sickened hundreds of thousands of Americans.

Sen. Sherrod Brown Pushes For ""Heroes Fund""
Last week U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown introduced his ""Heroes Fund"" proposal, a pandemic premium pay plan that would help reward, retain and recruit essential workers who are on the frontlines of this pandemic.
Twitter
""Workers in hospitals and nursing homes, in the service sector and public safety, and throughout our economy are risking their lives during this public health emergency to keep our citizens safe, and their paychecks should reflect that. Frontline workers also need proper protection from the virus at work,"" said Brown. ""The next coronavirus-response package Congress passes must honor the dignity of their work by including this Pandemic Premium Pay proposal to compensate our frontline heroes and mandatory safety requirements to keep them safe on the job.""
Brown's plan includes:
* A premium pay increase of up to $25,000 for essential workers, equivalent to a raise of $13 per hour from the start of the public health emergency until Dec. 31, 2020, and
* A $15,000 essential worker recruitment incentive to attract and secure the workforce needed to fight the public health crisis.
Congresswoman Joyce Beatty, Congresswoman Marcia Fudge, Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur and Congressman Tim Ryan agree that essential workers need supplemental pay.
Fudge told Spectrum News 1, ""We keep saying they're essential, but we don't treat them like they're essential. You don't pay an essential worker $8 an hour or $10 an hour.""
Ryan said, ""My goodness, I mean, this is the least we can do. We're throwing around trillions and trillions of dollars. I think those people on the ground should be the ones who get a little bit of reward for really being there for all of us for such a difficult time.""

Kirstin Alvanitakis,info@ohiodems.org,10 years of the ACA,"The coronavirus pandemic is revealing major weaknesses in our health care system, and now Donald Trump is doubling down on his attempt to destroy one of the things that has helped -- the Affordable Care Act.
Donald Trump's health care agenda is toxic -- and Ohioans can't rely on this dangerous president to protect our care.
Click here to join the Ohioans who are pledging to vote blue in November.
Team --
Today marks 10 years since President Barack Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law, expanding health care access to millions of Americans. But since Donald Trump's very first day in office, he has fought tooth and nail to gut the ACA -- and Ohioans are paying the price, especially in this crisis moment.
Here's the bottom line: Donald Trump's actions have made the impact of the coronavirus outbreak much worse.
His attacks on the health care law have led to rising numbers of uninsured Ohioans. He eliminated the pandemic response team. He's tried to slash funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Now Republicans and the Trump administration are going to court to throw out the Affordable Care Act -- a move that would put five million Ohioans with pre-existing conditions at risk and rip coverage away from more than half a million Ohioans who are covered under Medicaid expansion. It would also put 25 percent of Ohio hospitals at risk for closure. That's one out of every four hospitals in the Buckeye State.
The thing is, Trump and the GOP have never had a plan for health care -- this lawsuit that he's cheerleading is the Republican plan.
This is the choice facing voters in 2020 -- are we going to sign on for four more years of Donald Trump's ineptitude in a crisis and absolute devotion to undoing the Affordable Care Act? Or are we going to elect a president that is steady in a crisis and devoted to protecting health care, not taking it away?

Ohio Lost Thousands of Manufacturing Jobs Since GM Lordstown Closed
On the one-year anniversary of the last Chevy Cruze rolling off the line at the now-shuttered General Motors factory at Lordstown, the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services announced the state lost 12,500 jobs -- including 6,000 manufacturing jobs -- from January 2019 to January 2020.
Twitter
""It's been one year since the workers of GM Lordstown put the finishing touches on the last Chevy Cruze made in America, and since that time, Ohio has lost thousands of manufacturing jobs,"" said Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper. ""Donald Trump lied when he promised Ohioans that their jobs were 'all coming back' and 'new factories will come rushing onto our shores.' Donald Trump lied when he said 'Ohio just had the best year economically in the history of your state.'
Twitter
""Trump has been to Ohio six times in the past year and has never once come to Lordstown to look the workers and community members in the eye, even after they pleaded for his help. He said GM Lordstown's closing 'doesn't really matter.' Then he attacked Lordstown workers and their leaders. Then he proposed killing a loan program that could help save at least some of the jobs that were lost when the plant closed.
""Donald Trump needs to get off Twitter, stop golfing every weekend and get to work helping Ohio workers, rather than screwing them over at every turn.""

ODP Weekly Update,info@ohiodems.org,The polls open on Tuesday in Ohio,"Hello friends,
This is a challenging moment for our country. Our economy is continuing to struggle, we've lost more than 200,000 lives to the coronavirus pandemic and now our nation's president has been stricken with this deadly virus.
At the Ohio Democratic Party, our thoughts are with the First Family at this time, along with all others who are fighting through this deadly virus.
Twitter
We are glad to hear that Joe and Jill Biden have tested negative, and we hope everyone with both campaigns stays healthy. We will continue to do everything we can -- wearing masks, practicing social distancing -- to keep our staff, our volunteers and our communities safe and healthy.
It's a challenging moment, but our country has always conducted elections and upheld the results, even in times of great crisis. We held successful elections amid the Civil War, the Great Depression and both World Wars. Now it's our turn to prove that nothing -- not even this pandemic -- will stand in the way of our democratic commitment to voting.
However, even in these times there is good news. Today the appellate court ruled in our drop box lawsuit, and we are pleased that the court agreed with our contention from the outset of this dispute that nothing in Ohio law prevents the addition of dropboxes throughout counties. They explicitly rejected Secretary of State Frank LaRose's argument that somehow Ohio statute prohibited them, which he had used as his excuse for banning all but one per county. This decision makes clear that that was a political decision and not one with any basis in state law.
It is now the moment for LaRose to act on his public and private comments that he 'would love to see more drop boxes.' It's the right thing to do, and there is time to allow counties to add dropboxes in the final weeks of the election, when they will be most helpful, just like they are being installed in states across the country.
It's time to Make It Count, Ohio.
First things first -- check your voter registration now. The deadline to register is Monday, Oct. 5, so please encourage all of your friends and family members to get registered and confirm their registration right away.
Twitter
Secondly -- early in-person voting opens on Tuesday, Oct. 6, and for those of you who have already requested a vote-by-mail ballot, those will be sent out starting next week. It's important for everyone to vote for the entire ballot, including the judicial candidates, which will not have their party affiliation listed.
That's why it's helpful to have your Democratic ""sample ballot"" with you when you vote in person or fill out your vote-by-mail ballot. Click here to find a list of your county's Democratic candidates.

Hey team,
There are some folks on the right who want us to believe that wearing masks somehow makes us less free -- but the vast majority of Americans know that when we all wear masks, the rate of coronavirus transmission drops dramatically.
The Ohio Democratic Party wants you and your family to stay safe, and we'd like to send a message that Democrats are proud to take this common sense step -- so we've launched a new line of masks in our online store.
Whether you're out protesting, registering voters or simply going to the grocery store, we hope you'll wear these masks with pride.
(Psst -- half of all proceeds from our entire mask collection will go to support the Ohio Legislative Black Caucus, whose members are fighting to make our state the first to declare racism a public health crisis.)

But don't wait -- these union-printed, made-in-the-USA masks are available for a limited time only!

A quick update on the primary: a bill was passed this week and signed by Gov. Mike DeWine today extending the deadline for voting by mail until Tuesday, April 28.
All votes cast before March 17 have been secured and will be counted on April 28.
If you haven't voted in the primary yet, you can now cast a ballot by mail, postmarked up until April 27, or drop your completed ballot off at your board of elections up to April 28. Limited in-person voting will be available for those with disabilities or without reliable mail service.
Our Voter Protection Team and other departments are launching a wide and continual voter education campaign to inform voters on how they can exercise their right to vote in the primary, and we look forward to partnering with as many groups as possible in doing so.
All information needed to cast a ballot is also available here.

TRUMP WATCH
Trump's Failure to Deal with the Coronavirus Crisis
This Monday was the 10th anniversary of the Affordable Care Act, and Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper penned an op-ed for the Delaware Gazette discussing how the health care law has benefited Ohio -- and how Donald Trump's attacks on the ACA have harmed public health and our preparedness for the coronavirus outbreak.
Facebook
Trump's failed leadership and mismanagement of the coronavirus outbreak has endangered Americans and significantly worsened a severe public health crisis. Every day he continues his failed response by refusing to take any responsibility, blaming and attacking others, contradicting experts and his own administration, repeating falsehoods and downplaying the severity of the crisis.
Twitter
Twitter
Trump is keeping needed supplies out of hospitals stretched to the brink -- the government has 1.5 million masks sitting in Indiana they won't deploy, and Trump made a deal to get 80,000 more ventilators before backing out because he's too cheap.

Ohio Lawmakers Pass Coronavirus Response Package
State lawmakers returned to the Statehouse this week to address the coronavirus crisis and provide immediate relief to everyday Ohioans.
Facebook
""In times of crisis, our state has looked to its General Assembly to lead and respond to critical needs of working people and families in our state; House Democrats were happy to answer that call today and pass a sweeping, bipartisan bill that will be the first of many steps to restore normalcy and regain control of this public health crisis and the economic destruction it is leaving behind,"" said Ohio House Democratic Leader Emilia Sykes. ""While we know that not everything we wanted addressed was taken care of in this one bill, this is a good start to ensure our government continues to work for the people, especially during this crisis."" Many of the provisions passed in this bill address issues Democratic legislators have long fought for to support working people and families; protect the health, safety and security of Ohioans; equip children with the tools they need to succeed; and ensure our government works for the people, not against them.

Liz Shirey,info@ohiodems.org,Honoring her legacy,"Today is going to be a tough day for a lot of people. If you can, will you join me in honoring RBG's legacy by signing up to volunteer this weekend?
America lost a giant last night.
Like many of you, I was devastated to hear about Ruth Bader Ginsburg's passing. She was an inspiration to so many, breaking barrier after barrier as a woman in a male-dominated field. She was a fierce advocate for equality and has shaped our nation for generations to come.
But to so many Americans, her seat on the Supreme Court meant more than that. Her vote meant the difference between having access to health care or not, having reproductive freedoms or not, protecting the rights of Dreamers or not.
Justice Ginsburg's dying wish was that she wouldn't be replaced until a new president is installed. And without missing a beat, Mitch McConnell announced last night that he plans to move ahead with nominating a replacement before the year ends -- giving Republicans a 6-3 majority on the court.
It's understandable to feel hopeless in times like these. But that's exactly what Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump want. They want us to feel like we can't do anything. They want us to feel like there's no point in even trying.
But there is, folks. The stakes were always high, but my, have they grown exponentially higher in the last 24 hours.
Take a few moments to mourn today. Then sign up for a shift for our Weekend of Action to make calls, send texts, whatever you can to elect Joe Biden and end the nightmare of the Trump presidency.
Let's go win this for her -- it's the least we can do.

Check out this excerpt from a new USA Today column! It illustrates exactly what we've been preaching: Ohio is a must-win state.
Without Ohio, it is hard to imagine Trump winning a second term. That the state appears to be in play should be a warning sign for Republicans across the country.
And that's exactly why your donation to the Ohio Democratic Party is so important. Small-dollar contributions from folks all over the Buckeye State have made it possible for my team to move the needle on Trump by running highly targeted digital ads, expanding voter outreach and more.
I'm really proud of the progress we've made -- but because Ohio will make or break Trump's re-election, we need to wage the strongest campaign possible.
I wouldn't ask if it wasn't so important, -- can you chip in $5 to defeat Donald Trump this November?
Every dollar makes a difference -- and if you're able to pitch in, I hope I can count on you to help us win the most important election of our lifetimes.

I know there's a lot going on in the world right now, so I'll make this brief.
There are just 236 days left until the 2020 presidential election -- when our hard work for the last three and a half years is put to the test.
Ohio Dems are working harder than ever to build a pathway to victory for the eventual Democratic nominee through hiring field organizers, investing in digital ads and implementing an aggressive rapid-response communications strategy. But the pathway to victory requires raising a lot of money from grassroots supporters like you -- especially if we want to compete with the Trump fundraising machine.
The first quarter fundraising deadline is at the end of this month -- and it's our first opportunity in 2020 to prove that Ohio is not only a battleground state, but it's also the state that will stop Donald Trump.
We still need nine people from Ashley to join us in this fight -- can you chip in $5 (or the price of a cup of coffee)?

ODP Weekly Update,info@ohiodems.org,Protecting public health... and the right to vote,"Dear folks,
Like many of you, I'm working from home today with my family as we practice social distancing to help slow the spread of the coronavirus -- and we're doing the best we can. When I talk with reporters on the phone, my sons Jack and Charlie occasionally join the conversation, as perhaps your children are doing as well. It has fast become the new normal for those who are lucky enough to be able to work remotely.
For those of you who are at work today -- the people who are caring for the sick and vulnerable, preparing and serving food, stocking our grocery store shelves, driving trucks and delivering necessities to those in quarantine, cleaning our offices and schools and keeping our communities safe -- thank you for your service and sacrifice. I pray that you and your families remain safe and healthy.
Kudos also to the incredible work being done by our elected officials and public servants across the state -- mayors, school board members, county leaders, council members. This is the reason we work so hard on elections every year, at every level -- we need great public servants at times like these! And so many have been leading their communities in inspiring ways.
Speaking of elected officials, our Democratic leaders in the Statehouse, led by Leaders Emilia Sykes and Kenny Yuko, are ready to go the Statehouse next week to fight for broad relief as the crisis hits Ohio -- through steps to minimize the spread as much as possible, shore up our health response, as well as to minimize the economic damage it is already rendering across the state. There is so much that has to be done, but our legislators are up to it.
Quick Update on the Ohio Primary
With many of us staying at home, social media has become a major way for folks to connect and share information. Unfortunately, not all of that information is always correct.
There has been a lot of misinformation surrounding our primary election and the Ohio Democratic Party's decision to go to court to ensure those who have yet to cast their ballot are able to do so -- and do so safely.
As we stated on Monday, we supported Dr. Amy Acton and Gov. Mike DeWine in their decision to close polling places this week -- we had heard from across Ohio that polling locations were simply not ready to operate a safe and clean election for poll workers or voters. However, we also strongly believe that all Ohioans should still have a right to vote in the primary, and went to court Tuesday to ensure that the state has firm legal ground to extend the primary for all those who intended to vote Tuesday (something only a court or the legislature can do).
In addition, whether through the court or the legislature, we are proposing that Ohio not take the risk of scheduling another in-person primary for early June (which Secretary Frank LaRose is touting) -- which defies all that we are hearing about when this crisis will end. Instead, we are advocating a broad mail-in election, giving voters the opportunity to request and vote via absentee ballot, either by mail with prepaid postage, or at a secured curbside drop off location. We also would require accommodations for those who cannot vote a paper ballot without assistance. The end of this expanded vote-by-mail election would be well earlier than June 2, which is helpful in many ways. There are simply too many uncertainties with attempting to conduct a statewide ""Election Day"" with in-person voting to put all our eggs in that basket. We are working across party lines to get this done.
Facebook
So despite what you hear -- at this time, there is no resolution about how our primary election will be concluded, on what day and in what form. Our Ohio House and Senate Democrats will be addressing this issue and other major pieces of legislation to deal with the coronavirus outbreak. They have been talking with their colleagues across the aisle, and we have been in conversation with the governor's office throughout.
Facebook
Whether or not the General Assembly solves this, we also will push our position in court as a backstop to ensure the primary is extended in a way that protects public health and Ohioans' right to vote.
Still have questions? Our Voter Protection Team can help. Call our Voter Protection Hotline at 1-833-DEM-VOTE (833-336-8683) for assistance.
Getting Assistance
While democracy must go forward through thick and thin, for many, there are near-term needs that are far more pressing. Perhaps you or someone you know is dealing with food insecurity, job loss or mental health concerns. Here are a few resources you can utilize or share.
* Apply for Unemployment
* Locate a Food Bank
* Apply for Small Business Disaster Loan Assistance
* Coronavirus Resources from the U.S. Small Business Administration
* National Domestic Violence Hotline

We're all in this together.

TRUMP WATCH
Trump's War on Affordable Care Act Hurts Coronavirus Response
Donald Trump has shown that he doesn't value the American people's health care or public health.
Twitter
His first act as president was to sign an executive order instructing all his cabinet agencies to begin dismantling the Affordable Care Act -- which celebrates its 10th anniversary next week.
As a result of Trump's sabotage of the law, the nation's uninsured rate has increased every year he has been in office. Ohio was one of eight states to see our uninsured rate go up in 2018. And after he failed to repeal the ACA through Congress, the Trump administration is now pushing a lawsuit to throw out the health care law.
While Congress is focused on the immediate response to the coronavirus pandemic -- shoring up our health care system, protecting workers and small businesses from economic devastation and stimulating the economy -- Trump must stop his war on health care by doing the following:
* Dropping the lawsuit that threatens the health care of millions;
* Eliminating junk plans, which undermine the ACA and don't guarantee coverage or protections for people with pre-existing conditions;
* Re-opening open enrollment so Americans can shop for plans and get covered;
* Withdrawing unnecessary and burdensome Medicaid waivers, such as those that permit block grants and work requirements, that undermine coverage.

During that call, Democratic members of the House expressed their thoughts on legislative remedies to the current public health and economic crises as well as shared concerns they are hearing from local leaders and constituents in their districts.
Based on feedback from their constituents and local leaders, House Democrats have together identified more than 50 high-priority issues thus far, some requiring short-term and others requiring long-term legislative action.
Twitter
""During this time of unprecedented crisis in our state, the role of the legislature is to work in tandem with the other two branches of government as well as local and federal officials to provide the most comprehensive action plan possible that helps the most Ohioans, especially the ones hardest hurt by this pandemic,"" Sykes said.
Twitter
The Ohio Senate Democratic Caucus outlined its legislative recommendations this week to blunt the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on all Ohioans. The senators urged that the General Assembly immediately reconvene and that their recommendations be included in any legislative package that is considered over the coming weeks.
Twitter
""We are working on legislation that will help Ohioans get through this time,"" said Senate Democratic Leader Kenny Yuko. ""We are looking forward to working across the aisle to get relief to Ohioans as soon as possible.""

UPCOMING EVENTS
Because of the coronavirus outbreak, we're changing some of the ways we campaign -- but that doesn't mean the campaign ends. The Democratic National Committee recently added Ohio to its Battleground Build-up Program, and a new NBC News/Marist poll released this week showed both Democratic contenders leading Trump here.
In the coming weeks, Chairman David Pepper will be holding a telephone town hall with our supporters and volunteers to let you know how you can be a part of our effort to turn Ohio blue in 2020. Click here to sign up for the telephone town hall, and we'll email you with details soon.

I'm reaching out today to extend a huge thank you to everyone who became a 2020 member of the Ohio Democratic Party after my last email.
We were completely blown away by the number of folks who joined our fight to defeat Donald Trump and end gerrymandering this year -- and while we still have a long way to go to catch up to the GOP's fundraising numbers, this was an incredible start.
I just reviewed the new donations and updated our membership records -- here's what I have on file for you now:

When I pulled the numbers from my last email on Tuesday, I found that the average contribution was just $24 -- meaning that our party is a true grassroots operation. And when a lot of people chip in whatever they can, we prove that you don't need special interests and dark money to make an impact.
It's not too late to join our fight to defeat Donald Trump and end gerrymandering. Click here to become a 2020 member of the Ohio Democratic Party.

Hi folks!
My name is Megan Reenock, and I'm the finance director here at the Ohio Democratic Party, which means it's my job to raise the money we need to defeat Donald Trump and elect Democrats up and down the ballot.
Now that we're at the beginning of a new year (and decade!), I've been updating the Ohio Democratic Party's membership records. Here's what I have on file for you:
Your info: [[EMAIL_REDACTED]]
2020 Ohio Democratic Party member? No
Become a 2020 member >>
Every dollar that you invest in the Ohio Democratic Party goes directly to building our field program, expanding the reach of our digital ads and continuing a drumbeat of media events to hold Trump accountable for his broken promises and failed policies.
No matter what happens during tonight's debate or who becomes our nominee, Ohio Democrats are focused like a laser on defeating Donald Trump -- and you can play a key role in that effort. Republicans can snap their fingers and get big money from their lobbyist friends and special interests, but we depend on grassroots supporters reading emails exactly like this one.

Thanks so much for your support -- I really appreciate it!

"David Pepper, Ohio Democrats",email@ohiodems.org,Thank you,"Hi there,
Let me be the first person to welcome you to our team. We are so excited to have you on board as we gear up for some incredibly important fights -- for affordable health care, for high-quality education for all of our kids, for good-paying jobs, for voting rights and so much more.
We aren’t waiting for 2020 to start organizing -- here are a few ways that you can get involved right now:
* Run for office -- or help us find someone who should. Whether it’s for local office in 2019 or Statehouse races in 2020, we’re building a bench of hard-working public servants who will put the people of Ohio first. We want to know who in your community should run for office, so we can start training them now.
* Join the Truth Team. Our grassroots activist community is focused on holding Trump and Ohio Republicans accountable. Choose your group, and we’ll be in touch with online and in-person actions you can take to help us win back our state and our country.
* Make an investment with a recurring donation. Republicans can snap their fingers and get hefty checks from their lobbyist friends and big-money special interests -- we depend on small-dollar donations from supporters like you. Pledge a monthly gift of $3 (or whatever you can) to make sure we have the infrastructure we need to take back our state.
Again, we are so grateful to be in this fight with you. It will take every last one of us working together to fight for the future of our state and our nation.
Thank you for being a part of this,
David

# Marijuana Decriminalization Passes in Plymouth
###
Plymouth, OH - Marijuana is now decriminalized in Plymouth, Ohio. That means there will be no monetary incentive to enforce marijuana related infractions. Taking away the fine discourages enforcement of the draconian state law.
The ordinance passed in a 4-3 vote with Libertarian Mayor Cassaundra Fryman being the deciding vote. Mayor Fryman, who introduced the ordinance, said in her impassioned speech to the council “I want Plymouth to be seen as receptive to change, moving in a direction of economic and cultural modernization, and most importantly, restoring bodily autonomy to our community.”
Plymouth is one of many cities and townships passing local ordinances because the state refuses to act. Marijuana related offences cost a lot of tax dollars to prosecute and a large percentage of our jails are filled with people convicted of these non-violent crimes. The hope with these ordinances is to show the state that Ohio is ready for full and immediate legalization of marijuana.
Cassaundra Fryman is a Libertarian and started her term 01/01/2020. She hopes to continue working with the city council to bring more liberty to her constituents.

## Vice-Presidential Candidate Visits Libertarian Party of Ohio
####
Columbus, OH – Libertarian Party Vice-Presidential Candidate Spike Cohen attended the Libertarian Party of Ohio convention July 24th-26th 2020 in Columbus. He was greeted by the largest credentialed delegation in State party history. Cohen gathered with local and federal candidates to discuss issues facing Ohio
”I’m happy to be in the Buckeye state to meet local Ohio leaders working to spread the message of liberty in their communities. Draconian election laws forced on third parties in Ohio by the GOP require the Libertarian Party presidential ticket to get at least 3% of the vote in the general election. Jorgensen and I are confident that we'll exceed those goals with help from the passionate supporters I've met this weekend” Cohen said about the convention.
Cohen gave the keynote address on Saturday July 25th at 7pm to an enthusiastic crowd. He spoke about reaching voters by listening to concerns and working through solutions not offered by the two old parties. Cheers rang through the crowd when Cohen said “I hear the Ohio Speaker of the House has been arrested” talking of course about the 60 million dollar bribery scheme that landed multiple top Ohio Republicans in jail, including Speaker Larry Householder. “I don’t think Householder will be holding the House anymore.”
Former Ohio Libertarian Party Gubernatorial candidate, Travis Irvine, hosted a joint presentation with the first millennial Vice-Presidential candidate on all 50 ballots. Irvine, a stand-up comedian, felt right at home with Cohen as they discussed ‘Humor in Politics’.
“It was an honor to share a conversation about comedy and politics with our Vice-Presidential nominee, Spike Cohen, to serve as a reminder that a sense of humor is not just a way to get noticed in such a toxic political landscape, it’s also a way to tell the truth,” Irvine said. “I look forward to helping Spike and our Presidential nominee Jo Jorgensen run against the two old party’s despicable candidates in the election this fall.”
Cohen was nominated alongside Libertarian Presidential candidate Jo Jorgenson on Memorial Day weekend in the first ever virtual presidential nominating convention.

# ""The Most Important Election of Our Lifetimes""
﻿By John Fockler
We've all heard it. And heard it. And heard it!
""This is the most important election of our lifetimes!""
If we don't vote out the incumbent, we'll have fascism, and rigged elections – or even no elections – and children will be begging for their food in workhouses, like in Oliver Twist. Or, if we don't re-elect the incumbent, we'll have socialism, and unchecked rioting, and storefront abortion on demand.
As a dedicated observer of the political scene, I have to tell you that I believe about 90% of what the Republicans and Democrats say – about each other. But seriously, whichever of the legacy party candidates gets elected in two weeks (barring a miracle that the country suddenly comes to its senses and elects Jo Jorgensen), we know what we're going to get: more debt, more taxes of one kind or another, more body bags coming home from foreign wars, and more lies about how it's all the other team's fault. There are no real policy differences at stake, no principles. It's just a gigantic football game, ""Yea! My team won!""
But you know what? They might not be lying about one thing. This really might be the most important election of our lifetimes. But not because it will make any real difference which of the legacy party candidates gets elected. Not for any of the reasons they say it is.
It might be the most important election of our lifetimes as Libertarians, because it may well be a watershed election for our Libertarian Party. Let's take a quick look around the country before we come back to the situation here in Ohio.
Our national ticket, Jo Jorgensen and Spike Cohen, is polling relatively well, in the few polls that can be bothered to include them. As we all know, Jo and Spike are both principled and articulate representatives of Libertarian beliefs, but unlike our tickets of the last two Presidential election, neither are ""names,"" experienced politicians who will draw immediate recognition from the mainstream media. Despite this, there is reasonable hope that the ticket will draw at least as many votes as Johnson/Weld did last time, and might even touch that magic five percent figure, which would smooth the way for ballot access in many states and give us access to Federal matching campaign funds if we desire to accept them.i
There are at least two statewide races that could change the political map of this country. In Arkansas, Libertarian Ricky Dale Harrington, Jr., is the only opponent for incumbent Republican Senator Tom Cotton. The race is rated by experts as ""solid Republican,"" not surprisingly. But on October 14, PBS Arkansas scheduled a debate between Harrington and Cotton. Cotton refused to debate Harrington. But Harrington showed up, and PBS Arkansas devoted the entire hour allotted for the debate to a question-and-answer with him, broadcast statewide. Harrington has been earning a ton of media coverage, and may very well break established records for Libertarian statewide candidates.
Then there's our neighboring state of Indiana. Donald Rainwater, the Libertarian candidate for governor, is running extremely well. His polling numbers are very strong, he's receiving serious media attention and debate inclusion, and he has the Republican incumbent scared. He stands a very real chance of being the first Libertarian governor in US history, and the first non-legacy party governor in many decades to be elected without previous experience in high office or celebrity status a la Jesse Ventura. This will be game changing for our party, and might well be even if he doesn't quite win.
In Ohio, this really is a very important election for the Libertarian Party, because our ballot access – that is to say, our future as a functioning political party – depends on it. If we fail to get at least three percent of the Presidential vote in this election, it's back to square one. Reestablishing party status will require tens of thousands of signatures statewide. As no petitioning effort of this magnitude has ever been completed in the state of Ohio without significant reliance on paid petitioners, it means raising literally hundreds of thousands of dollars. That's the dark side.
The light side is that if we get at least three percent of the Presidential vote in this election, we secure ballot access for our party through 2024. Libertarian candidates will have easy access to every partisan race in the state, up to and including governor, and our 2024 national ticket will automatically appear on the ballot.
Now tie this happy scenario to the positive factors of a strong showing by our 'non-celebrity' national ticket and by candidates around the country like Harrington and Rainwater. I'm not going to begin to predict what our national ticket will be in 2024. But many of us can think of some names that will be interested, names that national political reporters and editors already know and respect, names that also have serious, strong Libertarian credentials. If we retain ballot access, we could be well-positioned to capitalize on increasing dissatisfaction with the offering of the legacy parties.
And there's yet another reason to not vote for the legacy party candidates. The incumbent President does have his share of fanatical supporters, for reasons that surpass all understanding. But I'll venture a guess that most people voting for him – and almost everyone voting for his legacy party opponent – are voting against the opponent much more than they're voting for the names on the box they're checking. So yes, once again, the Republicans and the Democrats are offering us crappy candidates. And a vote for either one of them is a vote for more crappy candidates in the future, because the two legacy parties will continue to offer us crappy candidates until we refuse to vote for them.
And now, it's all on us. We have to vote for our Libertarian ticket of Jo Jorgensen and Spike Cohen. We have to talk them up, to family, to friends, on social media, everywhere and every chance we get. We have to secure our party's future and tell the legacy parties that we won't accept their table scraps any more. Early voting is open now. My family and I are still planning on voting together on election day, just as we traditionally have.
So get up off your butts! Because this really could be ...

i. Accepting Federal matching funds is a controversial concept among Libertarians. Many of us make a principled argument that since the money comes from theft (taxes), it's immoral to accept it. My personal fantasy is that we qualify for the money, accept it, and then donate it to one or more worthy charities – with the full benefit of publicity. Can you imagine our 2024 Presidential candidate standing on a dais with officials of some worthy organization like Doctors Without Borders, explaining why we can't keep the money but want to see it go to good use? Can you imagine the media coverage that would generate?

# Libertarian Party of Ohio Endorses Robert Leist for Ohio 72nd
###
9/22/2020 – Libertarian Party of Ohio endorses Robert Leist for Ohio State Representative in the 72nd District against current State Representative and scandal-ridden former House Speaker Larry Householder.
Earlier this year, Householder was indicted on federal charges stemming from a historic $60 million bribery scandal which includes many other Ohio Republican Party members and operatives. Householder was also stripped of his House Speaker title, despite showing no indication he will step down as a state representative.
“Ohio and the 72nd District need someone who can restore public trust, protect the rights of its citizens and not be bound to corporate interests,” said Libertarian Party of Ohio Political Director Patrick Glasgow in reference to the decision to endorse Leist, “ Robert (Leist) has shown through the years his dedication to his community, the state, and individual freedom and we encourage voters to Write In Robert Leist on November 3rd.”
Leist is a registered Libertarian, but is running a write-in campaign as an Independent, as the filing deadline for partisan candidates to appear on the ballot has passed. His team plans to run an active campaign given the circumstances to give the voters of Ohio’s 72nd District a principled option and put Larry Householder out of a job.

## To LP, or Not to LP; That Is the Question
#### By John Focker
Editors Note: John wrote this piece in 2018 for the LPO Website and its a great reflection as we draw closer to the 2020 election.
> First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.
>
> Mahatma Gandhi
One of the age-old controversies in the liberty movement is this: “Is it better to work from within the two-party system, or from without?” This issue came to the fore late last year and early this year when a former candidate for the Libertarian Party presidential nomination opted to seek a US Senate seat in Missouri as a Republican. More on how that turned out later.
Recently, a piece on Reason Magazine featured a debate on this issue, with Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) taking the pro-duopoly side and former Massachusetts governor and LP vice-presidential candidate William Weld taking the pro-Libertarian Party side.
Now, obviously, since you've reached this piece on the webpage of the Libertarian Party of Ohio, and since the writer is an almost 20-year activist in this party, it's safe to assume that I prefer to work outside the legacy duopoly.
But what are the ramifications of fighting our good fight outside the two-party system instead of battling for a place within it? In making his argument in the Reason piece, Massie pointed out that there are two members of the House of Representatives right now with consistent libertarian credentials, himself and Justin Amash (R-MI). (Many Libertarians would take issue with Massie's claim that he or Amash are 99 and 99/100th percent pure, but that's another issue; most Libertarians would agree that both have fairly good records and stand head-and-shoulders above any of their current colleagues.) Of course, Libertarians also know quite well that Rep. Ron Paul (R-TX) championed consistently libertarian causes in Congress for a generation. To date, no one has been elected to Congress, or to statewide executive office in this country, as a Libertarian. Only Republicans and Democrats need apply.
If the Massies and Amashs in Congress were the norm, this would be a clear indication that the way to advance the cause of liberty would be through the duopoly – or at least through the red half of the duopoly. But they're not. They, and the handful of other members of Congress who sometimes support pro-liberty causes, are almost as much of an anomaly as Gary Johnson will be, should he beat the odds and be elected to the US Senate this fall from New Mexico.
Much more typical of the experiences of libertarians who try to work through the duopoly is that of Austin Petersen, the former LP candidate to whom I referred above. Petersen ran a quite professional campaign and raised an amount of money that would have been quite impressive – for a Libertarian campaign – and finished third in the GOP primary with 8.3% of the vote.
The American legacy parties aren't designed to accommodate ideological challenges. Truth be told, they aren't designed to accommodate ideologies at all. They are, rather, huge marketing machines designed to produce and sell a product to the American people, just like Ivory Soap. Excepting a few niche markets, where an Amash or a Massie can be elected, the system is designed to frustrate principle in favor of selling that product and securing “market share,” i.e., seats in political office. Petersen ran up against a new kind of Big Red Machine, and that machine kicked him to the curb and nominated a bland candidate who won't challenge either the voters or the status quo. For a principled libertarian – for a person of any kind of principle – running in one of the major parties is to attempt to swim with a brick in each hand.
Proponents of the work-within-the-system philosophy argue that the deck has always been stacked against insurgent parties or independents, and always will be. Yes, it has been, certainly as long as I can remember. But I'm not ready to concede that it always will be.
When I started with the LPO, late in the last century, Libertarian candidates rarely exceeded one percent of the vote. Our presidential ticket never did. In 2016, Johnson and Weld garnered better than three percent of the vote here in Ohio, and that was without the party label (thanks to draconian measures by the GOP) and following a long and expensive petitioning drive that left few resources to promote the ticket. Our statewide candidates have shown similar improvement in the last three statewide elections.
In addition, I can see signs that the “market” is changing, little by little. Social media and other online avenues are undermining traditional media, providing new, and often much cheaper, ways for insurgent candidates to get the word out. Maine recently became the first state to embrace instant runoff voting, also known as ranked choice voting, a method which combats the “wasted vote” argument and is much fairer to insurgents. And this is just my opinion, but I believe that more and more voters are waking up to the calcification of the two legacy parties and their complete inability to entertain new ideas or find new ways of working. Someday, I think, their patience with the two old parties will be exhausted, and more and more of them will be ready to consider a different option.
Now all this being said, I'm not going to condemn the pro-liberty fighters who do choose to work through the establishment parties. Well, let's be honest; they work through the GOP. There is a so-called “Democratic Liberty Caucus” that parallels the Republican Liberty Caucus (RLC), but they have even far less influence in their party than the RLC in theirs. But I have friends in the RLC, and I consider them colleagues with whom I disagree on strategy and means but not, fundamentally, on goals, principles, or ideology. I think a case can be made that the two threads, inside and outside the GOP, have a better chance of influencing that party than either would have alone, faint though I find that hope to be. And I make sure to remind them, whenever I can, that if they ever tire of pushing that rock up the hill against the inertia of their party, there will be a home for them in the LP.
And don't think the duopoly, especially the GOP, hasn't noticed our growth, small as it's been so far. I've been around the LPO since the two establishment parties ignored us, and the media and most voters laughed at us, steps one and two on the Gandhi path. Five years ago, Gov. Kasich and the Republicans in the legislature passed one of the harshest ballot access laws in the country, then the Republicans engineered a bogus challenge to our candidate for governor and spent literally hundreds of thousands of Ohio tax dollars defending against a lawsuit challenging the law and the Secretary of State's rulings on it. And I've heard a rumor – which I can neither confirm or deny – that the GOP has legislation standing by to reduce the vote percentage needed to retain ballot access from the current three percent to one percent. Supposedly, this is out of fear that the LPO's candidate for governor will get that three percent, the Green Party's candidate will not, and that therefore the GOP would face a presidential election in 2020 with a Libertarian on the ballot but without a Green. Step three achieved! They're fighting us!
Look, folks, advancing the cause of liberty is never going to be easy. Step four on the Gandhi path is still before us. The present two party system is a century and a half old. It has tremendous weight, a huge majority of the attention of traditional mass media, and inconceivable resources in money and manpower. It's going to resist change, if for no other reason than because thousands of people are entrenched within it for their gold, power, and glory. Maybe we only have a tiny chance to win. But it's still, as far as I can see, the best chance we've got.
