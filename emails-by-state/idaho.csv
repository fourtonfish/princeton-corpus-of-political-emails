"Alex,
It’s a lonely business to be the only Democratic legislator in North Idaho! We need your investment to elect more Democrats in North Idaho that represent their constituents at the statehouse. Shari Williams is a business owner, former teacher, inventor, dental professional, AND she’s running for Senate in District 4 in Coeur d’Alene.
She’s in a key battleground race against radical conservative Senator Mary Souza. Shari has lived and worked in Coeur d’Alene for the
last several decades and she understands her community cares about quality education, accessible healthcare, and a strong economy.
Her opponent is a right-wing radical that is known for sponsoring legislation that would waste taxpayer dollars and harm everyday Idahoans. Her recent bills include:
● The anti-transgender bill that mandates genital exams for high school girls to participate in sports
● Legislation that would have allowed a fellow GOP legislator to operate a youth treatment program without a license
● A proposal to eliminate Medicaid Expansion
● One of the Medicaid Expansion restrictions that would have required women to get approval from a family doctor to see an OB/GYN
And, that’s just the tip of the iceberg! If you’re worried about the harmful legislation that the GOP will bring in the upcoming legislative session, please invest in Shari Williams. Can you donate $25, $50, or $100 to help Shari get elected? Your contribution will be split between Shari and the IDLCC, which is focused exclusively on getting Democrats elected to the Idaho Legislature. All Idahoans will benefit when we have experienced people who understand the needs of their community in the statehouse.
Thank you for helping us to make Idaho a better place to live, work and play!

District 16 candidate Colin Nash is up against an opponent that is spreading coronavirus conspiracy theories, discredited anti-vaxxing claims, and other misinformation. We need your help to get Colin Nash elected to the Idaho legislature.
Idaho families don’t need more conspiracy theories, radical extremism, and fear-mongering. They need real solutions to the problems that they are experiencing on a daily basis. Colin cares about accessible healthcare, quality education, affordable housing, and security for Idaho families.
When a coronavirus vaccine is created and tested to be effective, we need people in the legislature who will do everything in their power to help Idahoans get vaccinated. Idahoans deserve to have representatives like Colin Nash who believe in using science, facts, and data to make the best decisions for their communities.
Your investment of $25, $75 or $150 will help Colin Nash make it over the finish line this November. We cannot have another conspiracy theorist that doesn’t care about facts in the legislature in the midst of a global pandemic. Colin has proven that he will advocate for what you care about when he is elected, but we need to send him sprinting into victory.
Thank you for helping to keep Idahoans safe and healthy by donating to elect Colin Nash to the Idaho legislature.
Best,

"Dear Alex,
Representative Steve Berch. There is simply no candidate that works harder or has more passion to better our state. Knowing that we’ll never have adequately funded education or fair tax policy in Idaho until we break the GOP supermajority, Steve ran 5 times and knocked on tens of thousands of doors. Finally, his hard work paid off, and in 2018 he won his west Boise district where no Democrat had ever won before. Since then, Steve Berch has been a powerhouse: fighting to protect school funding and curriculum standards, working across the aisle on a long-overdue review of sales tax exemptions that cost the state billions every year, protecting Medicaid expansion and voting rights.
But this is still a tough district for Democrats, and this year, the GOP has plans to take it back. Steve’s well-funded GOP opponent Pat McDonald has quite a record from his former stint in the Legislature:
* He voted twice to block healthcare for the gap population
* He supported legislation seeking the takeover of federal public lands
* He sponsored a draconian law on non-compete agreements, landing Idaho in national news for stifling start-ups and preventing employees from seeking better jobs
* He voted to ban any local government from raising the minimum wage
* He voted to force colleges to allow guns in classrooms
Steve Berch and his supporters worked so hard to win this seat – we can’t let it slip back into the hands of someone who has proven he will put special interests ahead of Idahoans’ needs. Steve is doing a wonderful job in the Legislature, but we need your help to keep him there!
If you are able to, please help by giving here. Your contribution to the Idaho Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee (IDLCC) will be split between Steve Berch’s campaign and the IDLCC, which is focused exclusively on getting Democrats elected to the Idaho Legislature.

"Alex,
In the closing weeks of the 2020 legislative session, the pandemic had arrived, and we knew we were heading into a crisis that would impact not only Idahoans’ health but also our economy, jobs, and education system.
So what did Idaho’s GOP-dominated Legislature do during these critical weeks? Certainly nothing useful, like beefing up our soon-overwhelmed unemployment insurance system, preparing schools for remote learning, or addressing property taxes. Instead, they rammed through the nation’s most extreme anti-transgender legislation, ignoring warnings from the Attorney General and Idaho’s leading employers that the bills were unconstitutional, would hurt our economy and would cost the state a fortune to defend.
Now Idaho’s businesses and workers must pay the price. California law bans taxpayer-funded travel to states that discriminate against LGBTQ Americans, and the GOP just landed Idaho on the banned list. This is the last thing our struggling restaurants and hotels need after months of COVID shutdowns. It means California’s public universities likely can’t send teams to compete in Idaho, and conference planners will be reluctant to book events in Idaho because California state employees can’t come. Plus the NCAA is considering pulling March Madness from Idaho, potentially costing $15 million in lost business.
The myth of the GOP as the “pro-business, fiscally conservative” party has been shattered once again. We need your help to elect legislators that won’t set our money on fire in service of discrimination crusades. For decades, GOP legislators have forced taxpayers to pay millions to defend clearly unconstitutional right-wing legislation that was passed to indulge various ideological fixations. We just can’t afford the GOP’s antics any longer.
You have the power. The IDLCC is focused exclusively on getting Democrats elected to the Idaho Legislature. Your contribution to the IDLCC will help us replace GOP legislators that are landing body blows on our economy. We have great candidates running to restore common sense to the Statehouse but we need your help to get them there.

"Dear Alex,
Remember Senator Dan Foreman of Moscow? When he wasn’t making news screaming at Planned Parenthood volunteers, introducing bills to make abortion a death penalty offense and opposing funding of higher education, he was trying to stop our kids from learning about climate change. For your enjoyment and edification, scroll down to see an actual email he sent to a mom who wrote him asking for climate change to be included in the science curriculum. Make sure you read to the end – you just can’t make this stuff up!
Thankfully, Senator David Nelson (D-Moscow) defeated Foreman in 2018, and we have been blessed with two years of sensible, hard-working, pro-education representation. But this year, Foreman is running to take back that seat. We cannot let this happen, but don’t think we’re safe. This seat has changed hands every year since 2014, and will be tough for us to hold. We need your help to do it.
If you are able to, please help by giving here. Your contribution to the Idaho Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee (IDLCC) will be split between Dave Nelson’s campaign and the IDLCC, which is focused exclusively on getting Democrats elected to the Idaho Legislature.
Keep that social distancing going, and stay safe!
Thank you,
Rep. Ilana Rubel, House Minority Leader
P.S. Dan Foreman’s email to my friend Terri:
Dear Terri,
Thank you for contacting me about your global warming/education concerns. Here is my honest reply. The global warming theory is nonsense. The vast majority of credible scientists say so. In fact, there is mounting evidence the planet is starting to cool. Remember the big email scandal involving the top scientific experts in Europe supporting the global warming initiative. Do you remember the discovered and well publicized emails from these scientists in which they admitted global warming was a hoax – part of an agenda to grow government in the name of saving the almighty environment? Global warming ranks right up there with Al Gore’s phony ozone scare. I hope the legislature enacts legislation to eliminate this ridiculous nonsense about global warming and climate change from all our textbooks. The left-wing has created a new religion, and it’s called ‘the environment.’ I wish they would pay more attention to real religion. Maybe we could make real progress in this country. People need to wake up and rediscover critical thinking once again. Too many people are falling victim to these scams foisted on us all by liberal zealots with ulterior motives. In closing, Idaho is a conservative state, and therefore has a conservative legislature. You should not be surprised we will not support liberal constructs and obsessions. Our legislature does a great job of separating the wheat from the chaff. Global warming is chaff. Thanks again for your contact.
Sincerely, Dan Foreman, Senator - District Five
Once again, you can help keep Dan Foreman out of office by giving today. Thank you!

"Dear Alex,
Idaho has the highest rate of child marriage in the nation, so in 2019 I brought a bill setting a minimum age of 16 for marriage. Rep. Julianne Young (R-Blackfoot) led the opposition, saying parental consent is sufficient, even for a child as young as 12 or 13. My bill was narrowly killed on the House floor by Young and her allies, making Idaho a laughing stock in the national news. She then brought a bill this year to ban transgender Idahoans from changing their gender markers, a bill the Attorney General said is unconstitutional, violates an existing court order, and is estimated to cost the state over $1 million. And as if all that weren’t bad enough, she voted 3 times to block funding for Idaho’s universities and voted to strip millions in funding from county public health and emergency response services in the middle of the pandemic.
Luckily, we have a great Democratic candidate taking her on. Travis Oler is an Army veteran, a small business owner and a farmer, and he is stepping up to bring reasonable representation to his district. Travis is tired of our state’s resources being poured into senseless culture wars, and will work to advance useful causes, like funding public schools and higher education. But we need your help to get him into the Legislature!
If you are able to, please help by giving here. Your contribution to the Idaho Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee (IDLCC) will be split between Travis Oler’s campaign and the IDLCC, which is focused exclusively on getting Democrats elected to the Idaho Legislature.

"Dear Alex,
Have you met Renee Love? She’s truly inspiring, and she’s running for my old seat in the Idaho House representing District 5 – a seat we lost when I retired in 2014. This year, we will take it back - with your help.
Renee Love is a first-generation college graduate and small business owner. She is a Ph.D-holding scientist, teaches geology at the University of Idaho, and would bring some heavy-duty I.Q. to the Statehouse. She understands the financial pressures facing vulnerable Idahoans. And unlike her opponent, a Republican incumbent who voted for every reckless tax cut for the wealthy that left our schools, universities, healthcare system and every other vital service desperately underfunded, Renee is committed to supporting education and health care so that everyone in Idaho has a chance to succeed and climb out of poverty just as she did.
North Idaho used to be a Democratic stronghold, but now we have only one seat (Sen. Dave Nelson). We have a real opportunity this year to build our strength back, and we are incredibly fortunate to have a candidate like Renee to make it happen. Please help us turn this opportunity into reality.
Your contribution to the Idaho Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee (IDLCC) will be split between Renee Love’s campaign and the IDLCC, which is focused exclusively on getting Democrats elected to the Idaho Legislature.

"Alex,
Hi! This is retired Representative Phylis King, and I want to tell you about a race that is very near to my heart. Pat Soulliere, Democratic Candidate for District 20, is in the fast lane to pass Joe Palmer in his race for the Idaho House. Pat needs your help! Can you donate $50, $100 or whatever you can afford to get him across the finish line?
Republican Joe Palmer chairs the transportation committee, where I served for 12 frustrating years. Did you know that Idaho has 187 structurally deficient bridges, and that 898 bridges are past their expected structural life? You can thank Palmer, who won’t fund our crumbling infrastructure unless the money comes out of our education budget. Did you know Idaho bans carpool lanes on our highways? Thank Palmer for that too – he single-handedly blocked legislation allowing carpool lanes, eliminating a cost-effective and eco-friendly path to reducing traffic. Did I mention Palmer also voted to block Add the Words, gut Medicaid expansion, preserve child marriage, and defund our universities?
Fortunately, Democrat Pat Soulliere has stepped up. Pat is a Micron employee who has been working hard knocking doors since last year because he is committed to improving the quality of representation in our Statehouse. He is a proud supporter of education, health care access and responsible infrastructure maintenance. Pat can turn District 20 blue but he needs your help. Please give what you can – we have an incredible opportunity this election year to bring badly needed change.
Your contribution to the Idaho Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee (IDLCC) will be split between Pat Soulliere’s campaign and the IDLCC, which is focused exclusively on getting Democrats elected to the Idaho Legislature.

"Dear Alex,
You probably saw the news that Gov. Little just signed into law the most anti-transgender legislation in America. This session, despite facing the greatest health crisis in modern history and off-the-charts unemployment, Idaho’s GOP legislators had no interest in boosting hospital capacity or helping laid-off workers. All they wanted to do was pass one divisive bill after another - banning affirmative action, banning transgender athletes, banning abortion with no exception for the health of the mother.
The good news is, it’s an election year. There’s a race we want to highlight for you this week where we have a great shot at replacing one of the worst offenders. Rep. Barb Ehardt (R-Idaho Falls) has been tireless in undermining education, health care and civil rights, and is a driving force behind much of the awful news coming out of the Legislature:
·  Ehardt voted three times to block funding of higher education
·  She demanded that universities shut down diversity / inclusion programs
·  She sponsored the transgender athlete ban
·  She tried to stop high schoolers from learning about climate change and sex ed.
·  She voted to gut Medicaid Expansion and ballot initiative rights.
We have a strong candidate running against her who can win, but needs our help. Miranda Marquit is smart, hard-working, and focused on issues that actually help Idahoans, like jobs, education and affordable housing. Winning this race would be a huge step away from the destructive culture wars that have set Idaho back decades. With your help, we can do this!
We know times are tough right now, and we wouldn’t ask if it weren’t important. So, if you can, please help by giving here. Your contribution to the Idaho Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee (IDLCC) will be split between Miranda’s campaign and the IDLCC, which is focused exclusively on getting Democrats elected to the Idaho Legislature.
And most of all, stay safe!

"Alex,
We thought we’d seen the worst of this special session when armed protesters broke a gallery door, a riot broke out in committee, police showed up, and Ammon Bundy was wheeled off to jail in a swivel chair. But don’t let all this distract you from truly dangerous legislation being passed. Yesterday, the GOP supermajority passed HB 6, a bill that provides immunity from COVID-related liability even for grossly negligent conduct.
Please help us elect Democratic legislators who put the safety of the public ahead of the wish lists of lobbyists. Can you help now with a donation of $25, $100 or $200 as we head into the critical final months of this election cycle?
This bill was opposed by teachers, labor groups, and senior citizen advocates (among many others) because they know it will make schools, workplaces, and senior care facilities more dangerous. When there is no possibility of accountability, things get sloppy.
The Republican legislature has used the heaviest hand of government to strip you of your right to recover if you are harmed by grossly negligent behavior. Every Democrat voted no, but we were overrun.
With less than 70 days left to flip Idaho seats, every donation makes a difference, and the time is now. Your investment in the IDLCC is an investment in protecting your rights and the rights of generations to come.

Representative Jake Ellis is working hard in District 15 to bring reason to the Statehouse, but he is under attack and he can’t win his election without your help.
Idaho GOP Chairman Tom Luna recently announced that “taking back” District 15 is their top objective this November. They are raising mountains of cash and using it to fund attacks on Jake and other Democratic legislators. Here’s Tom Luna sharing his plans to execute a coordinated strategy to take out Democrats in District 15. And Speaker Bedke just announced he’s putting in another $10,000 to help them do it.
Representative Jake Ellis was a firefighter for 27 years, a union leader and a civil rights advocate before he entered public office. And since being elected, he has worked across the aisle and powerfully continued his lifelong record of public service. Jake has been a strong advocate for funding quality education, increasing healthcare access, reducing property taxes, and equal rights for all. In 2018, he worked his tail off with an army of volunteers to narrowly flip a seat that had never before gone blue, and it will not be easy to hold it with the full force of the Idaho GOP against us. Making matters worse, the pandemic has shut down door-knocking and house parties, two key campaign elements for Democrats running in red-leaning areas. That means district-wide mailings are more essential than ever, and they cost money. But with your help, we can do it. We worked way too hard to gain this ground to give it up now.
Your contribution to the Idaho Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee (IDLCC) will be split between Representative Jake Ellis’s campaign and the IDLCC, which is focused exclusively on getting Democrats elected to the Idaho Legislature.
Idaho Democrats don’t have anywhere close to the big corporate PAC money bankrolling the other side. We are accountable to the people, but we need your help to get our candidates across the finish line. When the stakes are this high, even a few dollars can be the difference between keeping Democrats in office or giving more power to the Republican supermajority.

"Dear Alex,
There’s a seat up for grabs in North Idaho and Dulce Kersting-Lark (D) is the perfect candidate to turn it blue!
Dulce is running for the D5 Legislative seat formerly held by Paulette Jordan until the GOP grabbed it in a 2018 squeaker. Thankfully, GOP incumbent Bill Goesling is retiring. Maybe he got tired of writing hate mail to the university presidents, trying to defund higher education and attacking diversity programs. None of that none with Dulce! She is a young, bright candidate who will represent D5 with enthusiasm, dedication, and integrity.
We have a great opportunity to win this seat. With your help, we can do it. Please make a contribution of $25, $50, $100 or whatever you can afford to support Dulce and the IDLCC as we work to restore balance and reason to the Idaho Legislature.
Dulce has lived on the Palouse since 2011 and works as a historian and executive director of the Latah County Historical Society. She co-chairs the Moscow Women’s Giving Circle, is an active member of the Moscow Central Lions Club and a board member of the Idaho Association of Museums. Her upbringing in rural America gives her a deep appreciation for those who build the region’s economy through agriculture, timber, and more. Her top issues include providing a fair wage for hardworking Idahoans, ensuring all Idaho students have access to a quality education, and reforming our outdated and unfair tax system.
We have a solid path to victory in this race and Dulce is doing everything she can to tip the scales in our favor. We need your support to get her across the finish [[URL REDACTED]] contribution will be split between Dulce’s campaign and the Idaho Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee (IDLCC), which is focused exclusively on getting Democrats elected to the Idaho Legislature.

"Alex,
Today, for the first time in 6 years of public service, I felt unsafe doing my job as a legislator.
The first day of the special session began with hundreds of unmasked protestors from all over the state forcing their way into the House Gallery, breaking glass doors and packing committee rooms with little to no social distancing or masks.
I chose to excuse myself from committee today in light of completely unsafe conditions, and was met with heckling from a packed, unmasked, hostile crowd. We should never be forced to choose between doing our jobs and the safety of our families and community, as we were today.
Will you help us elect more Idaho Democrats so the 2021 legislative session isn’t overpowered by the extreme Republican legislators? Click here to donate today.
GOP leaders allowed this government-sponsored super-spreader event to proceed, undermining months of efforts to stop community spread. We need to get our economy back on track, our kids safely back in school and our people back to work, but that can’t happen until we get this virus under control— that starts in the Statehouse.

"Alex,
Campaigning on land, water, and the airwaves, Dr. Teresa Borrenpohl is an exceptional candidate. She took on the House race in District 3, a seat that has been beet-red for decades, and through hard work and strong messaging has made it really competitive. She is highly educated, extremely qualified, and has dedicated her career to reducing barriers to education. Dr. Borrenpohl would be an incredible asset in the legislature. We need your investment to get her to the statehouse!
When the coronavirus pandemic hit and she couldn’t knock on doors to meet constituents, she came up with a creative solution to meet voters. Dr. Borrenpohl kayaked along the Spokane River, campaigning to the many people she found recreating on the water!
You may remember her opponent, Representative Tony Wisniewski, who made news when he ridiculed a plan to provide social and emotional support for at-risk kids, advocating that parents should take their kids “out behind the woodshed, if necessary.” While Dr. Borrenpohl created a program in North Idaho that increased go-on rates by 25%, her opponent voted three times against funding higher education. He’s also supported anti-mask, conspiracy-fueled protesters in North Idaho.
The choice here could not be clearer. Since 2018, I’ve been the only Democrat in the Legislature representing North Idaho, and I’m ready for some company! We want to power Dr. Borrenpohl through the home stretch and send her to the Statehouse. Can you donate $25, $50 or $100 to help get her elected?
