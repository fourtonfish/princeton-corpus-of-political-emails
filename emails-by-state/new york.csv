Chairman Jay Jacobs shares his thoughts on the leadership of Governor Cuomo during this time of crisis in the Newsday Op-Ed Section.
The Cuomo leadership impact
By Jay Jacobs
The Siena Research Institute poll released Monday confirmed what many have been saying for the past two weeks: Andrew M. Cuomo, right now, is a hot commodity. Virtually, wherever you go, people want Cuomo for president — not in 2024, but today.
As a “Draft Cuomo 2020” account popped on Twitter, the governor has made it clear, most recently on his brother Chris’ news show, that he is not running for president. So, why is Cuomo’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak creating such a political paradigm shift? What is the shelf-life of his dramatic rise in popularity? And, how long can it last, and where could it take him?
Americans are starving for leadership. The example set by President Donald Trump makes that hunger even more acute. All of a sudden, experience is no longer a bad word. The “establishment” is what is mobilizing to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. And, many voters have a newfound respect and appreciation for government. Say what you want about Cuomo, but he has spent his career as a part of that establishment, acquiring years of experience IN government.
This crisis hasn’t changed Cuomo. It has changed the public’s appetite for what Cuomo has always been: a strong, effective and competent leader. It seems that now, as happens in history from time to time, the man may have found his moment.
Eighty-seven percent of New Yorkers approve of Cuomo’s handling of the COVID-19 crisis. Seventy-one percent have an overall favorable impression of him. His popularity extends across all regions, religions, ethnicities, and age groups. Even an impressive 42% of Republicans favor him now. Popularity built on extraordinary leadership in times of crisis is not that unique. After the 9/11 attack, then-Mayor Rudy Giuliani’s approval rating reached 79%. Then-President George W. Bush’s popularity peaked at 92% after the attack, and was a steady 80% to 90% for four months before it began to plummet.
The question is how sustainable is Cuomo’s popularity and is it deep enough to last to his next reelection in 2022 or the next presidential race in 2024? I would argue that Cuomo’s newfound popularity is much deeper than that of either Mayor Giuliani or President Bush.
For one, this crisis is much more personal to each and every citizen. As horrendous and consequential the 9/11 attack was on America, that is just what it was — an attack on our nation and our city. While it was extremely personal to those who lost loved ones, for society as a whole, for the most part, the physical threat did not hit every member of that society. Bush’s and Giuliani’s popularity after 9/11 was built on admiration and national pride.
In the 9/11 attack, our emotions were built around “us.” In this crisis, it’s much closer to home — it’s about “me and mine.” Whether it is the fear of getting ill or dying, the fear for the well-being of loved ones, or the fear of financial hardship, this threat is way more personal. Many people trust that Cuomo will get them through and out of this ordeal, safe and secure. His popularity is built on that trust — a much deeper, enduring emotion than admiration.
Cuomo, like FDR during the Depression, trusted the public with the truth. In turn, they have grown to trust and rely on him in a deeply personal way. Through the use of empathy and compassion, Cuomo has personalized the crisis, articulating clearly his view that the value of life trumps economic or other considerations. For a populace both personally scared and uncertain, his words not only reassure, but they uplift and call us to a higher purpose. Cuomo’s leadership is not just strategic or tactical — it is moral. And, moral leadership, in times like these, builds a strong bond of trust between the leader and those he leads.
Bush depleted his 9/11 popularity by breaking faith with the bipartisan spirit born in the attack and wasted it over the hunt for weapons of mass destruction. Giuliani’s popularity faded in the transparency of his ambition tied to the successes that built his popularity in the first place.
No one can predict the future. Surely, Giuliani saw his very differently. For Cuomo, if he continues to lead New York with common sense, honesty and purpose, retaining the public trust he has earned, the future will take care of itself.

STATEMENT FROM CHAIRMAN JAY S. JACOBS
John Lewis was an American hero. His peaceful work to secure equal treatment under the law for all people during the Civil Right’s movement saw him physically attacked and arrested more than 40 times. Such adversity never deterred John Lewis. The courage, compassion, and leadership he demonstrated during his illustrious career as a public servant is second to none. John Lewis made the world a better place, and losing such an heroic figure during these divisive times is particularly painful. Our thoughts and prayers go out to his family during this difficult time.

Remarks from Chairman Jay S. Jacobs
Dear Democrats,
Super Tuesday is upon us! Between now and Election Day, we must work nonstop to implement our plans for victory and turn out every Democrat to vote — and it won’t be possible without the commitment and action of supporters like you.
There is so much on the line this November. And as Democrats, we refuse to stand by and let Republicans go after our values and dismantle everything we’ve worked so hard to build and protect. We don’t need to look any further than right here in New York to see what a difference having Democrats in office makes. Here in New York, we are investing in a $3 billion bond to fight climate change, are continuing to develop historic infrastructure projects like the new Mario M. Cuomo Bridge, and we are supporting middle class families by increasing paid family leave to implementing paid sick leave. We are also expanding free college tuition to more New Yorkers and will continue to fight for middle class tax cuts. We are fighting the new wave of hate and anti-Semitism with increased funding and introducing the Hate Crime Anti-Terrorism Act. Enough is enough.
Later this spring, New York Democrats will also be participating in this ever-important process to select our own delegates for the National Convention. Together, we will defeat Donald Trump and take back the White House.
Onwards,
Jay S. Jacobs

19 years ago, America suffered its worst attack, killing almost 3,000 innocent people. As time progresses we have a responsibility to remember and honor our fellow Americans who perished in this heinous act of terrorism, and we must also remember and honor the sacrifices by the members of the FDNY, NYPD, Port Authority, members of Flight 93, as well everyone who contributed to the search, rescue, and cleanup of Ground Zero. As New Yorkers it is our responsibility to advocate for and ensure that the first responders and survivors of 9/11 continue to receive the resources they deserve and require.
We must also never let the progression of time erase the memory of what we as a nation endured. Nor should we forget the lessons learned – that a unified America can defeat any enemy, even it takes the form of a virus, by finding our strength in unity, courage through empathy, and hope through our collective resiliency.

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo urges Washington to support the Americans First Law that the Governor first proposed on May 10th, the law states that a corporation cannot be eligible to receive government funding if it doesn't maintain the same number of employees that the corporation had before the COVID-19 pandemic. See the full text here.
Andrew Cuomo: What Washington must do to protect workers
By Governor Andrew M. Cuomo
The covid-19 pandemic has thrust us all into unprecedented circumstances, even more dire than the economic collapse of the Great Recession. As the nation plots a course forward, I fear that mistakes of the past are being repeated — errors that put the well-being of large corporations above that of working Americans.
The latest monthly jobs report was staggering: Businesses across the nation shed more than 20.5 million jobs in April. The U.S. unemployment rate has climbed to 14.7 percent — the highest rate on record since tracking began in 1948. One in every five Americans employed before the onset of the pandemic are out of work. Ten years of unprecedented economic gains in our state were wiped out in a single month.
Over the past decade, New York generated 1.3 million jobs, reaching a record high of 8.3 million private-sector jobs in February, as unemployment fell to a record low. Wages increased by 47 percent, and we raised the minimum wage to $15 per hour. Now, our state is looking at a multiyear recovery, one longer and with a deeper decline than we faced after the Great Recession.
As states throughout the country take steps to reopen, Washington must not repeat mistakes of the past. Large corporations receiving government bailouts must be held accountable for doing right by their workers.
So far, Washington has been in repeat mode.
The $2 trillion federal assistance package passed in March included hundreds of billions of dollars to prop up large corporations without questioning their commitment to workers or business practices. I understand the desire to keep businesses from failing, but doing so makes sense only if government funds are being used to support workers — not to enrich executives and shareholders.
But that's what is happening. The Federal Reserve and Treasury Department are jointly launching a $500 billion bond-buying program without any requirement that companies receiving aid retain workers or limit distributions to their executives and shareholders. This is even more shocking given that the Federal Reserve's principal mandate is to promote maximum employment.
Think about that prospect — $500 billion in federal financial support with no strings attached. That's great for executives and shareholders! That's great for the largest corporations in this country, those that have increased their debt by close to $4 trillion since 2009, while enriching themselves via stock buybacks and massive dividends. Meanwhile, workers get laid off and taxpayers foot the bill for unemployment benefits, Medicaid, food assistance and other public supports.
We've seen this movie before. This is what Washington did after the 2007-2009 recession caused by mortgage fraud. Homeowners lost life savings and equity in their homes while bankers made fortunes. Taxpayers bailed out corporations and executives while those same taxpayers' home equity was lost. The injustice of our system was glaring and obnoxious. Bankers that had reaped record profits by selling what turned out to be toxic securities were then handed a taxpayer-funded parachute for a soft landing during the crash. This inequity is poised to happen again, as corporations are planning their next bailout scheme with their friends in Washington.
Even as the number of coronavirus cases in our country continues to rise, some corporations are looking for a chance to increase their profit margins on the backs of Americans they have laid off. Corporate leaders are telling Wall Street analysts that this is an opportunity to rethink their businesses and permanently reduce their payrolls as they get lean. This would mean significantly higher structural unemployment for longer periods. It would mean more spending by governments at all levels to keep Americans fed, housed and healthy. Ultimately, this stands to result in greater inequality, greater income disparity and potentially greater social unrest.
Our country cannot let that happen again. Washington must put in place stronger requirements for corporations that take federal bailout money. Corporations that do so must hire back at the same levels that they employed before the onset of the public health crisis and subsequent economic fallout. Federal financial assistance that refinances corporate balance sheets shouldn't be the catalyst for bigger corporate profit margins at the expense of workers.
Washington's bailout rule should be simple and clear: No government support if you don't hire back all of your pre-pandemic workers.
Government should not subsidize corporate plans to lay off workers, while any corporate layoffs must require a return of any government subsidy. The path forward for all of us will be difficult enough. Corporations are driven by profits. It is the role of government to ensure that those profits do not come at the expense of the Americans who are the backbone of our economy.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: 10/26/2020
NEW YORK STATE DEMOCRATIC CHAIRMAN CONDEMNS NEW YORK CITY SERGEANTS BENEVOLENT ASSOCIATION FOR IRRESPONSIBLE STATEMENTS
NEW YORK CITY, NY: Jay Jacobs, Chairman of the New York State Democrats, has released the following statement:
“Sunday’s statements from the Sergeants Benevolent Association that ‘the Democratic Party has abandoned police officers, encouraged violence and lawlessness’ along with stating that ‘People are being murdered in Democratic run cities’ is wrong, offensive, provocative, irresponsible and unbecoming of officers sworn to serve and protect the citizens of New York City. It is one thing to hold certain political views and favor a particular candidate for office. That is every citizen’s right. It is quite another to actively and publicly campaign for that candidate while in uniform and on duty. If the SBA doesn’t see anything wrong with that, they have lost all credibility and claim to the use of good judgment.
“Supporting the Black Lives Matter movement and the overwhelming majority of honorable, decent, courageous, hardworking police is NOT a mutually exclusive exercise. Democrats have always been supportive of law and order so long as it comports with the concept of ‘equal justice under law.’ Taking a knee with peaceful protesters in order to defuse what could have been a volatile situation represents the best of decent, honorable police work. That the leadership of the SBA would compare that to using police equipment to actively campaigning for a candidate for public office demonstrates how disconnected they are from the basic norms of civil society as well as the decency of the members they purport to represent.”

New York State Democratic Committee
STATEMENT FROM CHAIRMAN JAY S. JACOBS
People in this state, people in this country, need to decide where they stand. One way or another. The sidelines just will not do. Not for candidates, not for elected officials – of any party – and not for the average citizen. When candidates and political leaders can organize and participate in a public event that features the hanging-in-effigy of a life-sized figure of our state’s governor – or any political leader, for that matter – then something is very wrong with our body politic. As we have learned through history, disgusting displays, like the one that took place outside the Hamburg Town Hall near Buffalo, NY this past weekend, are often just precursors of potentially even more and real violence coming in the future. We can engage in legitimate debate on even the most contentious of issues. But when that debate devolves into the display or violent, hateful symbols, like the hanging in effigy of our Governor, decent people everywhere need to speak out. And, the candidates and elected officials who attended, remained or participated in that rally need to apologize.

""The passing of Sheila Comar is a loss not only for Democrats but for all New Yorkers. Sheila served as Washington County Democratic Chair for more than a decade. I had the privilege of working closely with Sheila when she chaired the Executive Committee of the New York State Democratic Committee. Her straightforward approach, integrity, vision, sense of humor and wit helped forge the way through many turbulent challenges. She represented not only her county, the north country and rural New Yorkers. She represented a much needed political philosophy of bringing people together to discover common ground, forge solutions and bring people together. Sheila will be sorely missed, now more than ever.""

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Libertarian Party of New York Enrollment Surpasses 20,000; Reflects Voters’ Frustration with Politics-As-Usual
Albany, New York, October 22, 2020 – The Libertarian Party of New York (LPNY) is proud to announce that active and pre-registered Libertarian enrollment has once again skyrocketed, increasing from 17,193 as of September 17 to 20,090 today. This reflects a net increase of 2,897 new Libertarian enrollments, and an increase of 16.8% statewide in just thirty-three days. Over the same period, Greene County reflected the highest percentage growth – 52% - while Suffolk County reflected the highest month-to-month increase in numbers, from 1,523 in September to 1,764 in October.
Between November 2019 and October 2020, the number of active and preregistered Libertarians statewide has increased from 12,404 to 20,090 – a 62% increase in just under eleven months. In the same period, Greene County again had the highest percentage increase – 262% - while Suffolk County again had the highest increase in numbers, from 1,056 to 1,764.
LPNY Chair Cody Anderson stated, “The message is clear: New Yorkers are tired of government playing an outsized role in their lives. They have seen the disastrous economic and fiscal consequences of the Governor’s ham-handed and overbearing response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Voters who have chosen to stay in New York, despite having been taxed to the brink of ruin, are flocking to the only political party committed to promoting personal responsibility, individual liberty, smaller government, and fiscal restraint.
“We welcome all New Yorkers whose livelihoods have been crushed by the force of the omnipotent state, and whose voices have been ignored by the two-party system. We call upon our enrollees and all New Yorkers disgusted by the electoral choices before them to send a message to Albany and Washington by voting on the Libertarian line for President and their other elected representatives this November!”

Fellow Libertarians,
The recent resignation of Jim Rosenbeck, our former State Chair, has created a vacancy on the Interim State Committee (ISC). The ISC plans to fill that vacancy at its next meeting on April 26th, using the following process:
\- Potential new members will be nominated to the vacancy and given a brief opportunity to speak
\- The nomination process will close, and the ISC will vote on all the candidates
\- As any candidate must receive a majority vote, multiple rounds of voting may occur.
If you are interested in filling this position, and are an enrolled Libertarian residing in New York State, please send a letter of interest, stating any qualifications you wish to share with the ISC. I ask that you email these to me at [[URL REDACTED]] by 5pm on Wednesday, April 22nd, so they can be shared with and reviewed by the ISC prior to our deliberations.
In Liberty,

Libertarian Party of New York,info@lpny.org,LEGISLATIVE ALERT - Your Immediate Action Is Needed!,"Governor Cuomo Revives Ballot Access Hurdles in Budget Legislation
Dear Friends and Fellow Libertarians,
Your Right To Vote Libertarian Is ONCE AGAIN Under Attack!
LATEST DEVELOPMENT: A source tells us Andrew Cuomo has SUCCEEDED in inserting the same recommendations into the 2020 New York State Budget to that were created by the unconstitutional ""Public Finance Commission"" and struck down by Justice Ralph Boniello on March 12, 2020. He rightly tossed out the law that established a ""Public Finance Commission"" with the purported intent of creating a system of publicly financed campaigns. Its other goal: to destroy the Libertarian Party and other minor parties in New York by changing the state's ballot access requirements to be among the most restrictive in the nation. Now, Governor Cuomo and the legislature's leadership are trying to bring the commission's recommendations BACK TO LIFE by using the current COVID-19 crisis and budget legislation as cover.
Call your representatives in the state Assembly and Senate today and tell them that the legislature must reject the budget legislation based on the Commission's December 1, 2019 report that undermines a New York voter's choice of political party. It is essential that this is shot down now, or there may be no more Libertarian Party after November, 2020.
We need you to do the following, now:
1\. Look Up The Contact Information For Your Representatives In The NY State Assembly and Senate.
Click here to look up your elected representatives. Enter your full address and then click ""submit."" When the window reloads, select the results tab labeled ""State"" and then scroll down to see your representatives in the Assembly and Senate, along with their contact information. (Note that you may need to close an email signup form in order to see the address lookup box.)
2\. Call Your Representatives.
Tell Them: ""My name is ________ and I am a constituent of Assembly Member/Senator ___________. I want more political choice in New York State, not less. I am counting on you to demand that the legislature reject the proposal to insert into the budget the Public Campaign Financing Commission's recommendations making New York's ballot access laws for grassroots parties like the Libertarian Party among the worst in the nation. NY voters want and deserve diverse political parties that reflect their perspectives.""
3\. Email Governor Cuomo, Leader Stewart-Cousins, and Speaker Heastie
Click here to email Gov. Cuomo and tell him no!
Email the Leaders of the Legislature:
Speaker of the Assembly Carl Heastie: [[URL REDACTED]]
Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins: [[URL REDACTED]]
""Dear Gov. Cuomo/Speaker Heastie/Leader Stewart-Cousins,
My name is ________ and I am writing to tell you I just got done calling my representatives in the state legislature to tell them I want more political choice in New York State, not less. As a legislative leader, it’s time for you to reject Gov. Cuomo’s attempt to insert the Public Campaign Finance Commission’s recommendations into the state budget legislation. Those recommendations will make New York's ballot access for minor parties like the Libertarian Party among the most restrictive in the nation, and create a public financing plan that spends taxpayer dollars needlessly and frivolously at a time when the state cannot afford it. NY voters want and deserve real campaign finance reform and diverse political parties that reflect their perspectives.""
4\. Tell Us All About It!
Reply to this email, tell us who you contacted and how it went.
5\. Spread the word.

Libertarian Party of New York,info@lpny.org,BALLOT ACCESS: An Urgent Message from the LPNY Chair,"Ballot Access: An Urgent Message from the LPNY Chair
Dear Alex,
As you are no doubt aware, Governor Cuomo and the legislature added a rider to the FY2021 NYS State Budget to increase our ballot access requirements from 50,000 votes on the Libertarian gubernatorial line every four years, to the greater of 130,000 votes or 2% of total votes cast on the Libertarian presidential or gubernatorial line every TWO years. Further, if we lose ballot access, a minimum of 45,000 verified signatures will be required to earn a line on the ballot - triple the current independent petitioning threshold. WE MUST NOT LOSE BALLOT ACCESS.
We are fighting in Federal court against this latest attempt to silence the voices of minor political parties in New York. We believe our case is strong, but as with all litigation, the outcome is not certain. Our best chance to keep ballot access is to whip 160,000 votes on the Libertarian POTUS line. The LPNY Executive Committee met immediately following the state committee organizing meeting and allocated resources to fund a Get Out The Vote (GOTV) campaign for our Presidential candidate and other Libertarian candidates across the state.
WE NEED YOUR HELP TODAY. We are looking for volunteers to help make automated GOTV phone calls. All you need a computer, a phone, and a little bit of free time to help the LPNY keep ballot access! We have scheduled a series of Zoom training sessions to get volunteers familiar with the phone bank platform and mechanics. Once you sign up, you will be sent a link to a Zoom meeting to train for the phone banking effort.
Any amount of time you can commit to helping us phone bank will be of enormous help. Our ballot access hangs in the balance. Please click the button below to volunteer for this urgent effort.
Click here to volunteer to GET OUT THE VOTE!
Our legal battle surrounding ballot access will continue. Please consider donating as generously as you are able to support both our GOTV effort and our ballot access lawsuit by clicking below.

I personally thank you in advance for donating your time, money and talent to our survival.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Libertarian Party of New York Denounces “Shampoo Licensing” Under Consideration By New York State Legislature
Albany, New York, September 1, 2020 – The Libertarian Party of New York (LPNY) strongly denounces the occupational licensing of “shampoo assistants” currently under consideration by the New York State Assembly (A06578) and Senate (S08862). Proposed by Assemblypersons Woerner (D-AD113) and McDonald (D-AD108) and Senator Metzger (D-SD42), the licensure legislation will require 500 hours of training for individuals who wish to earn a living by shampooing hair at a beauty shop – a measure that will force the average “shampoo assistant” to spend over $13,000 at a state-accredited beauty school, put over $350 million into the hands of special interests, and further line the State’s coffers using revenue licenses that only serve as a de facto tax on those who can least afford it.
At the same time, two members of the Secretary of State’s Division of Licensing Services’ “Appearance Enhancement Advisory Committee” pushing for the proposal – Michelle D’Allaird Brenner and Anthony Civitano – own beauty schools and stand to benefit personally from the implementation of these proposals. A third member of the Board, Anthony Fiore, also owns a school and could potentially profit, as well. It should also be noted that five of the nine seats on the Board of Licensure – all of them held for tradesmen in the “appearance enhancement” industry - are currently vacant, leaving industry workers without a voice on the Committee.
LPNY Chair Anthony D’Orazio stated, “The Libertarian Party of New York holds firm to the principle that individuals have the inalienable right to earn an honest and peaceful living through the free and voluntary exchange of goods and services. To require a person to have a license and hundreds of hours of training to perform a task that they have been doing themselves since childhood is an affront to the intelligence and livelihood of the working-class New Yorkers this proposal affects. We call upon both chambers of the State Legislature to drop consideration of this proposal immediately.”

Libertarian Party of New York,info@lpny.org,"Important Announcement Regarding 2020 Libertarian Party of New York
 State Convention and Organization Meeting","Important Announcement Regarding 2020 Libertarian Party of New York State Convention and Organization Meeting
Due to another Executive Order from Andrew Cuomo and “changing COVID guidance” imposed upon the hospitality industry, the venue hosting the Libertarian Party of New York’s State Committee Convention and Organization Meeting has informed the Convention Oversight Committee that the venue cannot host more than 50 people in their meeting room.
As much as we would like to fight this in court, the timing, uncertainty, and expense of litigation against a tyrannical and overreaching government with unlimited resources makes a court battle impractical. Our collective respect for private property rights prevents us from “just showing up” and holding a meeting in a manner contrary to the venue’s wishes and causing them harm vis-à-vis government force. Therefore, we have made the difficult, but necessary, decision to pivot to a virtual convention format.
* Zoom will be used by elected committee members, as well as those candidates seeking to fill vacancies and Executive Committee positions.
* The LNC’s parliamentary platform, Porcupine, will be used for voting and making parliamentary motions.
* All convention proceedings will be livestreamed online to the public.
We will be testing the system extensively over the coming weeks to ensure a smooth execution. We are disappointed with this outcome, but the Convention Oversight Committee is focused on conducting the Organization Meeting within the statutory window while minimizing uncertainty. We believe this is the best path forward and accept all responsibility for this decision.
As there is no longer a venue to compensate, there will be no fees for participation in this fully virtual convention. Voluntary donations to the LPNY are requested and welcome, as there will still be costs associated with hosting the Porcupine application and upgrading the LPNY Zoom plan to accommodate the format we will need to use.
People who have already paid convention fees will be contacted individually regarding the issuance of refunds and the possibility of donating a portion of their fees back to the LPNY. If you have made a hotel reservation, please contact the hotel directly at 914-576-3700 ext. 237 to cancel.
On convention weekend, we wholeheartedly encourage State Committee members who live in proximity to each other to gather at an appropriate location with adequate Internet and space to enjoy the camaraderie of your fellow committee members.
Thanks in advance for your understanding and assistance in making this convention a success. Please contact either one of us directly if you have any questions or concerns.
Sincerely,
Jeff Motta

New York is allocated 48 delegates in total, the fourth largest delegation overall. All Libertarian Party presidential campaigns were responsible for submitting to the New York Board of Elections a list of delegates and alternates from each of New York's 27 congressional districts, leaving 21 delegates and their alternates. to be selected by the LPNY.
Last September, the LPNY put out a public call for statements of interest from those who wished to represent New York at the LP National Convention. Once it became clear that Jacob Hornberger was the de facto winner of our primary, the LPNY was able to proceed with selecting those interested delegates and alternates who were not already selected by the Hornberger campaign. The list of primary delegates and their alternates selected by the LPNY appears below.
The list of Hornberger delegates and alternates as it currently stands also appears below. The Hornberger campaign is reaching out to their delegates and alternates to confirm interest. We expect the Hornberger campaign to release an updated list soon. We will share it with you as soon as it is available.
In Liberty,

Libertarian Party of New York,info@lpny.org,Statement from the Chair on Petitioning and COVID-19 Virus,"Statement from the Chair
﻿on Petitioning and COVID-19 Virus
Dear Friends and Fellow Libertarians,
I am thankful to have had the opportunity to speak with many of you directly over the past few days. We are experiencing unique and unpredictable times as a party and as a nation. First and foremost I wish to extend my thoughts and prayers for each of you and for your families as we navigate our way through the challenges presented by the COVID-19 virus.
Your concerns about changing political petitioning and filing deadlines are shared not only by Libertarians but across political party lines. Please be assured that the LPNY Interim State Committee will respond to changes in the political deadlines in a thoughtful and timely manner that places the utmost importance on the health and safety of our membership.
As you may already know, Governor Cuomo has signed an Executive Order that reduces the minimum number of petition signatures required to 30% of the normal thresholds. The petitioning period will now end at 5 p.m. on Tuesday, March 17 — two weeks earlier than planned. We have not heard if the deadline for filing petitions will similarly be changed.
Fellow Libertarians have expressed important concerns about this abbreviated petitioning period and the impact that this will have on both candidates for public office and judicial district candidates for our 2020 state committee. Local leaders are being hit with “what if” queries that we and other political parties are simply unable to answer quickly at this time. I assure you that we will strive to keep you informed and manage these challenges.
As we move forward, I ask that we all prioritize health and safety over politics. In the big picture political parties and elections are concerns that pale in comparison to people and families. Lets not rush and act impulsively in an attempt to meet the governor’s new petitioning deadline. We will sort these issues out after we have collectively defeated the COVID-19 virus. That is our number one priority.
Thank you,
Jim Rosenbeck
Chair, Interim State Committee

 Commission""!!!","A win for the LPNY, voter choice and government oversight!
COURT HANDS LPNY BALLOT ACCESS WIN!
Dear Alex,
Today, voters in New York were handed a huge victory in the fight for ballot access!
The New York Supreme Court on Thursday tossed out the law creating a commission that recommended the creation of a system of publicly financed campaigns, and with it the provisions making it harder for minor parties to get on the ballot.
[[URL REDACTED]]
Justice Ralph Boniello wrote in the ruling the measure creating the panel is ""an improper and unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority.""
We agree! Minor political parties in New York State, including the Libertarian Party, the Working Families Party, and the Green Party, would have needed to qualify for ballot access twice as often, with three times as many votes as previously required!
New York voters whose beliefs and priorities do not align with the two major parties would have been irreversibly disenfranchised. And $100 million of taxpayer money would have been handed to the Republican and the Democratic politicians. This is a huge victory for voter choice, government oversight, and the LPNY!
Make no mistake, King Andrew will appeal this decision. So we need to be ready to fight for our survival, yet again. We need your support more than ever!
Please make a donation to the LPNY's ongoing efforts to fight for ballot access and increase enrollment across the state. Or, consider making a monthly pledge to become a Supporter of Liberty, and have your name proudly displayed on the Pledge Honor Roll on the LPNY website!
In Liberty, and with sincerest thanks,
The Libertarian Party of New York

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Libertarian Party of New York Doubles Statewide Enrollment; Reflects Voters’ Frustration with Two-Party System
Albany, New York, September 23, 2020 – The Libertarian Party of New York (LPNY) is proud to announce that active Libertarian enrollment has skyrocketed to 17,193 voters statewide. This is more than double the number enrolled at the time Larry Sharpe’s historic gubernatorial campaign won the LPNY ballot access in 2018.
Also, the number of active enrolled Libertarians statewide increased from 13,481 to 17,193 between November 25, 2019 and September 17, 2020 – a 39% increase in just under ten months. In the same period, Clinton County had the highest percentage increase – 189% - and Suffolk County had the highest number - 467 - of additional enrollees. Suffolk County also has the highest total enrollment of any county, coming in at 1,523 active Libertarian enrollees.
LPNY Chair Anthony D’Orazio stated, “The Libertarian platform has wide, common sense appeal. Disenfranchised voters here in New York – literally, the least free state in the nation – are embracing the ideology of the only party that is focused on personal responsibility, individual liberty, smaller government, and fiscal responsibility. Governor Cuomo’s botched response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the ensuing economic and fiscal fallout have sent people to us in droves. The timing of our enrollment increases drive home that obvious truth.”

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Green Party and Libertarian Party File Joint Lawsuit Fighting Ballot Access Restrictions
Albany, New York, July 28, 2020 – The Green Party of New York (GPNY) and the Libertarian Party of New York (LPNY) filed a Federal lawsuit today in the Southern District of New York to invalidate restrictive ballot access provisions passed as a rider to the FY2021 State Budget.
Since 1936, minor political parties in New York have been required to obtain 50,000 votes for their gubernatorial candidate every four years in order to achieve and maintain ballot status. The GPNY achieved ballot status in 2010, and has since maintained it, while the LPNY achieved ballot status in 2018.
In an act of blatant political retribution against the Working Families Party (WFP), Governor Cuomo’s hand-picked “Public Campaign Finance Commission,” led by state Democratic Party Chair Jay Jacobs, recommended in December 2019 that not only should the requirement to achieve and maintain ballot access be increased from 50,000 votes to the greater of 130,000 votes or two percent of votes cast, but also that the qualifications should occur every two years, at the gubernatorial and presidential elections. At the same time, signature requirements for independent nominating petitions were recommended to be increased threefold. After the legislature declined to modify the recommendations, they automatically became law twenty days later.
Ultimately, the legislature’s abdication of its law-making powers to this executive commission caused a NYS Supreme Court judge in Western New York to declare the commission and all its actions unconstitutional. Bent on settling political scores, and under the cover of the COVID-19 crisis, Governor Cuomo and the legislature subsequently re-enacted the ballot access provisions in Part ZZZ of the FY2021 State Budget, leaving minor political parties in NYS facing an uncertain future.
The lawsuit filed today by attorneys James Ostrowski and Michael Kuzma on behalf of the GPNY and LPNY names NYS Board of Elections Co-Chairs Peter Kosinski and Douglas Kellner, Commissioner Andrew Spano, and Co-Executive Directors Todd Valentine and Robert Brehm as Defendants. The complaint alleges infringement upon First and Fourteenth Amendment rights to organize, identify, and vote for minor parties under the United States Constitution, and that the new voter and petitioning requirements are therefore unconstitutional.
""Whatever justification they may use for it, the choice by Gov. Cuomo and the Legislature to create new and onerous ballot-access thresholds this year is clearly designed to eliminate any threat of competition, preserve the state's anemic and uncompetitive electoral system, and satisfy their corporate paymasters. The Green Party stands with all other affected political parties, as well as the voters of New York State, who deserve a robust and expansive democracy,"" said Peter LaVenia, Co-Chair of the GPNY.
Anthony D'Orazio, Chair of the LPNY added, ""Under cover of the COVID-19 pandemic and the already byzantine New York State budget process, the Governor and his advisors decided to destroy political competition in New York and preserve power for the two major parties. The Libertarian Party stands with all minor political parties of New York in fighting against such tyranny.""

Dear Alex,
A year ago, ballot access was new to the LPNY. Few county organizations existed to spread the message of Liberty. Today, we have increased statewide Libertarian enrollment by nearly 40%, and more than half the counties in the state are now represented by a recognized county organization, with many more in the process of becoming recognized. We have the critical mass to get 160,000 votes on the Libertarian line in the November 2020 Presidential election and maintain ballot access. But we need your help.
Your monthly Liberty Pledge to the LPNY will help us build and maintain momentum from now through November, and beyond. Please consider pledging to the LPNY at one of the following levels:
* Sustaining Pledge - $5/month
* Bronze Pledge - $10/month
* Silver Pledge - $25/month
* Gold Pledge - $50/month
* Platinum Pledge - $75/month
* Diamond Pledge - $100/month
Our total pledge goal is $5,000 per month. If everyone reading this message pledges just $10 each month, we will easily exceed this goal. If you are able to give at a higher level, please do—we will exceed our goal faster.
In return for your pledge, you'll receive recognition on the LPNY website as a supporter of the LPNY and the Liberty movement here in New York.
Please click below to make your pledge, and to help the LPNY keep what we have worked so hard to attain.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Libertarian Party of New York Urges Congress to Deschedule and Legalize Cannabis
Albany, New York, September 2, 2020 – The Libertarian Party of New York (LPNY) urges Congress to consider and approve pending Federal legislation to deschedule and legalize cannabis. Since its inception in 1971, the Libertarian Party of New York has been the only political party consistently and vociferously denouncing the war on drugs as a failure, and advocating for the legalization of cannabis in order to take more victimless crimes off the books and to support all citizens’ rights to self-ownership.
The “MORE Act” (S2227/HR3884) - which stands for Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act – has sat fallow in Congress since July 2019. According to the summary on [[URL REDACTED]], the bill also makes other changes to existing law, including:
* replacing statutory references to marijuana and marihuana with cannabis,
* requiring the Bureau of Labor Statistics to regularly publish demographic data on cannabis business owners and employees,
* making Small Business Administration loans and services available to entities that are cannabis-related legitimate businesses or service providers,
* prohibiting the denial of federal public benefits to a person on the basis of certain cannabis-related conduct or convictions,
* prohibiting the denial of benefits and protections under immigration laws on the basis of a cannabis-related event (e.g., conduct or a conviction), and
* establishing a process to expunge convictions and conduct sentencing review hearings related to federal cannabis offenses.
* establishing a trust fund to support various programs and services for individuals and businesses in communities impacted by the war on drugs,
* imposing a 5% tax on cannabis products and requires revenues to be deposited into the trust fund.
Now, with election season well underway, and Libertarian candidates across the nation nipping at the heels of the duopoly parties, the bill has suddenly gained bipartisan support in the House of Representatives. Somewhat ironically, the bill’s sponsor in the Senate is none other than Vice Presidential candidate Kamala Harris (D-CA), whose atrocious past record on criminal justice, particularly drug crimes, exposes her move to support the ideas that have been championed by the Libertarian Party for decades as nothing more than political pandering.
With the exception of the proposed tax and government-administered trust fund, the LPNY supports all remaining facets of this legislation, and we implore Congress to consider and pass the pending legislation, and send it to the White House for signature.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Judge Declares Republican’s Petition Invalid Due to Lack of Libertarian Authorization
Oswego, New York, April 20, 2020 – The Libertarian Party of New York (LPNY) announced today that Oswego County Supreme Court Judge Scott J. Deleconte flatly invalidated Claudia Tenney’s attempt to appear on the Libertarian ballot line in the June primary for New York Congressional District 22. In his ruling, Judge Deleconte determined that Tenney, a Republican, “did not file the proper certificate of authorization…under the rules of the Libertarian Party”, and declared her designating petition invalid.
After the LPNY Interim State Committee declined to issue Tenney a certificate of authorization, known as a Wilson-Pakula authorization, a purported “22nd Congressional District Nominating Committee of the Libertarian Party” signed and submitted an improper certificate of authorization to the New York State Board of Elections (NYSBOE). Two general and specific objections from enrolled Libertarians were subsequently submitted to the NYSBOE, both arguing that the authorization was invalid because it violated the LPNY’s rules.
Jim Ostrowski, an Erie County attorney, represented the LPNY and the objectors named in this case. “We are pleased with the judge’s decision because it recognizes the importance of election law and party rules in protecting minor parties from being invaded by the two major parties. Of course, the Libertarian Party welcomes non-Libertarian candidates who wish to appear on our line and are willing to adhere to party rules and procedures to obtain a valid and proper Wilson-Pakula authorization.”
At the same time Tenney filed her lawsuit, Ostrowski filed a lawsuit in Oneida County Supreme Court seeking an order to declare Tenney’s certificate of authorization invalid. The hearing of the Oneida case was stayed pending the outcome of the Oswego case and is awaiting adjudication.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Libertarian Party of New York Moves Convention Online; Denounces Cuomo’s Ever-Changing “COVID Guidance”
Albany, New York, September 3, 2020 – Due to yet another Executive Order from Andrew Cuomo and “changing COVID guidance” forced upon the state’s hospitality industry, the Libertarian Party of New York (LPNY) has been forced to move its Organization Meeting and Convention, originally to be held on September 26 and 27 in New Rochelle, New York, to a virtual format. The venue hosting the Libertarian Party of New York’s Convention and Organization Meeting informed the Convention Oversight Committee this morning that the venue cannot host more than fifty people in their meeting room, leaving the LPNY with no choice but to move the convention proceedings online.
Cuomo’s most recent dictatorial decree came about as a direct result of a stunning loss handed to his Administration earlier this month in Federal court. Judge Glenn Suddaby, in the Northern District, ruled in favor of two couples who booked weddings at Arrowhead Golf Club, in Akron, rejecting New York’s limit of 50 people at wedding receptions in restaurants during the coronavirus shutdown. The lawsuit was initiated by Lucas James, co-owner of the golf course.
In response, and in keeping with his vindictive nature, Governor Cuomo removed the judge’s legal objections and tightened the rules even further, ending differentiation between indoor and outdoor events and limiting all “social gatherings” statewide to fifty people. Furthering the cycle of the New York’s economic and social hardship, hotels and event venues were forced under pain of license forfeiture to cancel their contracts with guests. These businesses have already suffered irreparable damage under the force of a tyrannical government at a time when an already hard-hit hospitality industry can afford it the least.
LPNY Chair Anthony D’Orazio stated, “The Libertarian Party of New York denounces Governor Cuomo’s continued interference in people’s rights to travel, peacefully assemble, and exercise personal responsibility. His continued vice-tightening on the state’s businesses must end immediately. We once again call upon both chambers of the State Legislature to immediately revoke the limitless Executive Powers they granted Emperor Cuomo nearly six months ago.”

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Libertarian Party POTUS/VPOTUS Candidates Achieve Ballot Access In All Fifty States; LPNY Presidential Electors Accepted By NYS Board of Elections
Albany, New York, September 10, 2020 – The Libertarian Party of New York (LPNY) is pleased to announce that Jo Jorgensen, Libertarian Candidate for President of the United States, and her running mate, Jeremy “Spike” Cohen, have achieved ballot access in all fifty states, plus the District of Columbia. This is the second consecutive presidential election in which the Libertarian Party’s POTUS/VPOTUS ticket has earned nationwide ballot access, and the fifth time since the party’s founding in 1971.
Commensurate with Jorgensen and Cohen being accepted for appearance on the ballot in New York State, the LPNY has also submitted to, and had accepted by, the New York State Board of Elections its list of Presidential electors.
LPNY Chair Anthony D’Orazio stated, “The Libertarian Party of New York is proud to submit its list of Presidential electors who will represent the Libertarian Party and New York State in the Electoral College. Citizens are seeking another choice that decreases the size and scope of government outside the two party system. The Libertarian Party represents the only principled third choice in American politics. Our ever-increasing enrollment and electoral returns are reflective of that reality.”

Libertarian Party of New York,info@lpny.org,Pledge Now to Support the LPNY's Future,"### Pledge Now to Support the LPNY's Future
Dear Alex,
The top priority of the Libertarian Party of New York is to maintain ballot access. Late last year, Andrew Cuomo’s hand-picked commission voted to change the law and make it more difficult for minor parties to stay on the ballot. Now, in order to maintain ballot access, we will need more than 160,000 votes on the Libertarian line in the November 2020 Presidential election.
We can do that.
Here is our plan to increase Libertarian outreach efforts statewide:
* Continue voter re-enrollment efforts
* Expand email campaigns
* Improve social, print, and outdoor media planning
* Highlight key Liberty-oriented issues, such as 2A, unfunded mandates, property taxes, bail reform, and prohibition, at the state level
But to do all this we need your help!
A monthly Liberty Pledge to the LPNY will help us build and maintain momentum from now through November and beyond. Please consider making a monthly pledge to the LPNY at one of the following levels:
* Bronze Level - $10/month
* Silver Level - $25/month
* Gold Level - $50/month
* Platinum Level - $75/month
* Diamond Level - $100/month
Our total pledge goal is $5,000 per month. If everyone reading this email pledges at the Bronze Level, we will easily exceed this goal. If you are able to give at a higher level, please do - we will exceed our goal faster.
In return for your pledge, you'll receive recognition on the LPNY website as a supporter of the LPNY and the Liberty movement here in New York.
Please click below to make your pledge, and to help the LPNY keep what we have worked so hard to attain.
Pledge to the LPNY
In Liberty,
Jim Rosenbeck

We need your help now to help us secure our ballot access.
Earlier this year, Governor Cuomo and the NY State legislators raised the number of votes needed by third parties to retain ballot access. We need to receive at least 160,000 votes in the Presidential race in order to stay on the New York ballot for the next two years. If we lose our access, it requires a bare minimum of 45,000 verified signatures to earn a line on the ballot.
IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE DO NOT LOSE BALLOT ACCESS THIS YEAR
We are looking for volunteers to start phone banking to get out the vote on the Libertarian line. Our first online training session will be this Thursday, October 8, if you can’t make it, we will be having a second training session in the very near future.
Any amount of time you can commit to helping us phone bank will help. The top 3 volunteers with the most calls will win a campaign t-shirt!

Rob Arrigo,liberty4ny@gmail.com,Does your vote matter in NY? Here are the facts.,"The last time a Republican Presidential Candidate won the state of New York was 1984...
Does your vote matter in NY? Here are the facts.
The fact is Biden is going to win NY.
No Republican Presidential Candidate has won New York since 1984.
According to [[URL REDACTED]], Joe Biden has a 99% chance of winning our state and is projected to receive ~65% of the vote.
I know what you are thinking.
The polls were wrong in 16’ so what makes them so right this time?
Consider the facts.
The Republican candidate for President has not won the State of New York since 1984; that’s 36 years
In 2016, Hillary Clinton won New York State with 4.5 million votes to Donald Trump’s 2.8 million votes.
In 2012, Barack Obama won New York with 4.4 million votes to Mitt Romney’s 2.4 million.
In fact, the last time a Republican Presidential Candidate came close to winning New York was 1988, when Michael Dukakis edged out George H.W. Bush by just 300k votes.
BUT THIS TIME IS DIFFERENT?
No not really.
Consider the party enrollment changes over time.
In 1996, New York had 3 million registered Republicans and 4.7 million registered Democrats.
Since that time the Democrats have added nearly 2 million more voters to the roll.
While the Republican Party has shrunk by 200,000 voters.
The reality is that in NY, the outcome of the election is a forgone conclusion.
But do not fear, there is a way to make your vote count in November.
Andrew Cuomo is trying his best to kill third parties, like ours, in NY. Cuomo and his cronies set an extremely high bar for ballot access.
To qualify, the Libertarian Party needs to obtain ~160,000 votes to maintain access to the ballot.
Believe it or not, that total is well within reach.
In 2016, Gary Johnson received 178,000 votes.
But we need your help to hit our goal.
This year, MAKE YOUR VOTE COUNT by Voting Libertarian on November 3rd.
In Liberty,
Rob Arrigo
Member-At-Large,
Libertarian Party of New York Executive Committee
P.S. Help us maintain ballot access by voting Libertarian on Nov 3.

"Cody Anderson, LPNY Chair",liberty4ny@gmail.com,Libertarian Party Ballot Access Under Threat in New York,"Governor Andrew Cuomo is trying to throw us off the ballot
Libertarian Party Ballot Access
﻿Under Threat in New York!
Dear Friend,
Governor Andrew Cuomo is attempting to permanently kick the Libertarian Party off the ballot!
We need your help!
We can defeat Cuomo's decree that threatens democracy in our state by getting ~160,000 votes for the Libertarian Party candidate for President.
In April of this year during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Cuomo inserted into the state budget a law to effectively kill third parties.
The law increases the number of votes and signatures it takes to get onto the ballot and to stay on, securing a ballot line on which to nominate candidates.
The best way to make your vote count this election, is to vote Libertarian in November.
I think we must recognize that New Yorkers’ presidential votes do not matter in 2020.
This is not an insult. Joe Biden is favored to win the state with 99% probability and the latest poll has Biden up 31 percent over President Trump in New York.
Under our electoral college system, New York’s 29 electoral votes will all go to Joe Biden.
The number of votes Biden and Trump receive makes no practical difference.
There is only one way New Yorker's presidential votes matter, and that is supporting ballot access for the Libertarian Party.
In 2016, Gary Johnson recieved over 176,000 votes in New York. This makes our goal well within reach, but we need your help!
Vote Libertarian on November 3rd and help us keep ballot access!
In Liberty,

Green Party of New York,enews@gpny.org,"Statement on the Murder of George Floyd and Solidarity Protests
 Around New York State","Green Party of New York State
Friend --
The Green Party of New York is outraged by the murder of George Floyd by former officer Derek Chauvin while fellow officers menacingly kept distressed and concerned by-standers at bay. The evidence is unequivocal that Chauvin and the other former officers killed Floyd and all of them need to be arrested, charged, and convicted for their crimes. The arrest of Derek Chavuin, while a welcome development, must be followed with the same for the other former officers.
Police murders of black and brown men and women continue with immunity while local, state and Federal politicians either offer ineffective solutions or worse yet are complicit in perpetuating the racist policies that allow these heinous acts to keep happening. The police force in Minneapolis, and across America, is shot through with racism and classism. While holding the offending officers accountable is absolutely necessary, and community control of police is an improvement, in the end the police must be dismantled as part of dismantling racist and classist systems of oppression.
The Green Party of New York stands in solidarity with our Green Party comrades in Minneapolis/St. Paul who have organized and participated in peaceful protests over the past few days including GPUS national co-chair Trahern Crews. During this COVID-19 pandemic we believe we are obliged to protect ourselves and take responsibility for public safety but our voices will not be silenced when injustice and racism result in the murder of our black and brown brothers and sisters. We encourage Green Party members to participate in solidarity actions in the coming days according to your comfort level.

Green Party of New York,enews@gpny.org,Fight for the Green Party’s Right to Exist!,"Green Party of New York State
Friend --
Simply put we are in the fight of our lives.
Earlier this week, the Green Party of New York and the Libertarian Party of New York jointly filed a Federal lawsuit in the Southern District of New York to invalidate restrictive ballot access provisions submitted by Governor Cuomo as an 11th hour rider to the FY2021 State Budget and under cover of the COVID-19 crisis, without any opportunity for meaningful debate.
For more than 80 years, political parties in New York have been required to obtain 50,000 votes for their gubernatorial candidate every four years in order to achieve and maintain ballot status. The GPNY achieved ballot status in 2010, and has since maintained it.
But to quash any future challenges from his political Left, Cuomo has raised the ballot access threshold from 50,000 votes to the greater of 130,000 votes or two percent of votes cast, and a party must qualify every two years, at both the gubernatorial and presidential elections.
At the same time, signature requirements for independent nominating petitions were recommended to be increased threefold.
Combined, the two provisions make it extremely difficult to 1) maintain ballot status and 2) regain ballot status once it is lost.
Can you give generously to help the Green Party defend our ballot line?
Having ballot status substantially reduces the number of signatures that Greens need to run candidates. It also allows our state committee to nominate Green candidates for statewide office without petitioning. Maintaining ballot status is key to the Green Party’s survival!
The new thresholds were the brainchild of Cuomo’s hand-picked “Public Campaign Finance Commission,” led by state Democratic Party, Chair Jay Jacobs. The Democratic-controlled Legislature subsequently declined to modify the recommendations last December and they became law. In March, a New York State Supreme Court judge in Western New York determined that the Legislature’s abdication of its law-making powers to the commission was unconstitutional and they were thrown out. But bent on settling political scores, Cuomo succeeded in pushing the harmful ballot access provisions into the budget, leaving third parties in New York facing an uncertain future.
If you value the Green Party and the right of New Yorkers to have a choice of candidates, please donate.
The onerous ballot-access thresholds pushed through by Cuomo and the Legislature are clearly designed to eliminate any threat of competition.
The lawsuit alleges infringement upon our First and Fourteenth Amendment rights to organize, identify, and vote for minor parties under the U.S. Constitution.
The Green Party is going to incur financial costs in defending this lawsuit. We are going to incur additional costs for a major get-out-the-vote campaign this fall.
We’re in the fight of our lives. Can you help us?
Thank you!
In solidarity,

We’d like to invite you to join us tonight for a special Facebook live stream on the election and why it’s so important to vote Green, especially here in New York. Party co-chairs Gloria Mattera and Peter LaVenia will be talking about that and how you can help us save the Green ballot line.
Why not invite a friend to join in watching with you this evening, too? The more people watching that know why it’s so important to vote Green, the better.
That way we can get the word out that Gov. Cuomo and the Democrats changed the law this year so that if we don’t get at least 150,000 votes here in New York, the Green Party will disappear from the ballot.
See you tonight!
PS.
We’re asking Greens to pledge to vote for Howie Hawkins and Angela Walker.

Governor Cuomo and the leaders of the State Legislature are attempting to use the current COVID-19 crisis to destroy the Green Party in New York by changing our state's ballot access requirements to be among the worst in the nation.
Call your representatives in the state Assembly and Senate today and tell them that the legislature must reject the budget legislation that undermines a New York voter's choice of political party. It is essential that this is shot down now, or there may be no more Green Party after November, 2020.
Visit our action page now to call and email Gov. Cuomo, Speaker Heastie and Leader Stewart-Cousins, along with your local legislative representatives!
On March 12, 2020, Justice Ralph Boniello tossed out the law establishing a commission that had a secret purpose of eliminating New York's third parties. But Cuomo and the legislature's leadership are trying to bring it BACK.
Don't. Let them. Act today!

Friend \--
In 2020, Green candidates for President/Vice President, Congress, the state legislature, and local offices in New York are standing up with one voice for systemic change that puts everyday people and planet over entrenched power and profits.
From the top of the ticket on down, Green candidates are truly independent and advocate for innovative ideas that are the necessary choice that New York voters need. They are united behind the Green Party’s Four Pillars of Peace, Ecology, Social Justice, and Democracy -- and the original authentic Green New Deal! This includes:
* Conversion to 100% clean, renewable energy by 2030 with a public employment program to rebuild a more sustainable infrastructure in energy, waste, agriculture, manufacturing, transportation, and housing.
* Loans and grants issued to develop local cooperative businesses and provide assistance for poor communities and workers displaced by the conversion.
* Research focused on sustainable practices and technology with a carbon tax, a stock transfer tax, an end to fossil fuel subsidies, and a minimum 50% cut in the military budget to fund it.
In order to enact this change, we need voters to support all of the Green candidates running in New York this year. The campaign platforms of each of them is a reflection of this unified message as it is applied to every local community in the state. Just as the candidates are united by this message, voters need to be united in their support to ensure that the future we want in this state can actually happen.
At the top of the ticket we have the awesome team of Howie Hawkins and Angela Walker for President and Vice President. We need New York to turn out in big numbers for Hawkins/Walker this year to maintain the Green Party’s ballot line for the next two years. As a reminder, please RSVP to join us on Friday, August 21st at 7:30 PM for the NY Hawkins/Walker Team organizing meeting via Zoom.
Our down ticket candidates also need your support. More information is available on the GPNY 2020 candidates page. Here is a snapshot of our candidates and the key platform planks they are running on:
Harry Burger: Congress (2)
1. Guaranteeing healthcare as a basic human right for all people.

The Climate Crisis. Single-Payer Healthcare. Marijuana Legalization. Ecosocialism.
As a party we organize for building a world where people and the planet matter. You’ve helped us: by voting Green, donating to our campaigns, and supporting us as a Green enrollee, and we salute you for that.
This year we’re looking for a few good Greens to step up and carry the Green flag just a little further. We’d like you to consider being a Green candidate for office in 2020!
Green candidates are at the core of what it means for us to be a party. We run candidates to express the ideas of our party, but also to win!
It’s crucial the Green Party has candidates standing against the corporate candidates of the Democratic and Republican parties. We are the only voice standing at the polls that speaks truth to power.
This year there are races across the state, especially for State Legislature, and for US Congress and some local races. It is these races where our candidates need to articulate our message that it is time for a real Green New Deal and a sustainable, ecosocialist future.
We know it can be daunting to run for office, but you’re not alone! We have Green locals across the state with experienced campaigners and volunteers ready and willing to help. Contact us at [[URL REDACTED]] and we can put you in touch with them.
There is also another reason to run for office this year: it might be the last time you can run as a Green in New York! Legislation crafted by the Democratic Party late last year made it nearly impossible for the Greens to retain a ballot line. Although this unfair legislation is being challenged in court, it is possible the Green Party will lose its ballot line after 2020. It is extraordinarily important that we run candidates this year!
Petitioning for office begins February 25th this year. If you’re willing to step up, we’re here to help you become a Green candidate! Join us!
Want to know more? Join us for Campaign School on January 25th. It will be livestreamed for those not in the Albany area. Please share the event widely: [[URL REDACTED]]

"Gloria and Peter, Green Party of New York",enews@gpny.org,The Real State of the State? Cuomo fiddling while the planet burns.,"Green Party of New York State
## Share our State of the State letter online
The Governor of the State of New York has yet again completely ignored the planetary climate emergency at a time when strong leadership is desperately needed. Not one of his 30+ proposals directly addressed the climate crisis, and they barely touched on other pressing issues facing New Yorkers (like the need for single-payer healthcare or progressive taxation to close the $6 billion budget gap). Governor Cuomo prefers small-bore, low-stakes reforms because they pose no threat to his wealthy donors.
In fact, Cuomo’s most ambitious move since his party’s takeover of the legislature in 2018 was to install a commission to kill off minor parties in New York, under the guise of public campaign finance. The Green Party and others are still fighting for our lives against this cartel-like power play to eliminate rivals in what is supposed to be a democracy. Cuomo is all-too-ready to “think big” or “outside of the box” when it comes to strangling voter choice.
* * *
The future of our party, our democracy and our planet is under threat in 2020. Please give to the Green Party of New York today so we can keep fighting! We are counting on you.
* * *
But when it comes to saving the planet? He cannot even summon a half-measure. New York should lead the U.S. with a commitment to halt new fossil fuel infrastructure in our state and invest $10 billion in an Eco-Socialist Green New Deal. But the CLCPA will not stop the worst effects of the climate crisis – we have until 2030 to de-carbonize the economy, and the CLCPA sets 2050 as a target for an 85% greenhouse gas reduction.
Yes, Cuomo proposed a $3 billion bond. But 1. $3 billion isn't enough 2. Bonds make future generations pay for our sins while enriching the children of the already-wealthy 3. When Cuomo proposes a $3 billion dollar bond for renewable infrastructure in January, by July it will turn out to be a $250 million tax break for New York's corporate elite.
Cuomo has virtually eliminated the environmental justice provision from the CLCPA and slashed funding. We need an immediate commitment to targets that rapidly shift New York to a 100% renewable economy with thousands of new, public sector jobs paying living wages. We have just witnessed one of the hottest years on record and wildfires ravaging California, the Amazon and Australia, yet Andrew Cuomo seems more concerned about legalizing alcohol sales in movie theaters.
New York is facing a $6 billion budget deficit because health care costs keep rising. Gov. Cuomo's speech barely touched on how to reign in those costs and he refuses to discuss raising taxes. We have heard about the proposed 1% cuts to Medicaid, which will severely impact those most in need. Yet the NY Health Act would both reduce state expenditures on health care and cover everyone.
Why won't Cuomo talk about it? For a governor that likes to tout his progressive credentials and fiscal responsibility, it's curious that he won't even talk about single-payer.
Cuomo also didn't touch on progressive tax reform in his speech – why not propose the state stop rebating the stock transfer tax? That alone would close the current budget gap and no new taxes would need to be instituted. New York needs long-term progressive tax reform that shifts the burden to the wealthy and corporations and away from property and sales taxes. Again, single-payer would relieve a huge tax burden on local governments and allow property taxes to be cut.
Cuomo's State of the State is once again disappointing. No climate crisis, single-payer, or progressive tax reform. Nothing on marijuana legalization. No talk about real electoral reform. Cuomo is a master of style over substance, but this is barely much of either. We need bold policies and he's given us thin gruel.

Gloria and Peter

Election Day is two weeks away. We’re asking Greens and Green allies to sign a pledge to vote for Howie Hawkins and Angela Walker.
Why?
Gov. Cuomo and the Democrats changed the law this year so that if we don’t get at least 150,000 votes here in New York, the Green Party will disappear from the ballot.
We’re also asking committed Greens to convince at least one other person to vote Green in New York this year, too. Can you help us with that?
Here are other ways you can help, too:
* Chip in $5 to help with our ballot-line defense fund
* Volunteer to phone-bank
* Spread the word on social media
* Connect with your local Green organization
See, just a second. Sign the pledge and tell your friends!
Help us save the Green Party and build an eco-socialist future!

 May 16 State Convention","Green Party of New York State
Dear Green Party members,
We hope you are keeping well and safe during the COVID-19 pandemic although we know our state has been severely impacted by this public health crisis. The Green Party of New York has taken this into consideration so the 2020 presidential preference vote will be conducted by absentee ballot instead of an in-person State Party Nominating Convention.
All GPNY Members (enrolled New York State Greens and Supporting Members legally barred from registering to vote) are invited to participate in our presidential preference vote by absentee ballot. Download, print, and mail to the address listed on the absentee ballot linked here. Ballots must be postmarked by May 9th.
Greens will need to provide, with their ballot, information to enable verification of their Green Party enrollment or Supporting Member status.
There are 3 candidates on the GPNY absentee ballot: Howie Hawkins, Dario Hunter, and David Rolde. GPNY’s State Committee decided in February that the candidates who met the Green Party of the United States criteria for official recognition on April 1, 2020 would be the candidates on the GPNY ballot. These 3 candidates are the only ones to have met that benchmark.
A candidate’s forum between Hawkins, Hunter, and Rolde will be livestreamed prior to May 9th. Stay tuned for a follow-up announcement with the date/time and details on how to watch the livestream. In the meantime, you can find links to candidates websites and questionnaires here and the latest campaign news here.
Please also plan to join us on Saturday, May 16 for our ""virtual"" State Nominating Convention! The results of the presidential preference absentee ballot vote will be announced. Candidates who have won delegates will be invited to speak. Delegates will then be nominated and elected to attend the Green Party National Convention scheduled to take place July 9-12, in Detroit, Michigan. Stay tuned for agenda details and guest speakers.
Fill out the RSVP form to attend the May 16 Convention. An RSVP is requested for everyone in order to join the meeting. Only GPNY members (New York State enrolled Greens or Supporting Members legally barred from registering to vote) may vote. The form will help us to verify your enrollment or Supporting Member status and activate you in our database as an eligible voter.

Friend \--
I’m not going to sugar-coat it. We have less than three weeks to save the Green Party in New York State.
Gov. Cuomo and the Democrats changed the law this year so that if we don’t get at least 150,000 votes, the Green Party will disappear from the ballot.
That means your vote for Howie Hawkins and Angela Walker is necessary to save your Green Party’s ballot line!
Joe Biden is up by 32 points in New York and is going to win the Electoral College vote. But your vote will matter this November when you vote Green to keep the party alive!
You know that Howie Hawkins and the Green Party were the first to run on a platform of an Eco-Socialist Green New Deal, and that Howie’s success running for Governor helped ban fracking in New York.
The Green Party has long championed the things that Trump and Biden run away from: Medicare-for-All, public living-wage jobs under a Green New Deal, legalization of marijuana, electoral reform, and an end to the imperial wars abroad.
Saving the Green Party means saving the ballot line so we can run amazing candidates at the local, state, and federal levels.
Vote to change this broken system.
Vote for candidates you can be proud of: Howie Hawkins and Angela Walker, and tell a friend to do the same!
PS. Can you chip-in to our ballot-line defense fund? We need your help today to save the Green Party of New York!

The Green Party has endured with its own ballot line, running its own candidates, for almost 10 years straight. Since they can't knock us out at the ballot box, they're trying to rig the rules of the game.
The Public Campaign Finance Commission's edict to raise ballot access for grassroots parties to the higher of 130,000 or 2% of the vote in presidential and gubernatorial elections, combined with raising the signature requirements for statewide independent candidates to 45,000, is a HUGE blow to democracy that will limit YOUR choices as a voter. It's an attempt to silence YOUR voice as someone who wants a party for People and Planet Over Profit.
Across New York, right now, your fellow Greens are fighting back against this attack until it is defeated.
HERE'S WHAT YOU CAN DO:
Right [[URL REDACTED]] to [[URL REDACTED]] to the Action Page where you can do the following:
1. Call your representatives in the NY Assembly AND the Senate. We will help you look up their phone numbers and help you with what to say
2. Email the Commission. Tell them you just spoke to your representatives on the Legislature and asked them to SHUT DOWN the proposal and its grossly undemocratic restrictions on voter choice
3. Tell us how you did
4. Spread the word. Only your voice and the voices in your community can stop this
Tell your friends, allies, and family members that if they EVER want more parties and perspectives to choose from on Election Day — and most voters do! —then they need to speak up NOW. Share the action page. Ask them to act today.
THIS IS THE BEGINNING
Cuomo and his cronies on this Commission don't know who they're messing with. They are not counting on you and tens of thousands of Greens and allies going to the mat for this party we have fought so hard to build. If you want to avert climate catastrophe, if you want to end capitalism's war on the planet and our lives, then you have to fight.
With Solidarity and Gratitude,
Gloria and Peter
Co-Chairs
Green Party of New York
p.s. It seems now all but certain that the Green Party will have to fight this in court. We have to prepare for that and fighting in court is costly. Give today so the Green Party can be ready.

GPNY Statement on the COVID-19 Pandemic and NY State Budget
The world faces an unprecedented crisis in the form of the coronavirus pandemic. New York has become the epicenter of the outbreak in the United States, and the actions taken here will have an outsized impact on the course of the crisis.
It is imperative that New York’s elected officials choose a path that empowers the working class, people of color, and low-income families, rather than the wealthy. During this crisis acts that were considered extraordinary yesterday will be enacted tomorrow. It is up to those of us in the Green Party and on the Left to ensure that those measures benefit working New Yorkers, and that we push for the most comprehensive, democratic, and ecosocialist version of those measures.
Governor Cuomo and the State Legislature must act to ensure the health and well being of all New Yorkers. This requires far more than quarantines: we need a fully built and funded social safety net so that everyone can receive medical care without fear of its cost, to be ensured they will have a home and income during the crisis, and a job afterwards. Therefore we call for the Governor and State Legislature to enact:
1. Universal Basic Income: No one should have to worry about whether and how they can afford to live. We propose a universal basic income supplement to all New Yorkers 18 and above, so that they are able to live comfortably during this crisis. A bare minimum of $1000/month, non-taxable, with regional adjustments upwards based on cost-of-living, should be provided immediately.
2. Paid Medical Leave: We call for mandatory minimum 14-day paid medical leave for all workers as well as parents of K-12 students forced to remain home due to school closure. This should be permanent going forward even after the end of the COVID-19 threat.
3. Company Reimbursement for Paid Medical Leave: The state government should reimburse small businesses for the cost of paid medical leave during the crisis, and develop legislation to ensure the burden of 14-day paid medical leave is shared equitably by businesses afterwards.
4. Guaranteed Employment: No one should lose their job as a consequence of the coronavirus. Employers should be required to reinstate workers that have taken paid medical leave, and benefits should continue to accrue to workers on paid medical leave.
5. Unemployment Benefits: New York State should ensure that anyone that loses their job should have access to extended unemployment benefits, especially at a time when businesses may furlough or lay off workers due to the economic effects of the pandemic. Unemployment benefits should be extended for at least an additional six months.
6. Hospital Testing & Related Costs: Until such time as the New York Health Act is passed, the state government should ensure no one should pay for testing or costs related to COVID-19 whether or not they have health insurance.
7. Health Insurance Companies’ Responsibility: Until such time as the New York Health Act is passed, the state government should ensure that health insurance companies should be required to waive all deductibles and copays for services related to COVID-19.
8. Statewide Moratorium on Rental and Mortgage Delinquency Evictions: No person should be made homeless because of the economic situation caused by the current pandemic. The state should enact an immediate moratorium on rental and mortgage delinquency evictions.
9. The New York Health Act: The unprecedented threat of the coronavirus has exposed the cruelty and inadequacy of the American for-profit healthcare system. New York should pass the New York Health Act and phase-in single-payer universal healthcare, which would guarantee every New Yorker healthcare and eliminate the threat of medical debt and medical bankruptcy. It would also reduce costs, and help solve the Medicaid budget gap New York is currently facing.
10. Tax the Rich: the state should pass several progressive taxation measures to ensure the funds necessary for the increased social services.
By building a response based on principles of equity and social justice, New York has a chance to humanely deal with an unprecedented crisis. It is clear that the neoliberal and piecemeal policies of just yesterday are inadequate dogma that cannot prevent the catastrophic spread of the virus or its aftereffects. Now is the time for bold action that charts a better course for the future of the people of New York. Let us work together to build an empowering, grassroots democratic society that protects and cares for all its members.

Green Party of New York,enews@gpny.org,No Debate — Howie won!,"Green Party of New York State
Friend \--
Last night’s “debate” was a travesty.
It exposed how rotten American politics is: a lying, blustering Donald Trump next to a doddering Joe Biden.
While Trump raised the bogeyman of socialism, Biden ran away from Improved/Expanded Medicare-For-All, away from the Green New Deal, and away from defunding the police.
The Democrats and Republicans want you to believe these are your only choices: bad and worse.
You know that’s not true: you can cast your ballot for Howie Hawkins and Angela Walker and vote for healthcare as a human right, an Eco-Socialist Green New Deal, and a real living wage for every worker.
But there’s even more at stake: your vote for Howie Hawkins and Angela Walker is necessary to save your Green Party’s ballot line! Gov. Cuomo and the Democrats changed the law so that if we don’t get at least 150,000 votes, the Green Party might disappear from the ballot.
After that embarrassing display from Trump and Biden, is there any doubt that the Parties of War and Wall Street are irredeemably broken?
Vote to change this broken system. Vote for candidates you can be proud of: Howie Hawkins and Angela Walker.

Just 2 more days to 200,000 votes.
Today, Sunday is the last day for early voting. You will not be able to vote on Monday so your last opportunity is actually on Tuesday, Nov. 3 - Election Day.
These are the last two days you can make sure that New York gives the corporate Democrats a strong message that in our state Medicare for All, a real Ecosocialist Green New Deal and true electoral reform are our priorities and that Black Lives Matter by voting for Howie Hawkins and Angela Walker, the Green Party presidential ticket and giving the Green Party the votes it needs to stay on the ballot as an independent, left voice pushing Cuomo and the State Legislature to do the right thing for all New Yorkers.
So whether you are early voting on the last day or waiting until Election Day on Tuesday - Vote Green!
Here are other ways you can help, too:
* Chip in $5 to help with our ballot-line defense fund
* Pledge to vote for Howie Hawkins and Angela Walker.
* Volunteer to phone-bank
* Spread the word on social media
* Connect with your local Green organization
