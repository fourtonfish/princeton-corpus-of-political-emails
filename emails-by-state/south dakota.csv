SDDP Chair Randy Seiler,info@sddp.org,Should Fireworks Return to Mt. Rushmore?,"Message from SD Democratic Party Chair Randy Seiler:
Should Fireworks Return to Mt. Rushmore?
Sioux Falls, SD (June 29th, 2020) – It looks as though fireworks may be returning to Mount Rushmore this year for the first time since 2009. While the South Dakota Democratic Party always welcomes an opportunity to celebrate our nation’s independence, we have a few concerns about the use of fireworks in this precarious situation.
First of all, the forested area surrounding Mount Rushmore spans 1,200 acres of mature ponderosa pine and lies adjacent to Black Elk National Forest. We hope that the controlled burn conducted in late May to clear out brush will help thwart any forest fires that could ignite from the fireworks. There’s a reason, though, fireworks haven’t been allowed at Mt. Rushmore since 2009; clearly there’s a significant chance of fire.
The possibility of groundwater contamination from the fireworks display has also been brought to our attention. During the 11-year span (1998-2009) when an annual fireworks show was held at the monument, the groundwater supplying monument began to show increased levels of perchlorate, a toxic chemical. This should concern everyone.
We are also concerned about the cost and how the display will be funded. The company contracted for the event, Pyro Spectaculars of Rialto, California, has a good track record of large, complicated events such as this. But, the cost for the 18-minute show is expected to reach the $350,000 maximum in the bidding process.
Payment for the display will be tax dollars taken from the Future Fund. For those who aren’t familiar with the fund, it was set up in the mid-1980s to invest in South Dakota’s workforce and promote continued economic development in our state. We’re unclear how an 18-minute fireworks show, open to only 7,500 visitors—against the advice of people who are experts in forest fires— will provide for future workforce or economic development in South Dakota.
And last but not least, COVID-19 cases are surging again across the country and social distancing or masking guidelines will prove challenging at this event. Recent large gatherings, such as the President's June 20th rally in Tulsa, have directly led to the spread of the virus. Eight of Trump’s own staff have now tested positive.
What would the four overlooking presidents think of this display? George Washington, who always put country before party; Thomas Jefferson, who outlined a visionary democracy; Teddy Roosevelt, who preserved the west and our natural resources; and Abraham Lincoln, who freed the slaves and defeated the confederacy; they too may have been concerned about throwing caution to the wind.

South Dakota Democratic Party,info@sddp.org,Stronger Measures Needed For COVID-19 Effects: Now And In The Future,"STRONGER MEASURES NEEDED FOR COVID-19 EFFECTS: NOW AND IN THE FUTURE
Sioux Falls, SD – (April 17, 2020) In the wake of nearly 650 confirmed cases of COVID-19 surrounding Sioux Falls-based Smithfield meat processing plant, state Democratic leaders request stronger mitigating measures to be taken by Governor Kristi Noem.
Over 1/2 of South Dakota’s total confirmed cases of the virus to date—now hovering at 1,311—stem from the lack of health and safety precautions revealed at the plant. And, the numbers are rising.
Sioux Falls mayor Paul TenHaken has repeatedly asked for local oversight, but Governor Noem’s executive orders have fallen short. Shelter-in-place orders currently cover only those over 65, and those with underlying health conditions living only in Minnehaha and Lincoln Counties. The order also allows these vulnerable individuals to still work in essential jobs, which could put them at further risk.
“Local control is best, and would have allowed the mayor and the county to protect our citizens locally. Rules should be in place to ensure businesses provide essential workers the safety equipment they need to do their job and stay healthy.” – Nikki Gronli, Vice Chair, SDDP
The Republican-majority state legislature was also provided the opportunity to allow counties and municipalities the ability to increase their decision-making power as early as March 30th, Legislative Veto Day. The bill didn’t receive the 2/3 number of votes needed to prevail.
Minority House leader Representative Jamie Smith states, “Democratic caucus leaders offered suggestions in a letter to the governor, to assist and minimize the effects of the virus on our state’s citizens. Although inroads were made by the governor and legislature in accepting many of the ideas, we need them to go the distance.”
Late last week, TenHaken and Noem sent Smithfield CEO Kenneth Sullivan a letter, urging him to close the plant for two weeks. Sullivan did not respond, but instead made a surprise announcement to close the plant indefinitely. The South Dakota Democratic Party hopes proactive recovery plans may be coordinated by state and local authorities.
“Moving forward, we should take more cues from union leaders, who have stepped up to not only bring the Smithfield situation to light, but also to offer protection to our valuable workforce.” – Randy Seiler, Chair, SDDP
Kooper Caraway, President of Sioux Falls AFL-CIO, oversees union representatives that assist 36 unions with 20,000 members statewide.
He states, “Governmental imposed shutdowns of facilities wouldn’t cause so much anxiety if our workers had guaranteed sick leave and paid family leave. Right now, South Dakota workers don’t have these protections; they have no guarantee other than minimum wage. Governor Noem could set an example by supporting these ‘pro-worker’ solutions.”
Many wonder what will happen to the 3700 Smithfield workers and their families, now left in turmoil. Smithfield will provide employees with two weeks of pay, and if the shutdown continues, they will need to apply for unemployment. Unfortunately, they won’t be eligible for CARES Act (Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security) funds since Smithfield employs over 500 people.
Representative Linda Duba, District 15 Sioux Falls, raised concerns with SD Department of Labor Secretary Marcia Hultman over large company shutdowns. The Secretary ensures they have the tools needed to support employees, including those whose primary language is not English.
“This is not a partisan issue; it is a responsibility issue. We are all responsible for not only ourselves both those impacted by this virus. We can and will work with all who come ready with ideas and a positive approach to slowing the spread and lifting up our fellow South Dakotans,” states Linda.
There are thousands of South Dakotans whose lives will be forever changed by this virus, whether it be physical, mental or financial. Governor Noem can help remedy the situation by issuing shelter-in-place orders for all in the Sioux Falls area, and offer strict guidelines to businesses and industries serving in essential capacities.
Taking her authority one step further, Governor Noem should consider an Executive Order to expand Medicaid in the state of South Dakota. She can also suggest tapping into state budget reserves to expand mental health services, educate or re-train workers, and create new sustainably-based jobs.
Medicaid expansion would provide health care not only for the estimated 55,000 individuals prior to COVID-19, but also for individuals and their families now put in precarious situations due to the virus. South Dakota is one of only 14 states that haven’t taken advantage of Medicaid expansion.
The framework for South Dakota’s economy has been weakened the last many months. Everyone will struggle, at their level of vulnerability. Unemployment payments, Medicaid expansion, and use of South Dakota’s state budget reserves would go a long way toward a concerted recovery effort.
“Working in a non-partisan way, we must utilize all the tools and resources in our toolbox to help in South Dakota’s recovery. We need all levels of leadership to work together, blurring the lines of partisanship, to create a tide that lifts all boats.” – Jamie Smith, SD House Minority Leader.

SDDP Executive Director Pam Cole,pam@sddp.org,Greetings From SDDP Executive Director Pam Cole: Petitions Due 3/31!,"##  Friend,
##
As your new Executive Director, I am determined to help bring transformational change to our party. Growing up on my family's farm in North Dakota taught me the value of working hard, and seeing things through. Not giving up, even when the challenges are daunting. Amid the uncertainty of today, and the days to come, one thing remains certain: we need progressive change NOW in our home communities, in South Dakota, and beyond.
I'm calling on you to help.
Our most immediate needs are to get more Democrats on the November 2020 ballot. This includes U.S. House Candidates Whitney Raver (Custer) and Brian Wirth (Dell Rapids); and U.S. Senate Candidates Dan Ahlers (Dell Rapids) and Clara Hart (Sioux Falls).
We also have dozens of legislative candidates seeking office in our 35 State Districts. Some have already filed, but many still need Democrats from their given districts to sign petitions. Please contact your county chair/party to find out how you can sign petitions for our federal and state candidates.
SDDP County Parties
I'm grateful for the opportunity to serve you alongside SDDP Chair Randy Seiler and Vice Chair Nikki Gronli. We've all pushed up our sleeves and gotten to work. My office is in Sioux Falls, and our Deputy Executive Director, Sunny Gaughen is located in Rapid City. Sunny has been tirelessly dedicated through this transition. Your SD Democratic Party is in very good hands.
This past year gave us perspective on handling our debt and implementing sound financial practices. We are happy to inform you that we have our financial house in order, all our obligations are up to date, and we have a multi-way checks and balance in place.
Chairman Seiler has tasked me with Transactional, Operational, and Transformational duties. I offer daily oversight of our finances, communication, and keeping the office running smoothly. Operationally, I help coordinate our yearly events, and assist with ongoing projects. Finally, by working together, we will transform our party: by growing leaders, building bridges, and breaking down barriers to peoples’ success.
My past experience in running and serving on both the school board and state senate level gives me the ability to relate and share ideas with candidates. And, my work with many non-profit organizations and business development offers valuable perspective. Visit our website at: [[URL REDACTED]] to find out more about our staff and leadership.
SDDP Leaders & Staff
In the months to come, once we get through the effects of this deadly and anxiety-inducing virus, I look forward to meeting you in your towns, or at Democratic events. I value and seek diversity in everything I do; and promise to reach out to every corner of our state.
Meanwhile, please reach out to your county chairperson, or email me [[URL REDACTED]] your questions or comments. Thank you so much for your continued support.
Sincerely Yours,
Pam Cole
Executive Director, SDDP
