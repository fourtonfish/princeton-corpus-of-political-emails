Democratic Party of Oregon,democrats@dpo.org,International Workers' Day: Share your thanks for frontline workers ,"Support our commitment to never stop fighting for them.
Alex,
Our lives and livelihoods have been upended by COVID-19, and this is a stressful and uncertain moment for workers all across Oregon — especially those working on the front lines of this pandemic.
Right now, those frontline workers are putting themselves in harm's way each and every day to keep Oregon connected, moving, fed, and well-taken care of.
We owe them an immense debt of gratitude, and they deserve nothing less than our complete, collective commitment to take care of them, just as they've taken care of us.
From safety protections on the job, to financial protections to help them pay the bills, to programs like paid sick leave, Oregon Democrats are fighting to give workers the security and peace of mind they deserve in these uncertain times.
This International Workers' Day (also known as May Day), will you join us to thank frontline workers and support our commitment to never stop fighting for them?
Thank you, frontline workers!

Hey Alex,
Oregonians will start getting their ballots in just over a week, so make sure you know our 2020 Statewide Ballot Measure Endorsements!
Democratic Party of Oregon 2020 Statewide Ballot Measure Endorsements: Vote YES ✓Measure 107 Allows laws and initiatives that reveal the true sources of money spent on Oregon elections, limit campaign contributions and spending, and require that political ads disclose who paid for them. Measure 108 Establishes a nicotine vape tax, reduces youth vaping and smoking, and funds the Oregon Health Plan and smoking prevention and cessation programs. Measure 109 Establishes a regulated psilocybin therapy system at supervised, licensed facilities in Oregon to help those suffering from depression and anxietyMeasure 110 Instead of arresting and jailing people for personal possession of small amounts of drugs, would expand access to drug treatment services paid for by marijuana taxes.
We're working hard to make sure Oregonians pass these important ballot measures, send Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to the White House, re-elect Jeff Merkley, and elect Oregon Democrats up and down the ballot.
But it's going to take all of us working together to boost our GOTV operations and reach as many Democratic voters as possible over the next 29 days.

Democratic Party of Oregon Logo
Hey Alex — tonight is the first presidential debate between Joe Biden and Donald Trump, so we'll keep this quick:
Before things get started this evening, we have two requests.
First, we want to remind you that Oregon's voter registration deadline is October 13th — just two weeks from tonight! Please make sure you, your friends, and your family are registered to vote, and that your voter registration information is up-to-date and accurate.
Register to Vote ➞
Check your voter registration ➞
Second, we want to ask you to chip in to help elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, re-elect Jeff Merkley, and elect Oregon Democrats up and down the ballot in 2020.
Tonight on the debate stage, Joe Biden will make his case to the American people.
We'll hear about his plan to contain the coronavirus, to build back better and lead America out of the darkness of Trump's administration.
In Joe Biden, we'll see a leader who understands the struggles of regular American families, and who knows what it means to work hard and to pay their fair share to support their fellow Americans.
Meanwhile, we'll hear Trump lie about his record again and again and again.
He'll lie about the fact that he paid nothing in income taxes for years, and only paid $750 in 2016 and 2017.
He'll lie about how he knew how dangerous COVID-19 was back in February, yet continued to say it was no worse than the flu, that the U.S. had it totally under control, and that the virus was going to disappear. Now, the virus has claimed more than 200,000 American lives.
And he'll lie about his plans to combat the virus, because Trump has no plan.
It doesn't have to be this way. And when we elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to the White House, along with Democratic majorities in the House and Senate, we can come out of this crisis together, even stronger than before.
But we need to work together over the next 35 days to make this a reality. If you're able, please consider donating to the Democratic Party of Oregon today.

Alex,
We made major progress in 2019 thanks to your support.
Our Democratic Senators and Representatives are working hard and fighting back against Trump and Republicans in Washington, D.C.
Back home in Oregon, Democrats passed major legislation like paid family and medical leave, campaign finance reform, paid postage on ballots, made the largest investment in schools in decades, and more.
But there's still much work to be done, notably on tackling the climate crisis — especially after Republican Senators walked off the job at the end of the last legislative session to prevent a vote on the Clean Energy Jobs bill.
So with less than two months until the start of Oregon's 2020 legislative session, we want to know: What issues are most important to you in 2020?
The survey won't take more than a minute. Tell us what matters most to you!
Climate Change
Health Care
Education
Campaign Finance Reform
Affordable Housing
Gun Safety
Transportation
Or another issue!

"KC Hanson, Democratic Party of Oregon",democrats@dpo.org,Join Oregon's labor unions for a Virtual Labor Day Celebration,"Join us on Monday, September 7th, at noon.
Democratic Party of Oregon Logo
Hi Alex,
Usually for Labor Day we encourage folks to gather at the many picnics and events happening across Oregon, to recognize and celebrate workers and to kick off our huge organizing efforts ahead of the election.
We were especially looking forward to Labor Day this year, after Democratic Party of Oregon Staff voted to unionize in January. DPO Staff are now proudly represented by the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades (IUPAT) District Council 5, Local 1094.
But Labor Day will look a lot different in 2020. And even though we won't be coming together in person this year, you can still join Oregon's labor unions on Monday at noon for a Virtual Labor Day Celebration and Call to Action! Click here to learn more and RSVP.
RSVP Today!
Even amid a pandemic that has caused massive job losses and pushed the economy into crisis, workers in Oregon and across the country are still facing heightened attacks from Republicans.
The GOP refused to pass another relief bill to support the record numbers of unemployed Americans, and they've lobbed unwarranted attacks on front-line workers. Most recently, the U.S.P.S. and our postal workers have been under Republican siege.
But Oregon Democrats are fighting to support working people, and there are critical races up and down the ballot in Oregon where we need to make sure we elect Democrats who will be a strong and proud voice for labor.
This Labor Day, hear from Oregon’s labor leaders, elected officials, and working Oregonians on the need for change as we continue our pursuit toward justice for all working people. RSVP today to join Oregon's Labor Unions on Monday at noon for the Virtual Labor Day Celebration and Call to Action.
In Solidarity,
KC Hanson
Chair

We've been looking forward to the Vice Presidential debate for a while, Alex.
And tonight, we watched Kamala Harris make history, becoming the first woman of color to take the stage at a Vice Presidential debate.
What's more, Kamala showed the American people why she will be an incredible Vice President. She is a fearless fighter who speaks truth to power, and who will be ready to lead on Day One.
Ballots will start to arrive in Oregon mailboxes in just one week, and we need all hands on deck to make sure we elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris this fall. With so much on the line in this election, can we count on you to chip in to help power our GOTV efforts over the final stretch?

On the other side of the stage, Mike Pence could not answer for his failures.
Pence and Trump share the blame and the responsibility for America's failed response to the COVID pandemic.
Pence isn't just the current Vice President, he's also the head of the White House's Coronavirus Task Force – which wouldn't even take the steps necessary to prevent an outbreak within the White House, let alone the country.
With Trump and Pence at the helm, more than 210,000 Americans have died from COVID-19, millions have been infected, hundreds of thousands of small businesses have closed, and millions of Americans have lost their jobs.
It didn't have to be this way. And Kamala Harris and Joe Biden are the leaders we need to come out of this crisis even stronger than before.
Let's do everything we can over the next 27 days to elect Joe, Kamala, and Oregon Democrats up and down the ballot. If you're able, please make a donation to the Democratic Party of Oregon today.

OR Dems,democrats@dpo.org,Trump attacks Vote-By-Mail,"""Voting rights for me, but not for thee.""
Did you see this, Alex?
During Trump's latest ~~campaign rally~~ coronavirus press conference, he was asked about vote-by-mail, which Oregon has used in our elections for more than two decades.
Here's what he said:
Trump attacking vote-by-mail as ""horrible"" and ""corrupt"" except when he uses it to vote ""because I'm allowed to""
You read that right. According to Trump, vote-by-mail is ""horrible, it's corrupt"" — except when he uses it to vote, and then it's fine ""because I'm allowed to.""
It's just the latest Republican attack on vote-by-mail, a safe, commonsense way to run an election that increases accessibility and allows more people to participate.
Now, during a global pandemic unlike any of us have seen in our lifetimes, Republicans are relentlessly working to force American voters to choose between their health and exercising their right to vote.
We won't stand for this. Oregon Democrats are fighting like hell to make sure the Oregon way of voting — universal vote-by-mail — is the way all of America votes.
If you're able, please chip in $5, $10, $25, or whatever you can to support our work for National Vote-By-Mail, and to defeat Trump and Republicans this fall.

Alex,
We're really close to breaking a big record.
If just 60 more supporters make a contribution through this email, we'll break our all-time record for individual email contributions in a calendar year — and it's only October!
This is a testament to how fired up, motivated, and engaged Oregon Democrats are ahead of the most important election of our lifetimes.
Your contributions power the voter outreach and grassroots organizing it's going to take to elect Democrats up and down the ballot this fall. And if we can break this fundraising record, I know we can break Oregon voter turnout records over the next nine days.
With just nine days left for Oregon voters to return their ballots, you can help us break all kinds of records by using your Oregon Political Tax Credit to make a donation to the Democratic Party of Oregon. Will you chip in today to support our work? It's like a free $50 donation!
Use your Oregon Political Tax Credit ➞
Here's how it works: If you're an Oregon taxpayer making under $75,000, you can give up to $50 per year to a state political party and receive the full amount as a credit subtracted from your Oregon state taxes when you file (If you're part of a joint-filing couple, you can give up to $100 a year, but you only qualify if you make less than $150,000).
The Oregon Political Tax Credit is like a free $50 donation to the Democratic Party of Oregon. And with nine days left for us to reach Oregonians who still haven't returned their ballot, every contribution helps us turn out more votes for Oregon Democrats up and down the ballot.
Use your Oregon Political Tax Credit to help us break fundraising records and voter turnout records over the next nine days.

Trump knew, Alex.
He admitted in a taped, on-the-record interview that he worked to conceal and downplay the true threat of the COVID-19 pandemic from the American people.
Trump knew way back in February, around the time the first American died from coronavirus, that the disease was spread through the air – yet continued to say it was no worse than the flu, that the U.S. had it totally under control, and that the virus was going to disappear.
Trump knew, and lied to the American people. And here we are, six months and nearly 200,000 deaths later.
It didn't have to be this bad, and it's time for America to once again have a leader it can trust. If you're able, will you chip in to help elect Joe Biden and Oregon Democrats up and down the ballot?
Yes, I'll donate!
How many lives could have been saved if Trump was just honest with the American people? How many job losses and business closures could have been avoided?
During times of crisis, Americans look to the president for the facts and to be reassured that there is a calm, steady hand at the helm.
Trump has proven to us time and time again that we will never get that from him.
Instead we get lies, conspiracy theories, and failed leadership when we need it most.
We can – and we will – get through this. But we can only start to repair the damage Trump and Republicans have wrought by kicking them out of office.
Help us do everything we can to defeat Trump and Republicans this fall by making a donation to the Democratic Party of Oregon.

I always love the Wayne Morse Gala, and I'm especially looking forward to it during this critical election year!
It's a great opportunity to come together as Democrats to get energized and ready to work non-stop to defeat Trump and Republicans this November.
I lead the Democratic Attorneys General Association and am so proud of the work we've done to defend against the Trump administration’s mean-spirited and illegal policies targeting women's reproductive freedoms, health care, immigration, student debt, the environment, and much more. And I'm more than ready to get Trump out of office!
I hope you'll join me and Senator Merkley at the 11th Annual Wayne Morse Gala in Portland on Saturday, April 4th. We'll celebrate the great work Democrats are doing here in Oregon and across the country and get ready for the fight to save our democracy.
The DPO team is working on bringing a great speaker to Oregon and I know you won't want to miss out!
Hope to see you at the Gala!

KC Hanson,democrats@dpo.org,Working together in these trying times,"We must act in solidarity with one another to protect the most vulnerable among us.
These are unprecedented and difficult times, Alex.
Oregonians are understandably worried — about their health, about their families, about their livelihoods, and about the growing impact of COVID-19 on our way of life.
There's an incredible amount of uncertainty right now, but it's important that we work together to slow the spread of COVID-19 and act in solidarity with one another to protect those most vulnerable.
Here at the Democratic Party of Oregon, the health, safety, and well being of our staff, volunteers, and organizers are a top priority. We've asked our team to work from home whenever possible, and our office is operating on very limited hours.
We hope that you and your loved ones are also taking the necessary precautions to help keep yourselves and those in your community safe from the spread of the virus.
Steps like frequently washing your hands, practicing social distancing, staying home if and when you are able, and following the recommendations of trusted public health professionals.
Even if you're not in a higher-risk group, we all have a responsibility to act to protect and support one another.
Here are some resources you might find helpful:
* The State of Oregon's COVID-19 page
* The Oregon Health Authority's COVID-19 page
* Information from the Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries
* The World Health Organization's COVID-19 page
* The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's COVID-19 page
* And remember, you can call, text, or email 211 for questions about COVID-19 or referrals to programs for food, shelter, health care and more.
The coming days, weeks, and months will not be easy. But we can do everything we can to make sure we emerge as strong and as healthy as possible by working together, acting responsibly, and by listening to the advice of public health professionals.
From all of us at the Democratic Party of Oregon, please stay healthy and safe.

Oregon Democrats,democrats@dpo.org,Governor Kate Brown takes bold action on climate,"Oregon Democrats are ready and willing to take bold action to save our planet.
Alex,
Governor Kate Brown just took bold action to protect our environment and act on climate.
The governor signed an executive order this morning giving Oregon the most ambitious plans in the country for reducing carbon emissions.
After Republicans walked out on their jobs last year and again this year to block climate bills in the Legislature, Governor Brown knew that we couldn't wait any longer to act to address the climate crisis.
This strong action to cut climate pollution and transition Oregon to a clean energy economy is a direct result of Oregon Democrats like you organizing and mobilizing voters in 2018 to re-elect Governor Brown.
Oregon Republicans have shown through their words and their actions that they would rather hold climate action and other important legislation hostage rather than being partners in moving Oregon forward.
Today's executive order is an important step that shows Oregon Democrats are ready and willing to take bold action to save our planet.
Together, we can continue to get things done for Oregonians. Chip in $5, $10, $25, or whatever you can today.

Oregon doesn't just elect Democrats by chance, Alex.
It happens because of incredible candidates and the grassroots Democrats who organize in their communities all across Oregon.
We're proud to play an important role in training many of those candidates and grassroots organizers, and we're ready to do even more in 2020 to make sure Democrats win up and down the ballot.
Will you donate to the Democratic Party of Oregon and help us train more local candidates and grassroots organizers in 2020?
Donate
Many of our local organizing programs are the envy of state parties across the country, and it's not hard to see why.
Our Neighborhood Leader Program knocked on more than 150,000 doors in 23 counties across Oregon in 2018. And two-thirds of the local candidates who participated in our Local Elections Project won their elections.
We've got big plans to do even more with these programs in 2020, Alex. But just how much we can do depends on you.
Please consider making your end-of-year donation to the Democratic Party of Oregon today. Remember, you can use your Oregon Political Tax Credit to give. It's like a free $50 donation!

Alex,
The Oregon Political Tax Credit is like a free donation for Oregon taxpayers, once a year — but you have to use it before 2019 ends.
Now, thanks to a generous supporter, grassroots contributions will be matched, DOUBLING your impact and doing even more to help elect Democrats in 2020.
Don't wait any longer: Use your Oregon Political Tax Credit today and your end-of-year donation will be matched dollar-for-dollar.
Donate today
The Democratic Party of Oregon is powered by grassroots supporters like you, Alex.
That's why the Oregon Political Tax Credit is so important to our work to elect Democrats — because it helps keep Oregon’s elections grassroots-powered.
Here's how it works: If you're an Oregon taxpayer making under $100,000, you can give up to $50 per year to a state political party and receive the full amount as a credit subtracted from your Oregon state taxes when you file (If you're part of a joint-filing couple, you can give up to $100 a year, but you only qualify if you make less than $200,000).
That's it! It's like a free $50 (or $100) donation to help defeat Trump and elect Democrats in 2020.
With only two more days left in 2019, the time to give is now. Give $50, $100, or whatever you can give today and your gift will be matched.

"Chrissy Erguiza, DPO Asian American & Pacific Islander Caucus Chair",democrats@dpo.org,The spirit of Asian American & Pacific Islander resilience,"This month we honor Asian American & Pacific Islanders’ rich diversity and contributions to the fabric of our nation.
AAPI Caucus Logo
Alex,
May commemorates Asian American & Pacific Islander Heritage Month. This month we honor Asian American & Pacific Islanders’ rich diversity and contributions to the fabric of our nation and celebrate the legacy of our path makers that sought progressive change for all communities in our nation.
The month of May was chosen to memorialize the arrival of the first Japanese immigrants to the United States on May 7, 1843, and to mark the anniversary of the completion of the transcontinental railroad on May 10, 1869. The majority of the workers who laid the tracks were Chinese immigrants.
The deeper message of Asian American & Pacific Islander Heritage month chronicles the story of resiliency in the face of injustice and bigotry within the backdrop of modern United States history.
The spirit of AAPI resilience is paired with the cautionary tale about the humanitarian atrocities of where complacency and ignorance can lead to; The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, the apartheid of the Geary Act a decade later, the Executive Order to Intern Japanese Americans nearly 75 years ago, and, in the not so distant past, the fight for civil and labor rights through the 1960s.
Today we are living through a global 21st century nadir surrounded by a roulette of uncertainties. Asian Americans & Pacific Islanders are experiencing an uptick of prejudice and xenophobia, and the President is espousing lethal rhetoric that divides and exhausts the most vulnerable in our communities. These tactics are cowardly and fuel hate that steers our country down a dangerous path aimed at conditioning a toxic mentality of fear.
Join us today by signing Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum’s COVID-19 call to action to stand with the Asian American community.
Add my name!
We are witnessing threats of erasure and extreme measures that target people with Asian heritage and culture — from attempts to ban the immigration of our Muslim brothers and sisters, maliciously restricting the movement of our loved ones and families, to even stripping the most basic rights of our New Americans in accessing vital essentials like food, health care, and government relief. These actions are harmful and do a disservice to the legacy and sacrifice that Asian, Arab, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islander Americans have contributed to our nation.
In 2020, we see increases of AAPI representation in Oregon who are boldly running for or are already serving in public office. Asian American & Pacific Islanders are the fastest-growing population in the country and even right here in Oregon. Our participation in our Democracy is the key to influencing the outcome of every single election because the work of justice must include Asian American & Pacific Islander voices in order to prevail over issues like ending family separation, investing in the potential of DACA students, and fighting climate change.
Today and every day, we choose to honor the past and continue the collective hum of progress that has pulsed through our veins for centuries.
As we celebrate, we reflect on stories of overcoming adversity of our shared collective experiences in the United States. As teachers, public officials, artists, and health care workers, Asian Americans & Pacific Islanders have a vibrant history in our country, and this month we celebrate the voices, sacrifices, and contributions of Asian American & Pacific Islanders to make the land we love and call our home a more prosperous place for everyone.
Traditionally, the AAPI Caucus hosts booths at community events, registers voters, and canvasses for Democratic AAPI candidates. COVID-19 has made it challenging to keep up these traditions, yet we hope you can join our caucus or make a contribution to support us through these unprecedented times.

Alex,
Have you responded to the 2020 U.S. Census yet?
The 2020 U.S. Census is critical — it's how we make sure that the government accurately allocates money, services, and resources to Oregon and its diverse cities and communities. It could even mean that Oregon is apportioned another Representative to elect to Congress in 2022!
Right now, amid the COVID-19 crisis, the best thing you can do to make sure that you are counted while protecting your health and the safety of census workers is to fill out your census form online!
Fill out your census form online at [[URL REDACTED]]
Many Oregonians are members of hard-to-count communities that are often overlooked by census counts.
These communities include people of color, children under five, renters, immigrants, people with limited English proficiency, multiple-family homes, Native tribal and urban communities, disabled people, and LGBTQ individuals.
The Democratic Party of Oregon is supporting the #WeCountOregon campaign to engage with Oregonians who are members of those hard-to-count communities and help them get counted in the 2020 Census.
If you are a member of a hard-to-count community, you can visit our website or the #WeCountOregon campaign's website for helpful resources.
Finally, Census Day is on Wednesday, April 1st! The #WeCountOregon campaign will be hosting a virtual livestream party at noon on Wednesday to come together and celebrate the importance of filling out the Census!
Join #WeCountOregon, Community Partners, Elected Officials and Community Leaders for interviews, music, and art to celebrate the ability to gain representation and funding for critical services Oregonians need.
RSVP on Facebook

Alex,
Next Saturday, join Congressman Peter DeFazio, Oregon State Senator Sara Gelser, and Oregon State Representative Marty Wilde in Albany for a dinner to support the Linn County Democrats and the Democratic Party of Oregon!
Get your tickets today!
We're so excited to welcome these three wonderful legislators for the event — legislators who have shown incredible leadership in these trying times.
Congressman DeFazio is a tireless advocate for Oregonians in Washington, D.C., working to implement the goals of the Green New Deal through transportation policy and legislation, and fighting back against the Trump administration.
Back home in Oregon, Sen. Gelser and Rep. Wilde have done what their counterparts in the Oregon GOP have refused to do: They've shown up and done their jobs.
Day in and day out during the Republican walkouts — despite undemocratic obstructionism from the Oregon GOP — Senator Gelser, Representative Wilde, and the rest of their Oregon Democratic colleagues held strong and did the work.
We are so fortunate to have leaders like them representing us in Salem and in Washington, D.C. We hope you'll join us next Saturday in Albany to welcome and thank them, and to prepare for the work ahead of us this fall.
Tickets are just $35 — get yours before they sell out!

Democratic Party of Oregon Logo
Alex,
Does it make your blood boil to hear Trump bash vote-by-mail? Me too. The benefits of vote-by-mail are more evident now than ever. And yet, our voting rights, and vote-by-mail itself, are under attack across the country.
Donald Trump wants to end vote-by-mail — the safest and most accessible form of voting. Period. As your Secretary of State, I will defend Oregon’s trailblazing vote-by-mail system, ensure that every Oregonian’s vote counts, and help any state that wants to adopt vote-by-mail.
I need your help to get there. Donate Now.
There’s so much at stake this election, and here in Oregon we need to do more than just protect ballot access — we need to expand ballot access. That’s why I’m running for Secretary of State, and that’s why I need your help. Every dollar you donate will help me fight for Oregon’s democracy. Can I count on you?
Donate Now
This fight isn’t new to me. In the legislature, I helped pass Oregon’s groundbreaking Motor Voter law, enrolling hundreds of thousands of Oregonians to vote for the first time. I also championed the paid postage law that went into effect this spring, ensuring that vote-by-mail is free for all Oregonians. These laws were milestones in expanding voting access, but we have more work to do. As Secretary of State, I vow to fight for fairness and uphold integrity in our election system.
When everyone’s voice is heard and every vote counts, change happens. Together we can make sure that progress is within reach for all Oregonians. If you’re able, please chip in to help us protect and expand ballot access in Oregon.
Thank you,
Shemia Fagan

With many of us counting down the days left in 2019, we're counting on Oregon Democrats to chip in during our end-of-year fundraising drive to support our work to defeat Trump and elect Democrats in 2020.
Can we count on your support, Alex? Remember, you can use your Oregon Political Tax Credit to give — it's like a free $50 donation for qualifying Oregon taxpayers!
Donate today!
Democrats across the state are using their Oregon Political Tax Credit to make their end-of-year donation and support our work.
Don't know if you qualify? It's easy to figure out:
✔  I am an Oregon resident
✔  I will submit an Oregon tax return for 2019
✔  I made less than $100,000 in 2019 or $200,000 for joint-filing couples
That's it! With the Oregon Political Tax Credit, most Oregonians can give $50 to the Democratic Party of Oregon and get that money back as a credit when they file their taxes. Remember, it's not a deduction — it's a credit.
Together we can defeat Trump, take the Senate out of Mitch McConnell's control, replace Greg Walden, and elect Democrats up and down the ballot in Oregon. Use your Oregon Political Tax Credit to make your end-of-year gift today.
Donate $50
Donate $100
Donate another amount

A Message from Rosa Colquitt, PhD, Chair, Democratic Party of Oregon Black Caucus
""While Juneteenth is a celebration of freedom, Juneteenth 2020 is bittersweet. The recent events of 2020, the witnessing of the wrongful deaths of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, George Floyd and Rayshard Brooks, is crushing our spirits and reminding us of the stark reality that the fight for racial justice, equality and freedom for BLACK LIVES continues.""
Juneteenth, (“June” plus “nineteenth”) sometimes called “Jubilee,” indicating the year of freedom from enslavement, or even more simply “Freedom Day,” is indeed a remarkable story commemorating the abolition of slavery in the United States.
It was June 19, 1865, when Union General Gordon Granger marched into Galveston, Texas, with official news that the Civil War had ended and the enslaved were now free. Granger read General Order Number 3 as follows:
""The people of Texas are informed that in accordance with a Proclamation from the Executive of the United States, all slaves are free. This involves an absolute equality of rights and rights of property between former masters and slaves, and the connection heretofore existing between them becomes that between employer and hired laborer.""
Amazingly, even in an era of slow communication and a nation at war, Granger was very late with important news of freedom — almost two and a half years after Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation ended slavery in the Confederacy, at least on paper.
In knowing the dehumanization of even one day of enslavement, I’ve looked for any historical explanations for the delay in delivering and enforcing the Emancipation Proclamation. One version of the story of ""freedom delayed, freedom denied"" was the tale of the messenger who was murdered on the way to Texas with the news. Another is that the official proclamation was deliberately withheld by the enslavers to maintain the ""free labor"" force on their plantations. And still another is that federal troops actually waited for the slave owners to reap the benefits of one last cotton harvest before going to Texas. Whether all or none of these versions are true, slavery in Texas remained status quo well beyond what was statutory.
My mind can scarcely imagine the depths of the emotions and the fear of the unknown for the ""newly freed"" Black men, women and children of Texas. Yet, it is within this historical backdrop of delay, confusion and terror that we have the beginnings of one of the most inspiring grassroots efforts of the post-Civil War period — the transformation of June 19 from a day of new freedom into an annual rite called “Juneteenth.”
Today, more than 154 years later, Juneteenth-centered activities are experiencing phenomenal growth and flourishing within communities and organizations throughout the country. The freedom celebrations highlight the tradition of bringing in guest speakers and the elders of the community to recount historical events of the past. Newer Juneteenth traditions focus on education and self-improvement, along with future community development, while cultivating knowledge and appreciation of African American history and culture.
What many Americans remember most about Juneteenth is that it is always a joyful celebration of entertaining the masses with parades, musical entertainment, dance, games, and always food — an abundance of wonderfully prepared food. In Portland, Oregon, Juneteenth is combined with ""Good in the Hood"" for an unforgettable annual community celebration of young and old, family, friends, organizations, and business vendors from every corner of the state, along with southwest Washington, and reflects all of our diverse racial and ethnic groups. For sure, no matter how large the gatherings at ""Good in the Hood,"" I always make my way from vendor to vendor until I have my soul food dinner of corn bread, black-eyed peas, collard greens and bar-b-que, and I always bring my own bottle of red soda water, just in case they don’t have it. One can’t quite celebrate Juneteenth without this original Texas tradition (and, unless I forget, there’s always a bottle of hot sauce in my purse).
Among all emancipation celebrations, we are reminded that June 19th falls closest to the summer solstice, the longest day of the year when the sun, at its zenith, defies the darkness in every state, including those states shadowed by slavery. By choosing to remember the last state in the South that freedom touched, we celebrate the shining ""promise of emancipation.""
Still, we can never ignore or forget the bloody path America took by delaying freedom and deferring the fulfillment of the simple words in General Granger’s General Order Number 3: ""This involves an absolute equality of personal rights and rights of property between former masters and slaves.""
While Juneteenth is a celebration of freedom, Juneteenth 2020 is bittersweet. The recent events of 2020, the witnessing of the wrongful deaths of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, George Floyd and Rayshard Brooks, is crushing our spirits and reminding us of the stark reality that the fight for racial justice, equality and freedom for BLACK LIVES continues.
The recent and unanimous votes to pass resolutions declaring that BLACK LIVES MATTER and demanding JUSTICE for and honoring the life of GEORGE FLOYD by our State Central Committee can give us hope that our cries to breathe are being heard.

I want to make a quick request, Alex. Will you use your 2020 Oregon Political Tax Credit to make a donation today to the Democratic Party of Oregon?
I usually ask this of our supporters in December, at the end of the year.
But with less than four months until ballots arrive in mailboxes across Oregon, and with the most important election of our lifetimes just 132 days away (and counting), we can't afford to wait until then. Your support right now will make a huge difference in what we can do to elect Democrats all across Oregon this fall.
Will you use your 2020 Oregon Political Tax Credit today? It's like a free $50 donation for Oregon taxpayers, once a year.
Use your Oregon Political Tax Credit today!
With the Oregon Political Tax Credit, qualifying Oregon taxpayers can give up to $50 per year (or $100 for joint-filing couples) to a state political party, and receive the full amount as a credit subtracted from your Oregon state taxes when you file.
And with Trump and his Republican sycophants proving more and more every single day how unfit they are to lead, we need your support now more than ever to make sure Oregonians elect Democrats up and down the ballot.
If you're able, please consider using your 2020 Oregon Political Tax Credit to give $50, $100, or whatever you can today to help Democrats win in November.

The U.S. Postal Service is in danger, Alex, and it needs our help.
Already saddled by Republicans with an outrageous forward funding mandate, the COVID-19 crisis has pushed the Postal Service to the limit.
Now, it needs relief from Congress if it's going to keep delivering letters, packages, and even ballots for our vote-by-mail elections.
Will you add your name and support our call to #SaveTheUSPS?
The USPS is a critical lifeline for so many Oregonians, especially people living in rural areas, seniors, and veterans.
It's one of the nation's largest employers of veterans and people of color, and provides an important opportunity for many Americans to earn a middle-class living. And letter carriers and postal workers are on the front lines of this crisis, putting themselves in harm's way day in and day out to keep Americans connected, supplied, and safe.
We also need a strong, functioning USPS to conduct our vote-by-mail elections — the safest way to hold free and fair elections during this pandemic. But Trump has threatened to veto relief bills if they contained any aid for the USPS.
The U.S. Postal Service has been there for Oregonians and Americans through snow, rain, heat, and gloom of night, and now through a global pandemic. Let's make sure we're there for them when they need our help.

KC Hanson,democrats@dpo.org,An Earth Day unlike any other,"We're seeing a spirit of collective action that we'll need to harness in the years ahead.
Alex,
Over the last few months, much of Oregon's and the world's attention has been (rightly) focused on the COVID-19 pandemic.
That hasn't stopped the Trump administration from putting Obama-era environmental rules on the chopping block.
These rules protected Americans from things like mercury and other toxic metals emitted from oil and coal-fired power plants.
I'd say it's unbelievable, but nothing is beyond the pale to this administration.
If you're able this Earth Day, will you support our work to defeat Trump and elect Democrats who will act on climate?
But while Trump rolls back environmental protections in Washington, D.C., Oregon Democrats are fighting back.
It may feel like forever ago, but it was a little over a month ago that Governor Kate Brown took bold action to protect our environment and act on climate, signing an executive order giving Oregon the most ambitious plans in the country for reducing carbon emissions.
And today — as we celebrate an Earth Day unlike any other — is an important reminder that even as we begin to emerge from what is hopefully the worst of this public health crisis, we still have much to do to address the climate crisis.
Oregonians and Americans are showing incredible solidarity right now, committing themselves to stay at home in order to halt the spread of this virus and protect vulnerable communities and the front-line workers — people working in hospitals, at grocery stores, in public transportation, delivering our mail, and more — who are most at risk.
It is this spirit of collective action that we'll need to harness in the years ahead in order to act on climate.
Governor Brown's strong action in March to cut climate pollution and transition Oregon to a clean energy economy was a direct result of Oregon Democrats like you organizing and mobilizing voters to re-elect her in 2018.
But if we're going to sustain that progress and truly make an impact on climate for future generations, we need your support to put more Democrats in office all across Oregon, in Congress, and in the White House.
A vote for Oregon Democrats is a vote for a cleaner, healthier, more livable planet. If you're able, please chip in $5, $10, $25, or whatever you can to elect Oregon Democrats up and down the ballot in 2020.

Happy Earth Day!

Alex,
It is my honor to announce that the 2020 Wayne Morse Award for Integrity and Passion will be presented to Benton County Commissioner Annabelle Jaramillo!
Join us this coming Tuesday, September 22nd, as we honor and celebrate Annabelle at the 11th Annual Wayne Morse (Virtual) Gala! Senator Tammy Duckworth, Senator Jeff Merkley and other great Democratic leaders will be speaking live. Tickets are pay-what-you-can, get yours at [[URL REDACTED]]!
Photo of Annabelle Jaramillo
After serving as Governor John Kitzhaber’s Citizens’ Representative from 1995 to 2000, Annabelle was first elected to the Benton County Board of Commissioners in November 2000, and has dedicated her life to the service of others.
As a child in Colorado, Annabelle was enrolled in a segregated grade school; her mother pushed the school to integrate and she became the first student of color in her classroom. This and other experiences inspired Annabelle to support civil rights and LGBT rights throughout her life. In 1991 in Corvallis, she managed a successful campaign to defeat a discriminatory charter amendment promoted by the Oregon Citizens Alliance. In 2004, the Benton County Commission decided to stop issuing all marriage licenses – straight and gay – in response to a demand by Attorney General Hardy Myers that they not issue licenses to same-sex couples. Annabelle stated that, “If we were going to end up with discrimination, we weren’t going to issue marriage licenses to anyone.”
As a county commissioner, she has served on the Association of Oregon Counties Board, Legislative Committee and Public Lands and Natural Resources Committee; the Council of Forest Trust Lands Counties; and the National Association of Counties Environment, Energy and Land Use Steering Committee. Additionally, she served on the Siuslaw National Forest and United States Bureau of Land Management Salem District Resource Advisory Committees.
In her political life, Annabelle has served the Democratic Party of Oregon as the State Party Treasurer, the Chair of the DPO’s Platform and Resolutions Committee, as Chair of the Benton County Democrats, and in countless roles serving Democrats seeking higher office.
Annabelle has always valued mentorship and building up our party’s young leaders. Annabelle is retiring at the end of her current Commission term, which concludes in January.
The Wayne Morse Award for Integrity and Passion was created to honor the outstanding Democrat who best exemplifies the passion and integrity of Senator Wayne Morse. I am so proud that we are recognizing her lifetime of service to Oregonians with this award.
I hope you'll join me and Oregon Democrats this coming Tuesday, September 22nd, at 6 p.m. to honor and celebrate Annabelle, and hear from Democratic leaders like Senator Jeff Merkley, our Keynote Speaker Senator Tammy Duckworth, and more.
The Gala is a pay-what-you-can event for the first time ever this year! We know it's going to be a great evening, and we want as many Oregon Democrats as possible to attend. Get your tickets at [[URL REDACTED]]!

Democratic Party of Oregon,democrats@dpo.org,Ballots for the May Democratic Primary go out this week!,"Thanks to vote-by-mail, Oregon can hold our elections safely and securely.
Hi Alex —
The voter registration deadline for the upcoming May Democratic primary in Oregon is this Tuesday, April 28th.
That means if you want to vote in the 2020 Oregon Democratic Primary, you need to make sure you are registered as a Democrat!
Here's where you can do that:
Register to Vote!
Update your Voter Registration
We've long known that Trump isn't fit to lead this country. But his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic has made it abundantly clear that we need a Democrat in the White House.
And with Mitch McConnell saying he'd sooner let cities and states declare bankruptcy than support additional federal relief, we need to take the Senate out of his control.
Make sure your voter registration is up to date before the Tuesday deadline at [[URL REDACTED]]
Thank you,
— Team Oregon Dems

Subject: Will you help stop Trump’s voter suppression?
To: <[[EMAIL_REDACTED]]>
Alex,
Does it make your blood boil to hear Trump bash vote-by-mail? Me too. The benefits of vote-by-mail are more evident now than ever. And yet, our voting rights, and vote-by-mail itself, are under attack across the country.
Donald Trump wants to end vote-by-mail — the safest and most accessible form of voting. Period. As your Secretary of State, I will defend Oregon’s trailblazing vote-by-mail system, ensure that every Oregonian’s vote counts, and help any state that wants to adopt vote-by-mail.
I need your help to get there. Donate Now.
There’s so much at stake this election, and here in Oregon we need to do more than just protect ballot access — we need to expand ballot access. That’s why I’m running for Secretary of State, and that’s why I need your help. Every dollar you donate will help me fight for Oregon’s democracy. Can I count on you?
Donate Now
This fight isn’t new to me. In the legislature, I helped pass Oregon’s groundbreaking Motor Voter law, enrolling hundreds of thousands of Oregonians to vote for the first time. I also championed the paid postage law that went into effect this spring, ensuring that vote-by-mail is free for all Oregonians. These laws were milestones in expanding voting access, but we have more work to do. As Secretary of State, I vow to fight for fairness and uphold integrity in our election system.
When everyone’s voice is heard and every vote counts, change happens. Together we can make sure that progress is within reach for all Oregonians. If you’re able, please chip in to help us protect and expand ballot access in Oregon.
Thank you,
Shemia Fagan

Alex,
We've been waiting four years for this moment.
Four years of heartbreak, righteous anger, frustration, sorrow, and disbelief — interspersed with moments of joy, solidarity, community, inspiration, and hope.
Today, as ballots start to arrive with Oregonians, we begin to pull our nation out of the darkness of the last four years, and take it back and build it back better and stronger than it was before.
Over the next three weeks, we are going to fight like hell to reach as many Democratic voters as possible so we can elect Oregon Democrats up and down the ballot.
This is the most important election of our lifetimes, and I've never been more ready or excited to cast my ballot.
I hope you'll join me in voting early for Oregon Democrats, and to support our ongoing work toward making Oregon a beacon of opportunity, tolerance, and freedom.
Thank you,

Will you add your name to this petition calling on Congress to prohibit Trump's police state tactics in our cities?
Add your name
Over the last two weeks, Trump's federal officers have repeatedly assaulted and teargassed peaceful protesters, with no regard for the fact that we are in the middle of a pandemic. These protesters are our mothers, our fathers, our siblings, our children, our coworkers, our friends and our neighbors.
Trump's occupying troops are also roaming the streets of downtown Portland in unmarked vans and in camouflage, rounding up people and detaining them with no explanation or identification. They're not backing down, and are threatening to bring these tactics to cities across America.
This is unacceptable — and we're not backing down either. We're joining a coalition of leading Democrats to fight back against this threat to our democracy, and call on Congress to prohibit Trump's police state tactics in our cities.
Can we count on you to add your voice, Alex? Sign this petition today.

Alex,
Did you catch Michelle and Barack Obama's speeches last week?
Their remarks were urgent and stressed just how important it is that we VOTE this fall:
Michelle Obama quote: “Being president doesn’t change who you are; it reveals who you are. Well, a presidential election can reveal who we are, too. And four years ago, too many people chose  to believe that their  votes didn’t matter.”Barack Obama quote: “This president and those in power ... they know they can’t win you over with their policies, so they’re hoping to make it as hard as possible for you to vote, and to convince you that your vote doesn’t matter. That’s how they win.”
We're already turning Michelle and Barack's words into action. Just this past weekend, we kicked off our 2020 Coordinated Campaign with staff and more than 150 volunteers contacting Democratic voters all across Oregon!
We're ready to do everything we can to elect Democrats up and down the ballot, and we need your support to make sure we don't leave anything on the table.

Oregon Dems,democrats@dpo.org,House Democrats act to undo Trump's USPS rollbacks,"Democrats are defending the U.S. Postal Service from Trump's attacks
Democratic Party of Oregon Logo
Alex,
Democrats in the House of Representatives are fighting back to undo Trump's rollbacks at the U.S. Postal Service.
After Trump installed Republican megadonor Louis DeJoy as Postmaster General, DeJoy wasted no time to implement controversial changes at the USPS, including overtime restrictions, as well as removing mail sorting machines and hundreds of Postal Service boxes locations in Oregon and across the country.
Today, House Democrats passed the Delivering for America Act, which would undo the changes DeJoy has already made, and block him from making any more until the COVID-19 pandemic is over.
Democrats are defending the U.S. Postal Service from Trump's attacks, but the only way we can truly stop these threats is to defeat Trump this fall. If you're able, will you chip in to elect Democrats up and down the ballot this fall?
Donate
All of Oregon's Democratic Congressional Delegation — Reps. DeFazio, Blumenauer, Schrader, and Bonamici — voted ""YES"" on the Delivering for America Act.
The Act will provide new funding for the USPS, prohibit the removal of mail sorting machines and mailboxes, reverse DeJoy's changes at the Postal Service, and require the USPS to treat all official election mail as First-Class mail.
But now the bill heads to Mitch McConnell's Senate, where important legislation that will help regular Americans goes to die.
Trump is holding the USPS hostage, and McConnell is standing in the way of every effort to stop Trump's sabotage. They need to go.
This is the most important election of our lifetimes, and together we need to make sure we do everything we can to defeat Trump and take the Senate out of Mitch McConnell's control.
That starts with you, Alex. Will you make a donation to the Democratic Party of Oregon today? Remember, you can use your 2020 Oregon Political Tax Credit to give – it's like a free $50 donation.

Hi Alex,
Join Senator Ron Wyden this Wednesday, April 22nd, for our next Democracy Webinar: National Vote-By-Mail!
Oregon has used vote-by-mail for more than two decades — it’s a safe, secure, and commonsense way to run an election. Oregon has proven that vote-by-mail increases accessibility to the ballot and allows more people to participate.
Now, during a global pandemic unlike any of us have seen in our lifetimes, Republicans are working to force American voters to choose between their health and exercising their right to vote. We won't stand for this.
Oregon Democrats, led by Senators Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley, are fighting to make sure the Oregon way of voting — universal vote-by-mail — is the way all of America votes.
Join our next Democracy Webinar: National Vote-By-Mail on Wednesday, April 22nd at 1:45 pm.
Learn about the National Vote-By-Mail bill, ask Senator Wyden questions, and help us spread the word that vote-by-mail is effective and allows more Oregonians and Americans to vote safely!
You will need a computer or tablet (or you can call in). This webinar will be appropriate for children if they want to join, too!
To join us for our next Democracy Webinar, please RSVP today.
See you (virtually) soon,
KC Hanson

Tomorrow is the last day to use your 2019 Oregon Political Tax Credit!
It's like a free $50 donation to support our work in 2020 to defeat Trump and elect Oregon Democrats.
And if you give today, a generous donor will MATCH your contribution! Alex: Will you make your end-of-year donation to the Democratic Party of Oregon?
Donate today and DOUBLE your impact
It's a credit, not a deduction — but you have to use it before 2019 ends!
It's simple: Qualifying Oregon taxpayers can give up to $50 per year (or $100 for joint-filing couples) to a state political party, and receive the full amount as a credit subtracted from your Oregon state taxes when you file.
And with so much on the line in 2020, every single dollar we can raise in the next 36 hours will make a huge difference over the next 11 months.
I know we can defeat Trump, take the Senate out of Mitch McConnell's control, replace Greg Walden, and elect Democrats up and down the ballot in Oregon — but only if we're in this together. Use your Oregon Political Tax Credit to give $50, $100, or whatever you can today and your gift will be matched.

KC Hanson,democrats@dpo.org,Senator Tammy Duckworth is our Wayne Morse (Virtual) Gala Keynote Speaker!,"I am so thrilled to share this exciting news.
Democratic Party of Oregon Logo
Alex,
I am so thrilled to share this exciting news: Senator Tammy Duckworth is our Keynote Speaker for the 11th Annual Wayne Morse (Virtual) Gala, happening on Tuesday, September 22nd!
Senator Duckworth has served our country on multiple fronts: as a U.S. Army helicopter pilot, as U.S. Assistant Secretary of Veterans Affairs, and then as a Member of Congress, acting as a voice for Illinois' working families in the U.S. House for four years before she was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2016.
She knows and understands what it means to sacrifice for our nation. Her unit was mobilized during Operation Iraqi Freedom, and in 2004 her Black Hawk helicopter was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade. She lost both legs and partial use of her right arm in the explosion, yet despite her injuries she continued to serve in the Illinois Army National Guard until she retired from the military in 2014.
During her time in office, Senator Duckworth has been a strong voice for working families, civil rights, and more, and is dedicated to her lifelong mission of supporting, protecting, and keeping the promises we've made to our Veterans.
Senator Duckworth is the first woman with a disability elected to Congress, is one of only three Asian-American women to ever serve in the Senate, and is the first Senator to give birth while in office, securing a historic change to Senate rules to allow Senators to bring their infant children onto the Senate floor during votes.
I cannot wait for Senator Duckworth to join us as our Keynote Speaker for the 11th Annual Wayne Morse (Virtual) Gala!
Get your tickets today!
I hope to see you (virtually) at the Gala!

Democratic Party of Oregon,democrats@dpo.org,Get Trump's occupying troops out of Portland,"You'd expect these tactics from dictatorships and authoritarian governments, not in a democratic society.
Democratic Party of Oregon Logo
Alex,
What Trump and his secret military police are doing in Portland must stop, now.
Federal officers are roaming the streets of downtown Portland in unmarked vans and in camouflage, rounding up people and detaining them with no explanation or identification.
They're assaulting peaceful protestors with potentially deadly munitions and tear gas, in the middle of a pandemic.
They're trampling over our constitutional rights as a political stunt to try to stop the bleeding of Trump's flailing re-election campaign.
You'd expect these tactics from dictatorships and authoritarian governments, not in a democratic society. Oregon Democrats won't stand for this.
Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum is suing the Trump administration, asking for a restraining order to prevent federal law enforcement from making any further arrests.
And Senators Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley are on their way back to Washington, D.C., right now to take action. They're demanding answers, and are introducing a measure to require Trump to remove these unwanted goon squads from America's streets.
Oregon Democrats are working to get Trump's secret police out of Portland, but the only way we will truly put an end to this is to defeat Trump, take back the Senate, and elect Democrats up and down the ballot this November.
Will you help do that, Alex? If you're able, please make a donation to the Democratic Party of Oregon today.

The Oregon Political Tax Credit is like a free $50 donation for Oregon taxpayers, once a year. Have you used yours, Alex?
Countdown clock to the end of September 2020
We're just a few hours away from our last major fundraising deadline before ballots go out to Oregon voters.
There's never been a better and more critical time to use your 2020 Oregon Political Tax Credit to make a donation to the Democratic Party of Oregon. Can we count on your support?
Use your Oregon Political Tax Credit ➞
Here's how it works: If you're an Oregon taxpayer making under $75,000, you can give up to $50 per year to a state political party and receive the full amount as a credit subtracted from your Oregon state taxes when you file (If you're part of a joint-filing couple, you can give up to $100 a year, but you only qualify if you make less than $150,000).
We are just 34 days away from the most important election of our lifetimes. The stakes are simply too high to not do everything we can to make sure we defeat Trump and elect Democrats up and down the ballot.
The Oregon Political Tax Credit is like a free $50 donation to the Democratic Party of Oregon. And with less than two weeks until Oregonians begin voting, and just 34 days until ballots need to be in, we can't leave anything on the table.

Alex,
It's a credit, not a deduction — but you have to use it before the clock strikes midnight on December 31st.
With the Oregon Political Tax Credit, most Oregonians can give $50 to the Democratic Party of Oregon and get that money back as a credit when they file their taxes.
And if you give today, your donation will be MATCHED dollar-for-dollar. Will you double the impact of your Oregon Political Tax Credit today?
Want to know if you qualify? It's easy to figure out:
✔ I am an Oregon resident
✔ I will submit an Oregon tax return for 2019
✔ I made less than $100,000 in 2019 or $200,000 for joint-filing couples
That's all it takes to qualify, Alex.
With your help, we can defeat Trump, take the Senate out of Mitch McConnell's control, replace Greg Walden, and elect Democrats up and down the ballot in Oregon.

Democratic Party of Oregon,democrats@dpo.org,BREAKING: Trump moves to cut Social Security and Medicare,"Make no mistake: Social Security and Medicare are on the ballot this November.
Democratic Party of Oregon Logo
Alex,
Donald Trump is laying the groundwork to make big cuts to Social Security and Medicare.
Trump signed Executive Orders this weekend that would delay the collection of payroll taxes, which fund Social Security and Medicare.
At a time when seniors and people with disabilities are struggling to deal with the threat of COVID-19, Trump is putting their hard-earned Social Security and Medicare in danger, and threatening to cut off a critical lifeline in this moment of uncertainty.
As with so many of Trump's actions these days, it's unclear whether his actions are even legal. And what's more, they could create a huge tax bill for workers and small businesses in December.
Make no mistake: Social Security and Medicare are on the ballot this November. If Trump wins, he's promised to permanently cut the funding for these vital programs that hundreds of millions of Americans rely on.
Democrats will never stop fighting to protect Social Security and Medicare. But we need your help to make sure we defeat Trump and elect Oregon Democrats up and down the ballot this fall. If you're able, will you chip in $5, $10, $25, or whatever you can to support our work?

P.S. You can qualify for the Oregon Political Tax Credit if you're an Oregon taxpayer making under $75,000, or $150,000 per year as part of a joint-filing couple. If you qualify, you can give up to $50 per year to a state political party and receive the full amount as a credit subtracted from your Oregon state taxes when you file (If you're part of a joint-filing couple, you can give up to $100 a year).

Governor Kate Brown,democrats@dpo.org,Every vote matters!,"And we need your help to turn out Democratic voters this fall
Democratic Party of Oregon Logo
Every vote matters, Alex.
I should know — when I ran in my first primary election to serve in the Oregon State Legislature, I won that that race by just seven votes.
Seven votes! So when I say that every vote matters, trust me: I know from experience.
That's why I'm asking you today: Will you sign up to volunteer with the Democratic Party of Oregon for the 2020 election? You can help turn out Democratic voters from the comfort of your own home!
Sign up to Volunteer
The stakes of this year's election couldn't be higher: We've got to send Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to the White House, and take the U.S. Senate out of Mitch McConnell's control.
And here in Oregon, there are critical races happening up and down the ballot that could come down to the wire — from Congressional races, to electing Shemia Fagan as our next Secretary of State, to defending and expanding our Democratic majorities in the Oregon House and Senate.
Oregon has had our fair share of close elections over the last few years. In 2016, two Oregon Senate elections were decided by fewer than 400 votes. And in 2018, an Oregon Senate race was decided by just 209 votes!
The Democratic Party of Oregon is ready to run their massive voter mobilization efforts over the next month, but they need you to help and volunteer to make sure we can reach as many Oregon Democratic voters as possible this fall.
With so much on the line during the 2020 elections, will you volunteer and help turn out Democratic voters?
Sign up at [[URL REDACTED]], or click here to find an upcoming volunteer event.
Thanks,
– Kate

Alex,
After a lifetime of breaking barriers and fighting for equality, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is still making history. Today, she became the first woman in U.S. history to lie in state at the U.S. Capitol.
As we mourn Justice Ginsburg's passing, and say goodbye to a groundbreaking American icon, we are now faced with the task of protecting her legacy, and are reminded once more of the massive stakes of this year's election.
The Affordable Care Act is on the ballot.
Roe v. Wade is on the ballot.
LGBTQ rights are on the ballot.
Voting rights. Climate action. Campaign finance. They are all on the ballot this fall.
We are ready to fight like hell to defend RBG's legacy and continue her life's work of creating a better and more just country. Make no mistake, this is going to be a tough fight. But if we're going to succeed, we need you by our side.
Will you chip in to make sure we defeat Trump, take the Senate out of Mitch McConnell's control, and elect Democrats up and down the ballot who will fight to honor and defend Justice Ginsburg's legacy?

Brad Martin,democrats@dpo.org,Daily reminders of the need for change this fall,"Trump and his administration’s actions make it abundantly clear
Democratic Party of Oregon Logo
Alex,
Through Trump and his administration’s actions — from their mishandling of the coronavirus outbreak, to their complete disregard and disdain for our constitutional rights, to threats of violence against Americans protesting for racial justice — we're reminded each and every day just how critical it is that we defeat Trump and Republicans this fall.
Our work to elect Oregon Democrats at the state and local level is just one way to help bring about the systemic change that Oregonians and Americans are calling for — and it's a goal that the Democratic Party of Oregon is deeply committed to deliver on.
It's going to take all of us working together to make sure we elect Oregon Democrats up and down the ballot this fall. If you're able, will you support that work by making a donation today?
Donate
Oregon Democrats have taken two big steps toward that goal in the last few weeks.
First, thanks in part to all our work together and democratic policies like online and automatic voter registration, there are now more than one million registered Democrats in Oregon! This remarkable achievement is a testament to what we already knew: Democrats are more energized and better organized than ever before.
Second, we’ve signed up 1,500 Neighborhood Leaders who have committed to turn out more than 100,000 Democrats this November. That’s huge!
I’m writing to give you these updates, but also to ask you to consider making a contribution to the Democratic Party of Oregon if you are able. And I want you to know you’ll join the nearly 1,000 grassroots donors who pitched in last month to keep the Party hard at work even during these challenging times.
Your grassroots support allows us to do the work we need to defeat Donald Trump and elect Senator Jeff Merkley, our great Congressional team, Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum, Treasurer Tobias Read, Shemia Fagan as Secretary of State, and defend and expand our Democratic majorities in the Legislature. Donate to the Democratic Party of Oregon today.
Donate $5
Donate $10
Donate $25
Donate another amount
Trump's Team is already on the ground in Oregon, buying ads and rallying his base, and we know Republicans will do anything to keep control of the Secretary of State’s office and attack our legislative majorities.
But the Democratic Party of Oregon knows how to turn out Democratic voters and win. Even amid a pandemic, Oregonians are shattering voter turnout records, and more Oregonians voted in May's primary than in any other previous primary in Oregon’s history!
Support from Oregon Democrats like you allow us to maximize the impact of our get-out-the-vote programs, so we can elect more Democrats to every level of office.
If there is one thing that this crisis has made abundantly clear, it’s that Donald Trump is supremely unfit to lead our country. America simply cannot afford another four years of Trump. Lives are at stake.
We need your help now to make sure we can do everything it's going to take to defeat Trump and elect Democrats in November. Please consider donating to the Democratic Party of Oregon today.
Thanks for all you do,
Brad Martin
Executive Director

Alex,
I always look forward to the Wayne Morse Gala, and this year is no different.
Even though we won't be able to meet in person, we'll still be ""together"" virtually, and I'm so excited for Oregon Democrats to hear from the Gala's Keynote Speaker, Senator Tammy Duckworth, and other Democratic leaders as we get ready for the home stretch of this critical election.
Will you join me this coming Tuesday, September 22, at the 11th Annual Wayne Morse Gala? For the first time ever, the Gala is going to be all online and pay-what-you can to attend!
Get tickets
As Co-Chair of the Democratic Attorneys General Association, I am so proud of the work we've done in Oregon and across the country to fight back against the Trump administration.
We've taken action to stop their attacks on our environment, on reproductive freedoms, on the Census, and more. We just won a huge decision to block the changes Trump and his Postmaster General made at the Postal Service to try to slow down mail ahead of an election where historic numbers of Americans are expected to use the Postal Service to vote by mail. And with the fate of the Supreme Court and our constitutional rights in jeopardy, the stakes of this year's election have never been higher.
I can't wait for you to join us on Tuesday to celebrate this big win and get ready for the work we need to do over the next 43 days to defeat Trump.
The 11th Annual Wayne Morse Gala is going to be a wonderful evening with incredible Democratic leaders like Senator Tammy Duckworth, Senator Jeff Merkley, and more. Don't wait any longer, get your tickets today at [[URL REDACTED]]!

Democratic Party of Oregon Logo
Alex,
Vote-by-mail isn't just a safe and secure way to run an election — it's also keeping Trump up at night.
Trump has called vote-by-mail the ""biggest risk"" to his re-election hopes. And in his latest 3 a.m. tweet, Trump raged against the prospect of more Americans voting by mail in this fall's election.
That's because he knows that people are done with his divisiveness, his hate, and his administration's incompetence. And if more Americans can vote safely without having to choose between their health and their right to vote this fall, Trump knows that he will lose.
Here in Oregon, we've been voting by mail for more than 20 years. And even during a pandemic, Oregonians turned out in record numbers in this May's Primary, thanks in large part to vote-by-mail.
The time is now for National Vote-By-Mail. Add your name to support a bill from Senators Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley to expand Oregon-Style Vote-By-Mail to all American voters this year.
I support National Vote-By-Mail!
Add your name in support of National Vote By Mail NOW

Alex, I will never stop leading the fight for bold, lasting progressive change.
Neither will the Democratic Party of Oregon.
I'm so proud to stand alongside them in the fight to push back against Trump's hateful and divisive agenda, and create a safer, more equitable, healthier, and more economically secure nation.
That's why I'm asking: Will you make a donation to the Democratic Party of Oregon and help elect Oregon Democrats up and down the ballot in 2020?
Donate
November's election is about more than Donald Trump. It's about making sure Democrats take back control of Congress and bring a strong, progressive vision to America.
What does that mean?
It's an America where health care is a human right.
It's an America committed to bold action to combat the climate crisis.
It's one where we end gun violence, enact real campaign finance reform, lower prescription drug prices, and stand up for and treat our immigrant neighbors with kindness, compassion, and respect.
Thanks to Democrats like you, we've already made incredible progress on many of these issues here in Oregon.
But our fight isn't over until we can bring about this progressive change for everyone in America.
Alex, it's up to us to fight for our progressive values in 2020. Join me and support the Democratic Party of Oregon in this fight by making your end-of-year donation today.

KC Hanson,democrats@dpo.org,Defend the Affordable Care Act,"Ten years ago today, President Barack Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law.
Alex,
Ten years ago today, President Barack Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law — expanding access to health care for tens of millions of Americans.
Today, even as the world and our nation faces the COVID-19 pandemic, Donald Trump and his administration are fighting to dismantle and destroy the ACA.
Thankfully, our elected Oregon Democrats are fighting tooth and nail to defend the Affordable Care Act, from beating back dozens of Republican repeal efforts in Congress, to our Attorney General defending the law in the courts.
On today's 10-year anniversary of the Affordable Care Act, join me in supporting the work of Oregon Democrats here at home and in Washington, D.C., to defend the ACA and ensure that health care is a right for all Americans.
Add your name
Thank you,
KC Hanson

Oregon Democrats,democrats@dpo.org,"Trump calls the USPS “a joke""","The USPS is the target of Trump's latest extortion racket.
Alex,
The target of Trump's latest extortion racket? The U.S. Postal Service.
At a bill signing this morning, Trump called the USPS ""a joke"" and confirmed reports that he's threatening to withhold $10 billion from the Postal Service unless it agrees to make huge, damaging changes to the way it operates.
Help build the support it's going to take to fight back against Trump and Republicans' efforts to weaken the USPS. Will you add your name?
Help #SaveTheUSPS
What kind of changes are Trump and his administration demanding as ransom to keep the USPS running?
Things like quadrupling rates to ship packages, weakening postal service unions, and reducing services.
Here's the truth:
* The U.S. Postal Service is a critical lifeline that keeps us connected, supplied, and safe.
* It provides an opportunity for many Americans to earn a middle-class living, and is one of the nation's largest employers of veterans and people of color.
* The USPS is consistently among the most popular federal agencies!
During this global pandemic, vote-by-mail is the safest way to hold safe and accessible elections. We must make our voices heard, and make sure the USPS is funded and fully functioning.
Fight back against Trump's latest extortion racket and help #SaveTheUSPS.
Add my name!
Thank you,
– Oregon Dems

Democratic Party of Oregon,democrats@dpo.org,Statement from Democratic Party of Oregon Leadership on Protests and Police Violence,"Democratic Party of Oregon Logo
Alex,
The Democratic Party has not lived up to our Party's vision for true equality. This is why we are recommitting ourselves to the actions necessary to bring about needed changes that are so long overdue. Our eyes are open, we share the anger, and we stand in humble solidarity with all who are working to bring about critical cultural transformation.
We stand united with millions of people around the world in our condemnation of police violence against George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, Tony McDade, Philando Castile, Alton Sterling, and far too many other innocent black Americans whose lives were taken way too soon. Black lives matter. They are precious, glorious, and irreplaceable.
In these most extraordinary times, anger and frustration about the status quo is not just understandable, but justified. Violence and destruction are not. We will march shoulder to shoulder with those who have taken to the streets to peacefully protest. Making our voices heard is a moral imperative. If we want to bring about real systemic change, then the choice isn’t between protests and politics. We have to do both.
At a time when our nation is suffering under misguided and malevolent leadership that seeks to divide us and turn back the clock to a supposed “greater” America, we know that the greatness of our nation is in its diversity. And as we work to take back our democracy, we must move forward with a full understanding of our historical strengths and weaknesses. That means fighting against the forces that seek to divide us — including fascists, right-wing agitators, and those inclined to incite violence for violence’s sake.
DPO Black Caucus Chair, Rosa Colquitt, PhD, said it best last week when she wrote:
The very core of both our Platform and our belief system as Democrats is about the equality of all. But in the wake of yet another senseless killing, we face the sad reality that our advocacy and even our most heartfelt, passionate beliefs were not enough to save George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, Tony McDade, and the thousands who came before.
As the leadership of the Democratic Party of Oregon, we demand the public right to equal treatment before the law — regardless of race, ethnicity, religion, age, gender identity, sexual orientation, national origin, physical ability, or economic means.
We see and understand ""unequal justice before the law."" In this tragic moment in history, we will work tirelessly to elect candidates who demand and act on reform to bring real systemic change for Black Americans and all other communities of color. With our eyes firmly on the prize, we will work with those who are striving to create a just and prosperous future for all.

Alex,
When Oregonians re-elected our Democratic Congressional Team in 2018, we sent them back to Washington, D.C., as part of a Democratic Majority in the House of Representatives.
They wasted no time, passing bill after bill with real solutions on issues that matter for Oregonians like you and me ... issues like tackling the climate crisis, lowering outrageous drug prices, gun safety, protecting our democracy, and more.
But nearly every single one of those bills has been blocked and stonewalled by Mitch McConnell, who has turned the Senate into a legislative graveyard.
We need your help to make sure we flip the Senate in 2020. Chip in $10, $50, or whatever you can to the Democratic Party of Oregon.
Donate today
Here are some of the bills still waiting for a vote, despite having broad support from voters:
H.R. 1: For the People Act
H.R. 3: Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act
H.R. 4: Voting Rights Advancement Act of 2019
H.R. 5: The Equality Act
H.R. 6: The American Dream and Promise Act
H.R. 7: The Paycheck Fairness Act
H.R. 8: The Bipartisan Background Checks Act
H.R. 9: The Climate Action Now Act
H.R.1585: Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2019
There's so much at stake in 2020. But this election is about more than defeating Trump and electing a Democrat to the Oval Office.
It's also about taking the Senate out of Mitch McConnell's control, so we can pass bills like these that will make an immediate and major impact on the lives of regular Oregonians and Americans.
That starts with re-electing Senator Jeff Merkley and our great team of Democratic Congressional Representatives. Will you make your end-of-year donation to the Democratic Party of Oregon today?

KC Hanson,democrats@dpo.org,Resources to stay informed about the Oregon wildfires,"Democratic Party of Oregon Logo
Alex,
First off, I hope that you and your loved ones are safe and out of harm's way right now.
Our thoughts are with all of the Oregon families affected by these terrifying and devastating wildfires, and we are so incredibly thankful for the brave and hardworking firefighters and other first responders putting their lives on the line to protect Oregonians.
If you're in an area near the fires, the most important thing to do right now is to be prepared, be ready to evacuate, and listen to the warnings and directions of local authorities.
The situation on the ground when dealing with wildfires can change in an instant, and one of the best things you can do is stay informed about what's happening in your area. To help, we've pulled together a list of resources from the State of Oregon and many of the affected counties to help you stay up to date:
* Oregon Wildfire Resources
* State of Oregon Fires and Hotspots Dashboard
* Clackamas County Wildfire Information
* Jackson County Wildfire Information
* Lane County Wildfire Information
* Marion County Wildfire Information
* Linn County Wildfire Information
* Lincoln County Wildfire Information
Even if you're not directly impacted by the wildfires, the smoke is spreading all across Oregon and making the air quality incredibly dangerous for people, especially those with chronic health conditions. For more information about the health threats from wildfire smoke and what you can do, click here.
If you're looking for other ways to help, we'd encourage you to consider making a donation to the Red Cross Cascades, the Oregon Food Bank, or a local non-profit relief organization. For everyone's safety, donations of clothing/household goods are not helpful at the moment, and a great way to support the work of these crucial relief organizations is by chipping in what you can.
This is a snapshot of the resources we've found right now, but as I mentioned above, the situation is constantly changing, We will continue to monitor the situation and share additional resources on our Twitter page.
From all of us here at the Democratic Party of Oregon, please stay safe.

Oregon Democrats,democrats@dpo.org,Trump: “We want to terminate health care under Obamacare”,"The worst public health crisis of our lifetimes isn't enough to stop Trump from trying to dismantle Obamacare.
Alex,
Even a global pandemic that has claimed the lives of at least 75,000 Americans isn't enough to stop Trump from trying to dismantle Obamacare.
Trump didn't mince words yesterday when announcing that he has no plans to stop his administration's lawsuit to destroy the entire Affordable Care Act. He told reporters in the Oval Office: “We want to terminate health care under Obamacare.”
Oregon Democrats aren't letting Trump take away our health care without a fight, and Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum is leading the charge to defend the ACA at the Supreme Court. Will you add your name to support the ACA and Attorney General Rosenblum's efforts to protect health care for millions of Americans?
Yes: We need to protect the ACA!
So what happens if Trump's lawsuit is successful, and the Affordable Care Act is overturned?
It would take health care away from 20 million Americans, and strip protections for the 133 million Americans with pre-existing conditions. It could even threaten free access to a coronavirus vaccine once it's developed — something that's currently covered by the ACA.
Unsurprisingly, Trump has no plan to replace any parts of the ACA if his lawsuit succeeds, just like he's had no plan at all to respond to the COVID-19 crisis.
It's despicable: We're in the middle of the worst public health crisis of our lifetimes — and Trump is still trying to rip health care away from tens of millions of Americans.
Add your name to support Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum in the fight to protect the Affordable Care Act.
Add my name!

Oregon Democrats,democrats@dpo.org,Trump's changes at the USPS threaten vote-by-mail,"Trump's major donor turned Postmaster is pushing big changes that could have major consequences for our elections
Democratic Party of Oregon Logo
Alex,
FIRST: Trump attacks the U.S. Postal Service, calling it ""a joke"" and threatens to withhold $10 billion from the USPS unless it agrees to make huge, damaging changes to the way it operates.
THEN: Trump installs one of his cronies, ""a top donor to President Trump and the Republican National Committee,"" to the critical job of Postmaster General.
NOW: Trump's major donor/Postmaster pushes major changes that could slow mail delivery — including vote-by-mail ballots — and threaten the agency altogether.
Add your name to #SaveTheUSPS
Oregon Democrats know and understand how important the U.S. Postal Service is for so many Oregonians and Americans, especially people living in rural areas, seniors, and veterans.
As one of the nation's largest employers of veterans and people of color, it provides an important opportunity for many Americans to earn a middle-class living, while keeping America connected, supplied, and safe.
And amid a pandemic, we need to make sure the USPS is funded and fully functioning in order to hold our vote-by-mail elections — the safest way to hold free and fair elections right now.
No one should have to choose between their health and their right to vote. Help us #SaveTheUSPS to make sure we protect this critical agency, and protect free, fair, and safe elections.

In less than three weeks, Oregonians will start getting their ballots in the mail.
Not long after that Oregonians will start voting, returning their completed ballots to an official drop box or putting them in the mail!
That means that time is of the essence — and we only have so many more weeks to make sure Oregon Democrats check or update their voter registration before ballots go out, to give them the tools they need to make a plan to vote, and mobilize Democrats in every single Oregon ZIP code to complete and return their ballots!
That's why we're reaching out today with a special ask: Will you make a huge impact on the final weeks of the 2020 Election by making a weekly donation to the Democratic Party of Oregon?
Donate weekly ➞
Make no mistake, Alex: The next few weeks are going to be challenging.
But we know that with dedicated Oregon Democrats like you by our side, we can do everything it's going to take to elect Democrats up and down the ballot this fall.
Help make sure we can finish strong and mobilize as many Democratic voters as possible over the home stretch of this campaign by starting a weekly donation today.

KC Hanson,democrats@dpo.org,America simply cannot afford another four years of Trump.,"Lives are at stake.
Alex,
Like so many of us, the COVID-19 crisis has forced the Democratic Party of Oregon to make a lot of adjustments to our work.
Our staff has been primarily working from home for the better part of the last two weeks. We've had to cancel meetings, trainings, and events. And we've postponed the 11th Annual Wayne Morse Gala until September.
But throughout this, we cannot stop in our work to prepare for November's election.
If there is one thing that this crisis has made abundantly clear, it's that Donald Trump is supremely unfit to lead our country.
Oregonians and Americans alike are already paying dearly for the Trump administration's delay in a coordinating a federal response to this outbreak, and even more could be put at risk if Trump continues to prioritize his re-election campaign over the public's health and safety.
America simply cannot afford another four years of Trump. Lives are at stake.
We're making more and more changes to our outreach strategies every single day to account for our new reality — from resources that we're sharing with County Parties about responsible campaign tactics, to all-day training webinars to support Democrats running for office this spring.
But we have a lot of ground to make up in order to catch up to the fundraising goals we had set for our in-person events.
We know this is an extremely difficult time for all of us. But if you and your family can manage, we need your help to make sure we can do everything it's going to take to defeat Trump and elect Democrats in November: Please consider chipping in $10, $25, or whatever you can to help support our work in the next 7 months and beyond.
From all of us at the Democratic Party of Oregon, please stay healthy and safe.
KC Hanson
Chair
Democratic Party of Oregon

P.S. Our work is possible because of grassroots support, but we know that many Oregon families are hurting right now. If you'd like us to hold off on sending you fundraising messages during this time, please let us know by filling out this form.

Countdown clock to Election Day
With just 100 days left until Election Day, the stakes of this election have never been higher, Alex.
Trump is weaponizing federal law enforcement in Portland, trampling over our constitutional rights as a political stunt to try to stop the bleeding of his flailing re-election campaign.
Oregon Democrats are fighting back in the courts and in the halls of Congress. But the only way we will truly put an end to this is to defeat Trump, take back the Senate, and elect Democrats up and down the ballot this November.
As we enter the final stretch of the most important election of our lifetimes, will you chip in to help elect Democrats up and down the ballot?
Yes, I'll donate!
It's all hands on deck here at Team Oregon Dems.
We're working day in and day out to make sure we defeat Trump, re-elect Jeff Merkley, elect our slate of Democratic Congressional candidates, and more.
And with a Democrat running in every single Oregon Legislative district on the ballot in 2020, we need to make sure we turn out Democratic voters in every single Oregon ZIP code.
Election Day is in 100 days, Alex. Can we count on you to help elect Democrats all across Oregon by chipping in $10, $25, or whatever you can today?

KC Hanson,democrats@dpo.org,Want to help Democrats in Nevada?,"You can help from the comfort of your own home!
Alex,
Our friends at the Nevada Democratic Party are looking for volunteers to help their ""First in the West"" Caucus on February 22nd, and Oregon Democrats are invited!
Sign up to volunteer for the Nevada  Caucuses!
Nevada is critically important because it's an early battleground state that has turned deep blue over the last few election cycles.
In 2018, Nevada became the first state in the nation's history to elect more women than men to serve as state legislators. That historic event, of course, happened as Democrats took control of the Nevada Senate!
Nevada is the first opportunity in 2020 to lift up western issues and highlight our shared values, principles, and priorities. And it is our first step toward defeating Donald Trump in November!
If you are willing and able to help, fill out this form to get started. You can participate remotely from the comfort of your own home, or if you're feeling a bit more adventurous, you can be an on-the-ground volunteer at the Nevada Caucuses!
Once you’ve completed the form, you'll receive an email with more information.
The Nevada Dems look forward to working with Oregonians at the ""First in the West"" caucus this year, and we're excited to help make sure everything runs smoothly.

Alex,
First there was the crime: Trump abusing the power of his office, pressuring a foreign country to interfere in our elections for his own benefit, and then doing everything in his power to obstruct Congress' investigation.
Now, there's the cover-up. Mitch McConnell is working hand-in-hand with Trump to rush the impeachment trial, hiding important evidence and blocking key witnesses from testifying.
Americans want and deserve a fair, open trial. But it's clear that with Mitch McConnell in control of the Senate, we won't get anything resembling that.
No matter what happens in the impeachment trial, we need to be ready to do everything it takes to elect Democrats this November. And to do that, we need your help, Alex.
Will you donate to defeat Trump and take the Senate out of Mitch McConnell's control?

KC Hanson,democrats@dpo.org,BREAKING: One Million Oregon Democrats!,"Together, we are more than one million strong.
I've got big news, Alex: There are now more than one million registered Democrats in Oregon!
This makes the Democratic Party of Oregon the first political party in Oregon history with more than 1 million registered members.
Democrats believe that we’re greater together than we are on our own, and now — together — we are more than one million strong.
While Republicans have achieved a net increase of about 5,000 voters in the last year in Oregon, Democrats have seen a net increase of nearly 30,000.
That’s because more and more Oregonians agree with Democrats’ belief that this country succeeds when everyone gets a fair shot, everyone does their fair share, and everyone plays by the same rules.
As DNC Chair Tom Perez said earlier about this great news, “Republicans have a million reasons to be nervous today.""
We couldn't agree more, and we're ready to defeat Trump and his Republican enablers this fall. (If you're able, please consider chipping in today to support our work to elect Oregon Democrats in 2020.)
To each and every one of the one million Oregon Democrats (and counting) — THANK YOU!

That's why we're training Neighborhood Leaders — one of the most effective grassroots voter contact programs in Oregon politics and a driving force behind our big wins in 2018.

Democratic Party of Oregon,democrats@dpo.org,SCOTUS UPDATE: What Trump and Senate Republicans just did,"This was a vote to strike down the Affordable Care Act, to overturn Roe v. Wade, and more.
Democratic Party of Oregon Logo
Alex,
Senate Republicans just voted to confirm Amy Coney Barrett, Trump's nominee to the Supreme Court.
Let's be clear about what this vote was about:
This was a vote to strike down the Affordable Care Act and take health care away from tens of millions of Americans.
This was a vote to get rid of protections for pre-existing conditions.
This was a vote to overturn Roe v. Wade and an attack on reproductive rights.
Rather than taking action to provide relief for Oregonians and Americans struggling through the COVID pandemic, Trump and Republicans rushed through a Supreme Court nominee in an unprecedented power grab.
More than a million Oregonians have already voted. More than 60 million Americans have already cast their ballots. And this rushed confirmation makes clear what Trump and Republicans think about the voters who deserve a say in who chooses the successor to Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
Oregon's incredible Senators Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley have been steadfast in their opposition to this appointment. And if we're going to stop this from happening again, we need to make sure we take the Senate out of Mitch McConnell's control.
We're fighting like hell to defeat Trump and Republicans, and to elect Oregon Democrats up and down the ballot. The stakes have never been higher — help us win on November 3rd by making a donation today.

Hi Alex,
Our upcoming Democracy Webinar: National Vote-By-Mail with Senator Ron Wyden is happening tomorrow!
RSVP to join Oregon Dems and Senator Wyden tomorrow at 1:45 p.m.
Here in Oregon, we've been using vote-by-mail for more than two decades.
It's a safe, secure, and commonsense way to run an election, and amid the COVID-19 crisis no voter should have to choose between their health and exercising their right to vote.
That's why Senator Wyden has introduced a bill to expand vote-by-mail nationwide this November.
Join Senator Wyden and the Democratic Party of Oregon tomorrow to learn more about his bill, ask questions, and help us make the Oregon way of voting — universal vote-by-mail — how all of America votes.

Together we can defeat Trump, take the Senate out of Mitch McConnell's control, replace Greg Walden, and elect Democrats up and down the ballot in Oregon.

What we've been seeing all across Oregon over the last week has been nothing short of incredible.
In every corner of our state, from Portland to Burns, in Pendleton, Klamath Falls, Salem, John Day, and dozens of cities and towns across Oregon, folks are turning out to remind their communities that Black lives matter, and that it’s time for swift and significant change.

We stand united with millions of people around the world in our condemnation of police violence against George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, Tony McDade, Philando Castile, Alton Sterling, and far too many other Black Americans.
As Oregon Democrats, we are committing ourselves to the actions necessary to bring about needed changes that are so long overdue.
Our Democratic leaders in Congress are proposing bills for police reforms at the national level, and the Oregon Legislature's People of Color Caucus has called for specific actions this year to improve police accountability.

OR Dems,democrats@dpo.org,Trump installs top GOP donor to head the USPS,"This is bad news for the Postal Service, and bad news for our democracy.
Alex,
Fresh off calling the U.S. Postal Service ""a joke,"" Trump has decided to install one of his cronies to the critical job of Postmaster General.
Trump has named Louis DeJoy — ""a top donor to President Trump and the Republican National Committee"" — to lead the USPS.
This is bad news for the Postal Service, and bad news for our democracy.
The USPS isn't just a lifeline that keeps us connected, supplied, and safe — it's also a critical component of our vote-by-mail elections.
And during a global pandemic, vote-by-mail is the safest way to hold safe and accessible elections.
But when the head of the USPS — which oversees the delivery and collection of mail-in ballots — is an unqualified, conservative loyalist who has given millions to Trump and Republicans over the last four years, it throws the trust that so many Americans have in the Postal Service into question.
Add your name to #SaveTheUSPS and oppose Trump installing one of his top donors as America's Postmaster General.

Alex,
This morning, Democratic Senators grilled Trump's megadonor-turned-Postmaster General Louis DeJoy about the controversial changes he's made at the U.S. Postal Service over the last few weeks.
Despite his claims that no further changes would be made before the election, DeJoy is refusing to restore the mail sorting machines and the hundreds of Postal Service boxes that have been removed from locations in Oregon and across the country.
We know we can't take DeJoy at his word that he won't attempt any further rollbacks. That's why the House of Representatives is poised to vote tomorrow on the Delivering for America Act, which would undo the changes DeJoy has already made, and block him from making any more until the COVID-19 pandemic is over.
Will you add your name in support of the Delivering for America Act?

This is a critical moment for us as we begin to kick off our plans to organize and mobilize Oregonians ahead of what will be the most important election of our lifetimes.

That's why we're asking: Will you use your 2020 Oregon Political Tax Credit to donate before tonight's June fundraising deadline? It's like a free $50 donation for Oregon taxpayers, once a year.
Use your Oregon Political Tax Credit today!
It's so important that we finish this quarter strong and hit our fundraising goals. That's why we're double-checking our internal records ahead of tonight's deadline. Could you take a look to make sure this is right?

Oregon is so close to having ONE MILLION REGISTERED DEMOCRATS!
As of the end of March, there are more than 996,000 registered Democrats in Oregon:

Are you one of them, Alex? You could be the one millionth Oregon Democrat!
The voter registration deadline is April 28th. That means if you want to vote in the 2020 Oregon Democratic Primary, you need to make sure you are registered as a Democrat! Here's where you can do that:
Register to Vote!
Update your Voter Registration
I'm so excited about this milestone. And while the COVID-19 pandemic has effectively shut down field organizing and face-to-face voter outreach, Oregon's elections and voter registration system are resilient enough that we can still help Oregonians register to vote online.
We've adjusted our tactics and strategies toward reaching voters online and over the phones in this new environment. But we need your help to make sure we hit this goal before the registration deadline on April 28th. If you're able, please chip in $5, $10, $25, or whatever you can to help hit this milestone and help us register the one millionth Oregon Democrat!

Democratic Party of Oregon Logo
Alex,
Trump's megadonor-turned-Postmaster General is at the heart of another big scandal.
Louis DeJoy, whose success as a GOP fundraiser led to Trump naming him head of the U.S. Postal Service, is now under investigation after  he reportedly urged his employees to make campaign contributions to his preferred GOP politicians. DeJoy then gave bonus payments to the ones that did, telling them: ""I'll get it back to you down the road.""
In case it wasn't clear, this would be illegal.
If you're able, chip in to bring an end to Trump's corrupt administration and help us elect Democrats up and down the ballot this fall.
Yes, I'll donate!
DeJoy is already under fire for the controversial changes he's made at the USPS, banning postal workers from using overtime to make sure mail is delivered, removing mail sorting machines and postal boxes across the country, and jacking up the cost of postage for states to send out ballots to voters.
Unfortunately, this kind of corruption is a feature and not a bug of Trump and his administration of Republican lackeys.
It didn't have to be this way, from America's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, to Trump trying to sabotage the USPS and hold our elections hostage, to his continued attacks on American workers, veterans, our health care, and more. We need leaders who are focused on helping regular Oregonians and Americans instead of figuring out ways to enrich themselves. We can't afford another four years of Donald Trump.
With less than two months until Election Day, we need your support now more than ever. Will you chip in $10, $25, or whatever you can to the Democratic Party of Oregon?

"Rosa Colquitt, Ph.D., DPO Black Caucus Chair",democrats@dpo.org,African Americans and the Vote,"We invite you to reflect upon the 2020 National Black History Month theme, “African Americans and the Vote.""
Black History Month  2020: “African Americans and the  Vote”
A Sharing Moment from Rosa Colquitt, PhD, DPO Black Caucus  Chair
As Oregon and all of America approaches the 2020 elections, the Democratic Party of Oregon Black Caucus invites you to reflect upon the 2020 National Black History Month theme, “African Americans and the Vote.” This highly relevant theme calls for the commemoration of two anniversaries — the 150th anniversary of the ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment, by which black men gained the right to vote after the Civil War, and the 100th anniversary of the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment, by which women won the vote. Yet, as we celebrate these constitutional milestones, history is a constant reminder of their limitations — the recognition of both the progress and the setbacks for African American men and women.
In reflecting upon the hard-fought battles for the right to vote, a right so fundamental to democracy, we remember many Black American heroes: Senator Hiram Revels of Mississippi, Congressman Robert Brown Elliott of South Carolina, Governor P.B.S. Pinchback of Louisiana, and all the other Black elected officials who courageously stood up for the rights of their people during the Reconstruction Era of the 1870s and beyond. We likewise celebrate the “uncelebrated” in freedom’s first generation who lost their lives for simply attempting to register to vote, or to exercise their right at the ballot box, as was the case in the Colfax Massacre in Louisiana in 1873.
Of equally great significance, in reflecting upon the theme, “African Americans and the Vote,” we champion the work of Black suffragists — Mary Church Terrell, Ida B. Wells-Barnett, and Nannie Helen Burroughs, who organized the votes of Black women under the banner of being “in politics to stay” during the 1920s. In spite of these heroines, however, the celebration of Black History Month again reminds us that the great majority of Black women, just as Black men, in the South could not wield the ballot until the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Even then, the vote came at a dangerous cost, including beatings, loss of economic livelihood, and even death to many warriors of the civil rights movement.
As Oregon and all of America approaches the 2020 elections, and as we reflect upon “African Americans and the Vote,” our Black History Month celebration would be incomplete without recognizing the current work of Ms. Stacy Abrams. Abrams, who is leading the national battle against voter suppression, became the first Black woman to receive a major Party nomination for governor in any state, in her home state of Georgia. In her own passionate words, she says, “I have the right to do the things I think I should do. My gender and race should not be limitations.” Accordingly, Abrams has founded Fair Fight 2020, which aims to educate Black voters and urge them to go to the polls and vote. Abrams counsels all Black Americans to “overwhelm the system to thwart voter suppression nationally.”
In our celebration of Black History Month 2020, the DPO Black Caucus looks forward to the screening of the award-winning documentary, “Standing on My Sisters’ Shoulders.” We can think of no better way to reflect on “African Americans and the Vote” than to honor the commitment, bravery and leadership of many courageous Mississippi civil rights heroines. After seeing this documentary, hopefully, we will never forget Fannie Lou Hamer, Annie Devine, Unita Blackwell, Mae Bertha Carter, or Victoria Gray Adams.
Join us on Friday, February 21, 2020, from 7 to 9:15 pm at the Clinton Street Theater!
Happy Black History Month to all from the Democratic Party of Oregon, and the DPO Black Caucus!

"KC Hanson, Democratic Party of Oregon",democrats@dpo.org,Senate Republicans complete Trump's cover-up,"This is a sad day for our democracy.
This is a sad day for our democracy, Alex. Today, Senate Republicans voted to complete Trump's cover-up.
With the lone and historic exception of GOP Senator Mitt Romney, Republicans confirmed their allegiance to a craven and corrupt President rather than their country.
Senator Romney's vote to convict Trump vividly illustrates how insidious the core of the GOP has become. Not one GOP Senator joined him.
By their refusal to hold Trump accountable — and especially by their refusal to hear witnesses in the impeachment trial — they are complicit. And it's clear: We need to vote Trump and every single one of these Senate Republicans out of office.
Chip in to defeat Trump, put Democrats back in control of the Senate, and elect Democrats up and down the ballot in November.
Donate
Here are the facts:
Trump pressured a foreign nation to interfere in our elections for his own political gain.
Trump then obstructed Congress, defying subpoenas, blocking witnesses, and withholding documents from an investigation into his interference.
But after the House voted to impeach and the articles reached Mitch McConnell's Senate, it became clear that Republicans were only interested in holding a sham trial.
No witnesses, no subpoenas (despite explosive new evidence coming to light), nothing. Just vote after vote by Republicans to move the ""trial"" along to an end as quickly as possible.
Senate Republicans have put party over country and abandoned their oaths of office to protect our nation from all enemies — foreign and domestic.
They've effectively declared that so long as there are 34 Republicans in the Senate, a Republican President can do whatever they want with no fear of being held accountable.
I'm so thankful for our Oregon Senators — Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley — for voting to remove Trump for his impeachable offenses, and for acting and voting to defend our democracy once more. We should be incredibly proud to have them as Oregon's voice in the Senate.
But now, our job now is simple. We fight back and defeat Republicans at every single level.
This is a sad moment in our history, but I know that together we can bring this dark chapter to a close this November. That's why we need you with us right now, Alex: Please donate $5, $10, $25, or whatever you can to the Democratic Party of Oregon.

Oregon Dems,democrats@dpo.org,What happened last night...,"Democratic Party of Oregon Logo
Alex,
Here's what happened in last night's debate:
Trump refused to condemn white supremacy.
Trump lied about his failing response to the COVID-19 pandemic that has led to more than 200,000 deaths and millions of jobs lost.
Trump lied about paying $0 in income taxes for years, and only $750 in 2016 and 2017.
And Trump spent the entire debate ranting and interrupting like a petulant child who isn't getting their way.
There was one candidate on stage who spoke directly to the American people and showed the leadership, the temperament, and the compassion that the job of President of the United States requires.
That candidate is Joe Biden.
America cannot afford another four years of Donald Trump. Our last major fundraising deadline before Oregonians start to vote is at midnight tonight. Will you make a donation to the Democratic Party of Oregon before our end-of-quarter fundraising deadline to help defeat Trump and elect Oregon Democrats?

Team OR Dems,democrats@dpo.org,The USPS could shut down by “July or September”,"The USPS needs our support NOW.
Alex,
The U.S. Postal Service is facing a major crisis, and instead of helping it, Trump and Republicans are holding it hostage.
Trump is threatening to veto any relief bill that includes funding to keep the USPS running.
And now, the head of the American Postal Workers Union says that without relief from the government, he expects that the Post Office will likely run out of money and have to cease operations sometime ""between July and September.""
Will you add your name to call on Congress to #SaveTheUSPS?
The response we've seen so far in support of the U.S. Postal Service has been incredible.
That's because Oregon Democrats know and understand how important the USPS is for so many Oregonians and Americans, especially people living in rural areas, seniors, and veterans.
As one of the nation's largest employers of veterans and people of color, it provides an important opportunity for many Americans to earn a middle-class living, while keeping America connected, supplied, and safe.
And amid a pandemic, we need to make sure the USPS is funded and fully functioning in order to hold our vote-by-mail elections — the safest way to hold free and fair elections right now.
Alex: Please add your name to #SaveTheUSPS:
Add my name to #SaveTheUSPS

Democratic Party of Oregon Logo
Alex,
Vote-by-mail is the safest and most secure way to hold an election, especially during a pandemic.
Vote-by-mail makes it easier for people to make their voices heard, and most importantly, it prevents anyone from having to choose between their health and their right to vote.
Donald Trump? He disagrees, because he knows that he doesn't stand a chance if more Americans are able to vote and make their voices heard.
Lately, his Twitter feed has been filled with even more lies and disinformation about vote-by-mail than usual. It got so bad that Twitter even added a link to a few of his tweets for users to ""Get the facts about mail-in ballots.""
Gif of Trump's tweets lying about vote-by-mail
Trump is already laying the groundwork to question the outcome of the election when he loses in November. Help us fight back against his lies and defeat Trump and Republicans this fall by making a donation today.
Donate
Trump and Republicans are doing more than just questioning vote-by-mail — they're spending upwards of $20 million this year on lawsuits to fight efforts by states to make voting safer and more accessible in 2020.
Here's the truth: When you make voting safer and more accessible, more people vote and can make their voices heard.
Democrats believe that no American should have to choose between their health and their right to vote. Trump and Republicans think that vote-by-mail is good enough for themselves, but not for the rest of America.
Enough lies. Enough hypocrisy. Enough putting American lives in danger. Enough of Trump and Republicans. If you're able, please chip in $5, $10, or whatever you can, and together we'll elect Democrats up and down the ballot this fall.

Dear Alex,
Team Trump has their eyes set on Oregon.
Trump's Campaign Manager, Brad Parscale, and Lara Trump came to Oregon in November to meet with Republicans to plan their campaign to flip Oregon in 2020.
Here's what they said: ""Oregon's budget in the 2016 campaign ... was zero dollars and zero cents. But now we're here. We're already spending money.""
If Trump thinks his path to victory runs through Oregon, he better think again. Will you donate to the Democratic Party of Oregon and make sure we keep Oregon blue in 2020?
Donate today
With your support and a lot of hard work, we'll prove Trump wrong. We’re laser-focused on electing a Democrat to the White House, re-electing Senator Jeff Merkley and our great Democratic team, and making sure more Democrats get elected up and down the ballot. And with Republican Congressman Greg Walden retiring, we have a huge opportunity to turn another seat blue.
Alex, your donation will be an investment in the critical organizing, technology, and large-scale voter contact programs needed to make sure every Democrat in every ZIP code in Oregon votes, so we win big in 2020.
And you may be able to take advantage of Oregon’s Political Tax Credit! Most Oregonians qualify — it's like a free $50 donation! Learn more and use your Oregon Political Tax Credit to make your end-of-year gift today.

Alex,
We know it's short notice, but we wanted to let you know about an exciting event happening TONIGHT to support Secretary of State Nominee Shemia Fagan.
This election cycle we know the Trump administration is going to do everything in their power to chip away at vote-by-mail in an attempt to delegitimize our elections.
Shemia's opponent is a 2016 Trump delegate who has called vote-by-mail ""plagued"" and has consistently voted against expanding access to the ballot.
As Secretary of State, Shemia will stand up for Oregon's proud tradition of vote-by-mail and ensure that every Oregonian has access to free and fair elections.
In Oregon, we know that vote-by-mail works, and we know that electing female Democratic leaders is one way we will continue to lead the country forward.
Join this incredible group of Winning Women tonight at 6:00 pm.
RSVP Now!

KC Hanson,democrats@dpo.org,Independence Day 2020,"Our July 4th celebrations are taking on a very different meaning this year.
Democratic Party of Oregon Logo
Alex,
Our July 4th celebrations are taking on a very different meaning this year.
We're usually excited to share with you information about ways to celebrate with Democrats in your area, whether it's picnics, parades, fireworks, or other festivities.
But the COVID-19 pandemic has cancelled those gatherings, and we want to strongly urge you and your loved ones to keep your July 4th celebrations local, and small.
Governor Kate Brown's face covering requirement for public indoor spaces is now in place across all of Oregon, and it's critical that all of us look out for each other and do our part to help stop the spread of the virus.
July 4th also takes on a deeper meaning in light of the widespread protests for racial justice and against police brutality.
The last few weeks have seen hopeful signs of progress here in Oregon.
In last week's special session, the Oregon Legislature declared affirmatively that Black Lives Matter, and passed laws to reform police accountability. I want to thank the Oregon Legislature's BIPOC Caucus for their inspiring leadership in passing those measures, and look forward to working alongside them as we move to create a more just society here in Oregon.
But this is just the beginning of that work, and as many of us take time today to celebrate the founding of our nation, we must also take time to reckon with America's original sin — slavery — and the fact that we are still dealing with its consequences more than 150 years since its abolition.
Frederick Douglass in 1856, around 38 years of age
Frederick Douglass in 1856
Personally, it's an opportunity to revisit one of the most cutting assessments of our Independence Day, delivered by Frederick Douglass in 1852:
""Fellow-citizens, pardon me, allow me to ask, why am I called upon to speak here to-day? What have I, or those I represent, to do with your national independence? Are the great principles of political freedom and of natural justice, embodied in that Declaration of Independence, extended to us? ... I am not included within the pale of this glorious anniversary! Your high independence only reveals the immeasurable distance between us. The blessings in which you, this day, rejoice, are not enjoyed in common. The rich inheritance of justice, liberty, prosperity and independence, bequeathed by your fathers, is shared by you, not by me. The sunlight that brought light and healing to you, has brought stripes and death to me. This Fourth July is yours, not mine. You may rejoice, I must mourn. ... Fellow-citizens, above your national, tumultuous joy, I hear the mournful wail of millions! whose chains, heavy and grievous yesterday, are, to-day, rendered more intolerable by the jubilee shouts that reach them.
[[URL REDACTED]], to the American slave, is your 4th of July? I answer; a day that reveals to him, more than all other days in the year, the gross injustice and cruelty to which he is the constant victim. To him, your celebration is a sham; your boasted liberty, an unholy license; your national greatness, swelling vanity; your sounds of rejoicing are empty and heartless; your denunciation of tyrants, brass fronted impudence; your shouts of liberty and equality, hollow mockery; your prayers and hymns, your sermons and thanksgivings, with all your religious parade and solemnity, are, to Him, mere bombast, fraud, deception, impiety, and hypocrisy-a thin veil to cover up crimes which would disgrace a nation of savages. There is not a nation on the earth guilty of practices more shocking and bloody than are the people of the United States, at this very hour.""
Douglass, rightly so, doesn't mince any words. But he closes his speech looking forward, with a glimmer of hope:
""Allow me to say, in conclusion, notwithstanding the dark picture I have this day presented, of the state of the nation, I do not despair of this country. There are forces in operation which must inevitably work the downfall of slavery. ... I, therefore, leave off where I began, with hope. While drawing encouragement from ""the Declaration of Independence,"" the great principles it contains, and the genius of American Institutions, my spirit is also cheered by the obvious tendencies of the age. Nations do not now stand in the same relation to each other that they did ages ago. No nation can now shut itself up from the surrounding world and trot round in the same old path of its fathers without interference. The time was when such could be done. Long established customs of hurtful character could formerly fence themselves in, and do their evil work with social impunity. Knowledge was then confined and enjoyed by the privileged few, and the multitude walked on in mental darkness. But a change has now come over the affairs of mankind.""
You can read the full text of Douglass' address here.
From all of us at the Democratic Party of Oregon, please stay safe, stay local, and stay healthy this weekend.
Thank you,
KC Hanson

Democratic Party of Oregon Logo
Alex,
The Klonoski Award, named for Professor James Klonoski, is given each year to an individual or group that has demonstrated exceptional commitment to promoting civic engagement.
This year, it is with a mix of pride, grief, and so much love that we posthumously honor Mary Gautreaux with the 2020 Klonoski Award.
Join us on Tuesday, September 22nd, as we celebrate Mary and honor her life with the Klonoski Award at the 11th Annual Wayne Morse Gala.
Photo of Mary Gautreaux
Mary Gautreaux served her beloved state of Oregon for more than 25 years within the office of Senator Ron Wyden. In 1994, Mary joined Senator (then Congressman) Wyden’s Senate Family, first as a Legislative Fellow, then as a Field Representative, as the Natural Resources Director, and then as the Senator’s Deputy State Director.
Mary’s spark shines through countless “Mary stories” of her colorful life. She was born in 1947 in West Virginia, then grew up in Richmond, Virginia. By the late 1960s, Mary drove her VW bug out west and eventually settled in the Blue Mountains of Eastern Oregon near John Day.
Mary went on to work planting trees and fighting forest fires for the U.S. Forest Service to provide for her young family. Mary single-handedly raised her four children with grit, passion, and perseverance. Mary also went back to college and by 1994 had earned her master’s degree in Public Policy.
As part of Senator Wyden’s team, Mary had a hand in many of Oregon’s public policy initiatives over the years, including protecting Portland’s Bull Run, protecting Mt. Hood wilderness, and the Central Oregon Badlands. She was literally and physically all over the state seeking meaningful input and engagement from a wide range of voices in the corners of Oregon.
Mary found herself at home in an Eastern Oregon ranching town, a coastal mill town, and in Portland, as she had called each of them home at a different time. For Mary’s innumerable contributions, the Senator called her “the Eighth Wonder of Oregon.” For Mary’s ability to delegate and engage other capable (if not unwitting) souls, she was also dubbed “Hurricane Mary.”
Mary died on Sept. 20, 2019, leaving a legacy of indomitable will and capacity to find solutions to any situation. Mary is survived by her four children, Ryder, Myria, Callie, and Lucas, five grandchildren, and her brothers, Hank and Richard. She is also survived by countless friends, from the streets of Portland to the Governor’s mansion (or the canyons of the Owyhee).
As Senator Wyden said on the Senate Floor when remembering Mary:
""Mary loved bright colors, to make sure that her home and everybody there really sees that what she wanted was a lot of color, and a lot of passion, and a lot of friends, and a lot of people talking about what a special place Oregon is. And that all these young people, who have done so much, are building on her approach for bringing people together, her values of caring, standing up for people who didn't have very much and were outside the power circle of Washington. So this is a hard talk to give, but it's sure easy to always remember what a wonderful person Mary Gautreaux was, how she represented the very best our state has been able to offer.""

Hi Alex: Making sure you saw this message about next Tuesday's Wayne Morse Gala featuring Senator Tammy Duckworth!
For the first time ever, the Gala is going to be all online, and pay-what-you can to attend!

Subject: Next Tuesday's Wayne Morse Gala with Senator Tammy Duckworth
Alex,
Next Tuesday's Wayne Morse Gala featuring Senator Tammy Duckworth is going to look very different this year, as we'll be holding it entirely online for the first time ever.
But even though it's going to be an all-virtual Gala, what's really special about it in 2020 is that we're including a pay-what-you-can option to attend!
Of course, we really hope you'll consider chipping in, since your support will help us reach even more voters and make sure we elect Joe Biden and Oregon Democrats this fall.
But if you can't contribute, don't worry – we are also planning on livestreaming the Gala.
With Senator Tammy Duckworth joining us live as our Keynote Speaker, as well as Senator Jeff Merkley and more speakers to be announced soon, we know it's going to be a great evening, and we want as many Oregon Democrats as possible to attend.

It's always such a wonderful event, and we're often lucky enough to welcome rising stars in the Democratic Party to speak to Oregonians about the challenges we face as a nation, and the solutions Democrats are fighting for here and all across the country.
I'm so excited to attend this year's Gala in Portland on Saturday, April 4th. The DPO team is working on bringing a great speaker and I know you won't want to miss out!
This is a critical moment — and our democracy is on the ballot this November. It's never been more vital for Democrats to come together and fight like hell to defeat Trump and Republicans. I'm ready for that fight, and I know you are too.

So we're giving everyone who donates through this email a free ""Dump Trump. Ditch Mitch. Save America!"" sticker!
Whether you chip in $5 or $10, or use your Oregon Political Tax Credit to donate $50 or $100, any amount you can give helps fund the ground game it's going to take to dump Trump, ditch Mitch, and save America next November.

Together, we can defeat Trump, take the Senate out of Mitch McConnell's control, replace Greg Walden, and elect Democrats up and down the ballot in Oregon.
A great way you can help do that (and get a free sticker in the process) is by using your 2019 Oregon Political Tax Credit!
It's simple: Oregon offers a tax credit to qualifying taxpayers who make less than $100,000 (or less than $200,000 for joint-filing couples). It's like a free $50 donation.
To qualify, you need to give before the end of 2019. With just a few days left in the year, don't wait any longer — give $50, $100, or whatever you can today, and we'll send you a free ""Dump Trump. Ditch Mitch. Save America!"" sticker!

Brad Martin,democrats@dpo.org,"The Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Republican field","Help us defeat them by electing a Democrat to replace Greg Walden in 2020.
Alex,
The Republican field in Oregon's Second Congressional District is shaping up to be full of bad options for Oregonians.
Will you help make sure we defeat them by electing a Democrat to replace Greg Walden in 2020? If you give today, your contribution will be matched dollar-for dollar.
Donate today and DOUBLE your impact!
First, there's Knute Buehler, who Oregonians have rejected twice already at the ballot — first for Secretary of State, and then for Governor in 2018.
When he ran for statewide office, we sounded the alarm that Buehler's attempts to distance himself from Trump and his claims of being a moderate were nothing but lies and hot air. Now that he's pandering to the Republican base, he's proving us correct with his full-on embrace of Trump and far-right policies.
Next, there's Cliff Bentz.
Bentz was one of the eleven Republican State Senators who fled the state and abandoned their constitutional duties to block a vote on a major climate bill in June. Now he's hoping Republicans in the district reward him for bringing D.C.-style shutdown politics to Oregon, while touting his support from the extremists in the NRA and Oregon Right to Life.
Then, there's Ken Medenbach.
Does Medenbach's name ring a bell? That's because he was one of the people who occupied the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in 2016. He's previously argued in court that the federal government doesn't have jurisdiction over public lands, and that the courts don't have the authority to interpret the Constitution. Now, he wants to be a Member of Congress.
These three aren't the only candidates who have thrown their hats into the ring, but no matter who the Republican nominee is, we're going to do everything we can to make sure we elect a Democrat to replace Walden in Oregon's Second Congressional District next November.
Please chip in whatever you can to help Democrats win in 2020 — and if you give today, you can DOUBLE the impact of your donation.
Remember, you can use your Oregon Political Tax Credit to give.

Katie Drumm,democrats@dpo.org,What the Wayne Morse Gala means to our work:,"With the Gala now postponed until September, we need your support to help fill the gaps in our fundraising.
Alex,
I've had April 4th circled on my calendar for a while — tonight was when we had planned to welcome incredible Democrats from near and far for the 11th Annual Wayne Morse Gala.
Of course, COVID-19 has forced us to postpone the Gala until September. While we're sad we're not hosting the Gala tonight, it was absolutely the right decision to protect the health and safety of staff, attendees, volunteers, and everyone else involved in putting on this great event.
The Gala is a critical way for us to pull together the resources it's going to take to elect Democrats up and down the ballot this November. In fact, it played a huge role in supporting the strategies that led to the historic victories we celebrated in 2018, and we have big plans to build on those wins 2020.
But with the Gala now postponed until September, we need your support to help fill the gaps in our fundraising.
We're doing everything we can to adjust our outreach and organizing strategies during the COVID-19 outbreak. But your support has never been more critical to our work.
If you're able, please chip in $5, $10, $25, or whatever you can to help us bridge our fundraising gap and elect Democrats all across Oregon this fall.
Donate
Thank you so much for your support.

Oregon Dems,democrats@dpo.org,Trump says he hopes the Supreme Court ends Obamacare,"And if Trump wins, he and Republicans are going to rip health care away from tens of millions of Americans in the middle of a pandemic.
Democratic Party of Oregon Logo
The Affordable Care Act is on the ballot, Alex.
And if Trump wins, he and Republicans are going to rip health care away from tens of millions of Americans in the middle of a pandemic.
Don't just take our word for it: He said it himself.
In an interview with 60 Minutes, Trump was asked what would happen if the Supreme Court — soon to be filled with three of Trump's hand-picked Justices — overturned the Affordable Care Act. Here's what Trump said:
“I hope that they end it. It’ll be so good if they end it.”
Trump's only plan for health care is to take away yours. He and Republicans are working to convince the Supreme Court to end protections for more than 130 million Americans with pre-existing conditions.
This election is a fight for our health care. It's a fight for our climate. It's a fight for our voting rights, for reproductive rights, for our democracy, and so much more.
We have 12 days to do everything we can to defeat Trump and elect Democrats at every level. Will you donate to help us protect our health care and elect Oregon Democrats?

KC Hanson,democrats@dpo.org,Remembering Ruth Bader Ginsburg,"May her memory be a blessing.
Democratic Party of Oregon Logo
Alex,
Like so many Americans, we are still shocked and saddened by the passing of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
A champion for women’s rights, she was an iconic hero and tireless intellect who fiercely advocated for the marginalized throughout her long and amazing career.
There is a hole in our collective heart, and a deep, lonely cavern in our nation's justice community as we grapple with this tremendous loss.
Our thoughts are with Justice Ginsburg's family, with her friends, and with all Americans as we mourn and reflect on the energetic, dedicated, and vibrant life of this towering American icon. May her memory be a blessing.
Yet as we mourn, we must also resolve to protect the powerful legacy Justice Ginsberg leaves in our care.
From reproductive justice, to gender and LGBTQ+ equality, to health care access, to voting rights, RBG championed so many of the democratic values we hold dear and fundamental. She relentlessly and persistently sought a better and more just country, and she weaved these values into living American law. In the shadow of her spirit and legacy, we now must work even harder to defend our shared core principles.
And we will.
On Tuesday, Oregon Democrats will gather virtually for our yearly Wayne Morse Gala. As we convene for what is normally an evening of joy and celebration, let us also come together to grieve, to commiserate, and reflect on the incredible life of one of our nation's judicial pioneers.
All are welcome, either with us in the virtual Gala room, or by tuning in to the livestream of the Gala on our social media pages.
Thank you,
KC Hanson

Oregon Democrats,democrats@dpo.org,[Add your name] Tell the Senate: Pass the Equality Act!,"All Americans, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity, deserve the same protections under the law.
Democratic Party of Oregon Logo
Alex,
Monday's Supreme Court ruling was a landmark victory for LGBTQ+ rights, affirming that in America, you can no longer be fired or denied a job simply because of who you love or how you identify.
But there are still gaps in America's non-discrimination laws, and this week's decision still leaves many people vulnerable to discrimination.
That's why Democrats led the way to pass the Equality Act in the House with bipartisan support in 2019, which would provide clear, comprehensive non-discrimination protections for LGBTQ+ people across the country in all areas of the law.
Will you add your name in support of the Equality Act to make sure that all Americans, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity, enjoy the same protections under the law?
Since the Equality Act passed in the House last year, the bill has been cast aside by Mitch McConnell, who has turned the Republican-controlled Senate into a legislative graveyard.
It's been more than a year, and McConnell has refused to bring the bill to the Senate floor for a vote.
The LGBTQ+ community won a major victory this week for equality, but there's still work to be done to make sure no American is discriminated against because of who they are or who they love.
It's time for the Senate to pass the Equality Act. Add your name:
Pass The Equality Act!

Alex,
That's a wrap on the first presidential debate between Joe Biden and Donald Trump.
Joe Biden just proved to the entire nation why he is far and away the leader Americans need right now to face this crisis, and to help us come out of it even stronger than before.
And time and time again, Trump put on display the divisiveness, ignorance, and the complete inability to take any responsibility for his actions that has made things way worse than they ever had to be.
With just two weeks until ballots go out to Oregon voters, and just 35 days until Election Day, we can't rest for a moment. Can we count on you to donate to the Democratic Party of Oregon?
Donate ➞
America cannot afford another four years of Donald Trump, and we are ready for a leader who will bring Americans together. And tonight, Joe Biden showed that he is that leader.
We're just a little more than 24 hours away from our crucial end-of-quarter fundraising deadline. Your support right now will make a huge impact on our voter mobilization efforts as we turn our plans into action and Democratic votes.
Will you chip in before our fundraising deadline to help us defeat Trump and elect Oregon Democrats up and down the ballot?

KC Hanson,democrats@dpo.org,Republicans turn their back on Oregonians AGAIN,"ANOTHER wasteful, costly walkout.
Alex,
House and Senate Republicans have turned their backs on Oregonians and kicked off ANOTHER wasteful, costly walkout.
Enough is enough. No more delays. No more walkouts. It's time for Oregon Republicans to get back to work, show up, and do the job that our lawmakers were elected to do.
And if they won't, we know plenty of Democrats who are ready to get elected to replace them in November. Donate to hold these Oregon Republicans accountable.
Donate
Do you get paid if you don't show up for work? Would you get a paycheck if you skipped out on work? Of course not!
But that's exactly what Oregon Republicans are doing, taking a taxpayer-funded vacation to shut down the government and block Oregon from taking meaningful action on climate.
Their argument that this climate bill has been rushed is preposterous.
It's been in the works for YEARS, passing out of eight committees, getting at least 12 public hearings in the last 14 months, including a statewide tour of public town halls.
It's been the subject of countless working groups, studies, and debate, and of thousands of pages of testimony.
It's well past time for lawmakers to vote. This bill has been vetted and negotiated, and it deserves a vote by the Legislature.
No more delay.
No more walking away from hard decisions.
Oregonians elected you to do a job, and if you won't come back to Salem to do it, we're ready to elect Democrats who will. Donate today to help us fight back against these costly walkouts.

Subject: Senator Tammy Duckworth is our Wayne Morse (Virtual) Gala Keynote Speaker!
Alex,
I am so thrilled to share this exciting news: Senator Tammy Duckworth is our Keynote Speaker for the 11th Annual Wayne Morse (Virtual) Gala, happening on Tuesday, September 22nd!
Senator Duckworth has served our country on multiple fronts: as a U.S. Army helicopter pilot, as U.S. Assistant Secretary of Veterans Affairs, and then as a Member of Congress, acting as a voice for Illinois' working families in the U.S. House for four years before she was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2016.
She knows and understands what it means to sacrifice for our nation. Her unit was mobilized during Operation Iraqi Freedom, and in 2004 her Black Hawk helicopter was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade. She lost both legs and partial use of her right arm in the explosion, yet despite her injuries she continued to serve in the Illinois Army National Guard until she retired from the military in 2014.
During her time in office, Senator Duckworth has been a strong voice for working families, civil rights, and more, and is dedicated to her lifelong mission of supporting, protecting, and keeping the promises we've made to our Veterans.
Senator Duckworth is the first woman with a disability elected to Congress, is one of only three Asian-American women to ever serve in the Senate, and is the first Senator to give birth while in office, securing a historic change to Senate rules to allow Senators to bring their infant children onto the Senate floor during votes.
I cannot wait for Senator Duckworth to join us as our Keynote Speaker for the 11th Annual Wayne Morse (Virtual) Gala!
Get your tickets today!
I hope to see you (virtually) at the Gala!

KC Hanson,democrats@dpo.org,Trump weaponizing federal officers in Portland,"It's abhorrent. It's a terrifying abuse of power. And it has no place in a democratic society.
Democratic Party of Oregon Logo
Did you see this headline, Alex?
""Federal Law Enforcement Use Unmarked Vehicles To Grab Protesters Off Portland Streets""
— Oregon Public Broadcasting
Trump is deploying federal officers to Portland, and in the last week they've shot a protester in the head with a potentially deadly munition, and are now roaming the streets of downtown Portland in unmarked vans and in camouflage, rounding up people and detaining them with no explanation or identification.
These largely peaceful protests began in response to injustice and systemic police violence against communities of color. The presence and the violent tactics of these federal officers have done nothing but escalate tensions.
It's abhorrent. It's a terrifying abuse of power. And it has no place in a democratic society.
Enough. We will not be silent in the face of Trump's attempt to weaponize federal law enforcement to bolster his re-election chances. This has nothing to do with public safety, and everything to do with Trump's flailing polling numbers.
He already tried this in June when he teargassed protesters in Washington, D.C., for a political photo op. And as Governor Brown put it, ""Trump is looking for a confrontation in Oregon in the hopes of winning political points in Ohio or Iowa.""
Senators Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley, along with members of Oregon's Democratic Congressional Delegation, have now called for an investigation into the presence and violent actions of federal forces in Portland.
We demand answers, we demand accountability, and we demand that Trump's unlawful federal agents leave Portland, now.

Alex,
You shouldn't have to choose between your health and exercising your right to vote. And it turns out many Oregonians and Americans agree!
Over the last week, we've seen an incredible response from people who believe that the Oregon way of voting — universal vote-by-mail — should be the way all of America votes.
​Now, w​​​e're building support for a bill from Senators Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley to expand Oregon-Style Vote-By-Mail for all U.S. voters.
Oregon has had vote-by-mail in place for more than 20 years, and we know it better than just about anyone.
That's why we're asking: Will you share your story and tell us why you think America should follow Oregon's lead and establish national Vote-By-Mail?
Share your story!

Alex,
Abuse of power. Obstruction of justice.
House Democrats just unveiled two articles of impeachment, charging Trump with violating the Constitution over his efforts to extort Ukraine into helping his re-election campaign by investigating a political rival, and then standing in the way of Congress' investigation.
Oregon Democrats know that no one is above the law. Not even the President of the United States.
We will fight to uphold our Democratic values and hold leaders accountable.
And no matter what happens next, whether in a vote to impeach Donald Trump, or in a Senate trial to consider removing him from office, that doesn't change our mission in 2020: To elect Democrats up and down the ballot, all across Oregon.
With so much at stake in our democracy right now and over the next 11 months, join us by making your end-of-year donation to the Democratic Party of Oregon.
Remember, you can use your Oregon Political Tax Credit to give.

Democratic Party of Oregon Logo
Alex,
The ballots are dropping in Oregon, and we can't afford a cruise to the finish — we need to kick things into our highest gear.
This is not only the most critical election in our history, but it’s also the most difficult campaign season we’ve ever undertaken.
In this year of COVID-19, even the Presidential Campaign offices never opened in Oregon. But the dynamics of the pandemic have NOT inhibited the GOP from what they do best — raise gobs of cash from uber-wealthy donors. At the same time, Democrats have been unable to do what we do best — make tens of thousands of face-to-face contacts on the doors and at events.
That's why we need your help right now, Alex. Our virtual GOTV efforts are powered by the work and energy of volunteers like you. Will you help us turn out Oregon Democrats by signing up to volunteer?
Sign up to Volunteer! ➞
Check out our upcoming GOTV events ➞
There are also assumptions made about Oregon that could hurt Democrats. How?
Our own great Democratic performances pulled us out of the “swing state” category after 2004. When Republican waves swept the nation in 2010 and 2014, Oregon bent a little, but did not break — maintaining our Congressional numbers, our representation in our state Executive branch, and never ceding majorities in either Salem legislative chamber.
But amidst this year’s pandemic and horrific wildfires, the national GOP has targeted Oregon, pouring money into our state and targeting Oregon Democrats. They have an incompetent and unqualified candidate running against Congressman Peter DeFazio in Congressional District 4, and are fighting tooth and nail to try to prevent Democrats from electing progressive champion Shemia Fagan as our next Secretary of State.
So even if Democratic confidence in Oregon is strong, it is ESSENTIAL that all of us run through the finish line in this year’s election. Oregon Democratic candidates up and down the ballot need your help right up until 8pm on Election Day.
Oregon turned blue because Democrats like you trailblazed that path. And we know Oregon stays blue because of the hard work and energy of our supporters, volunteers, and Democrats all across the state.
Please sign up to volunteer and help keep Oregon blue and elect Democrats up and down the ballot in 2020.
Let’s do this!

The field for November is set, Alex.
Oregon Democrats made their voices heard, voted in record numbers, and chose their Democratic Nominees — and for the first time in at least 20 years, there will be a Democrat on the ballot for every single Oregon Senate and Oregon House race this fall.
Will you chip in ahead of our May fundraising deadline to help elect as many of these Democrats as possible in November?

It was just three months ago that Oregon Republicans staged another wasteful, costly walkout — taking a taxpayer-funded vacation to shut down the government and block Oregon from taking meaningful action on climate.
Now, they're betting that enough voters won't remember that they walked off the job. We're not going to let that happen.
Oregonians are tired of these walkouts. Oregon Republicans have shown time and time again that if they can't get their way, they won't even bother showing up for the job they were elected to do. So now, let's make sure we elect Oregon Democrats who will.
Our May fundraising deadline is tomorrow at midnight, and we've got Oregon Democrats running in rural districts, in urban districts, and everywhere in between. If you're able, please chip in $5, $10, or whatever you can, and together we'll elect Democrats all across Oregon this fall.

Subject: Trump is holding the USPS hostage
To: <[[EMAIL_REDACTED]]>
This should be the front-page headline in every paper in America, Alex.
Today, Trump admitted that he is blocking crucial funds from the U.S. Postal Service in order to obstruct mail-in voting in this fall's election — an election where record numbers of Americans will be voting by mail to stay safe during a worldwide pandemic.
Here's what Trump said:
""They need that money in order to make the Post Office work so it can take all of these millions and millions of ballots ... But if they don't get [the funding] that means you can't have universal mail-in voting.""
Let that sink in. Trump is holding the USPS and our elections hostage to try and rescue his flailing re-election campaign. It's just the latest assault from Trump and his cronies to sabotage the U.S. Postal Service.
We must do more than simply defeat Trump this fall – we need to make sure there is no doubt by working to turn out as many Democratic votes as possible. Will you chip in and make sure we defeat Trump and elect Democrats in 2020?
Donate
After Trump installed one of his top donors as the Postmaster General, they wasted no time throwing a wrench into the works of one of the most popular and trusted American institutions.
Postal workers are reporting that they're being banned from working overtime, preventing mail from being delivered on time.
Mail processing and sorting machines are being removed from postal facilities across the country.
And Trump's Postmaster General is now trying to jack up the cost of postage for states to send out ballots to voters.
Trump knows he can't win on the merits, so now he's working to sabotage the system that millions of Americans will rely on to cast their ballots this fall.
We need to do everything we can to fight back, and that starts with your support. Will you donate today to the Democratic Party of Oregon? Remember, you can use your 2020 Oregon Political Tax Credit to give – it's like a free $50 donation.

Democratic Party of Oregon Logo
Alex,
Even by Republican standards, the 2020 Republican National Convention has been hard to watch.
Republicans barely acknowledged the COVID-19 pandemic, or that Trump's refusal to take responsibility for managing the crisis has made it so much worse.
And when they did mention the pandemic, they talked about it in the past tense, as if it were over and not still claiming the lives of 1,000 Americans every day.
They also repeatedly violated laws that prohibit the use of government resources for political gain.
But as we've seen over the last four years, corruption is a feature for Trump and Republicans, not a bug — in fact, one of last night's speakers was a former state Attorney General who nixed an investigation into Trump University after Trump sent a $25,000 contribution to her re-election campaign.
The next two nights of the Republican Convention won't get any better. And if Trump gets another four years in office, his corruption and law-breaking is only going to get more flagrant, more brazen, and make our country worse for regular Oregonians and Americans.
We need to do everything we can to defeat Trump and Republicans this fall, Alex. If you're able, will you donate to the Democratic Party of Oregon today?

Democratic Party of Oregon Logo
Did you see this from Kamala Harris in last night's Vice Presidential debate, Alex?
Kamala Harris: ""The American people have witnessed what is the greatest failure of any presidential administration in the history of our country.""
From her opening response last night, Kamala Harris went to bat for the American people — the people who Trump, Pence, and Republicans have failed with their inept response to the COVID crisis.
She called Trump and Pence out for hiding the truth about the dangers of the virus from us, because as Kamala said last night, ""You respect the American people when you tell them the truth. You respect the American people when you have the courage to be a leader.""
And she took Trump and Pence to task for working to rip health care away from millions of Americans in the middle of a pandemic, telling Americans that ""if you have a pre-existing condition, heart disease, diabetes, breast cancer, they’re coming for you.""
As for Mike Pence, he spent the debate interrupting the two women on stage every chance he got, while refusing to answer the questions he was asked.
We need leaders who will be honest with us and who have a plan to address the crises we face head-on.
The choice couldn't be clearer. Help us do everything we can to elect Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and Oregon Democrats this fall by making a donation today.

[Vote-By-Mail Alert] via OR Dems,democrats@dpo.org,Trump is holding the USPS hostage,"This should be the front-page headline in every paper in America, Alex.
Democratic Party of Oregon Logo
This should be the front-page headline in every paper in America, Alex.
Today, Trump admitted that he is blocking crucial funds from the U.S. Postal Service in order to obstruct mail-in voting in this fall's election — an election where record numbers of Americans will be voting by mail to stay safe during a worldwide pandemic.
Here's what Trump said:
""They need that money in order to make the Post Office work so it can take all of these millions and millions of ballots ... But if they don't get [the funding] that means you can't have universal mail-in voting.""
Let that sink in. Trump is holding the USPS and our elections hostage to try and rescue his flailing re-election campaign. It's just the latest assault from Trump and his cronies to sabotage the U.S. Postal Service.
We must do more than simply defeat Trump this fall – we need to make sure there is no doubt by working to turn out as many Democratic votes as possible. Will you chip in and make sure we defeat Trump and elect Democrats in 2020?
Donate
After Trump installed one of his top donors as the Postmaster General, they wasted no time throwing a wrench into the works of one of the most popular and trusted American institutions.
Postal workers are reporting that they're being banned from working overtime, preventing mail from being delivered on time.
Mail processing and sorting machines are being removed from postal facilities across the country.
And Trump's Postmaster General is now trying to jack up the cost of postage for states to send out ballots to voters.
Trump knows he can't win on the merits, so now he's working to sabotage the system that millions of Americans will rely on to cast their ballots this fall.
We need to do everything we can to fight back, and that starts with your support. Will you donate today to the Democratic Party of Oregon? Remember, you can use your 2020 Oregon Political Tax Credit to give – it's like a free $50 donation.

Oregon Dems,democrats@dpo.org,Trump is trying to dismantle Obamacare in the middle of a pandemic,"They don't care, Alex.
Democratic Party of Oregon Logo
It's despicable, Alex.
Late last night, the Trump administration called on the Supreme Court to overturn the Affordable Care Act.
Trump and Republicans don't care that we're in the middle of a pandemic that has already claimed nearly 125,000 American lives and shows no sign of slowing.
They don't care that destroying Obamacare would rip health care coverage away from 23 million Americans, including more than 400,000 Oregonians.
They don't care that millions of Americans have lost their jobs because of the pandemic, and only have health care coverage right now thanks to the Affordable Care Act.
Trump and Republicans don't care, and they're working day and night to take away our health care.
Oregon Democrats won't stop fighting to protect our health care, and Oregon's Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum is part of a coalition of state Attorneys General opposing Trump in Court.
The stakes of this fall's election couldn't be higher. If we're going to defend the Affordable Care Act and protect the health care millions of Americans rely on, we need to defeat Trump, re-elect AG Rosenblum, and elect Oregon Democrats up and down the ballot. But the only way we can do that is with your support.

Oregon Democrats,democrats@dpo.org,Make that Trump's final State of the Union,"Together we can defeat Trump and Republicans this November.
Alex,
Trump just wrapped up his State of the Union address.
Just like every other address he's given, it was filled with lies and deceptions that ignore the reality of the last three years.
Like when Trump and Republicans tried to kick 21 million Americans off their health insurance.
Or when they have tried time and time again to cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.
Or when Trump abused his power and pressured a foreign nation to interfere in our elections for his own personal gain, and then obstructed Congress' investigation.
We've had enough, Alex.
Enough of the lies. Enough of an administration that ignores science and fails to act on climate. Enough of an administration that pushes tax cuts for the rich at the expense of working Americans, that demonizes our immigrant neighbors and is trying to close America off from the rest of the world.
Together, let's make sure that was the last State of the Union that Trump ever gives.
Donate to defeat Trump and elect Oregon Democrats up and down the ballot this November.

In less than 100 days, ballots for the 2020 Election will be arriving in Oregon mailboxes.
We're so fortunate to have vote-by-mail here in Oregon, Alex. It's a safe and secure way to run an election — and during a pandemic, it's how we make sure that no Oregonian has to choose between their health and their right to vote.
But Trump is doing everything he can to keep Americans from voting by mail this fall. It's not just tweets attacking mail-in ballots (though he had even more of those this morning) — his campaign is now suing battleground states like Pennsylvania to keep them from setting up ballot drop boxes for voters to use in the fall!
Oregonians know that when you make voting safe, easy, and convenient, more people vote. And whether you prefer to drop your completed ballot in the mail, or bring it to a ballot drop box, you've got that choice.
But Trump and Republicans know that unless they throw up every roadblock they can to make it harder for Americans to vote, they're going to lose.
In less than 100 days, Oregonians will be casting their votes in the fall election. Let's make sure we do everything we can to defeat Trump and Republicans, and elect Democrats who won't make Americans choose between our health and our right to vote.

Mario Parker-Milligan,democrats@dpo.org,An incredible year for DPO Caucuses,"Here's a bit of what our Caucuses did in 2019:
Alex,
Our Caucuses are a critical part of the grassroots building blocks of the Democratic Party of Oregon.
And 2019 was a banner year in their work to expand the strength and voice of the great diversity within our Party.
Here's a bit of what our Caucuses did in 2019:
Our newest Caucuses, the Native American Caucus and the Young Democrats of Oregon Caucus, both celebrated their one-year anniversaries!
The Native American Caucus held a meet and greet at the Oregon Summit, where Congresswoman Sharice Davids — one of the first two Native American women elected to Congress — met with native elders and children.
Meanwhile, the Young Dems have been holding house parties across Oregon to help raise money for Democrats and to engage more young people. They made calls for special elections across the country, helped canvass to defeat the recall effort against Oregon Rep. Tiffiny Mitchell, and helped raise more than $1,300 to help sponsor renewal fees for DACA recipients!
The Black Caucus helped push for the creation of the Racial Equity, Accountability and Leadership (R.E.A.L.) Special Committee to study racial disparities within the party and provide actionable solutions to ensure our Party can more adequately represent and support the growing diversity of Oregon.
This barely scratches the surface of some of the great work our Caucuses accomplished this year, including: holding community events; acting to protect our immigrant friends and neighbors; gathering pledges to vote in 2020; and hosting debate watch parties.
With 2020 fast approaching, we must do everything we can to support our Caucuses and their outreach efforts to expand the Democratic Party of Oregon's membership and diversity.

We've got our work cut out for us in 2020. But next year is about more than defeating Donald Trump.
It's about re-electing Senator Jeff Merkley.
It's about replacing Greg Walden and sending an all-Democratic Oregon Congressional Delegation to Congress next year.
It's about making sure we elect Democrats in every race up and down the ballot, from statewide offices to local positions.
But if we're going to build the ground game we need and put organizers in every corner of Oregon, we need you with us.
The Trump campaign is already spending money in Oregon to try and flip it red. Will you support the Democratic Party of Oregon and make your end-of-year gift today?

Did you watch our Oregon Delegation co-chairs announce Oregon's votes, alongside Senators Wyden and Merkley, and Oregon State Senator (and our next Secretary of State) Shemia Fagan?

As our Oregon Delegation Co-Chairs Rosa Colquitt and Travis Nelson put it, ""as Black Americans, standing on Native land, we proudly represent Oregon. The dual viruses — COVID-19 and racism — laid bare unequal health care access and deaths in communities of color. But Democrats are working to bridge divides and make sure everyone has equal access to low or no cost quality care.""
Then, with Senator Wyden and Merkley’s support, they cast Oregon's votes.
We are so ready to do everything we can to elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris — now the official nominees of the Democratic Party. Will you chip in to help us defeat Donald Trump, take the Senate out of Mitch McConnell's control, and elect Oregon Democrats up and down the ballot?

Oregon Democrats,democrats@dpo.org,"Additional wildfire resources, and how to vote if you've been evacuated:","Democratic Party of Oregon Logo
Alex,
We hope you and your loved ones are safe and out of harm's way right now.
While it appears the weather has started to shift and created better conditions for our firefighters and first responders to combat the wildfires still raging across the state, many Oregonians are now either evacuated from their homes, or dealing with hazardous air quality caused by the smoke.
But even in the face of this tragedy, it has been incredibly heartwarming to see the outpouring of support and generosity from Oregonians for those in need.
With that in mind, we wanted to share some more information about available resources, whether you've been displaced, are trying to deal with the smoke, or are just looking for ways to help:
* Oregon Wildfire Resources
* State of Oregon Fires and Hotspots Dashboard
* Open Red Cross Shelters
* Find resources and sign up for alerts from your county
* Find a hotel for emergency lodging
* Current air quality information
* Information about how to deal with health threats from wildfire smoke
If you're looking for other ways to help, we'd encourage you to consider making a donation to the Red Cross Cascades, the Oregon Food Bank, or a local non-profit relief organization.
We especially want to highlight efforts in Southern Oregon that our friends with the Jackson County Democrats shared with us. Phoenix and Talent were decimated by the fires, and this is where a large number of the county's farmworkers and immigrant families live. To help those recovery efforts, UNETE has set up a Farm Worker and Immigrant Family Relief Fund, and the United Way of Jackson County has established a Fire Fund you can support.
Finally, if you or anyone you know has had to evacuate or has been displaced by the wildfires and is wondering how that will affect their ability to vote this fall, please read and share this information from State Senator Shemia Fagan, our Democratic Nominee for Secretary of State.
How to vote if you've been evacuated
Photo of State Sen. Shemia Fagan
1\. Displaced people have until October 13 to decide where they want their ballot sent. Provisional ballots should be a last resort.
2\. We vote by mail, but it's okay if you do not have an address. People without homes must provide a residence address, but it can be any physical location. This could be a shelter, park, motor home, or other identifiable location.
3\. The mailing address of a person who is homeless or who resides where mail service is unavailable can be the office of the county clerk. Voters can pick up their ballot at the county elections office.
4\. After a disaster, it is hard to know where we will be months from now. The deadline to update voter registration is 10/13. If you update it, and then end up in a different county...
5\. You can request a provisional ballot at a county elections office and vote in a different county than you are registered in.
If you have any questions about your ballot, please reach out to us at [[URL REDACTED]], or contact your county's elections office.
From all of us here at the Democratic Party of Oregon, please stay safe.
– Oregon Democrats

This is big, Alex.
As of this weekend, nearly 3 out of every 4 Oregon Democrats have returned their ballot, and Oregon's overall voter turnout is at 61%!
But we're not stopping now. We can't afford to, not with so much at stake and so many incredible Oregon Democrats to elect up and down the ballot.
These Democrats need your vote! If you still have your ballot, don't wait any longer to complete and it to a drop box — see the Democrats on your ballot and find a drop box near you with our 2020 Voter Guide at [[URL REDACTED]]
Visit [[URL REDACTED]]
In 2016, turnout among Oregon Democrats was nearly 88%.
In 2012, that number was more than 86%.
And in 2008, an incredible 89% of Oregon Democrats voted!
In 2020, we're aiming even higher, but if we're going to break that record over the next three days we need to reach as many Oregon Democrats as possible who still have their ballot and make sure they return it to a drop box by 8 pm on Tuesday!
Are you one of them, Alex? If so, make sure you get your ballot to a drop box as soon as possible!
Use our 2020 Voter Guide to look up the Democrats on your ballot and find a drop box near you.

Ballots go out to Oregon voters this week, Alex!
Before you get your ballot, we need to know: Will you pledge to vote in 2020?
Pledge to Vote
Why is your pledge to vote so important?
Once ballots start to arrive in Oregon mailboxes, we're going to turn our GOTV operation up to 11: reaching out to and mobilizing Democratic voters, and giving them the tools they need to complete and return their ballots as soon as possible.
We're seeing massive early Democratic turnout numbers in states across the country, and if we can replicate that here in Oregon, it means we can focus our efforts even more on the voters who might need a little bit more of a nudge or some additional information before they're ready to turn in their ballots.
That's why your pledge to vote is so important, and it will make a direct impact on how many Oregon Democrats we can elect this fall.
With so much at stake this election, will you pledge to vote in 2020?
Pledge to Vote
Thank you,

P.S. Not sure if you're registered to vote? Oregon's voter registration deadline is on Tuesday, October 13th. Make sure you register to vote, or check your voter registration information before the deadline!

Democratic Party of Oregon Logo
Say it with us, Alex: The only poll that matters is on Election Day.
We're not getting complacent. How could we? Not with so many critical races happening up and down the ballot in Oregon.
In addition to defeating Trump, Oregon has a U.S. Senate race and five U.S. House races on the ballot. There's the race for Oregon Secretary of State, Attorney General, and Treasurer. And there are critical Oregon Legislative races that will determine whether we can defend and even expand our Democratic majorities in Salem.
What that all means is that we won't stop organizing and mobilizing Oregonians until every ballot has been counted this fall.
But we need you with us to make sure Democrats win all across Oregon in November. If you're able, will you start a monthly gift to the Democratic Party of Oregon?
Count me in!
If there was ever a moment to consider becoming a monthly donor to the Democratic Party of Oregon, now is the time.
Why now? Because with Election Day just 111 days away, and with ballots arriving in Oregon mailboxes in 91 days, we need all hands on deck to elect Democrats all across Oregon in November.
If we're going to do that, we need to mobilize Democrats in every single Oregon ZIP code — and if we know we can count on your monthly support between now and Election Day, we can boost turnout even higher this fall.
Becoming a monthly donor is one of the most impactful things you can do to elect Democrats in 2020. Will you start a monthly gift to the Democratic Party of Oregon?

Remember, it's not a deduction — it's a credit. And it’s like a free $50 donation for Oregon taxpayers, once a year.
Together we can defeat Trump, take the Senate out of Mitch McConnell's control, replace Greg Walden, and elect Democrats up and down the ballot in Oregon.

Democratic Party of Oregon Logo
The final presidential debate of the 2020 election just ended, Alex. And the choice we face could not be clearer.
We must defeat Donald Trump and elect Joe Biden as the next President of the United States.
Now, there's just one thing left to do.
Vote.
Vote because countless lives depend on it.
Vote because our democracy depends on it.
Vote because our climate, our health care, our rights, the shared values of humanity and decency and honor that make up so much of what it means to be Oregonians and Americans, and so much more are all on the line.
Hundreds of thousands of Oregonians have already cast their ballots. Nearly 50 million Americans have already voted early.
Now, we need you to join them with your vote.

[Supreme Court Alert] OR Dems,democrats@dpo.org,SCOTUS upholds DACA!,"This is a huge victory for DREAMers across the country
Democratic Party of Oregon Logo
Great news, Alex!
The Supreme Court ruled today that Trump can't immediately end the DACA program. This decision will protect 700,000 DREAMers across America and about 10,000 here in Oregon from being deported from their homes. This is a huge victory for DREAMers across the country!
But as much of a relief as this decision is, this win is only temporary, because the ruling is silent on whether Trump has the power to end DACA. It merely recognizes that the way his administration went about trying to end DACA violates the law.
FiveThirtyEight summed it up with their headline on the decision: ""The Supreme Court Put DACA's Fate In The Hands Of Voters.""
538 headline: ""The Supreme Court Put DACA's Fate In The Hands Of Voters.""
If Trump wins re-election, you can be sure he'll try again to end DACA — and there's no telling how the Supreme Court will rule if he does.
What's more, Trump's telling his base that he's looking to appoint even more far-right judges to the Court, potentially creating a hard-line conservative majority on the Court for decades:
Trump tweet: ""I will be releasing a new list of Conservative Supreme Court Justice nominees, which may include some, or many of those already on the list, by September 1, 2020. If given the opportunity, I will only choose from this list, as in the past, a Conservative Supreme Court [[URL REDACTED]] on decisions being rendered now, this list is more important than ever before \(Second Amendment, Right to Life, Religous Liberty, etc.\) – VOTE 2020!""
We can't let that happen. We need Democrats in Congress and a president who will protect DREAMers.
Like the headlines say: The fate of DACA and of hundreds of thousands of DREAMers rests in our hands. That's why it's so critical we do everything we can to elect Joe Biden, re-elect Jeff Merkley, and vote for Democrats up and down the ballot this fall. Are you with us?

For the past three years, Senator Wyden has been one of our nation's foremost leaders in stopping the Trump administration's policies. At every turn, Senator Wyden has been there to protect our health care, our environment, and our Constitution.
He's been able to do that because he has heard directly from thousands of Oregonians at the more than 150 town halls he's hosted across the state since Trump took office.
He's hosting upcoming town halls in your area where you can learn more about what he's doing in D.C., and how he's going to keep fighting for the Oregon Way. We encourage you to attend and show your support!

KC Hanson,democrats@dpo.org,Effective and trustworthy leadership matters so much right now,"We're paying dearly for Trump's inexcusable delay in responding to this crisis.
Alex,
Oregonians and Americans alike are paying dearly for Trump's inexcusable delay in responding to this crisis.
Even more of our loved ones could be put at risk if Trump continues to ignore public health experts and prioritizes his re-election over our health and safety.
Oregon has proven that effective and trustworthy state and local leadership matters so much right now. From Governor Kate Brown, to our Democratic Congressional team, to our Democratic state, legislative and local elected officials, they've shown how important it is to have trusted public servants in elected office.
We must work harder than ever to ensure that we elect Oregon Democrats to office at every level who will continue to fight for the values we share.
Alex, I know these are tough times, but the Democratic Party of Oregon needs your support now more than ever. That’s why I’m asking: If you're able, could you chip in what you can ahead of tonight's April fundraising deadline to help us elect Democrats all across Oregon in 2020?
Donate $5
Donate $10
Donate $25
Donate another amount
COVID-19 and social distancing requirements have caused a seismic shift in our organizing.
It’s been hard. Our staff are all working from home. We've had to postpone our largest fundraising event, the 11th Annual Wayne Morse Gala, until September. We’ve had to change how we hold meetings and trainings.
But despite these monumental challenges, the work to win this November must go on.
In 2018 we turned our organizing plans — especially around strategies like our Neighborhood Leader Program and our Local Elections Project — into historic victories at the ballot box.
We're putting our 2020 plans into action and setting the stage for even bigger wins this fall. But right now we need to build the support it's going to take to implement and expand these winning programs, especially in the changed campaign environment.
We’re working with County Parties on new and responsible campaign tactics, holding training webinars to support Democrats running for office right now, retaining our entire excellent staff, and planning to hire essential positions later this summer to run critical voter turnout programs.
If there is one thing that this crisis has made abundantly clear, it's that Donald Trump is supremely unfit to lead our country. America simply cannot afford another four years of Trump. Lives are at stake.
That's why we need your help now to make sure we can do everything it's going to take to defeat Trump and elect Democrats in November.
If you're able, will you chip in $5, $10, $25, or whatever you can before tonight's fundraising deadline to help elect Oregon Democrats in 2020? It matters now more than ever.
From all of us at the Democratic Party of Oregon, please stay healthy and safe.

The stakes for November's election keep getting higher and higher, Alex.
In times like these, it's so important that we rise to the occasion and come together to do everything we can to elect Oregon Democrats up and down the ballot. And we do that by building a grassroots movement that can't be beat.
Our February fundraising deadline is at midnight tonight. Will you chip in $5, $10, or whatever you can to support our work?

We are stronger when we come together to organize and mobilize Democrats in all corners of Oregon, and that strength comes from the grassroots.
That comes from Neighborhood Leaders talking to their neighbors and encouraging them to vote, one of the most effective ways to boost Democratic turnout.
That comes from recruiting Precinct Committee People — the building blocks of our Party — to turn every precinct blue.
And that comes from grassroots Democrats like you chipping in to support outreach programs like these and more that will make sure we elect Democrats all across Oregon in 2020.
Can we count on you to chip in before our midnight deadline to help build the grassroots support it's going to take to elect Democrats this fall?

Oregon Democrats,democrats@dpo.org,House Democrats fighting for national Vote-by-Mail and to #SaveTheUSPS,"The House of Representatives is poised to vote on the HEROES Act as soon as tomorrow.
Alex,
Democrats just unveiled their latest COVID-19 relief plan – a critical package that will provide urgent financial support for Oregonians and Americans, safeguard our democracy by ensuring every voter has access to vote-by-mail, keep the U.S. Postal Service running, and more.
The House of Representatives is poised to vote on the HEROES Act as soon as this afternoon. Will you add your name to show our Oregon Democratic Congressional Delegation that you support the HEROES Act?
Add my name!
These proposals ought to be something all of our elected officials can rally around and pass quickly in order to provide a sense of safety and stability for Americans in the midst of this crisis.
But unfortunately, that's unlikely to be the case. Trump recently called the U.S. Postal Service ""a joke"" and railed against vote-by-mail, calling it ""horrible"" and ""corrupt"" despite the fact that he, his family, and many in his administration all use vote-by-mail.
Meanwhile, Mitch McConnell's idea of a response to this crisis is to let states go bankrupt and to convene the Senate just to force more Trump nominees onto the Courts.
Democrats are fighting to deliver bold, urgent relief to families and workers in need, and to safeguard our democracy. Add your name to support the HEROES Act.
Support the HEROES Act

OR Dems,democrats@dpo.org,Trump threatens to delay the election ,"We want to be crystal clear here, Alex: Trump cannot do that.
Democratic Party of Oregon Logo
This morning, Trump took to Twitter and threatened to delay the 2020 election.
We want to be crystal clear here, Alex: Trump cannot delay the election. Only Congress can do that, and there is ZERO chance of that happening thanks to your hard work to make sure Democrats took control of the House of Representatives in 2018.
It's no coincidence that this latest outburst comes after reports that the American economy shrank last quarter at the worst rate on record, or after the haunting milestone of 150,000 lives lost from the coronavirus, or as Trump continues to see his poll numbers plummet amidst his failure to respond to this pandemic.
It's not enough to simply defeat Trump this fall. We need to make sure that the results of this election are decisive and beyond a shadow of a doubt. And we need you with us to make that possible.
Our July end-of-month fundraising deadline is tomorrow at midnight. Will you donate to the Democratic Party of Oregon to defeat Trump and elect Democrats all across Oregon? Remember, you can use your 2020 Oregon Political Tax Credit to give – it's like a free $50 donation.
Yes, I'll donate!
Over the next 96 days, we can be sure that Trump will throw everything he can at the wall in hopes of reviving his flailing campaign.
He's already tried sending his goons to Portland to weaponize federal law enforcement against Oregonians protesting against racial injustice and systemic police violence. In response, even more Oregonians raised their voices to declare that Black Lives Matter and to defend our Constitutional rights — and now the feds are on their way out.
And Trump continues to attack vote-by-mail, despite the fact that it is the safest and most secure way to conduct an election right now. He would rather force people to risk their health and safety to cast their vote to than make sure every single American has access to a mail-in ballot.
Every single day, Trump's malfeasance makes crystal clear that this is the most important election of our lifetimes. If you're able, please chip in before our July fundraising deadline to help defeat Trump and elect Democrats up and down the ballot this fall.

P.S. You can qualify for the Oregon Political Tax Credit if you're an Oregon taxpayer making under $75,000, or $150,000 per year as part of a joint-filing couple.

Alex —
We're just two weeks away from Election Day!
We just got the first big batch of turnout data, and 1 out of every 7 Oregon Democrats has already returned their ballots — that's more than 160,000 Democrats!
These are huge numbers after the first weekend of voting, and they're a testament to the hard work of our volunteers and supporters, and to how energized Democrats are to vote this year.
But with more than one million registered Democrats in Oregon, we've got a lot of work to do to make sure our GOTV efforts turn out as many Democratic votes as possible in the next two weeks in order to defeat Trump, re-elect Jeff Merkley, and elect Oregon Democrats up and down the ballot.
We have two more weeks to finish strong, and we can't leave anything on the table. Will you donate to power our voter outreach and grassroots organizing over the last two weeks of the 2020 Election?

"Rosa Colquitt, Ph.D.",democrats@dpo.org,Dr. King's National Day of Service,"""A day on, not a day off.”
Alex,
The Martin Luther King Jr. holiday on January 20, 2020, marks the 25th anniversary of the day of service that celebrates the Civil Rights leader’s life and legacy.
Observed each year on the third Monday in January as “a day on, not a day off,” MLK Day is the only federal holiday designated as a national day of service to encourage all Americans to volunteer to improve their communities.
The MLK Day of Service inspires hundreds of thousands of Americans to come together to serve their community. Citizens in all 50 states deliver meals, refurbish schools and community centers, and collect food and clothing. Volunteers also recruit mentors, support job-seekers, build homes and provide other services for veterans and military families, and help citizens improve their financial literacy skills.
Our nation’s leaders, including congressional members, governors, and mayors, honor Dr. King’s legacy through service projects, while addressing pressing community needs. This day of service helps to empower individuals, strengthen communities, bridge barriers, address social problems, and move us closer to Dr. King's vision of a ""Beloved Community.""
On this 25th Anniversary of Dr. King’s National Day of Service the DPO Black Caucus and Democratic Party of Oregon encourage you to give back by giving some of your time to a cause close to you. Find your day of service volunteer opportunity here.

Hey Alex,
The support that we're seeing from Oregon Democrats right now — even during this pandemic — has been absolutely incredible.
As the DPO's Digital Coordinator, an important goal for me isn't just about how much money we can raise. It's more about how many Oregon Democrats chip in to support our work.
That's because we know that if we can build widespread, grassroots support, we can do everything it's going to take to defeat Trump and Republicans this fall.
So you can imagine how excited I am to share that more Oregon Democrats have donated via email this month than in any April before — and nearly 40% for the first time ever! And the average contribution this month? $26.
We're seeing unprecedented levels of grassroots support from Oregon Democrats. Now, with our April fundraising deadline just a few hours away, help us finish this month strong.
If you're able, will you chip in $26, $10, $5, or whatever you can to help defeat Trump and elect Oregon Democrats up and down the ballot in 2020?

Alex,
You shouldn't have to choose between your health and exercising your right to vote. It's just that simple.
We know the Oregon way of voting — universal vote-by-mail — should be the way all of America votes.
And amid the COVID-19 crisis, we should be doing everything we can to make sure all Americans can exercise their right to vote without fear of putting their health at risk.
That's why Senators Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley introduced a bill to expand Oregon-Style Vote-By-Mail for all American voters this year.
Will you add your name in support of Senator Wyden and Merkley's bill to expand vote-by-mail nationwide?
Yes, we need National Vote-by-Mail NOW!

Oregon Democrats,democrats@dpo.org,What's happening in Wisconsin right now is a travesty,"Republicans are putting voters' lives at risk to keep Americans from voting by mail.
Alex,
What's happening in today's Wisconsin primary is a travesty, and is putting people's lives at risk.
Republicans at all levels of government, from the Wisconsin legislature, to the state Supreme Court, all the way to the five Republican-appointed Justices on the U.S. Supreme Court, have blocked Wisconsin from taking the necessary steps to ensure the safety of voters and poll workers.
Now, people in Wisconsin are being forced to choose between their health and safety, and exercising their right to vote.
We're already seeing images and reports of huge lines of people (both wearing and not wearing protective masks) having to wait hours to cast their votes.
Not only is this disenfranchising people, it is putting their health and even their lives at risk.
Oregonians know: It doesn't have to be this way.
We know the Oregon way of voting — universal vote-by-mail — should be the way all of America votes.
That's why Senators Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley introduced a bill to expand Oregon-Style Vote-By-Mail for all American voters this year.
Will you add your name in support of Senator Wyden and Merkley's bill to expand vote-by-mail nationwide?
In Oregon, we’ve been voting by mail successfully for more than two decades — it’s increased accessibility, it’s given more Oregonians the ability to participate in our democracy, and it’s a safe, commonsense way to conduct an election, especially under these circumstances.
The strength and success of our vote-by-mail system shows exactly why the Republican attacks on mail voting are so dishonest and such a transparent attempt to stop more Americans from exercising their constitutional right.
The GOP is pushing these baseless claims for one reason: Trump’s record has hurt hardworking Americans, and they know when more people vote, Democrats win.
Please, add your name to support National Vote-By-Mail:
I support National Vote-By-Mail!

We're getting down to the wire, Alex, and our final fundraising deadline of the 2020 Election is tomorrow at midnight.
With a little more than 24 hours to go until our October deadline, and with one weekend left to turn out as many Oregon voters as we can, your support right now could make the difference in close races up and down the ballot.
That's why we're asking: Can you chip in right now and help us elect Oregon Democrats in 2020?
Donate ➞
This is the biggest fundraising deadline of the year, Alex.
The support we can generate by midnight tomorrow will determine the resources we can put into the final few days of GOTV in this election.
It's so important that we finish strong, so we're double-checking our records ahead of the deadline. Could you take a look to make sure this is right?

Democratic Party of Oregon,democrats@dpo.org,Impeached,"No matter what happens next, our mission in 2020 is clear:
Alex,
Tonight, the House of Representatives voted to impeach Donald Trump for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.
This vote happened amid overwhelming and irrefutable evidence Trump pressured a foreign country to interfere in our election on his behalf, and then obstructed a congressional investigation into his actions.
It is only the third time in our nation's history that a president has been impeached.
All of Oregon's Democratic Congressional Delegation voted in favor of impeachment. We're thankful for their leadership, their dedication to their oaths of office, and their understanding that no one is above the law.
The vote proved that we cannot say the same of any House Republican, including Greg Walden.
The impeachment proceedings now move to the Senate, where Mitch McConnell has already made clear that he has no intention of holding a fair trial.
No matter what happens next, our mission in 2020 is clear: To elect Democrats up and down the ballot, all across Oregon.
There is so much at stake in 2020, and we need your help in this fight, Alex. Please make your end-of-year donation to the Democratic Party of Oregon today.

We have a critical opportunity next November, Alex.
For the first time since 1998, Greg Walden will not be on the ballot in Oregon's Second Congressional District.
Walden is retiring at the end of his term, giving Oregonians a great opportunity to elect a Democrat in the district.
Will you donate today to help us replace Walden with a Democrat in 2020?
Yes, I'll donate!
Walden sold his constituents out in 2017, joining his Republican cronies to vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act and take health care away from 300,000 Oregonians and nearly 65,000 people in his own district.
After he won re-election by his tightest-ever margin in 2018, Walden told reporters that his district ""sure as heck ain't getting any redder.""
Walden saw the writing on the wall, and now it's up to us to finish the job in 2020.

"Rosa Colquitt, Ph.D., DPO Black Caucus Chair",democrats@dpo.org,"George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, and all who came before.","Democratic Party of Oregon Logo
A Message from Rosa Colquitt, PhD, Chair of the Democratic Party of Oregon’s Black Caucus
On May 26, most Americans woke up to the news of a disturbing video showing 46-year-old George Floyd pinned to the concrete with the knee of a Minneapolis police officer on his neck. After more than seven minutes being pinned under the pressure of the officer's knee, Mr. Floyd ultimately died.
My reaction as a Black mother was to hold my adult son to my bosom, to never release him, to protect him with my very life. I am incapable of speaking the fear inside of me for my Black son. I know I voice the sentiments of Black mothers all over the country. Whites express grief: “How horrible, how wrong, yet again — it must stop.” Black Americans say, ""Oh yes, again, who's next?""
Weeks earlier, America witnessed the unspeakable trauma and grief over the killing of 26-year-old EMT Breonna Taylor while sleeping in her home in Louisville, Kentucky, by police officers serving a no-knock arrest warrant on her boyfriend. And more recently, the killing of 25-year-old Ahmaud Arbery while jogging in Glynn County, Georgia, by an armed father-son duo, supposedly for a ""suspected robbery."" No doubt this is a month of national reckoning for Black people and for all conscientious Americans, all in the midst of a coronavirus pandemic that is disproportionately killing Black Americans.
Rev. Dr. Bernice King, youngest daughter of civil rights icon Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. tweeted a picture of the police officer kneeling on George Floyd's neck alongside a picture of Colin Kaepernick kneeling at a football game to protest the shootings of unarmed Black men by police. She wrote in part, ""If you're unbothered or mildly bothered by the first knee but outraged by the second, then in my father's words, you're more devoted to order than to justice.” Bernice King speaks profoundly to a nation so badly in need of healing.
Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, former Vice President Joe Biden spoke to the nation this afternoon about the killing of George Floyd. After speaking with Mr. Floyd's family, Biden addressed the lack of presidential leadership in his speech, as well as the history connected to Floyd’s death. Part of the Vice President's speech follows:
“Once again we heard the words, ‘I can’t breathe.’ An act of brutality so elemental, it did more than deny one more black man of America his civil rights and his human rights, it denied him of his very humanity, it denied him of his life ... The same thing happened with Arbery, the same thing happened with Breonna Taylor, the same thing with George Floyd ... they’re the latest additions to the endless list of stolen potential, wiped out unnecessarily. It’s a list that dates back more than 400 years, black men, black women, black children. The original sin of this country still stains our nation today, and sometimes we manage to overlook it. We just push forward with a thousand other tasks in our daily life, but it’s always there. On weeks like this, we see it plainly that we are a country with an open wound, and none of us can turn away, none of us can be silent. None of us can any longer — can we hear the words, ‘I can’t breathe,’ and do nothing.”
Biden went on to say it's not a time for tweets and encouraging violence, but a time for leadership in a national crisis.
The leadership of the Democratic Party of Oregon strenuously rejects the unwarranted killings of Black Americans. The very core of both our Platform and our belief system as Democrats is about the equality of all. But in the wake of yet another senseless killing, we face the sad reality that our advocacy and even our most heartfelt, passionate beliefs were not enough to save George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, and the thousands who came before. The most virtuous beliefs mean nothing if they are not lived; the most comprehensive of policies are feckless if they are not promoted and enforced; and our visions of marching toward a truly more perfect union will go dark without all of us forging a path forward together.
May our passion and commitment, as well as our rage and grief, bring all of us together to fight this horrific and deadly disease that is racism.

Democratic Party of Oregon,democrats@dpo.org,RNC spending $20 MILLION on voter suppression,"Republicans are stooping to new lows this election, and voter suppression is key to their strategy.
Alex,
Republicans can't reliably win elections by winning enough votes, so now they're spending tens of millions of dollars to make it more difficult for Americans to vote.
The Republican National Committee and Trump's re-election campaign have DOUBLED their budget to $20 million for filing lawsuits intended to suppress voting in states across the country.
Much of this is expected to be spent fighting against efforts by states to allow more Americans to vote by mail this fall, and will likely force many people to choose between their health and their right to vote.
Donate to fight back against voter suppression tactics and help elect Democrats up and down the ballot.
Donate
Republicans are now reportedly trying to recruit 50,000 volunteers in key states to intimidate voters and challenge their ballots at polling places.
This is part of a coordinated Republican strategy to suppress turnout among minority voters. In fact, they've done it before, leading to a court order dating back to 1982 preventing the RNC from quote-unquote ""ballot security"" activities.
But that ban ended in 2018, and now Republicans are wasting no time to lay the groundwork for voter suppression this fall.
A senior Trump campaign advisor said the quiet part loud last November, telling fellow Republicans about the need to ramp up their voter suppression plans after losing governor's races in Kentucky and Louisiana last year.
Republicans have already made clear that they're willing to stoop to new lows this election — and voter suppression is key to their strategy.
We won't let this stand. If you're able, please consider chipping in $5, $10, $25, or whatever you can to support the Democratic Party of Oregon.

Democratic Party of Oregon Logo
Did you see this bombshell news, Alex?
NYT Headline:  TRUMP’S TAXES SHOW CHRONIC LOSSES AND YEARS OF TAX AVOIDANCE – ""Donald J. Trump paid $750 in federal income taxes the year he won the presidency. In his first year in the White House, he paid another $750.  He had paid no income taxes at all in 10 of the previous 15 years""
After years of Trump refusing to release his tax returns, new reporting uncovered more than two decades of Trump's tax return information. It revealed that in 2016 and 2017, he paid only $750 in federal taxes, and paid nothing in federal taxes for 10 of the last 15 years.
Think about that – whether you're a teacher, a firefighter, a nurse, or just about any working Oregonian – you've probably paid more in federal taxes than Donald Trump.
Regular Oregonians pay their fair share, but Trump looks for and exploits every way he can to avoid paying his. This isn't right. Help defeat Trump and elect Oregon Democrats by making a donation to the Democratic Party of Oregon today.
Donate ➞
Making matters worse, the Trump tax scam that he and Republicans passed in 2017 gives even more handouts to Trump and his wealthy cronies, all while the GOP works to cut Medicare and Social Security to pay for Trump's tax breaks.
Enough is enough. It's time to elect leaders who know what it means to work hard and pay their fair share to support their fellow Americans.

Oregon Dems,democrats@dpo.org,Trump's fundraiser-turned-postmaster general is sabotaging the USPS,"""The policies could undermine their ability to deliver ballots on time for the November election.""
Democratic Party of Oregon Logo
Alex,
With less than 100 days until a nationwide election that will see record numbers of Americans casting their ballots by mail, this headline is deeply troubling:
Washington Post headline: ""Postal Service backlog sparks worries that ballot delivery could be delayed in November""
According to reporting from the Washington Post, the ""U.S. Postal Service is experiencing days-long backlogs of mail across the country after a top Trump donor running the agency put in place new procedures described as cost-cutting efforts, alarming postal workers who warn that the policies could undermine their ability to deliver ballots on time for the November election.""
It hasn't even been two months since Trump installed Louis DeJoy, one of his top donors, as postmaster general — and DeJoy is already doing everything he can to undermine the USPS.
Trump is attacking vote-by-mail every chance he gets, threatening to delay the election, and now with his fundraiser-turned-postmaster general sabotaging the USPS, we need to do everything we can to fight back.
We're less than 24 hours away from our big July fundraising deadline. If you're able, will you chip in to help defeat Trump and elect Oregon Democrats this fall? Remember, you can use your 2020 Oregon Political Tax Credit to give – it's like a free $50 donation.
Yes, I'll donate!
DeJoy's cuts at the USPS are resulting in delays in mail delivery all across the country, even for express mail, earning him the nickname ""Louis DeLay.""
Vote-by-Mail is the Oregon Way, and we're prepared to conduct this fall's election entirely by mail because Oregon has been doing it that way for more than 20 years.
We know that the dedicated postal workers at the USPS will be doing everything they can to ensure ballots arrive in time this fall. But with Trump's donor/postmaster general calling the shots, we have to work even harder to contact voters and make sure they turn in their ballots as soon as possible.
Our July fundraising deadline is tonight at midnight, and we need support from Oregon Democrats like you to make sure we hit our goal. Will you donate to the Democratic Party of Oregon?

Alex,
No one should have to choose between their health and their right to vote. That's why every voter should be able to vote by mail from the safety and comfort of their homes this fall.
But instead of making sure Americans are safe, Trump is more focused on himself and his campaign, and this week he called vote-by-mail the biggest threat to his re-election.
Oregon has been voting by mail for more than two decades: It's safe, it's easy, and it's accessible. And thanks to vote-by-mail, we set new turnout records in this May's Primary, even during a pandemic!
The time is now for National Vote-By-Mail. Add your name to support a bill from Senators Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley to expand Oregon-Style Vote-By-Mail to all American voters this year.
I support National Vote-By-Mail!

As the sham impeachment trial in Mitch McConnell's Senate hurtles toward an end with Republicans voting to not allow ANY witnesses, it can be easy to despair in this moment.

Alex,
Exactly one month from tonight, Americans will tune in for the first presidential debate of 2020.
2020 has taught us all that a lot can happen in the span of a month. But if the last four years are any indication, we have a pretty good idea of what to expect from that evening.
We'll see Trump lie about his failed presidency, one where his chaotic leadership and his divisive rhetoric and actions have made it impossible to solve the challenges that we face as a nation.
We'll see Trump refuse to take any responsibility for managing America's failed response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has now claimed more than 180,000 American lives, cost 6 million jobs, put tens of millions of people out of work, and shuttered businesses in Oregon and across the country.
And we'll see Trump continue to spread lies and conspiracy theories about vote-by-mail, the media, even about coronavirus treatments — all to try and salvage his flailing poll numbers.
It didn't have to be this way. And America cannot afford another four years of Donald Trump.
Our August end-of-month fundraising deadline is Monday at midnight. Will you chip in before then to help us defeat Trump and elect Democrats up and down the ballot this fall? Remember, you can use your 2020 Oregon Political Tax Credit to give – it's like a free $50 donation.
Yes, I'll donate!
On the other side of that stage will be Vice President Joe Biden, who is ready to lead our country out of the darkness of Trump's administration.
He and Kamala Harris will work to begin a new chapter in our nation's history, and when we elect them — along with Democratic majorities in the House and Senate — we can come out of this crisis stronger than before.
But we need every single one of us coming together and doing everything we can over the next 65 days to make sure that happens.
As we head into the final stretch of the most important election of our lifetimes, will you make a donation to the Democratic Party of Oregon ahead of our August fundraising deadline?

Democratic Party of Oregon,democrats@dpo.org,Walden sticks to the Republican Party line on vote-by-mail,"If you were expecting any leadership from retiring Republican Greg Walden during the COVID-19 crisis, think again.
Alex,
If you were expecting any leadership from retiring Republican Greg Walden during the COVID-19 crisis, think again:
We shouldn't be surprised that Walden is wrong (again) and sticking to the party line (again).
He's following Trump's lead and telling Americans that they might have to choose between their health and exercising their right to vote this November.
But let's get the facts straight, because the suggestion that a rapid transition to National Vote-by-Mail is some kind of insurmountable logistical hurdle is nonsense:
Five states, including Oregon, conduct all their elections by mail. Walden himself has (presumably) voted by mail for the last 20 years.
Three more states give counties the option to run elections entirely by mail.
At least 28 states (and Washington, D.C.) allow voters to request absentee ballots for any reason.
Every single state has some form of absentee balloting. In fact, in the 2018 election, more than one out of every four voters cast their ballot with vote-by-mail!
Now is the time to expand these programs to provide National Vote-by-Mail.
Walden and Republicans would rather put voters at risk (or better yet, keep them from voting) than even try to do the right thing for Americans during a pandemic. Unless we act, we could see what happened this past week in Wisconsin all across the country in November.
It's time for #NationalVoteByMail. And it's time for Greg Walden to head toward the exits, since he clearly has no interest in demonstrating leadership on his way out.

Alex,
Trump is doing everything he can to cast doubt on this fall's election.
For months now, he's lied about the safety and security of vote-by-mail, at a time when we should be doing everything we can to make sure people don't have to choose between their health and their right to vote.
And yesterday, he tweeted about delaying the election — something he cannot do on his own. It's the kind of talk you'd expect to hear from dictators and authoritarians who know they can't win a free and fair election.
How are Oregon Republicans reacting to this? You guessed it: Radio silence.
They couldn't wait to line up in support of Trump's goon squads and their violent, unconstitutional tactics. But now, after Trump's latest tweets attempting to subvert our democracy, they're so quiet you'd think they had left the state to avoid a quorum call. Even Mitch McConnell pushed back against Trump talking about delaying the election.
Oregon Republicans have proven time and time again that they cannot be trusted. They'd rather shut down the government to take a taxpayer-funded vacation than show up and do the jobs they were elected to do. And now with Trump threatening our democracy, their silence is deafening.
This fall, there is an Oregon Democrat running in every single legislative race on the ballot. With just a few hours left until our July fundraising deadline, chip in to help elect as many Oregon Democrats as possible in 2020.

One week, Alex. That's all that remains between us and when voting ends in the most important election of our lifetimes.
Democrats have been gearing up for these final seven days of this election campaign since November 9th, 2016.
All of the planning, all of the outreach, the marches, the phone calls, the postcards, the volunteer shifts, the text banks, everything ... it all comes down to what we do in the next week.
We can't — we won't — leave anything on the table. We need everyone working together to run through the tape and defeat Trump, send Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to the White House, take the Senate out of Mitch McConnell's control, and more.
If you're able, please chip in $10, $25, or whatever you can to power our final week of Get-Out-The-Vote outreach and elect Oregon Democrats up and down the ballot.

Tim McCann (via DPO.org),democrats@dpo.org,This is a critical moment 📅,"Our first big fundraising deadline of the year, Alex.
Countdown clock to the end of January 2020
Alex,
Friday is our first big fundraising deadline of the year, and it comes at a critical moment.
Oregon's short legislative session begins on Monday, and Oregon Democrats are ready to finish the job we started last year by passing major legislation to act on climate.
Will you chip in before our January fundraising deadline?
Donate
There are already rumblings that Republicans might walk off the job again and leave the state in order to block a climate bill.
Oregonians have made it clear that the time is now to take strong action to address the climate crisis.
That's why voters overwhelmingly elected Democrats in 2018 who ran on the promise of climate action.
And new polling shows that huge numbers of Oregonians agree: If Republicans don't like a bill, they should work to improve it or simply vote against it rather than shut down the Legislature because they didn't get their way.
But if Republicans try to shirk their responsibility and walk out, we need to be ready to act.
Our January fundraising deadline is Friday at midnight. Will you pitch in $5, $10, $25, or whatever you can to support the Democratic Party of Oregon and help make sure we pass a major climate bill this session?

Oregon Democrats,democrats@dpo.org,Americans – Democrats and Republicans alike – agree on this:,"We shouldn't have to choose between our health and our vote.
Alex,
No American should have to choose between their health and their vote.
As it turns out, most Americans agree!
Reuters headline: ""Most Americans, unlike Trump, want mail-in ballots for November if coronavirus threatens.""
Regular Americans — Democrats and Republicans alike — understand that vote-by-mail is a safe, commonsense way to run an election, especially during a global pandemic.
But Trump and his Republican cronies are refusing to expand vote-by-mail nationwide, despite the fact that many of them use vote-by-mail themselves!
If it's good enough for Trump's family and his administration, why isn't it good enough for all Americans?
That's not all. A funded and fully functioning U.S. Postal Service is critical to holding vote-by-mail elections, and Trump is making the USPS the target of his latest extortion racket.
He's called the USPS ""a joke"" and refusing to offer any kind of relief to the venerable agency unless it imposes draconian cuts and weakens postal service unions.
We're fighting to make the Oregon way of voting — vote-by-mail — available to all Americans this year. And we're raising the voices of thousands of Oregon Democrats like you to #SaveTheUSPS, to keep this critical lifeline for so many Oregonians open, and to make sure we can safely hold free and fair elections during this pandemic.
Our April end-of-month fundraising deadline is tomorrow at midnight, and despite all of the challenges the COVID-19 pandemic has thrown our way, our goal is within reach.
If you're able, please consider chipping in $5, $10, $25, or whatever you can to support our work and help elect Oregon Democrats in 2020.

KC Hanson,democrats@dpo.org,HUGE WIN for LGBTQ+ rights,"Today's landmark civil rights decision from SCOTUS:
Democratic Party of Oregon Logo
Alex,
As an LGBTQ+ American, as an activist who battled the insidious Oregon anti-gay ballot initiatives of the 1990's, and as the Democratic Party of Oregon's first out lesbian chair, I can barely scratch the surface in describing my joy at this morning's historic Supreme Court decision.
The stunning 6-3 ruling declares that LGBTQ+ workers are protected by federal anti-discrimination laws. This dramatically changes the status quo for millions of Americans — over half the states have no non-discrimination law that applies to LGBTQ+ workers. (Oregon passed protections in 2007.)
This is a HUGE victory for LGBTQ+ equality. This decision affirms that in America, you can no longer be fired or denied a job simply because of who you love or how you identify.
But even with this win, there is still more work to be done, including passing H.R. 5: The Equality Act, which would provide clear, comprehensive non-discrimination protections for LGBTQ+ people across the country in all areas of the law. That bill passed out of the House more than a year ago, and has been sitting in Mitch McConnell's Senate ever since.
Will you donate to help the fight for LGBTQ+ rights by defeating Trump and taking the Senate out of Mitch McConnell's control?
Donate
For Democrats, it was obvious that anti-discrimination laws apply to the LGBTQ+ community. Justice had been delayed and denied for far too long for many Americans, especially Aimee Stephens and Donald Zarda, two plaintiffs in today's cases who passed away as it was moving through the courts.
But this ruling was far from assured, and that it was decided with a 6-3 majority was surprising news in and of itself.
Whether or not ALL Americans can enjoy full equality under the law shouldn't be a question of whether a Republican-appointed Justice decides to rule in favor of civil rights. And the only way to avoid that question entirely is with a Democrat in the White House and with the Senate in Democratic hands, ready to appoint Justices who will protect and uphold civil rights for ALL Americans.
This ruling is cause for celebration, but the work is far from over. If you're able, will you help elect Democrats up and down the ballot this fall by making a donation today?

Donate $10

""There is no room in this world for discrimination or racism,"" said Gerald Bostock, lead plaintiff in one of the cases.
As Democrats, we will keep pushing on that arc of justice for all Americans and all Oregonians.

The Wayne Morse Gala is going to look very different this year, as we'll be holding it entirely online for the first time ever.

Of course, we really hope you'll consider chipping in, since your support will help us reach even more voters and make sure we elect Joe Biden and Oregon Democrats this fall.
But if you can't contribute, don't worry – we are also planning on livestreaming the Gala.
With Senator Tammy Duckworth joining us live as our Keynote Speaker, and more speakers to be announced soon, we know it's going to be a great evening, and we want as many Oregon Democrats as possible to attend.

Alex,
Will you help us elect Oregon's delegates to the Democratic National Convention?
Every four years, Oregon Democrats vote to choose our delegates to represent us at the Democratic National Convention, where we officially nominate our Presidential Candidate.
Delegate nominating conventions are a longstanding tradition for Oregon Democrats — however, we have to adapt in these unprecedented times. That's why we’ve established a safe and secure remote election process to choose Oregon’s delegates to the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee this summer.
We’re excited and hopeful that this new process will allow more Oregonians than ever to participate, and help us achieve and exceed our diversity and representation goals for our delegation, as we want our delegation to be representative of Oregon’s diverse population.

Hey Alex,
Ballots are out and Oregonians are voting!
It's time to fill out your ballot, so make sure you know our 2020 Statewide Ballot Measure Endorsements!
Democratic Party of Oregon 2020 Statewide Ballot Measure Endorsements: Vote YES ✓Measure 107 Allows laws and initiatives that reveal the true sources of money spent on Oregon elections, limit campaign contributions and spending, and require that political ads disclose who paid for them. Measure 108 Establishes a nicotine vape tax, reduces youth vaping and smoking, and funds the Oregon Health Plan and smoking prevention and cessation programs. Measure 109 Establishes a regulated psilocybin therapy system at supervised, licensed facilities in Oregon to help those suffering from depression and anxietyMeasure 110 Instead of arresting and jailing people for personal possession of small amounts of drugs, would expand access to drug treatment services paid for by marijuana taxes.
Oregonians are ready to pass these important ballot measures, defeat Trump, re-elect Jeff Merkley, and elect Democrats up and down the ballot.
But it's going to take all of us working together to power the voter outreach and grassroots organizing it's going to take to win.

Tomorrow could be a historic day, Alex.
The U.S. House of Representatives is expected to vote on a bill tomorrow to grant statehood to the District of Columbia, putting Washington, D.C., one step closer to becoming the 51st state.
D.C. statehood would have a big impact on American politics, giving residents of the District voting representation in the House, and the ability to elect two Senators to the Senate. So we want to know:
Do you support making the District of Columbia the 51st state?

Alex,
Democrats across America are getting ready for one of the most unique and anticipated Democratic National Conventions in history.
And we want you to participate in everything the Convention has to offer – with more events open to Oregonians than ever before.
Make sure you don't miss a moment! Sign up to get exclusive access to our Convention Schedule.
Sign me up!
Even though our Oregon Democratic Delegation won't be able to come together in Milwaukee to officially nominate Vice President Joe Biden as our nominee, we have an opportunity to allow Oregonians to participate in so many of the Convention's exciting events right from the comfort of their own homes!
Every single day during the Convention, the Democratic Party of Oregon will be hosting events leading into the nightly Convention program.
You'll be able to join events with our friends from Democratic State Parties across the country who are all working so hard to defeat Trump and elect Democrats up and down the ballot in their states.
These will have an incredible lineup of leading Democrats, including a historic event on Tuesday, August 18th, featuring Democratic Women Governors from across the country for a conversation reflecting on the role of women in electoral politics as we celebrate the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment!
We're so excited for you to join us for this virtual Convention Across America. Sign up to get daily updates during the Convention.
Hope to see you next week!

KC Hanson,democrats@dpo.org,Oregon Republican leader defends Trump's goon squads,"Instead of condemning the presence and the violent tactics of federal officers, he doubled down in support of Trump's goon squads. And he didn't stop there.
Democratic Party of Oregon Logo
I can't believe this, Alex.
This week, Oregon Senate Republican leader Fred Girod went on Fox News to talk about the protests happening in downtown Portland in response to injustice and systemic police violence against communities of color.
But instead of condemning the uninvited and unwelcome presence of federal officers and their violent, unconstitutional tactics, Girod doubled down in support of Trump's goon squads.
And he didn't stop there.
He dismissed concerns about Trump's occupying troops roaming the streets of downtown Portland in unmarked vans and in camouflage, rounding up people and detaining them with no explanation or identification. Girod essentially said that if you're walking around downtown Portland while wearing black and get rounded up, you were asking for it.
Sen. Girod seems to think wearing black is sufficient probable cause for unidentifiable federal officers to arrest people. His comments are offensive, and show what little regard he has for our constitutional rights.
We shouldn't be surprised: Girod is one of the Oregon Senate Republicans who walked off the job in each of the last two regular legislative sessions, taking a taxpayer-funded vacation to shut down the government and block Oregon from taking meaningful action on climate.
Here's where you come in: If we can flip at least two Oregon Senate seats and defend all of the districts currently held by Oregon Senate Democrats, we can stop Fred Girod and Senate Republicans from shutting down the government whenever they feel like walking off the job.
Let's be clear, the Republican Party at all levels is out of control. They refuse to govern. They refuse to address the COVID-19 pandemic and the devastation it has created for all Americans. And now Oregon Republican leaders are defending Trump's goon squads and making a mockery of our Constitution.
Will you chip in $10, $25, or whatever you can to help get a walkout-proof majority in the Oregon Senate, and elect Democrats up and down the ballot this fall?

Pledge to Vote
We're finalizing our GOTV plans for when ballots go out, and making sure as many Oregon Democrats pledge to vote as possible is a critical way for us to drive up turnout.
And Vice President Joe Biden made it clear in this week's debate: You have the power to determine the outcome of this election.
Vice President Joe Biden ""Show up and vote.  You will determine the outcome of this election.   Vote. Vote. Vote.   You have it in your control to determine what this country is going to look like the next four years.""
This is the most important election of our lifetimes, Alex.
And whether or not we can expand access to health care for millions of Americans, take action on climate, defend voting rights, protect reproductive rights and more will be determined by how many Democrats we can turn out over the course of the next month.
With so much on the line, will you pledge to vote in the 2020 election?
Pledge to Vote
Thank you,

P.S. Not sure if you're registered to vote? Oregon's voter registration deadline is on Tuesday, October 13th. Make sure you register to vote, or check your voter registration information before the deadline!

Oregon Dems,democrats@dpo.org,[Add your name] Pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act,"We now have an opportunity to honor John Lewis' life and legacy.
Democratic Party of Oregon Logo
Alex,
Fifty-five years ago today, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was signed into law, prohibiting racial discrimination in voting and establishing what President Obama recently called ""one of the crowning achievements of our democracy.""
But ever since the Supreme Court's Shelby County v. Holder decision in 2013 gutted critical protections within the Voting Rights Act, voter suppression has been on the rise across America.
Congressman John Lewis spent his life fighting to protect our right to vote. When he died last month, America lost one of our greatest civil rights heroes.
Barack Obama quote: “The Voting Rights Act is one of the crowning achievements of our democracy. It’s why John \[Lewis\] crossed that bridge. It’s why he spilled his blood.”  “If politicians want to honor John... there’s a better way than a statement calling him a hero. You want to honor John? Let’s honor him by revitalizing the law that he was willing to die for.”
We now have an opportunity to honor John Lewis' life and legacy. Senators Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley have joined Senators from across the country to introduce the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, which would restore the Voting Rights Act and create more safeguards against voter suppression.
Will you add your name to support the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act?
Add your name
Thank you,

In one month, ballots for the May Primary Election will begin to arrive in mailboxes all across Oregon.
Many states have had to postpone their Primary Elections due to the COVID-19 crisis — but thanks to Oregon's Vote-By-Mail system, our elections are moving forward as planned.
What's more, there will be a Democrat running in every single Oregon Legislative district on the ballot in 2020.
For the first time in at least 20 years, not a single Republican candidate for the Oregon Senate and the Oregon House will run unopposed.
The COVID-19 crisis has forced us to make a lot of adjustments to our work and to all of our daily lives. But we cannot stop our organizing to prepare for November's election and to make sure we elect Democrats who will fight for Oregonians in every corner of our state.
We've got Oregon Democrats on the ballot in every district, but it's going to take all of us to make sure they win.
If you're able, please chip in $5, $10, $25, or whatever you can to help elect as many Oregon Democrats as possible this November.

It's like a free $50 donation you can use to help defeat Trump and elect Democrats in 2020 — but only if you use it by midnight on December 31st!
Find out if you qualify and use your Oregon Political Tax Credit to give today.
Use your Oregon Political Tax Credit
With the Oregon Political Tax Credit, you can give up to $50 per year (or $100 for joint-filing couples) to a state political party, and then get the full amount back as a credit subtracted from your Oregon state taxes when you file.
That's right — it's a credit, not a deduction.
It's an important way to keep Oregon’s elections powered by grassroots supporters like you. And if you make less than $100,000 (or less than $200,000 if you're filing jointly), you could qualify!
With just one week left in 2019, don't wait any longer: Use the Oregon Political Tax Credit to make your end-of-year donation today.
Donate $50
Donate $100
P.S. Do you make more than $100,000 per year, or $200,000 per year as part of a joint-filing couple? You won’t qualify for the Political Tax Credit, but we can still use your help funding our important work to elect Democrats in 2020! Please donate any amount you can today.

Oregon Democrats,democrats@dpo.org,What you can do to help our neighbors affected by wildfires,"Democratic Party of Oregon Logo
Alex,
The last week has been devastating for families all across Oregon.
Wildfires are burning, forcing thousands of Oregonians to evacuate from their homes, and causing communities all across the state to deal with hazardous air quality caused by the smoke — all in the midst of a deadly pandemic.
It is heartbreaking to see so many people hurting right now. But Oregonians have been stepping up in a big way to support their neighbors when they need it most, from the firefighters and first responders, to the volunteers and relief workers, to the people simply looking for ways they can help out.
If you're able, we hope that you'll consider making a donation to this group of organizations and non-profits working to support the Oregon families affected by the wildfires, to the Red Cross, or to UNETE's Farm Worker and Immigrant Family Relief Fund.
We have a long road to recovery ahead of us, but we know we can make it through this difficult time by working together and looking out for one another.
From all of us here at the Democratic Party of Oregon, please stay safe.
– Oregon Democrats

Yes! I'll add my name
We're so thankful that Governor Brown's efforts to re-open Oregon are being guided by science, by data, and by the best judgement of trusted public health professionals.
Oregonians agree, and so many are adding their name (and a kind note) to our message thanking Governor Brown for her leadership.
Here are just a few of those notes:
""I live in a retirement community, where all of us are high risk for covid-19, and your actions have guided our efforts to stay home and well. I'm so very grateful for your wisdom and courage. Thank you!""
""True leadership in these times is not an easy quality. Thank you for doing the right thing.""
""My family, my business, and I want to say thank you to you and your team for your decisive action that has undoubtedly saved Oregonian lives.""
""Thank you for taking the action you did. As a single mom of 3 and a teacher, this has been hard, but I am so grateful to you and your administration.""
""As an Emergency Physician, I am especially grateful that you acted when you did. Please keep emphasizing the need to follow the science. Thank you.""
We are fortunate to have leaders like Governor Brown who are ready to make difficult decisions, and make them by following science and fact-based evidence.
Add your name (and a note!) thanking Governor Brown for her leadership.

Thanks to quick, decisive action by Governor Kate Brown, and an incredible show of collective action from Oregonians to stay home and save lives, Oregon appears to be flattening the curve.
Tell Governor Brown: Thank you for your leadership and for protecting Oregonians.
We are all deeply saddened by the lives lost to the virus, but we take some comfort knowing that our shared sacrifices and the governor's aggressive actions may have averted at least 70,000 infections.
We all want to be able to return to something resembling normalcy as soon as possible. But it is absolutely critical that our efforts to re-open Oregon are guided by science, by data, and by the best judgement of trusted public health professionals.
And Oregonians agree! A recent survey showed overwhelming support for Governor Brown's ""Stay Home, Save Lives"" orders, as well as for the criteria that the governor has outlined for parts of Oregon to re-open.
This much is clear: We are fortunate to have leaders like Governor Brown who are ready to make difficult decisions, and make them based on science and fact-based evidence.
Join us today to thank Governor Brown for her leadership during this crisis.

Oregon Democrats are voting in big numbers, but with so many important races coming down to the wire we have to do everything we can to make sure Democrats win up and down the ballot.
That's why I'm spending part of my Election Day calling Oregonians to make sure they return their ballots. Will you join me?
Sign up today!
Whether it's the race for the White House, for Congress, for Secretary of State, the Oregon Legislature, and more — the calls we can make on Election Day could make the difference.
And if you've never called voters before, don't worry! The team at the Democratic Party of Oregon will give a short training beforehand, so no experience is necessary.
Voters talking to voters is one of the purest forms of grassroots democracy, and is one of the most effective ways to turn out the vote. I hope you can join me at 2 pm PT on Election Day to help get out the vote!
Sign up
See you on Election Day!
Ron
P.S. You don't have to wait until Election Day to call voters! You can sign up for an upcoming volunteer shift here.

Alex,
We just wanted to reach out this afternoon to say thank you.
Thanks to an outpouring of support from incredible Democrats all across Oregon, we surpassed our end-of-quarter fundraising goal!
We know this is a tough time for many Oregonians, and we are so grateful for each and every person who has chipped in and decided to be a part of our work to defeat Trump, re-elect Senator Jeff Merkley, and elect Oregon Democrats up and down the ballot this fall.
We have a tough fight ahead of us over the next four months, and we're not taking anything for granted. But with the support of so many dedicated Oregon Democrats, we know we're ready to do everything it's going to take to win what will be the most important election of our lifetimes.
Thanks again,
Oregon Democrats

Greetings, and welcome to the Pacific Green Party! We Greens are famous for our emphasis on ecology, but our focus is not limited to the great outdoors. To begin with, a few words on what it means to be a member.
Generally, all important decisions for the PGP are made at Chapter meetings, which operate by majority vote. Although any member may attend conventions and, of course, vote for our candidates, it takes a supporting member to vote on decisions at meetings. Supporting members pay annual membership dues, and have attended at least one meeting; you are allowed to vote at the second meeting you attend as a supporting member, and we encourage you to take this important step into active grassroots democracy with us. Join a local Chapter; if there are no Chapters in your area and you are a supporting member, you and four other supporting members may apply to form one.
Details of this process, and many other aspects of our organization, are to be found in our bylaws, which are available on our website, where you may also find instructions and resources on how to run for office: if you see yourself championing fairness in economy and society, the treasuring of social and ecological diversity, peace, the ability of every individual to have meaningful work, good health, and a good living in a just and democratic legal system, we encourage you to do so.
Our “green” is not just outdoors, unfettered from the ties of business, cities, culture, and discourse; from the making of laws and money; from our communities, our government, or the many things that allow us to thrive. “Green” is about symbiosis: interdependence among peoples, creatures, institutions, technologies, communities, ideas, art, and soil. Greens thrive on these connections, because finding them keeps us honest, compassionate, interested, and growing.
Thank you for joining us in our endeavor to do them justice. Go Greens!

The Oregon People’s Rebate is a proposed initiative petition for the November 2022 election (IP 2022-006) that will REBATE $750 to every Oregonian every year. This REBATE will go directly to anyone living in Oregon for more than 200 days of the year, regardless of age, income, or status.

Hello Alex,
### Ranked Choice Voting in Benton County Commissioners Race
Ranked Choice Voting will be used for the first time in Oregon to elect the County Commissioner. Mike Beilstein, long-time green party member, is running, providing the electorate a first time opportunity to see how RCV works.
In Maine, Lisa Savage, another long time green, is running against Susan Collins (R), Sara Giddeon (D) and Max Linn. She participated in the recent televised debates. Lisa's performance was outstanding.  ""Lisa Savage, a former Green running as an independent, laid out clear pitches for progressive ideas including Medicare for All, the universal health care plan championed by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, and a Green New Deal to address climate change. Her performance was widely praised next to the volatile Linn and sparring frontrunners."" Bangor Daily News
Maine senate debate link
Now we have the opportunity to do the same in Oregon - as the next couple of years will see the push for the statewide implementation of Ranked Choice Voting.
### Please contact Mike Beilstein to support his race: 541-602-1007. We have a list of Green Party members in Benton County and need help calling that list.
### Other Green Party races
Nathalie Paravicini is running for Secretary of State and turning her race into a strategic tool to build the party. The objective is to have teams trained with the needed tools to run strong candidates in local elections and in 2022 and 2024.
She has participated in a couple of debates fostered by the League of Women Voters and local City Clubs. In doing so she has established a working relationship with the potential next SOS, especially on environmental issues.
The debates were particularly interesting and full of information, in part because of our presence. Candidates no longer benefit from attacking each other - they have to speak to the issues. Ranked Choice Voting has been prominently featured at those debates. Please go to [[URL REDACTED]] We will be posting those debates later tonight. The debate hosted by the Willamette Week will be released on October 14.
Upcoming will be a series of videos to discuss the management of our state lands, with new information pertaining to the future of the Elliott Forest. Please visit [[URL REDACTED]] or the Pacific Green Party facebook page.
### CALL FOR ACTION: We need some of you who are comfortable with social media to help us spread the word - post and repost blogs and other info, keep the website updated. Training will be provided. Please register to volunteer at [[URL REDACTED]] Other tasks include database update and calling.
Coming out of this election we want to have a few ""cells"" who can take action on the ground, build strong alliances help spread the word.
Other races are listed in [[URL REDACTED]] and include Ibrahim Taher running for US Senate; Shauleen Higgins running for Oregon Senate District 5, and Tim Dehne, Oregon House District 17.
### Wed 6:30pm Meetings - Portland Metro Area (incl. Clackamas, Washington)
Next two wednesday evenings 6:30pm (Oct 7 and 14). At those meetings we can decide when to meet and whether to have more local groups. You will need to register to attend; here is the link
### Sunday Noon Candidate meetings
We are also holding candidate meetings on Sundays noon. Link for candidate meetings. Those are usually relatively short and a way to coordinate our efforts.
### Be seen being Green - Seed fund
Please donate to the party now - we want to start producing T-shiorts and other merchandise to be visible when we take part in actions. Many greens are often in the rallies and protests - we need to become more visible as we support our allies.
Womens Caucus logo
We also want to start producing yard signs that can be used over multiple election cycles. Finally, the Women's Caucus designed a new logo for its group - we would like to see it on T-shorts, aprons, hats, sweatshirts, etc.
We need seed money for those. Please donate now - there is no small donation.

Hello Alex,
### Ranked Choice Voting in Benton County Commissioners Race
Ranked Choice Voting will be used for the first time in Oregon to elect the County Commissioner. Mike Beilstein, long-time green party member, is running, providing the electorate a first time opportunity to see how RCV works.
In Maine, Lisa Savage, another long time green, is running against Susan Collins (R), Sara Giddeon (D) and Max Linn. She participated in the recent televised debates. Lisa's performance was outstanding.  ""Lisa Savage, a former Green running as an independent, laid out clear pitches for progressive ideas including Medicare for All, the universal health care plan championed by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, and a Green New Deal to address climate change. Her performance was widely praised next to the volatile Linn and sparring frontrunners."" Bangor Daily News
Maine senate debate link
Now we have the opportunity to do the same in Oregon - as the next couple of years will see the push for the statewide implementation of Ranked Choice Voting.
### Please contact Mike Beilstein to support his race: 541-602-1007. We have a list of Green Party members in Benton County and need help calling that list.
### Other Green Party races
Nathalie Paravicini is running for Secretary of State and turning her race into a strategic tool to build the party. The objective is to have teams trained with the needed tools to run strong candidates in local elections and in 2022 and 2024.
She has participated in a couple of debates fostered by the League of Women Voters and local City Clubs. In doing so she has established a working relationship with the potential next SOS, especially on environmental issues.
The debates were particularly interesting and full of information, in part because of our presence. Candidates no longer benefit from attacking each other - they have to speak to the issues. Ranked Choice Voting has been prominently featured at those debates. Please go to [[URL REDACTED]] We will be posting those debates later tonight. The debate hosted by the Willamette Week will be released on October 14.
Upcoming will be a series of videos to discuss the management of our state lands, with new information pertaining to the future of the Elliott Forest. Please visit [[URL REDACTED]] or the Pacific Green Party facebook page.
### CALL FOR ACTION: We need some of you who are comfortable with social media to help us spread the word - post and repost blogs and other info, keep the website updated. Training will be provided. Please register to volunteer at [[URL REDACTED]] Other tasks include database update and calling.
Coming out of this election we want to have a few ""cells"" who can take action on the ground, build strong alliances help spread the word.
Other races are listed in [[URL REDACTED]] and include Ibrahim Taher running for US Senate; Shauleen Higgins running for Oregon Senate District 5, and Tim Dehne, Oregon House District 17.
### Wed 6:30pm Meetings - Portland Metro Area (incl. Clackamas, Washington)
Next two wednesday evenings 6:30pm (Oct 7 and 14). At those meetings we can decide when to meet and whether to have more local groups. You will need to register to attend; here is the link
### Sunday Noon Candidate meetings
We are also holding candidate meetings on Sundays noon. Link for candidate meetings. Those are usually relatively short and a way to coordinate our efforts.
### Be seen being Green - Seed fund
Please donate to the party now - we want to start producing T-shiorts and other merchandise to be visible when we take part in actions. Many greens are often in the rallies and protests - we need to become more visible as we support our allies.
Womens Caucus logo
We also want to start producing yard signs that can be used over multiple election cycles. Finally, the Women's Caucus designed a new logo for its group - we would like to see it on T-shorts, aprons, hats, sweatshirts, etc.
We need seed money for those. Please donate now - there is no small donation.

Pacific Green Party of Oregon,outreach@pacificgreens.org,Thank you for joining,"Alex --
Greetings, and welcome to the Pacific Green Party! We Greens are famous for our emphasis on ecology, but our focus is not limited to the great outdoors. To begin with, a few words on what it means to be a member.
Generally, all important decisions for the PGP are made at Chapter meetings, which operate by majority vote. Although any member may attend conventions and, of course, vote for our candidates, it takes a supporting member to vote on decisions at meetings. Supporting members pay annual membership dues, and have attended at least one meeting; you are allowed to vote at the second meeting you attend as a supporting member, and we encourage you to take this important step into active grassroots democracy with us. Join a local Chapter; if there are no Chapters in your area and you are a supporting member, you and four other supporting members may apply to form one.
Details of this process, and many other aspects of our organization, are to be found in our bylaws, which are available on our website, where you may also find instructions and resources on how to run for office: if you see yourself championing fairness in economy and society, the treasuring of social and ecological diversity, peace, the ability of every individual to have meaningful work, good health, and a good living in a just and democratic legal system, we encourage you to do so.
Our “green” is not just outdoors, unfettered from the ties of business, cities, culture, and discourse; from the making of laws and money; from our communities, our government, or the many things that allow us to thrive. “Green” is about symbiosis: interdependence among peoples, creatures, institutions, technologies, communities, ideas, art, and soil. Greens thrive on these connections, because finding them keeps us honest, compassionate, interested, and growing.
Thank you for joining us in our endeavor to do them justice. Go Greens!

We can't wait to see what the major corporate parties will do to curb climate change, radically transform our economy and address the flagrant injustices and pilfering.
The Democratic party needs a force to pull it to the left; depending on the outcome of the primaries, radical progressives will need a party to go to.
The Green Party also has wide appeal for disaffected Republicans and independents looking for a fiscally conservative, ethical alternative with a vision: The Green New Deal, crafted by the Green Party in 2009.
With the 2020 campaigns we are building alliances across the state; providing those allies with a political electoral platform for their issues.
We need your talent and skills; show up, connect and take action.

Ibra Taher,taher.campaign.2020@gmail.com,Interviews and Endorsement,"Hello Alex Brown,
Our Future
Throughout history, change can be reduced to two factors: cultural revolution and overthrowing the regime (actual revolution). It is my view that the only way to avoid revolts and revolutions is by raising public awareness. Hence, since the beginning of my campaign, I tried to the best of my ability to share what I learned, tell the inconvenient truth, and engage in deeper discussions. I hope that more people pay attention to the issues I raised in these last two weeks.
Moreover, our economic collapse, the transfer of wealth, and the increased authoritarianism is changing our near future, rapidly. I believe that you, me, and everyone else are responsible now to take action, pay extra attention, and educate the others. No, I do not mean by taking an action, an action that is confined to the elections but rather in everything that is influencing our lives and future.
Special Endorsement
Our campaign has received an endorsement from Cynthia McKinney, Ph.D., former congresswoman, and Green Party presidential candidate 2008.
Recording of the Last Event
Here are two videos for our last event ‘Exposing Merkley’
1. Foreign policy records and stances
2. Immigration and economy
Video Ad
My campaign with our humble resources and volunteers produced this video ad.
