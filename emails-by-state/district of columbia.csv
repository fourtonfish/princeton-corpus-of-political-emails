"Merry Christmas to all DC Republicans!
More than two millennia ago, a new hope was born into the world, a Savior who would offer the promise of salvation to all mankind. Just as the three wise men did on that night, this Christmas heralds a time to celebrate the good news of a new King. We hope Americans celebrating Christmas today will enjoy a day of festivities and a renewed closeness with family and friends.
As we celebrate, and regardless of our beliefs, we must also remember those among us who are less fortunate. Many on this day, right here in all eight Wards of the District of Columbia, are without hope, and need our kindness and compassion. It is our prayer we will rise to meet the material, emotional, and spiritual needs of our neighbors and fellow DC residents. What better day is there to love our fellow man than today?
As we open presents, enjoy Christmas dinner, and celebrate our own family traditions, we are mindful of our brave men and women in uniform. Many are stationed around the world today protecting our freedoms, and cannot be with their own spouses, children, parents, and siblings. We offer our deepest gratitude for their service as well as for the service of our law enforcement officers, first responders, teachers, and pastors, whom we ought to remember in prayer not just on Christmas Day, but the whole year round.
On this Christmas we ask for God's blessings for the DC GOP, for our families, for our nation, and we pray that our country will be a place where every child has a home filled with love, a community rich with hope, and a nation blessed with faith.

Chairman

"Only a short amount of time left...
Hi there,
We haven't asked in a while, but we are getting close to Election Day and we don't have much time.
When I took over the position of Chairwoman of the DCGOP, I pledged to fight to make Republican gains in our great city. We have fantastic candidates running for office and we need to hit the pavement running!
We need $3,000 to meet our goal for August. Are you able to chip in at least $15, today, to help our voter contact & mail programs?
> Rush $15 now
> Rush $20 or more
If 200 Republicans contributed just $15 each, we will easily meet our goal!
Democrats will have record turnout in November and we MUST do better. We have to boost our voter contact operation now to reach the maximum amount of people.
Thank you for continuing to support us.
Darlene Glymph
Chairwoman, D.C. Republican Party

"Dear DC Republicans:
Today on this Memorial Day we remember those who made the ultimate sacrifice for our nation so that the freedoms we enjoy would endure. More than one million of America's sons and daughters have died in the wars and conflicts this nation has fought since the first colonial soldiers took up arms to fight for their independence. On this day we remember all the men and women killed in military service to the United States. I wish you a happy and restful Memorial Day. I hope you are able to find some time to express gratitude and reflect on the fighting men and women who made the greatest of sacrifices to protect us and future generations of Americans. As Abraham Lincoln noted upon the dedication of Gettysburg, ""It is for us, the [[URL REDACTED]] be dedicated here to the unfinished work which [[URL REDACTED]] thus far so nobly advanced.""
As always, I hope you stay safe and healthy and please do not forget to vote. Polls are open again beginning tomorrow, Tuesday, May 26, from 8:30 am to 7:00 pm on each day through election day on Tuesday, June 2. A list of voting centers is below.

"Dear DC Republicans:
This is a reminder that if you wish to serve as a Delegate or Alternate at the 2020 Republican National Convention on President Trump's slate, please submit your DC GOP Standard Form application ASAP. You can send via email or to the address in the previous message (below). As a reminder, rules and a copy of the DC GOP Standard Form are posted on the [[URL REDACTED]] website. The Trump campaign is performing background checks and the window on those checks will close within the next week.
Thank you,
Your friends at the DC Republican Party
Volunteer, Run for Office or Become a Delegate/Alternate at the
2020 Republican National Convention
Dear DC Republicans:
This link contains a PDF document for volunteering, running for local office or for beginning the process to become a Delegate/Alternate at the 2020 Republican National Convention (RNC). If you are interested in any of these opportunities during the 2020 election cycle please complete the DC GOP Standard Form and return it to this email ([[URL REDACTED]]). Alternately, the form may be mailed or hand delivered during regular business hours to:
WeWork
Attention: DC GOP
80 M ST SE
Washington, DC 20003
More information on becoming a Delegate or Alternate to the 2020 RNC will be available once the DC Board Elections approves the DC GOP Party Plan; however, if you wish to apply for one of the Delegate/Alternate roles for a Presidential candidate, the first step is to fill out the DC GOP Standard Form. We recommend you submit your form as soon as possible (within the next two weeks) as campaigns must perform background checks. While the hard deadline for applying to be Delegate/Alternate is January 2, 2020, the earlier you submit, the more likely your application will get a thorough review by the DC Republican Committee and Presidential campaigns. Again, please fill out the DC GOP Standard Form if you are interested in volunteering, running for local office or becoming a Delegate/Alternate.
Thank you,
Your friends at the DC Republican Party

"Dear DC Republicans:
As President Ronald Reagan famously stated, ""Republicans believe every day is the Fourth of July, but the democrats believe every day is April 15."" It may have been extended three months, but today is tax day in the District of Columbia. The DC Council has already moved this year to impose over $60 million in news taxes on DC residents and businesses. A consortium of employers, nonprofits and other DC stakeholders known as the Recover Strong Alliance is advocating against raising taxes. If you support economic growth and oppose regressive tax increases, please consider weighing in with your comments to the DC Council here:
[[URL REDACTED]]
It takes one to two minutes and it is an opportunity to advocate your support for DC residents and District businesses struggling through this economic recovery.
Regards,
Your friends at the DC GOP

"Liberal love fest...
Hi Alex,
I hope you are doing well. Have you been keeping up on current events?
The far-left rhetoric coming from the Democrat National Convention, this week, isn't anything [[URL REDACTED]]'s the same ""government will save you"" policies. We think it's time to SHRINK government control over our lives and that has to start locally.
Republican leadership is the answer.
Look, we have to get tougher on D.C. Democrats. In order to do that, we need some financial support to get digital advertisements and a ""get out the vote"" operation in place.
The Chairwoman asked me to reach out to see if you could help boost the DC GOP by Sunday, before the Republican National Convention begins. We want to walk into the Charlotte convention center with at least 100 individual donors at ANY donation level.
Can you chip in at least $5 as an individual donor?
> Quick Donate $5 <
The more individual donors we have, the stronger we look.
﻿Every dollar that comes through our door is thrown into our voter outreach efforts. D.C. is craving leadership and we want to make sure we fight as hard as we can.
Thank you for continuing to support us,
Patrick Mara
D.C. Republican Committee Member

"11:59PM
Hello my friend,
I am reaching out because we have a huge deadline to meet tonight.
After crunching our numbers, we are in need of $1220 more in candidate funding to stay on pace with our budget. There will be a lot of political noise these next few weeks and our Republicans need to be seen and heard with our help!
Are you able to help us out with $20 or more towards this? If just 61 D.C. Republicans could give $20 each today, we would reach the goal!
Choose an amount below to help us out!
> Rush $20 to the goal!
> Rush $40 to the goal!
> Rush $60 to the goal!
Give the ENTIRE goal = $1220
Give HALF the goal = $610
There are many ""on the fence"" voters that we need to persuade to vote Republican. We can't do that without your financial help!
Thank you for your dedication to our cause,
Darlene Glymph
Chairman, D.C. Republican Party

"Dear DC Republicans:
We are advised by the DC Board of Elections to request absentee ballots for upcoming elections in DC. The usual 144 voting locations will not be open on election day; therefore, most voters are unable to vote at their typical polling locations. The Board of Elections will open 20 voting centers which will likely lead to very long lines due to social distancing and 124 fewer voting locations. Please consider requesting an Absentee Ballot HERE for the June 2, 2020, Republican Primary and for future elections this year.
I hope you are staying healthy and please visit [[URL REDACTED]] and [[URL REDACTED]] for more up-to-date and reliable information on the coronavirus.

"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
WASHINGTON - The DC Republican Committee issued the following statement in response to the potential toppling of the Emancipation Statue at Lincoln Park, a National Park Service park in the Capitol Hill neighborhood of Washington, DC:
""When did burning, looting, and statue toppling go mainstream?"" noted DC Republican Committee Chairwoman Darlene Glymph. ""As a black woman and a descendent of slaves myself, the civil rights movement I know is marked by peaceful discourse, not about mob rule and destruction.""
She continued, ""Do I like the visual of a black man squatting in a loincloth before Lincoln? No, but that doesn't mean I or any mob has the right to topple a statue. While many do not believe the freedman is properly depicted clothed in a loincloth kneeling before President Lincoln in the Emancipation Statue, in our society we do not simply let the mob remove things that they do not like. We have a civil discourse. We talk about the things perceived to need changing and then we follow the appropriate official channels to make change.""
""In America, we don't let the mob burn books they do not like at our public schools or libraries. We do not let them desecrate works at our museums they find unsettling. We have a civil discourse, follow the appropriate channels, and then decide. Let's have a civil discourse on the statue of Abraham Lincoln and Archer Alexander. If you are really unhappy - one way or another - give Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton a call or send her a note.""
Unveiled on April 14, 1876, on the 11th anniversary of President Lincoln's death, the Emancipation Statue depicts Abraham Lincoln with a squatting figure modeled after Archer Alexander, the final human being captured under the Fugitive Slave Act. The statue is located in Lincoln Park, a National Park Service park located in the Capitol Hill neighborhood of Washington, DC.
The DC Republican Committee is made up of registered Republicans living throughout the District of Columbia in all eight wards who are nominated and elected to serve as members.

"Hi,
It was a long weekend of meetings, but it is finally time.
We are currently in Charlotte for the Republican National Convention representing Washington D.C. The energy here is amazing!

"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
WASHINGTON - The DC Republican Committee issued the following statement in response to the looting, fires and violence taking place in the District of Columbia:
Burning, looting and vandalism of small businesses, historic landmarks and personal property has no place in our civil discourse. The domestic terrorism taking place in our streets is separate and distinct from peaceful protests following the horrible death of George Floyd.
In response to the significant nighttime violence taking place in Washington, DC, streets, DC Republican Committee Chairwoman Darlene Glymph noted, ""For months DC residents were made to stay home as a health and safety precaution, but now these mostly out-of-town hoodlums are allowed to run free and wreak havoc in our streets. Violence has no place in the Washington I know.""
She continued, ""Mayor Bowser must use all resources at her disposal and coordinate with all Federal efforts to ensure our streets are kept safe and secure. The mostly law abiding residents and small businesses of the District of Columbia have already suffered enough over the last several months. Many are still grappling with significant financial hardships and job loss, and others even lost their lives. Please Mayor Bowser, do whatever it takes to stop domestic terrorism in the city I love and send these violent criminals to prison or back to their homes. We have a long road of healing ahead of us as the fight against Covid-19 continues and domestic terrorism in our streets only further exacerbates our lengthy journey to recovery.""
The DC Republican Committee is made up of registered Republicans living throughout the District of Columbia in all eight wards who are nominated and elected to serve as members.

Hi there,
We only have 8 week until Election Day.
We have so much to fight for. Our city is desperate for Republican leadership. The radical democrats are now contemplating removing the Washington monument and other statues they deem [[URL REDACTED]]!
We have to do better for D.C.
We have a fantastic slate of candidates for D.C. Council & State Board of Education. We are working closely with them all through Election Day and we are asking for you to help us with funding the GOTV efforts.
> Fund $10 in GOTV Efforts
> Fund $25 in GOTV Efforts

We may be outnumbered in voter registration, but we still have opportunities to prove to voters that Republicans policies will work and can change the city for the better.
Please consider helping us out with $10 or more!

"Dear DC Republicans:
I write to remind you that the usual 144 voting locations will not be open on election day; therefore, most voters are unable to vote at their typical polling locations. The DC Board of Elections will open 20 voting centers which will likely lead to very long lines due to social distancing and 124 fewer voting locations. Please consider requesting an Absentee Ballot HERE for the June 2, 2020, Republican Primary and for future elections this year. The Board of Election must receive your request by Tuesday, May 26.
Thank you and stay safe,

"Today we celebrate Juneteenth, commemorating the end of slavery in the United States on June 19, 1865, and the anniversary of the DC Republican Party, originally founded on June 19, 1855. Below is a write up on the founding of the DC GOP from Nelson Rimensnyder, a longtime member of the DC Republican Committee.
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
Establishment and Early Activity
On June 19, 1855 a small group of anti-slavery Democrats, Whigs, and Free-Soil Party members met and organized the Republican Association (Party) of the District of Columbia. At that meeting, Benjamin Brown French was elected President of the Party, and Lewis Clephane, Secretary. At the time, French was a practicing attorney and a partner in the Magnetic Telegraph Company, which provided service between Washington and New York. Clephane, a native Washingtonian, was the business manager of the New Era, an anti-slavery journal.
In 1856, the new party would send a delegation to the first Presidential Nominating Convention in Philadelphia, as it has to every nominating convention since.
The initial platform of the party had three planks: 1) The abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia; 2) Amending the Constitution to treat the District of Columbia as a state for purposes of representation in Congress; and 3) Petitioning Congress to be represented by an elected Delegate to the U. S. House of Representatives, eligible to speak for local residents pending approval of a constitutional amendment providing for voting members of Congress.
In 1870, a plank was added to the party platform seeking the election of Delegates to both the U. S. House and Senate. Another plank was approved in 1871 recommending that Congress establish a unified territorial government for the District of Columbia headed by a governor. In 1871, Congress did authorize a Delegate to the House (Norton P. Chipman, a Republican, was elected) along with the creation of a unified territorial government. Alexander ""Boss"" Shepherd was appointed Governor and proceeded to implement his modernization of Washington's infrastructure. Numerous Republican candidates were elected to the new District of Columbia territorial legislature.
Unfortunately, controversies and scandals connected with Shepherd's fiscal administration led to the abolition of the territorial government along with all elections in the District in 1878. It marked the end of the Reconstruction Era in the District. There would be no more local elected government for almost 100 years, during which the District was governed by three appointed commissioners and the U. S. Congress.

DC Democratic Party Response to Yesterday's Primary Election
WASHINGTON, DC — The DC Democratic Party wants to congratulate every candidate who ran in our June 2nd primary. We are incredibly grateful for the amazing slate of Democrats whose campaigns centered on improving our city and our country. We look forward to continuing to work with all of you. We also want to sincerely thank all of the volunteers who worked the polls or served in other capacities.
Moving forward, we will be addressing the numerous challenges that came with this year’s primary election. Due to COVID-19 concerns, the DC Board of Elections promoted vote-by-mail and only opened 20 in-person voting centers across the District. But countless residents who requested an absentee ballot never received it, and there were lines up to five hours long at multiple voting centers. Many residents showed up at their regular voting locations, which were closed, and there was no signage to inform them about nearby open voting locations. Some people waited past midnight to cast their ballot. That is unacceptable.
DC Democratic Party Chairman Charles E. Wilson gave the following statement:
“I am incredibly frustrated and disappointed by the fact that so many DC residents had to wait in line for hours to cast their vote yesterday. It is clear that this primary election process was mismanaged. The Board of Elections should have engaged local leaders earlier in the decision making process, which could have made things run smoother. Now it is time to have an honest conversation about lessons learned and work collaboratively to implement a solid plan for November, because there cannot be a single issue with voting when another four years of Trump is at stake.”
DC Democratic Party Vice Chair Linda L. Gray gave the following statement:
“I would like to thank all Democrats for voting, especially considering the impact of COVID-19 and our turbulent political climate. Casting your ballot in the Democratic Primary is the first step to creating the change we want and need in the White House. But our work is far from over. We will need to work together to ensure voting in the General Election is unobstructed and issue-free.”
The DC Democratic Party will be doing everything in our power to make voting as easy and organized as possible for the General Election in November. We will be pushing for expanded vote-by-mail, an increased number of vote centers, and better communications from the Board of Elections. We also plan on working with other state parties and voting rights organizations to ensure that we break down any barriers to voting nationwide.
We will be discussing these issues at our upcoming general body meeting on Thursday, June 4, which is open to the public. We are looking forward to receiving feedback from the community.

DC Democratic Party Statement on Historic DC Statehood Vote
WASHINGTON, DC — Today, the House of Representatives overwhelmingly voted to pass H.R.51, the Washington, D.C. Admission Act. This is the first time in history that DC Statehood has passed either house of the U.S. Congress. The final vote count was 218-169, almost entirely along party lines. We will now be focusing our efforts on lobbying Senators to support the bill. In response to this major victory for Washingtonians, DC Democratic Party Chair Charles Wilson gave the following statement:
“We are so deeply grateful to all who have fought for DC Statehood, but especially to our Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton, who introduced this bill and who has made it her life’s mission to end DC disenfranchisement. We would also like to thank the Democratic National Committee (DNC), the Association of State Democratic Committees (ASDC), and every State Democratic Party and ally who helped secure this victory. We are one step closer to becoming a state, and therefore one step closer to a stronger Democratic majority.
But we also know we have an uphill battle ahead of us getting this bill through the Senate. We are calling on Senator Whitehouse (RI), Senator Jack Reed (RI), Senator Sinema (AZ), Senator Doug Jones (AL), Senator Angus King (ME), and Senator Joe Manchin (WV), all caucusing with the Democrats, to co-sponsor the bill in the Senate and do what’s right for not just DC, but for our country. And to all the Republicans who voted against or are planning to vote against DC Statehood: We’re looking forward to supporting your Democratic challengers.”

DC Democratic Party Issues Statement on the District's Shortchange in the Senate’s Coronavirus Relief Fund Bill
March 26, 2020 | For Immediate Release
WASHINGTON, DC — DC Democratic Party Chair Charles Wilson issued the following statement in response to the Senate’s passage of the “Coronavirus Relief Fund"" bill, which will give the District around $500 million, the same funding as each of the US territories, or about 60 percent less than a state, which will each receive a minimum of $1.25 billion dollars. District residents pay the most in federal taxes per capita than any other state:
“What the Senate did to DC residents who are first-responders, nurses, doctors, educators, and workers, many of whom are heroically battling on the front lines of this national health emergency is disgraceful. Their ill-timed scheme to shortchange the District places us at a frightening disadvantage by tying one hand behind our back when we are fighting a global pandemic that has yet to call a truce.
“The District is not a US territory. We send more tax dollars to the IRS than the residents of 22 states. And our population of more than 700,000 residents is greater than those who live in two states and is comparable to the population of several others. Unlike the territories, DC residents pay federal taxes. To treat us as second-class citizens is inexcusable.
“This is why our fight to become the 51st state is more important than ever as this would have never happened if we had two senators at the table, the way our friends do who live in the 50 states.
“We call on everyone who believes in equity, fairness, and democracy to reach out to members of Congress and tell them to treat DC residents like the American federal taxpayers we are and fix this injustice in the Coronavirus Relief Fund bill.”

DC Democratic Party Passes Vote By Mail Resolution
Washington, DC — The DC Democratic Party has passed a resolution calling for the implementation of full Vote By Mail for the November election. This would make it so that DC voters would automatically be mailed a ballot for the General Election, without the need to fill out a form to request one, with the hopes that ballots would be sent out far enough in advance that anyone who did not receive their ballot would have time to remedy the issue.
We have also sent an open letter to DC Board of Elections Director Michael Bennett urging him and the BOE to institute these changes.

"We can’t let Trump appoint another Justice to the Supreme Court. Help us make sure that doesn’t happen.
Alex—
Donald Trump is announcing his new Supreme Court nominee this week, and we must do everything in our power to make sure they don’t get approved.
We will never forget what Mitch McConnell and Senate Republicans did in 2016 to block the nomination of Merrick Garland hundreds of days before that year’s election. Now, with less than 50 days until we choose our next President, it's only fair to hold those same standards and wait to appoint a new Justice to the Supreme Court.
In order to make sure another anti-choice, anti-LGBTQ, pro-Trump Justice doesn’t get a seat on the Supreme Court, we need to win the White House and flip the Senate. And we need your help to do it. Chip in today to help us elect Democrats up and down the ballot.
Reproductive justice is on the line. Health care is on the line. Our right to vote is on the line. LGBTQ+ equality is on the line. DC statehood is on the line. We must defeat Trump and take back the Senate, before it's too late. Donate now to help us ensure Trump’s nominee doesn’t make it to the Court.
For RBG,

"Today, the DC Democratic Party released its Delegate Selection Plan for the 2020 Democratic National Convention.
DC Democratic Party Releases Delegate Selection Process for 2020 Presidential Election
January 17, 2020 | For Immediate Release
WASHINGTON, DC — Today, the DC Democratic Party released its Delegate Selection Plan for the 2020 Democratic National Convention. The plan details the selection process for the District of Columbia’s 45 delegates to the quadrennial convention, which will take place in Milwaukee, Wisconsin July 13-16, 2020.
The District’s Delegate Selection Plan details how registered DC Democrats can participate in the pre-primary caucus, the presidential primary, and the Pledged Party Leader and Elected Official process.
“We believe our Delegate Selection Plan offers a clear and concise structure for selecting a diverse delegation of devoted Democratic advocates to represent the District in Milwaukee this summer,” said Charles Wilson, DC Democratic Party Chairman. “As District residents, we have much at stake in the next presidential election. The current officeholder has not lived up to our DC values, especially when it comes to supporting DC Statehood. Our message is clear: we need to elect a presidential candidate that supports our full autonomy. I encourage DC Democrats who want to engage with the Party on the issue of statehood—or any issues important to them—to consider becoming a delegate.”
Under the 2020 plan, the DC delegation will consist of 45 total delegates and two alternate delegates. They will be chosen across three dates:
* On April 18, 2020, the Party will hold a pre-primary caucus to elect up to 13 district-level delegates and one alternate delegate for each of the remaining 2020 Democratic presidential candidates. The allocation of the district-level and alternate delegates among the Democratic presidential candidates will be based on the results of the June 2 presidential primary.
* On June 4, 2020, two delegates will be allotted to Pledged Party Leaders and Elected Officials (PLEOs) based on the results of the June 2 presidential primary.
* On June 11, 2020, the Party will elect four at-large delegates and one at-large alternate to add to the delegation.
To ensure district-level delegates are equally divided between men and women (determined by gender self-identification) delegate positions will be designated by presidential preference beginning with the highest vote-getting presidential preference.
The following chart details the apportionment of district-level delegates and alternates based on gender parity:
*Assuming no gender non-binary delegates are elected
The full Delegate Selection Plan is available on the DC Democratic Party’s website. The plan may also be obtained by contacting Charles Wilson ([[URL REDACTED]]) or Claudette David ([[URL REDACTED]]), mailing a request to the DC Democratic State Committee, P.O. Box 50622, Washington, DC 20091, or by calling (202) 386-8741.

DC Democratic Party Passes “No Donation Without Representation” Resolution
WASHINGTON, DC — The DC Democratic Party passed a resolution at our Thursday, July 2nd General Body Meeting stating that we will only donate or offer in-kind services to candidates who support DC statehood. The resolution was drafted by DC Democratic Party Statehood Committee Co-Chairs Andria Thomas and James S. Bubar.
With DC residents contributing substantial fundraising to campaigns, including more than $95 million in individual contributions in 2016, it is imperative that we put that money toward electing politicians who commit to ending Washingtonians’ disenfranchisement by supporting statehood.
We encourage DC residents to follow our lead by researching or asking candidates their stance on DC statehood before making contributions. While we understand that any contribution to a Democratic candidate is a worthy one, DC residents can choose from hundreds of candidates to support in 2020. We suggest that support for DC statehood be a consideration in deciding where to direct contributions to candidates. This is our party’s effort to promote DC statehood and gain support from Democrats around the country.
Students for DC Statehood have organized a pledge that candidates can take showing their support for the cause. People can also look to the list of co-sponsors for S.631, the Senate’s DC statehood bill, as well as the list of Democrats who voted for H.R.51, the “Washington DC Admissions Act,” in the House (all but one, Minnesota Rep. Collin Peterson).
The resolution is as follows:
WHEREAS, the District of Columbia Democratic State Committee (DCDSC) has both an obligation and responsibility to advocate for policies which advance the well-being of the residents of the District of Columbia; and,
WHEREAS, the DCDSC supports Statehood and full democracy for the residents of the District of Columbia and is urging that the national Democratic party include Statehood and full democracy in the 2020 Democratic Party platform; and,
WHEREAS, advocacy in a modern electoral era includes providing direct and indirect support to candidates who support said policy; and,
WHEREAS, the residents of Washington, DC contributed more than $95 million in direct support to candidates or electoral organizations in the 2016 election cycle nationally and are expected to do the same for the 2020 election cycle; and,
WHEREAS, the residents of Washington, DC contribute countless hours of indirect support through direct grassroots activity on behalf of candidates and outside organizations; and,
WHEREAS, the DCDSC desires to adopt “No Donation Without Representation” with respect to donations of money and services to candidates in the 2020 election cycle and beyond.
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the DCDSC adopts “No Donation Without Representation” with respect to donations of money and services to candidates in the 2020 election cycle and beyond; and,
BE IT ALSO RESOLVED, that the DCDSC will only provide direct contributions, and indirect organizational support, staff assistance and endorsements to candidates and organizations who have demonstrated public, on-the-record support for Statehood for the District of Columbia; and,
BE IT FINALLY RESOLVED, that the DCDSC will develop educational materials and resources and disseminate them as needed to inform the residents of Washington, DC about these criteria and encourage them to adopt similar, personal criteria for their own contributions of money and services to candidates in the 2020 election cycle.

On November 2, the DC Democrats had breakfast with Attorney General Karl Racine at Busboys & Poets while learning about his office’s efforts to progress civil, financial, housing, and juvenile justice in the District.
An open Q&A session followed the Attorney General's talk, and attendees asked about curbing violence in the District, the Second Chance Act, statehood, and more.
### DC Democrats Hold 2019 Days of Action
On November 4 & 5, DC Democrats rallied together and mobilized for the 2019 elections. We phone banked, canvassed, and distributed sample ballots to get out of the vote in Virginia, Kentucky, Mississippi, and Louisiana.
All the hard work paid off, though: We flipped the Virginia House and Senate, ousted a Republican governor in Kentucky, and retained a Democratic governor in Louisiana!
### DC Democrats Hold Voter Registration Drive in Ward 8
The DC Democrats spent November 11 registering voters in Ward 8 at We Act Radio. This was the first of a series of planned voter registration drives leading up to the 2020 election, and we thank all the volunteers who made it possible!
### Ward 2 Democrats Host November Debate Watch Party
On November 20, the Ward 2 Democrats hosted the November Debate Watch Party at the Dignitary in Ward 2. Attendees enjoyed appetizers and networked while watching the Democratic debate hosted by MSNBC and the Washington Post.
At the conclusion of the event, attendees participated in a straw poll asking which candidate they thought had the best debate performance. The results are shown below.
### The DNC, DC Dems, and Wanda's on 7th Host 'Chop It Up'
On November 22, the DC Democrats' Black Caucus teamed up with the DNC to host 'Chop It Up: A Barbershop Discussion on Politics' at Wanda's on 7th.
The event was such a success that we plan to host more barbershop talks in the future. Like us on Facebook to make sure you don't miss the next one!
### Ward 8 Democrats Unveil New Community Census Portal
To help residents prepare for the upcoming U.S. Census, the Ward 8 Democrats unveiled a new 2020 Census portal at its public meeting last month on becoming ""Census Ready.""

"Hello Fellow Democrats!
We're emailing to keep you updated on what voting is going to look like for the general election. First off, every registered voter will be mailed a ballot. The Board of Elections will also be opening 80 Vote Centers from October 27 - November 2, as well as on Election Day, November 3, 2020. We are encouraging folks to vote by mail, and if that is not an option, to vote early. In order to avoid the long lines we saw during the primary, as well as to take precautions against Coronavirus, early voting and voting by mail are greatly encouraged.
If you plan on voting by mail, please make sure your information is correct in the Bored of Elections' voter file, and if it is not, update it immediately. Please also make sure you mail back your ballot as soon as possible since postal service return times are expected to be slower due to the large volume of mail.
The deadline to register to vote or update your address is Tuesday, October 13, 2020. Alternatively, DC offers same day registration during the early voting period and on election day.
We are also encouraging folks who are healthy and able to sign up to work the polls on election day and during the period of early voting. Please also use our social media toolkit to promote messaging about voting in November.
Here is the current list of candidates that will appear on the general election ballot, and here is the list of candidates running for ANC.
If you have concerns about your right to vote, please email us at [[URL REDACTED]]

DC Democratic Party Issues Statement on the Resignation of Ward 2 Councilmember Jack Evans
Party also calls for Evans to step down as National Committeeman
January 8, 2020 | For Immediate Release
WASHINGTON, DC — In response to Ward 2 Councilmember Jack Evans’ announcement that he is resigning from the DC Council effective January 17, 2020, DC Democratic Party Chair Charles Wilson released the following statement:
“Jack’s resignation is in the best interest of the DC Council and the District of Columbia. It is time to turn a page and begin the long process of restoring trust and accountability to our government. As Democrats elected to our positions, we must never lose sight of the honor and privilege we have to serve constituents in our various roles. We owe it to each of them to hold ourselves and every elected official to the highest standards of ethics and integrity. To this end, I hope Jack will also submit to the calls from Party members to resign his position as National Committeeman.”
During their December 5 general body meeting, the DC Democratic Party passed a resolution encouraging Evans to step down from his position as National Committeeman. In this role, Evans is slated to represent the District of Columbia at the 2020 Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

"Upcoming events, announcements from our affiliate organizations, and more!
Hello Fellow Democrats,
We had a packed month! We texted nearly 10,000 voters for the June 2nd Primary Election, we had our monthly general body meeting on the 4th, where we passed a resolution calling for full vote by mail for the November General Election, we sent a letter to the Board of Elections regarding the primary and our calls for change. We saw DC Statehood pass the House, we celebrated Pride Month, and we released our final list of delegates for the Democratic National Convention. And this past Saturday, we hosted a panel discussion with Brooke Pinto and Janeese Lewis George, which you can watch here.
We've also seen Washingtonians out protesting every day for justice, sparked by the deaths of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor and countless other Black Americans who are the victims of police brutality. The DC Democratic Party pledges to continue fighting this fight and supporting other organizations who are doing the hard work to institute reform.

Association of State Democratic Committees Passes DC Statehood Resolution
December 16, 2019 | For Immediate Release
AUSTIN, TX — At their regular membership meeting on Friday, December 13, 2019, the Association of State Democratic Committees (ASDC) passed a historic resolution in support of making the District of Columbia the nation’s 51st state. The resolution was introduced by DC Democratic Party Chairman Charles Wilson and passed by a unanimous vote. The resolution affirms that DC statehood is fully supported by each state Democratic Party organization.
Chairman Charles Wilson released the following statement in response to the resolution’s passing:
“The passage of this resolution is an enormous win in our ongoing fight for statehood. Having the approval and support of our nation’s state Democratic Party organizations will be crucial in our grassroots movement to make the District of Columbia the 51st state.
“I would like to thank ASDC President Ken Martin for holding a vote on this crucial resolution and seeing it through to passage. With the support of our Democratic state-level organizations, we know it is only a matter of time before full voting rights are granted to residents of the nation’s capital.”

Biden Rolls Out Plans for Economic Recovery, Infrastructure, and Clean Energy
WASHINGTON, DC — In the past week, Vice President Joe Biden has released two big plans to tackle job and economic recovery along with infrastructure and clean energy. The DC Democratic Party is grateful and thrilled that our prospective Democratic presidential nominee is focused on solutions to our biggest problems.
The first plan is entitled “Build Back Better: Joe Biden’s Jobs and Economic Recovery Plan for Working Families,” and includes solutions to create millions of good-paying jobs, provide aid to state, local, and tribal governments to prevent layoffs, extend COVID crisis unemployment insurance to help those who are out of work, and provide a comeback package for Main Street businesses and entrepreneurs.
The second plan is entitled “The Biden Plan to Secure Environmental Justice and Equitable Economic Opportunity in a Clean Energy Future,” which outlines the necessity to integrate climate justice into infrastructure rebuilding. The plan includes using an inclusive and empowering All-of-Government approach; making decisions that are driven by data and science; targeting resources in a way that is consistent with prioritization of environmental and climate justice; and assessing and addressing risks to communities from the next public health emergency.
DC Democratic Party Chairman Charles Wilson gave the following statement in response to Biden’s new plans:
“We already knew Joe Biden was the right candidate to take on Trump, and his newly-released plans of action to tackle economic recovery, sustainable infrastructure, and a clean energy future prove that he is the right candidate for our whole country. He understands that economic recovery and environmental justice are two of the most pressing issues our nation and our world faces today, and has created some of the most detailed and well-thought-out plans we’ve ever seen. The DC Democratic Party is looking forward to continuing to work with the Biden campaign to ensure his victory in November.”

"It's time to fill out the 2020 Census!
Alex,
You may have heard that yesterday was Census Day, meaning 2020 Census forms are due to be turned in soon. We encourage every household in in the District to complete their Census questionnaire.
Why does the Census matter?
1. The federal government distributes over six billion dollars annually to the District to support vital programs based on census data.
2. Census data is used to update Ward and ANC boundaries to reflect population growth and movement across the District.
3. District agencies rely on accurate census data for budgeting, planning and policy decision-making across the city.
4. Residents use the census to support community initiatives involving legislation, quality-of-life and consumer advocacy.
5. Businesses use census data to decide where to build offices and stores—creating jobs for the community.
You can complete the Census questionnaire online (it's quick and easy!) here.
COMPLETE THE 2020 CENSUS

"DC Vote has launched a new action toolkit in an effort to secure funding from Congress in upcoming Coronavirus relief packages.
WASHINGTON, DC — DC Vote has launched a new action toolkit in an effort to secure funding from Congress in upcoming Coronavirus relief packages. The first round of aid from the federal government, the Cares Act, only provided $500 million to Washington, DC. The guaranteed minimum for states was $1.25 billion.
The Heroes Act, which was just passed by the House of Representatives last Friday, would make up for the previous lack of funding for DC, but it is unclear whether the Senate will vote for its passage. A coalition of more than 150 groups is working to ensure that DC gets adequate support, and to push Senators to vote yes on the Heroes Act.
The toolkit includes guidance for contacting elected officials to encourage them to support DC Statehood and DC Coronavirus aid, as well as a petition that will be sent to Congress. There are also template and sample emails and social media posts to further spread the campaign and its message.
The DC Democratic Party is encouraging all DC residents and all of its Democratic allies to utilize this toolkit to ensure DC does not get shortchanged again. The DC Democratic Party asks all District residents and DC allies to participate in this effort and utilize the toolkit to ask their elected officials to support DC Statehood and Coronavirus aid.
In November 2016, 86% of DC voters supported the DC Statehood referendum. DC pays more taxes than 22 states and pays more to the federal government than they receive in federal services. Yet, the residents of DC do not have equal representation in Congress. There are more than 700,000 people living in the District, more than the populations of Wyoming and Vermont, and roughly the same as Alaska and North Dakota. Voting representation is the foundation of our democracy and it is only fair to extend it to the people of DC.

No previous poll watching experience is necessary. You will receive training materials and be required to attend either a virtual or in-person training before you're placed as a poll watcher for the General Election.
Responsibilities and Expectations:
* You must be available for at least a 4.5 hour shift of poll watching on Election Day (November 3, 2020).
* You must have your own transportation to the polling location.
* You must have access to a cellphone that you can use throughout the day to report incidents, track numbers, and communicate with the DC Dems Voter Protection team.
* You must have access to a printer so you can print out your official poll watcher credential.
* You must review training materials and attend a poll watcher training session. You'll receive an email with details on signing up for this training after you sign-up.

"Dear Fellow Democrats,
Twenty-two days—That's all we have until the American people decide whether Joe Biden is our next President, or Donald Trump remains on his path of destruction and corruption. We have to do all we can help elect the Biden-Harris ticket, flip the Senate, and ensure a Democratic majority in Congress.
DC statehood can become a reality if we elect Democrats up and down the ballot across the country. But you have to do your part and show up. You have to fight not just for yourself, not just for your family, but for people you don't know. It's now or never. So sign up for a volunteer shift, make a donation, and do your part to make sure Democrats win big this November.
Donate Directly to the DC Democratic Party!
Donate to the Flip NC for DC Fund!

"Dear fellow Democrat,
There is one urgent message for the country in 2020: Vote Democrat like your life depends on it. We are proud of the work we have done to support Democrats around the country—It is the path to sanity and statehood.
But the message to vote Democrat is equally compelling here in the District. We face an unprecedented race for two At-Large Council seats, with 24 names on the ballot and many candidates spending hundreds of thousands of dollars in pursuit of a coveted seat.
There is, however, only one Democrat—Councilmember Robert White.
Robert has been a sensational member of the Council, showing leadership and responsiveness on a broad cross-section of issues. We need to make sure that a great Councilmember and candidate—and the sole Democrat in the race—wins a much-deserved re-election.
Please be sure to cast your first vote in the At Large race for the Democrat, Robert White.
In addition to voting, there are two critical ways you can support Robert White today! Sign up to volunteer at a vote center during Election Week or reach out to your friends and family to remind them that the message of 2020 is to take nothing for granted and to please join you in voting for Robert White, our Democratic At-Large Councilmember.
To a victorious November,
Charles E. Wilson

"Fellow Democrats,
If you’ve been to a DC Dems meeting in the last three years, chances are good that you’ve met Janeese Lewis George.
George has been an active member of the DC Democratic Party for years, contributing her time as an officer and engaged member of the effort to elect Democrats to seats across DC. We were already proud to know her before, but we are even more so now.
Janeese Lewis George is now the Democratic nominee for DC Councilmember in Ward 4, and the DC Democratic Party is incredibly proud to support her campaign. Join us in supporting her by making a donation today:
DONATE NOW!
Donating now will help turn out some of the hardest-to-reach voters in these last crucial weeks before November. That’ll help Democrats in every race on the ballot, and it will also help build a powerful coalition of voters who believe in progressive leadership on the Council.
George’s campaign is one of the most energized that we’ve seen in a decade or more, and that’s the energy Democrats are bringing right now to races across the city and around the country.
Democrats are committed to equity and service for the common good, and George embodies those principles and so much more. Join us in making a donation to her campaign today.
Stay safe and vote early!
Sincerely,
Charles E. Wilson
Chair, DC Democratic Party
