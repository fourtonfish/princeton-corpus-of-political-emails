# RNC 2020 | Ken Buck casts Colorado's delegate votes for Trump to 'keep America great again'
Colorado Politics: U.S. Rep. Ken Buck announced Monday that President Donald Trump had received all of the state's delegate votes during a roll call held in Charlotte, N.C., on the first day of the Republican National Convention.
Colorado, Buck said in a brief, televised speech, ""proudly casts all 37 votes to keep America great again for president Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence.""
In his remarks, Buck, chairman of the Colorado Republican Party and the chair of the state's delegation to the RNC, praised Trump and Pence for cutting taxes, installing federal judges and Supreme Court justices ""who interpret the law and don’t legislate from the bench"" and ""protect[ing] us during a worldwide pandemic.""

# Despite Trump’s Alarmism, Colorado GOP Chair Rep. Ken Buck Has ‘No Problem With Mail-In Ballots’
Colorado Public Radio: In an interview with Colorado Matters, the three-term congressman spoke against the federal government stepping in to “start running elections. It's inappropriate, inefficient, and I think it could very well lead to bad practices down the road.”
.....
Buck was at the convention in Charlotte, North Carolina Monday to announce the Colorado delegation’s unanimous vote for Trump’s nomination. He said Trump’s concern about vote fraud stems from the FBI’s 2016 investigation into Russian interference in the race between Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton.
....
“I think the question that will be on most voters’ minds when it comes time to cast their ballot in October, early November, is who is best prepared to bring the economy back from this pandemic,” he said. Trump’s record “shows that he is well-suited to managing the economy and to creating a robust economy.”

Gardner For Senate Releases New Ad
Cory Gardner for Senate today released a new ad, titled ""Beer,"" highlighting the real differences between Gardner's bipartisan record of delivering for Colorado and Hickenlooper's repeated admissions that he would not be an effective Senator.
""I've spent my career reaching across the aisle to deliver commonsense results for Colorado, while John Hickenlooper isn't even sure he wants to be a Senator,"" said Senator Cory Gardner (R-CO). ""One thing is clear: Coloradans can count on Hickenlooper for beer, but can count on me to get things done.""

President Trump Nominates Amy Coney Barrett to Supreme Court Vacancy
President Trump has made a terrific selection in Judge Barrett. Judge Barrett received bipartisan praise from the legal community when appointed to the federal bench and she will continue to uphold the Constitution for all Americans in her service on the Supreme Court.
The left is already trying to takedown Amy Coney Barrett just because she is a Mom and a Constituionalist. We must fight back and ensure that this qualified Judge, who will practice judicial restraint and enforce our laws is confirmed to the U.S. Supreme Court.
Sign our petition today thanking President Trump and Senator Gardner for appointing and confirming qualified judges like Amy Coney Barrett.

# Gardner’s National Suicide Hotline Bill Headed To President’s Desk For Signing
CBS Denver: A bill introduced last year by Senator Cory Gardner that designates a the three-digit telephone code that will lead callers directly to crisis counselors passed the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday, meaning the President’s signature is the next step into making the proposal a reality.
The measure was approved by the U.S. Senate last May. It was approved by voice vote in both cases.

NEW Gardner Ad: Jet
Cory Gardner for Senate today released a new ad highlighting Governor John Hickenlooper's illegal private jet flights and unprecedented ethics violations during his time in elected office.
""The Hickenlooper Loophole allowed Governor John Hickenlooper to jet around the world dozens of times and suffer no consequences for his illegal actions,"" said Senator Cory Gardner (R-CO). ""Gov. Hickenlooper has proven time and time again that he's in politics for his own interests and not for the people of Colorado.""

# ENDORSMENT: Reelecting Gardner is the easiest call on the ballot
Colorado Springs Gazette: Colorado has the third-youngest senator in Congress who has proven himself a workhorse who gets great results for Colorado. With six years of gaining trust and respect among his colleagues, Pentagon brass and the White House administration, he is well on his way to becoming the most formidable member of the Senate.
On a ballot full of difficult questions, one decision is easy: reelect Sen. Cory Gardner.
A vote for Gardner’s opponent is one that puts at risk the otherwise likely decision to keep Space Command in Colorado. Gardner, with the help of U.S. Rep. Doug Lamborn, has led the charge on persuading President Donald Trump and Department of Defense officials that the agency belongs right here in Colorado Springs. If voters don’t keep him in the Senate, they will send a clear message to Washington they don’t appreciate Gardner’s fight for Colorado as the best possible host for Space Command.

Griswold sent a mailer to several people who are not eligible to vote, CBS4 reported, in a swing state that has a U.S. Senate seat on the ballot this year and could prove pivotal in the presidential race.

# Congressional candidate Lauren Boebert stops by Bayfield on campaign trail
Durango Herald: BAYFIELD – More than 70 La Plata County residents gathered under the Eagle Park pavilion in Bayfield on Saturday to hear upstart, congressional candidate Lauren Boebert make her case for their vote.
It seems to be working.
Boebert, a Republican from Garfield County, is vying for one of Colorado’s seven House of Representative seats against former state legislator Diane Mitsch Bush, a Steamboat Springs Democrat. Local residents, weary of do-nothing politicians, saw Boebert and her meteoric rise as someone who can bring new ideas and energy into the Republican Party.

Hello everyone-
I hope you are all having a better week than John Hickenlooper, who was found guilty on Friday of violating Colorado's gift ban by the Independent Ethics Commission. This vote comes a day after Hickenlooper was held in contempt by the commission for defying a lawfully issued subpoena.
As always, let me know if you have any questions or comments.

# John Hickenlooper violated Colorado’s gift ban, independent ethics commission rules
Colorado Sun: ""Former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper violated the state’s constitutional gift ban by accepting private flights aboard company jets owned by his friends, an ethics panel decided Friday.
""The Colorado Independent Ethics Commission decided his flight aboard a plane owned by MDC Holdings, a Colorado-based homebuilder led by top political donor Larry Mizel, and a pair of private dinners related to the USS Colorado celebration in Connecticut amounted to a violation.""

# Cory Gardner on business recovery amid COVID-19: Time to instill confidence, change PPP
Coloradoan: ""Gardner also touted legislation he is sponsoring, the Great American Outdoors Act, as a way to provide an economic boost through projects.
""The effort would fund up to $1.9 billion per year in backlog maintenance projects at national parks, the U.S. Forest Service and more. He said dollars spent locally would fix roads, trails and visitors centers and provide more than 40,000 jobs.""

# Senate Republicans push to freeze automatic increases to legislator salaries, per diem pay
The Center Square: ""Senate Republicans are pushing to freeze automatic increases to lawmaker salaries and per diem pay as the state slashes its budget because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
""On Monday, Senate Minority Leader Chris Holbert, R-Parker, said on the Senate floor that he hopes two bills – one freezing increases to lawmakers' per diem pay and another freezing automatic salary increases – will get late filing approvals from majority leadership in the Senate.
""Republicans have submitted late bill requests for both pieces of legislation.""

""But the hypocrisy from Leftist leaders has only added fuel to this fire. The same politicians who once called for total lockdowns of their states are now allowing looters and rioters to destroy the communities they claim to love. Make no mistake, these destructive actions are compounding problems that will harm African-American communities more than we can imagine.""

""The Cortez Republican penned a letter to Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy. He cited the Trump administration's claims that the Chinese Communist Party manipulates the steel market with deceptive practices.
""Pueblo, in Tipton's 3rd Congressional District, is a steel production town, where the industry employs about 1,600 people and puts more than $1.16 billion into the state's economy.""

# Colorado businesses, legislators push more legal challenges of Polis' executive orders
Denver Business Journal: ""Following a two-month period in which Gov. Jared Polis received leeway from business and community leaders to set coronavirus-related rules through executive orders, some groups and individuals are starting to push back, challenging the foundations of his authority.
""Prominent business group Colorado Concern sued the governor over his order allowing for collection of petition signatures for ballot initiatives by mail and email, and both a restaurant and a church have sued Polis over rules that limit their ability to welcome people inside. Meanwhile, two Republican efforts are afoot at the state Capitol to roll back some authority — a resolution submitted Wednesday to end Polis’ declaration of a public health emergency and a proposed bill that would require the governor to receive legislative approval to continue emergency orders beyond their initial end date.""

Good afternoon-
Taxpayers have spent more than $133,000 to defend John Hickenlooper's illegal conduct. Last month, the Independent Ethics Commission (IEC) found Hickenlooper in contempt for ignoring a subpoena and guilty of breaking Colorado ethics laws.
A recent Denver Post article outlines how Hickenlooper's private attorney was paid $525/hr by taxpayers to defend him. Hickenlooper was eventually found in violation of the Colorado Constitution and given the biggest fine ever by the IEC.
But Hickenlooper's ethics troubles aren't over yet, it was also revealed that a State Lawmaker has asked the U.S. Treasury Department to investigate the use of federal funds to pay for his defense.
Senator Gardner stated yesterday, ""It's time for Governor Hickenlooper to pay back the more than $133,000 he used from a 9/11 recovery fund to skip out on a court-ordered subpoena and defend taking illegal private jet flights from billionaires.""
If you agree with Sen. Gardner, sign the petition below demanding that millionaire Hickenlooper pay taxpayers back $133,000 for the funds used in his illegal misconduct defense.
Sign The Petition!

Colorado GOP and Trump Victory Surpass 2 Million Voter Contacts
Colorado Politics: Volunteers with the Colorado Republican Party and the state's Trump Victory campaign on Sunday surpassed 2 million voters contacts, a spokesman for the state GOP said Monday.
U.S. Rep. Ken Buck, the state party's chairman, said achieving the milestone demonstrates the GOP's organizational strength heading into the home stretch before the November election.
""With less than 114 days until the election, our volunteer ground forces across Colorado are energized and excited to engage with voters in all 64 counties to talk about Senator Gardner, President Trump, and our slate of Republican candidates. It's clear that Democrats can't match our permanent, data-driven ground game operations, or the enthusiasm of Colorado Republicans,"" Buck said in a statement.
""I'm proud that our volunteer teams have already reached over 2 million voters and are focused on continuing to share the results-oriented leadership of our Party. Surpassing this milestone proves that Republicans in Colorado are fired up and ready to re-elect President Trump, Senator Gardner, and Republicans up and down the ballot come November.""

# Hickenlooper’s ethics defense costs taxpayers more than $133,000
Denver Post: ""Taxpayers spent $133,438 covering the cost of John Hickenlooper’s defense attorney in the 18 months before he was found to have violated the state’s ban on gifts to public officials.
That total, uncovered through open records requests, does not include expenses incurred in June, which could add up to tens of thousands of dollars. Hickenlooper’s attorney, Mark Grueskin, was paid $525 per hour for his work on the case, which ended in mid-June.""

# Rep. Ken Buck to Newsmax TV: Colorado 'Very Competitive' for Trump
Newsmax: Colorado GOP Chairman Rep. Ken Buck cast doubt on polls showing presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden well ahead of President Donald Trump, saying his state has trended more Republican over the last three presidential elections.
“I think Colorado is a much more competitive state than any of the numbers show at this point,” Buck said. “We have 2 million voter contacts in the last six months and I think that when you look at Colorado, John McCain lost Colorado by almost nine points, Mitt Romney by over six points and Donald Trump by just, between four and five points.
“So it is trending our direction, and I think this state is going to be very competitive.”

About These Initiatives
Initiative #295: VOTE ON FEES
It’s time to put an end to massive fees and enterprises being used to grow our state budget while avoiding voter approval under our Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights (TABOR). Two-thirds of state revenue now falls outside of TABOR. We need to do a better job of managing our state’s more than $30 billion budget. The status quo of continuing to grow and create new state programs and finance them off of “fees” needs to end. Initiative 295 requires all new legislative enterprises, fees and surcharges with revenue of $100,000,000 or more in the first 5 years to be placed on the ballot.
Initiative #306: TAX CUT
The purpose of Initiative 306 is to Energize Our Economy with a REAL fair tax cut, reducing Colorado’s income tax rate from 4.63% to 4.55%. This stands in contrast to a progressive income tax increase which also may be placed on the ballot which would raise $2 billion a year in new income taxes. Colorado is suffering from recession and high unemployment. Initiative 306 lets families keep more of what they earn and gives an incentive for businesses to expand and locate here.

# Hickenlooper Dodges on Court Packing
Washington Free Beacon: Colorado Senate candidate John Hickenlooper (D.) dodged the question of court packing during a Tuesday debate.
The debate moderator directly pressed Hickenlooper to say whether or not he would support packing the Supreme Court if Amy Coney Barrett is confirmed, but the candidate avoided answering the question.

# An ‘Astounding Victory’ For Suicide Prevention Crafted By Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner
Colorado Public Radio: Starting in 2022, there will be a new three-digit phone number to connect to a suicide prevention hotline nationwide: 988.
Without fanfare, President Donald Trump signed the National Suicide Hotline Designation Act into law Saturday. The bill was introduced by Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner last fall.

# EXCLUSIVE: Lauren Boebert on Campaign, Key Policy Issues
KREX: Boebert tells KREX 5/Fox 4 she was inspired to run for Congress after she worked to gather signatures for the petition to ask voters to repeal the state’s National Popular Vote Law. Boebert and others’ signature gathering was successful, which lead to Proposition 113 landing on Colorado ballots this election cycle. A clip of Boebert also went viral in September 2019 when she confronted Beto O’Rourke about his gun control policies at one of his rallies in Colorado when he was running for president.
“During that time when I was working with the people to save our votes for president I heard the frustration, I saw the frustration in so many hearts in our district,” Boebert said in an interview with KREX 5/Fox 4’s Adrian Thomas. “Then shortly after that Beto O’Rourke came to Colorado and I learned that if I take a stand and speak up for what I believe in I can affect and represent millions.”

# Colorado 'Independent' Dem Candidate Has a History With a Socialist Publication
Townhall: The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) is pumping funds into Colorado’s 3rd district, in support of Diane Mitsch Bush, as Democrats hope to flip seats in November.
Bush, obviously endorsed by the DCCC, claims to be “independent,” but her historical donations to a socialist publication discredit her promise to transcend party lines. The congressional hopeful donated to In These Times, a self-proclaimed socialist magazine, between the years of 1999 and 2003 on a host of occasions; the publication was founded by James Weinstein, a proudly self-proclaimed socialist. Bush even received recognition for her “financial commitment” to the socialist propaganda publication.

# Rep. Ken Buck demands DOJ investigate removal of big tech protections after censoring of NYPost Biden article
Fox News: Rep. Ken Buck, R-Colo., sent a letter to the Department of Justice on Wednesday, asking the attorney general to look into accusations of censorship by Twitter and Facebook, after the big tech giants took steps to limit the exposure of a New York Post article critical of Hunter Biden.
""I write to express my concerns regarding Twitter and Facebook’s recent actions to censor a prominent American news outlet,"" Buck began. ""These actions violate the platform’s immunity under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act and threaten to chill free speech throughout our nation.""

# Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner introduces bill authorizing a VA Hospital in Colorado Springs
KKTV: A little more than a week after announcing a push to bring a VA hospital to Colorado Springs, U.S. Sen. Cory Gardner introduced legislation that would authorize the construction of a VA medical center in Olympic City USA.
“Our nation’s veterans deserve timely access to quality care, but I hear frequently from veterans in El Paso County about the need for additional access to services,” said Gardner in a news release. “As the veteran population in El Paso County continues to experience rapid growth, the need for additional health care resources will only increase. I am incredibly proud of Colorado’s active-duty military strength, courage, and bold vision for the future, and I will always fight to ensure our veterans receive access to the quality care they deserve.”

# EDITORIAL: Don't be duped, Mitsch Bush is far in left field
Colorado Springs Gazette: Mitsch Bush stated her support for Proposition 113, which sells out Colorado’s electoral votes to wealthy Californians who would like to control our Western Slope water.
Mitsch Bush campaigns as a moderate, but her past contradicts the pretense. In Washington, she would contribute to the left’s anti-rural agenda that tries to force urban values and lifestyles on farmers, ranchers, miners, and energy workers who make up much of the Third Congressional District.
Imagine the next crony of AOC emerging from the slopes, valleys and farmlands of District Three. It doesn’t get weirder than that.

# Guest commentary (Kristi Burton Brown): Coloradans deserve a clear answer on court-packing
Denver Post: As a constitutional lawyer, I understand the critical importance of nominating and confirming qualified judges to serve on our courts. The judiciary is critical to our government and the American way of conducting justice. While every American may not agree with every decision, having an independent judicial branch is crucial to our nation’s future success.
Unfortunately, Democrats have a long history of trying to use the courts to implement their radical agendas that they can’t pass as legislation. Changing the courts has been a high priority for Democrats and progressives, dating back to President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s failed court-packing scheme in the 1930s.

# McInnis endorses Boebert
Alamosa News: Lauren Boebert does not hesitate standing for the pledge, hugging a veteran, thanking a police officer, reaching a hand out for the more vulnerable, believing in our system, and being so very proud to be an American.
We will benefit. Our district will benefit. She is ready to help us. Let us put Lauren Boebert to work as our next congresswoman.

# With Cory Gardner leading the charge, Senate takes up Great American Outdoors Act
Denver Post: ""President Donald Trump has said he will sign this Great American Outdoors Act if lawmakers get it to his desk. Senators this week took up the issue, aiming for a vote next Tuesday, and around 200 House members have said they’ll support similar legislation.
""On March 3, Gardner, of Yuma, went to the White House and, in a discussion with Trump, showed a photo he’d taken on his iPhone of the Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park in Colorado. Trump said it was beautiful. Gardner also said he pointed to a portrait of President Teddy Roosevelt, a leading conservationist, in suggesting that Trump support could lead to a major achievement. He said Trump gazed up at the portrait and said he would sign the legislation.""

# Colorado voters will decide on 22-week abortion ban this fall
Denver Post: ""The Colorado Secretary of State’s Office announced Monday that the group Due Date Too Late collected enough signatures for Initiative 120 to make the November ballot. The group fell short initially but a judge said it could wait until stay-at-home orders lifted to “cure,” or make up the shortfall.
""Colorado is one of the few states that doesn’t currently have a law limiting abortion later in pregnancy, so it has become a destination for women who seek one for medical or other reasons.""
Congratulations to the Due Date Too Late team on their work to get #Initiative120 onto the ballot! This fall, Coloradans will have the opportunity to vote to save lives.

# Colorado IEC Gives Hickenlooper Highest Fine in Commission's History for Ethics Violations
Town Hall: ""Colorado’s Independent Ethics Commission (IEC) approved financial penalties for Senate candidate and former Governor John Hickenlooper (D) after the IEC found him guilty of two separate ethics violations. After requiring a subpoena to compel Hickenlooper’s testimony, the former governor ignored the request, which led the commission to hold him in contempt. The IEC deemed Hickenlooper guilty of two separate violations of Amendment 41 of Colorado's Constitution, which sets a cap on lawmakers' ability to accept gifts.
""The IEC fined Hickenlooper a total of $2,750 for both ethics violations, after the former governor’s defense counsel lobbied to purge the contempt charge.""

Colorado Republican Party Chairman Ken Buck released the following statement regarding the confirmation of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the U.S. Supreme Court:
“Tonight, the U.S. Senate confirmed a supremely qualified jurist who will make us proud. Amy Coney Barrett is a brilliant legal mind and a solid conservative who will protect our Constitution and uphold the law.

## Lauren Boebert takes on progressive politicians in Durango campaign stop
Durango Herald: More than 1 million Coloradans, mostly Democrats, have voted already. Boebert and Buck urged people to use mail-in ballots, despite statements by President Donald Trump questioning their legitimacy.
When Trump talks about problems with mail-in ballots, he is talking about other states, Buck told the crowd.
“Here in Colorado we do an excellent job with mail-in ballots,” Boebert said. “We’ve had this process for years. I’m pretty confident in it. We see some hiccups now and then, but that’s why we go down and drop off our ballots.”

Townhall: Former Colorado Governor and current Senate candidate John Hickenlooper (D) indicated that he would follow the lead of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) on court packing, if he were to win the state’s battleground Senate race in November.
""John Hickenlooper wants to pack the courts in direct opposition to a majority of Americans and a 150-year-old, 9-justice precedent,"" Colorado GOP Spokesman Joe Jackson told Townhall. ""It's shameful that Hickenlooper is choosing to stand with Chuck Schumer over Coloradans.""

Colorado Republicans-
I wanted to let you know about a limited-time exclusive offer to order a signed copy of Chairman Ken Buck's new book Capitol of Freedom: Restoring American Greatness. The book highlights how progressives continue to reject our Constitution in order to implement their socialist agenda, Chairman Buck writes that all of us must continue fighting to protect our liberty.
There is a limited quantity available and all funds will go to the Colorado GOP to support our candidates this November. Those who contribute $100 or more now will receive a signed copy. Please be aware that it is first come, first serve and that there is a limited supply available.
Limited-Time Offer
About ""Capitol of Freedom""
As progressives reject the Constitution to implement their socialist agenda, Congressman Ken Buck argues that we must reclaim our heritage of liberty by applying the principles we learn through the U.S. Capitol’s art, architecture, and artifacts.
This book tells the story of how our nation’s founders carefully designed a political system that would guard against tyranny and protect individual liberty. Using the Capitol and its features as the backdrop, Buck shows how our heritage as a free people is woven into every institution in America, and how progressives are attempting to undermine individual liberty. The book offers clear recommendations for steps liberty-minded Americans can take to reverse the progressives’ damaging course.
For all who are willing to listen, the Capitol speaks, showing how conservatives can halt the progressives' plans, preserve our remaining freedoms, and reclaim what we’ve lost.

Fellow Colorado Republicans-
I wanted to send out an email and let you all know that the Colorado Republican Party fully and absolutely supports the repeal of Colorado's National Popular Vote legislation and will always fight to protect Colorado voters voices at the ballot box.
Recently, we have have become aware of a group called ""Conservatives for Yes on National Popular Vote."" This deceptive group and their leadership team are running around the state claiming that President Trump and other key Republicans support the National Popular Vote. This is completely false and couldn't be further from the truth.
The Colorado Sun recently wrote about this shady group, you can read about it below:
Read More
The National Popular Vote gives Colorado's votes and voice to larger states like California and New York. The framers of our Constitution instituted a system of checks and balances to ensure that states of all sizes would have a voice in our Democracy. Unfortunately, the National Popular vote destroys those checks and balances and instead aims to give more control to large liberal states.
You can watch this short video below on why Colorado Conservatives need to stand together and work to repeal the National Popular Vote legislation.
Learn More
This scheme, which is supported by out-of-state liberals must be repealed this November. I look forward to standing side-by-side with all of you as we fight to protect Colorado's votes at the ballot box.
Sincerely,
Ken Buck

Colorado Politics: The Colorado Republican Party on Friday kicked off a digital advertising campaign featuring state residents describing how GOP policies have made their lives better.
The ""Results Matter"" campaign includes a website and four videos — three in English and one in Spanish — starring ""everyday Coloradans and how they've been positively impacted by the results delivered by Republican leaders in our state,"" a party spokesman said.
""Results Matter, and the people of Colorado know that President Trump, Senator Gardner, and their local Republican officials are fighting everyday to achieve policies that positively impact our state and local communities,"" said U.S. Rep. Ken Buck, the state GOP chairman, in a statement.

# ENDORSEMENT: Send Lauren Boebert, a young impassioned leader, to Congress
Colorado Springs Gazette: If Lauren Boebert lands a job in Congress Nov. 3, she will improve the brand of the Republican Party.
A 33-year-old wife, mother of four and owner of a highly unique business, Boebert drew media intrigue even before she shocked the political establishment by defeating five-term Republican Rep. Scott Tipton in the primary. In addition to movie star looks, she exudes passion for freedom, capitalism and the United States that makes the socialist, anti-America sentiment of AOC + three look gloomy and sad.
In the big league of Congress, she could lead a national, youthful, patriotic, pro-capitalist movement to rival the fashionable narrative that tells young Americans their country is evil.
....
In a meeting with The Gazette’s editorial board, Boebert exuded an unequivocal devotion to freedom, free markets, compassion for others, and the joy of discovering self-sufficiency.
...
Vote for Lauren Boebert and empower the kind of inspiring, high-quality candidate that seldom comes along.

# Cory Gardner's 'Big Idea': Keep pace with China in the space race and prevent it from stealing American IP
Fox News: Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., believes in taking special precautions to protect the United States against the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). One of his proposals is to pump more money and attention into the space race to prevent China from taking hold of the final frontier in an effort to enhance its own power and harm American citizens.
Gardner said it's vital America be vigilant with regard to aerospace technology and innovation -- as scientists, the government and private industry continue to tackle projects related to Mars, the moon, satellite technology and deep space exploration.

# Vice president’s nephew, Congressman Ken Buck rally for Trump in Erie on Wednesday
Longmont Times Call: Under an Erie park picnic shelter Wednesday a group of roughly 30 people gathered to rally for President Donald Trump and to meet Congressman Ken Buck and John Pence, the Trump Campaign senior adviser and Vice President Mike Pence’s nephew.
Buck, who represents the 4th District and chairs the Colorado Republican Party, sought to reinvigorate GOP supporters, even as polling numbers show support for Trump in Colorado falling behind Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.
“You’re going to see some polls come out with Cory Gardner down, President Trump down — it’s nonsense,” Buck said. “We’re doing really well in Colorado. The night of Nov. 3, you will see some people act awfully surprised.”

# Colorado Dem Campaigns as a Moderate, Obscuring Radical Record
Washington Free Beacon: Colorado Democrat Diane Mitsch Bush has backtracked on her past support for Medicare for All and the Green New Deal in an effort to win over voters in a highly contested swing district.
When Mitsch Bush ran for Colorado's Third Congressional District in 2018, she pushed for a Green New Deal and Medicare for All. Bush now condemns both policies, removing them from her current platform in order to campaign as a ""pragmatic progressive"" on the trail.
.....
Mitsch Bush has painted herself as a ""pragmatic progressive"" since winning the Democratic primary by running to the left of her primary opponents. She has said in interviews she spent her career as a legislator reaching across the aisle. Her support for radical causes, however, stretches beyond 2018. As early as 1999, Mitsch Bush donated to In These Times, a pro-union magazine founded by an avowed socialist. Mitsch Bush donated for at least two more years, until 2003.

# County Election Officials Say Secretary Of State Jena Griswold Is Politicizing Her Office, Risking Trust
Colorado Public Radio: She has feuded with the state’s elections clerks and President Donald Trump while watching the leadership team she hired quit just months into her tenure. Over the objections of the county clerks who run elections, she supported a massive re-write of state elections law, then her office underestimated how much it would cost to implement.
....
It was mid-April 2020, about 15 months into Griswold’s tenure, and local election officials in Colorado were fed up.
It started when Griswold supported 2019 legislation, driven by voter advocacy groups, that required clerks to open more in-person voting options and provide more drop boxes. It was expensive, and unsupported by the state’s clerks, many of whom thought the changes were unnecessary. After that, Griswold frustrated clerks by surprising them with a requirement to change the way they print ballots.

Colorado GOP Chair Ken Buck says party is ‘energized’
Sterling Journal Advocate: A group of national delegates, who voted by proxy instead of attending the Republican Party’s convention as planned, and other supporters were encouraged last week by U.S. Rep. Ken Buck, who serves as the Colorado Republican Party chairman.
While COVID-19 prevented their opportunity to fully participate as delegates, he suggested during a celebration in Windsor to hear President Donald J. Trump’s party nomination acceptance speech, their opportunity to work on behalf of the president and others on the ballot is continuing.
“There are a lot of energized people who want to see President Trump get re-elected and [U.S. Sen.] Cory Gardner re-elected,” Buck said. “We’re also working to make sure at least one house of our state legislature is in the right hands.”
...
“The violence going on in our cities now is having an impact,” Buck said. “When it comes to security and public safety, Republicans are far ahead.”

Good evening-
Earlier today, the Independent Ethics Commission (IEC) voted unanimously in a 5-0 vote to hold John Hickenlooper in contempt for refusing to honor a subpoena to appear at his OWN ethics hearing. This hearing was previously scheduled to investigate the claims that Hickenlooper violated the state's constitutional gift ban by accepting free private flights to Italy, Jackson Hole, and the East Coast.
Hickenlooper decided to defy the subpoena AFTER a Colorado judge appointed by him declined to block the subpoena late last night. The committee then voted unanimously to have the AG's office enforce the subpoena.
His taxpayer paid attorney maintained all day that Hickenlooper would not honor the subpoena, before completely flip flopping at the 11th hour.
The flip-flop didn't go over well with the commission:

Fellow Republicans-
With less than 90 days until Election Day, one thing is clear - President Donald Trump is America's only choice this November.
Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and the radical Democrats want to change our way of life, defund the police, and raise our taxes. Meanwhile, President Trump, Senator Gardner, and Republican leadership have equipped small businesses across the nation to get back to work and be stronger than ever before. But we need your help to ensure that the radical left doesn't win in November and destroy the accomplishments of the past 3 years.
Join our hardworking volunteers across Colorado fighting to re-elect President Trump, Senator Gardner, and Republicans up and down the ballot!
Help us turn Colorado red
Can we count on you to help President Trump defeat Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and the radical Democrats this November? This is a pivotal election and we need everyone working together to ensure our nation and state is going in the right direction.

# Congress passes Cory Gardner’s Great American Outdoors Act
Denver Post: The U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday passed a major public lands bill introduced by Sen. Cory Gardner, a Republican from Yuma.
The Great American Outdoors Act passed by a vote of 310-107. It previously had passed the Senate, so it now goes to President Donald Trump, who has said he will sign it.
“By fixing and repairing our public lands and national parks, we not only have the chance to improve the roads, hiking trails, campsites and visitor centers for generations to enjoy,” Gardner said in a statement after the House vote, “but also to create thousands of job opportunities in Colorado and across the nation at a time when our country needs them most.”

# Colorado Rep. Ken Buck says big tech CEO hearing will cover privacy, antitrust and bias allegations
Fox News: ""I think it's a very important hearing to bring in the leaders of these large platforms and figure out whether we need to update the law so that it applies to big tech,"" Rep. Ken Buck, R-Colo., told Fox News.
There are three issues we are going to be looking at in this hearing,"" Buck said. ""One is the anticompetitive behavior of these platforms. The second is the privacy issue and the third is the bias that some of these platforms engage in. The idea that when I go online and search for a particular pair of cowboy boots -- that information is immediately sold to people without my consent and without any benefit to me.""
He added, ""If we didn't have one large platform that was dominating the search engines, I think what you would see is you'd have various platforms that would actually pay people to use them. And if you consent, they could use your information. But we're not there. And I think it's a very strong argument for how we need to update the law in this particular area.""

# Meteorologist Marty Coniglio leaves 9News after comparing federal troops to Nazis
Denver Post: Meteorologist Marty Coniglio, a staple of Denver TV weather for three decades, left 9News Friday, a day after he compared, on social media, federal troops in U.S. cities to Nazis.
Coniglio later deleted the tweet, but not before dozens of users screenshot it, including U.S. Rep. Ken Buck, Colorado’s Republican Party chairman.
“Comparing the brave men and women of our law enforcement community to Nazis is absolutely reprehensible,” Buck tweeted.
The Colorado Republican Party also responded on Twitter: “Republicans know that the press leans to the left, but are fellow reporters okay with this type of radical hate against law enforcement from employees at local news stations?”

Good evening-
We are now 3 days into the confirmation hearings of Judge Amy Coney Barrett's nomination before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee.
The hearings have shown that Judge Barrett is supremely qualified for this role and that she will be a justice focused on applying the law as written and serving the American people with honor and integrity.
Meanwhile, John Hickenlooper during last night's Senate debate once again dodged the question of whether he will continue to stand with Chuck Schumer as Democrats demolish 150 years of Supreme Court precedent and move forward with their radical court packing plans. It is sad that Hickenlooper has refused to level with Coloradans about this critical question.
Democrats have chosen to try and attack Judge Barrett's religion and faith but with the American Bar Association calling her the ""gold standard"" for nominees, we know that she should and will be confirmed to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court.
SIGN our petition today thanking President Trump and Senator Gardner for appointing and confirming qualified judges like Amy Coney Barrett to our courts.

# John Hickenlooper’s legal defense against ethics complaint cost taxpayers $150,000, a final tally shows
Colorado Sun: Taxpayers spent $150,000 to defend former Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper’s against an ethics complaint that led to two violations of the state’s gift ban, records show.
The final cost of the legal expenses matches the maximum allowed in a contract with Mark Grueskin. The prominent Democratic election attorney represented Hickenlooper on behalf of the state after a conservative nonprofit filed two ethics complaints against him in late 2018 just months before he left office.

Chairman Ken Buck Joins Jon Caldara for Interview:
## Republicans hope to gain ground with their ground game
Colorado Sun: On Saturday morning, a few dozen volunteers gathered at Smoky Hill Library in southeast Aurora to knock on doors for two Republican legislative candidates, Suzanne Staiert and Caroline Cornell.
“One thing that sometimes makes it easier when we go to a door, we might leave the literature under the doormat and ring the doorbell,” Staeirt, who is running for a hotly contested state Senate seat, told the group before they headed out. “That way, when the voter comes, you don’t have to have that awkward handoff of the literature.”
Republicans are facing a difficult election cycle this year in Colorado, but they see one possible advantage in their willingness to continue their ground game despite the coronavirus crisis. While some Democrats are still willing to meet voters at their doorsteps, the party’s in-person strategy has been greatly diminished compared to the GOP.
“The Dems will outspend the Republicans and always have when it comes to local races and legislative races,” said U.S. Rep. Ken Buck, who is also chairman of the Colorado Republican Party. “They have the money to do that. We have the shoeleather to outwork them.”
.......
Most voters were happy to speak with Staiert, who’s competing in an open seat, and Cornell, who is trying to unseat Democratic state Rep. Tom Sullivan. One woman put on a mask before having a conversation with the pair, and another prodded the candidates on their abortion views from the safety of her porch.

# Exclusive–Ken Buck: Trump, Cory Gardner’s Record Will Lead to GOP Victory in Colorado
Breitbart: Rep. Ken Buck (R-CO), the Colorado Republican Party Chairman, told Breitbart News during an exclusive interview on Wednesday that President Donald Trump and Sen. Cory Gardner’s (R-CO) successful track record will lead to a Republican victory in November.
He continued, “I think he’s in a great position to win this … I hear Democrats talking about how Colorado has gotten so unbalanced and how Cory is doing a good job, and we should give him another term. So, if Democrats are saying that, then I think a good portion of the unaffiliated are going to say that, and I think Republicans are going to stick with the team” that has been successful.

# Sen. Cory Gardner says new space caucus will address threats in orbit | Tom Roeder
Colorado Springs Gazette: A new space caucus in the Senate led by Colorado Republican U.S. Sen. Cory Gardner is planned to get congressional attention on increasing issues in orbit.
The space caucus gives Gardner a chance to interact with military leaders that is otherwise difficult for lawmakers who are not appointed to the Senate Armed Services Committee. Neither Gardner nor Colorado’s Democratic U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet has a seat on their chamber’s military panel.

Good morning-
In 2021, an independent redistricting commission will redraw congressional and legislative districts for the state of Colorado. Every 10 years, after the Census, states are required to redraw congressional and legislative districts to equalize population. This process is called redistricting.
Unfortunately, we have seen in the past that interest groups work behind the scenes to draw districts to their advantage. This is called gerrymandering. In recent decades, Colorado has increasingly experienced gerrymandering. Now is our opportunity to ensure a fair and balanced process.
In 2018, Colorado voters passed Amendments Y and Z to the Colorado constitution. These amendments created politically balanced commissions – each composed of four Republican, four Democrat and four Unaffiliated members – to redraw the maps, using neutral criteria, and nonpartisan staff.
We want to ensure that this commission is served by people like you, not special interests in Denver. The future of Colorado can very well be determined by what this board produces.

"Don't let California and New York take our votes A message from the Colorado Republican Party
View this email in your browser
Good evening-
As people are voting and turning in their ballots all across Colorado, I wanted to make sure that no one is fooled by ads and messaging coming from a group called ""Conservatives for Yes on National Popular Vote.""
This deceptive and Democrat leaning group is running around the country claiming that Republicans and President Trump support the National Popular Vote - that couldn't be further from the truth.
Colorado Republicans are urging everyone to vote NO on Proposition 113. This proposition would effectively mean that all of Colorado’s 9 electoral votes are awarded to the presidential candidate who wins the popular vote nationwide, not necessarily the candidate who wins Colorado.
Learn More About Prop 113 >>
The Colorado Republican Party absolutely and wholeheartedly supports the repeal of Colorado's National Popular Vote legislation and will continue working to protect Colorado's voter's voices at the ballot box this November.
Please encourage your family and friends to vote NO on Proposition 113. Let us know if you have any questions or concerns.
Sincerely,
Ken Buck

"Gov. Hickenlooper went on vacation during one of Colorado's most destructive wildfires A message from the Colorado Republican Party
View this email in your browser
Hello everyone-
I wanted to flag an article from the Denver Post, which highlights the hypocrisy of John Hickenlooper. For weeks now, Hickenlooper and his team have been wrongly accusing Sen. Gardner in attack ads of going on vacation during the Senate's August state work period.
Well, now it seems that it was Gov. Hickenlooper who went on out of state vacations while there were major wildfires destroying parts of Colorado.
One of those vacations was to prepare for his failed presidential campaign in New Hampshire and the other was to the infamous ""Bilderberg meetings in Turin, Italy, where Colorado’s Independent Ethics Commission subsequently determined he violated state ethics laws by accepting free meals and a ride in a Maserati limousine...""
In 2018, the 416 fire in Colorado destroyed over 55,000 acres and cost $40 million, yet that didn't stop then Governor Hickenlooper from taking his summer vacations.
In Case You Missed It...

Joe Jackson
Communications Director | Colorado GOP
# EDITORIAL: Gardner shellacs Hickenlooper in the first U.S. Senate debate
Colorado Springs Gazette: In the year’s first debate between candidates for the U.S. Senate, Democratic nominee John Hickenlooper made a serious mistake. He built his case for election on a slushy foundation and showed Colorado why he’s not cut out to be a senator.
Any undecided voters who watched this debate should not remain undecided. Sen. Cory Gardner, making the case for a second term, owned the stage. It was a shellacking of Hickenlooper. Gardner was crisp on the issues and enumerated his accomplishments as the third-most bipartisan member of the Senate. Gardner reiterated the unassailable fact he introduced more successful legislation than the rest of Colorado’s nine-member congressional delegation during the past six years.
Hickenlooper meandered and stumbled over his words, appearing unpolished, feckless, underprepared and on the defensive.

# Rep. Ken Buck accuses Colorado secretary of state of sending voter registration cards to non-citizens and dead people, calls for probe
Fox News: Rep. Ken Buck, R-Colo., sent a letter to the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Election Commission (FEC) on Wednesday, asking them to look into the Colorado secretary of state's efforts to send out voter registration cards to non-citizens and dead people, ahead of November's election between Joe Biden and President Donald Trump.
Buck cited reports from both CBS and Brietbart about the cards being mailed out and said the actions by Secretary of State Jena Griswold cast a cloud over the final election results.

# Q&A with Lauren Boebert, Republican candidate for Colorado’s 3rd Congressional District
Steamboat Pilot and Today: Q. Looking beyond the campaign to a time next year when you are actually a member of Congress, let’s assume Joe Biden wins the presidency and Democrats continue to control the House, what are the two to three policy priorities you will take the lead on to best represent the interests of Colorado’s 3rd Congressional District?
A. I reject the assumption that Joe Biden will be the president or that the Democrats will continue to control the House. My first vote in Congress will be to fire Nancy Pelosi as Speaker of the House. Among other things, Nancy Pelosi spent years wasting time on impeachment instead of taking up President Trump on his offer to address immigration and infrastructure.
My priorities will remain the same regardless of who is in leadership. We need America to be responsibly open for business to get our economy back on track. We need to push hard to open up more markets for our local energy, agriculture and steel industries. And, we need to address our infrastructure and health care.
I encourage everyone to read my Contract with Colorado, posted at my campaign website [[URL REDACTED]] My contract outlines my key policy positions on everything from balancing the budget to education, energy production, healthcare and supporting term limits for all politicians.

District: HD- 46

About: Hi, I'm Jonathan Ambler and I'm running for Colorado's House District 46. President Trump won my district in 2016 but my opponent ran unopposed. Her socialist values/agenda run contrary to the values of Pueblo, the Home of Heroes.
HD 46 is considered one of the most flippable seats in Colorado. My opponent is the chairman of the Joint Budget Committee and influences state finances greatly. She sponsored the bill to put the Gallagher Amendment up for repeal. So I mean it when I say no one living in Colorado can afford another two years of her in the state legislature.

# Prominent Colorado Republicans Speak at Cameo Shooting Complex
KREX: A shooting range may not be the most conventional place for a political campaign. But Colorado GOP Chairman and Congressman Ken Buck says it’s a great venue for an important event.
“I’m excited to be in Mesa County and I’m so excited to be here at a gun range, defending the 2nd amendment,” says Buck.
Colorado Senator Cory Gardner says it’s crucial for him to go out and meet his constituents, so he can be a strong voice for rural Colorado, when he is in Washington. He says it also helps him push through legislation that Coloradans want. He also took shots at his Democratic opponent, former Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper.
“I believe in the people, I believe in Western Colorado. That’s why I passed the Great Outdoors Act, the most significant conservation bill in 50 years. But John Hickenlooper, wants the Green New Deal,” says Gardner.

# Trump’s GOP Nomination Speech Rallies Colorado Republicans Ready To Help Him Win Here In 2020
Colorado Public Radio: About 70 Republicans, including Colorado delegates to the Republican National Convention, alternates and guests, gathered in Windsor Thursday night to watch President Donald Trump make his case for reelection as he accepted the nomination to be the GOP’s choice for president in 2020.
Trump spoke outside the White House in front of more than a thousand people, capped off by fireworks.
“It's certainly not as fun for the delegates to be here as opposed to in Charlotte right now,” said Republican Rep. Ken Buck, the head of Colorado’s Republican Party, as he chatted standing over a cocktail table near a large outdoor television screen under white lights.
“But I think that we're making the most of it. There's a lot of energy from this president's speech, and I think people will leave this event and go out and work really hard for the president.”

Rep. Lamborn: What Joe Biden's America would look like in 2021
Washington Examiner: It is now November 2021, one year after Joe Biden was elected president after a razor-thin election. We have been given a glimpse into the future to see Biden’s America.
Summer 2021 was another scorcher. The rolling brownouts California suffered in 2020 spread throughout the West. Record demand for air conditioning combined with the ongoing closures of coal, nuclear, and even gas-powered electric plants have left millions powerless in these heat waves.
Energy Secretary Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, with the support of President Biden, has permanently extended the airlines’ drastic curtailments of flights, first seen during the late pandemic, in keeping with the Green New Deal they both support. Taxes on gasoline and diesel fuel have shot up to European levels “to discourage internal combustion engine use and to promote jobs in the alter.

# Colorado Springs Gazette: Gardner passes history's largest conservation bill
Colorado Politics: ""One day after presumptive Democratic senatorial nominee John Hickenlooper spent a debate explaining ethics convictions and a racist comment, Sen. Cory Gardner delivered again for Colorado and the rest of the country. His latest in a long succession of victories involved challenging President Donald Trump and changing his mind for the good of Colorado.
""Senators do not get better than Gardner. The Senate passed his Great Outdoors Act on Wednesday, which was the 10th major piece of legislation passed into law at Gardner’s insistence and sponsorship. All other eight members of Colorado’s Washington delegation combined have not passed that many laws in the past six years.""

""On Monday, Hickenlooper had to apologize again — this time after a black Denver school board member tweeted a 6-year-old video of the then-governor making a joke about how politicians' schedules are so packed they are like rowers on “an ancient slave ship” being whipped to go faster.""

Colorado Sun: President Donald Trump on Tuesday signed the Great American Outdoors Act into law, providing full funding to the Land and Water Conservation Fund — a program his administration previously wanted to pare back.
The law was championed by Colorado’s U.S. Sen. Cory Gardner and Montana’s U.S. Sen. Steve Daines, both of whom are Republicans facing difficult reelection battles in November.
Gardner thanked Trump for “making it happen.” Trump thanked Gardner for championing the legislation during the White House ceremony.

# Rep. Doug Lamborn: Investigate John Hickenlooper for Misuse of Taxpayer Funds
Breitbart: Rep. Doug Lamborn (R-CO) sent a letter to Acting Inspector General Richard Delmar asking for an investigation into former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper’s alleged misuse of taxpayer funds to retain an attorney to defend him against an ethics and personal misconduct complaint.
“The financial abuse allegations being reported by multiple media outlets against former Governor John Hickenlooper are extremely concerning,” Lamborn said in a statement. “Any allegation detailing the misuse of federal taxpayer money should be thoroughly investigated.”
.....
To date, the total cost to taxpayers for Hickenlooper’s $525-an-hour lawyer has reached over $133,000, according to the Denver Post.

Fox News spoke with Buck and asked if there were any plans to subpoena Dorsey, based on the fact that he was not present during a House subcommittee hearing with America's big tech CEOs last month.
""Twitter was notably absent from the big tech hearing last month,"" Buck told Fox News. ""It's time we hear from Jack Dorsey on Twitter's blatant censorship of conservative voices and willingness to protect the Chinese Communist Party's outright lies about the spread of the coronavirus.""

Good afternoon-
Democrats are now openly admitting that they are taking Colorado voters for granted. A Colorado Sun article from this morning highlights how Republicans are working hard across the state to talk to voters, while Democrats decided to abandon in-person canvassing.
Our statewide field team is working hard every day and is fast approaching nearly 3 million voter contacts, meanwhile Joe Biden and John Hickenlooper aren't even trying to talk to voters about their socialist message.
It's clear that Colorado Democrats are complacent and not focused on talking with Coloradans are about the future of our state and country. Please, join us today and help us continue our huge ground game lead over the Democrats.
This is a critical election and we need every volunteer to help get our message out to the people of Colorado.
Join Us Now!
Onward to Victory!

Good afternoon-
As many of you have seen in recent weeks, left-wing extremists across the country have been working everyday to tear down and destroy historical statues of great Americans. Leaders like Abraham Lincoln, Ulysses S. Grant, and even George Washington aren't spared in their radical crusade.
Here in Colorado, we've seen the toppling and destruction of a statue outside the Colorado Capitol building that honored Colorado soldiers who fought for the Union during the Civil War. Many of those soldiers fought and died to help end the moral stain of slavery- those responsible for this disgraceful act should be held accountable.
Sign The Petition
Sign the petition today to demand that our elected officials place discourse over discord, and have a real discussion about these monuments and statues before giving into the leftist mob that wants to rewrite all of American history.

Initiative #295: VOTE ON FEES
It’s time to put an end to massive fees and enterprises being used to grow our state budget while avoiding voter approval under our Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights (TABOR). Two-thirds of state revenue now falls outside of TABOR. We need to do a better job of managing our state’s more than $30 billion budget. The status quo of continuing to grow and create new state programs and finance them off of “fees” needs to end. Initiative 295 requires all new legislative enterprises, fees and surcharges with revenue of $100,000,000 or more in the first 5 years to be placed on the ballot.
Initiative #306: TAX CUT
The purpose of Initiative 306 is to Energize Our Economy with a REAL fair tax cut, reducing Colorado’s income tax rate from 4.63% to 4.55%. This stands in contrast to a progressive income tax increase which also may be placed on the ballot which would raise $2 billion a years in new income taxes. Colorado is suffering from recession and high unemployment. Initiative 306 lets families keep more of what they earn and gives an incentive for businesses to expand and locate here.

# Buck introduces House resolution thanking police
Colorado Politics: U.S. Rep. Ken Buck on Thursday introduced a resolution offering thanks and appreciation to law enforcement personnel while slamming calls to defund the police and “progressive groups” that participate in demonstrations.
“Democrat mayors and governors are allowing anarchists to burn our cities to the ground,” said Buck, who is also the chair of the Colorado Republican Party and a former district attorney. “The least we can do is offer our nation’s law enforcement officers our sincerest thanks and appreciation for their sacrifice to serve our communities regardless of the political winds of the day. Defunding the police will only make our cities less safe.”
The resolution has 21 co-sponsors, all Republicans, including U.S. Rep. Doug Lamborn. It mentions in part that the U.S. House of Representatives “rejects the misguided and dangerous efforts to defund and dismantle the Nation’s law enforcement agencies.”

Sign the Petition: Demand that Polis call a special session
Parents shouldn’t have to decide between the health and education of their child, nor should they be ignored when they call for leadership. Let’s get our legislators together to find ways to provide resources and opportunities for our parents, students, and teachers, while still respecting local control decisions made by each district.
We are asking the Governor to convene a special session so our lawmakers can begin discussing those solutions.

# Lamborn backs Trump beef with Twitter with House resolution
Colorado Politics: ""President Trump isn't the only politico who has a bone to pick with Twitter. Add U.S. Rep. Doug Lamborn of Colorado Springs to the list.
He's backing a resolution ""condemning Twitter’s biased and unwarranted censorship of President Donald J. Trump.""
'Free speech is one of the founding principles of our nation. President Trump uniquely uses social media to interact directly with the American people, and to bypass the political biases of the mainstream media,"" Lamborn said in a statement Thursday evening. “Now, Twitter, a platform built on the free and open exchange of ideas, is singling out the President in an attempt to suppress his First Amendment right and interfere in the Democratic process. We cannot allow this to continue unchecked.'""

# Colorado's Rep. Tipton wants to help small oil companies survive the pandemic
Gray DC: ""One Colorado lawmaker wants to make sure small companies in the Western Slope can get the financial boost they need. Colorado Congressman Scott Tipton (R-CO) says many companies are being left out.
“We’re seeing a lot of our small producers now struggling to stay afloat…creating those jobs in rural Colorado is incredibly important,” said Tipton.
In a May 11 letter, Tipton and other House lawmakers asked the Administration to include smaller companies in the program too, quote “without discriminating by industry.”

# Who Is Lauren Boebert?
Colorado Public Radio: ""Boebert, a 33-year-old mother of four boys, backs gun rights, President Donald Trump’s MAGA agenda, and small government and limited spending.
Her support for the Second Amendment is as prominent as the firearm she often wears on her hip. Her restaurant, Shooters Grill in Rifle, Colorado, is known for its pistol-packing servers.
She gained national attention for challenging then-presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke at a September 2019 event in Aurora to discuss gun violence.
“I was one of the gun-owning Americans who heard you speak regarding your ‘Hell yes I’m going to take your AR-15s and AK-47s,’” she told O’Rourke. “Well, I’m here to say ‘Hell no you’re not.’”

“The Colorado constitution requires that ballot initiative petitions be signed in the presence of the petition circulator,” the court said in its ruling. “That requirement cannot be suspended by executive order, even during a pandemic.”
The decision marks the first court-ordered reversal of an action taken by Polis in response to coronavirus.""

# Lauren Boebert: 2020 Election Is a Choice Between ‘Freedom’ and ‘Government Control’
Breitbart: The 2020 general election is a choice between “freedom” and “government control,” assessed Lauren Boebert, the GOP candidate for Colorado’s Third House District, offering” her comments on Thursday’s edition of SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Tonight with host Joel Pollak.
She described her Democrat opponent, Dianne Mitsch Bush, as “far-left”. “She’s taking the Biden approach. Right now, she’s hiding in her basement.”
“It’s a very scary world out here in Western Colorado,” Boebert quipped. “So she’s not really talking to the people, but I’m doing grassroots rallies and meeting with folks, and it’s just so energizing. The momentum is tangible. People understand that we are in a battle now — more than ever — for the heart and soul of our country, and they realize that we need to step up and have a voice in this. because if we’re silent we lose by default.”

Our children need and deserve a high-quality education. The rest of their lives depend on that. The solution seems clear, let’s test and use flexibility around what we know to make the best decision for our children. Their futures depend on it.

Good morning-
It's hard to believe but we are less than 4 months away from the November elections. Our teams and campaigns across the state are working hard everyday and I wanted to make sure you are aware of what they have been up to this past week.
Let me know if you have any questions or comments.

Colorado GOP and Trump Victory Surpass 2 Million Voter Contacts
This past Saturday, the Colorado GOP and Trump Victory field teams surpassed 2 million voter contacts.
Read Chairman Ken Buck's statement on this impressive milestone:
""With less than 114 days until the election, our volunteer ground forces across Colorado are energized and excited to engage with voters in all 64 counties to talk about Senator Gardner, President Trump, and our slate of Republican candidates. It’s clear that Democrats can’t match our permanent, data-driven ground game operations, or the enthusiasm of Colorado Republicans. I’m proud that our volunteer teams have already reached over 2 million voters and are focused on continuing to share the results-oriented leadership of our Party. Surpassing this milestone proves that Republicans in Colorado are fired up and ready to re-elect President Trump, Senator Gardner, and Republicans up and down the ballot come November.”

Ken Buck: Why Progressives Wage War on History
National Review: ""From its founding, our nation’s history is the story of individual freedom and responsibility, with limited government as a means for accomplishing both. Our Constitution simultaneously protects individual liberty and thwarts the progressive agenda. Progressives are constantly frustrated in their attempts to remake America into a socialist and godless society because of our Constitution. Is it any wonder that they devote so much of their energy to undermining, subverting, and circumventing the Constitution?
""Progressives know that what can be erased can be replaced. Knocking down statues and removing names of institutions are the necessary first step in reshaping America’s future.
""In our fight against the progressive agenda, our history is not only what we seek to protect — it is also our primary weapon.""

# Cory Gardner wins endorsement from US Chamber of Commerce for re-election bid
Colorado Politics: ""The U.S. Chamber of Commerce threw its formal support behind U.S. Sen. Cory Gardner on Wednesday — putting its mouth where its money has been, following the business advocacy organization's heavy spending already this cycle to back the Colorado Republican's re-election bid.
""It's amazing what you can do when you decide this country is more than just parties, it's more than just red and blue — it's red, white and blue,"" Gardner said. ""When you believe in Colorado, anything is possible. It's not because you're a Democrat, it's not because you're a Republican, it's because you're for Colorado.""
