Alex Thornton,alexrheathornton@gmail.com,SCLP Sign Up,"Hi Alex!
My name is also Alex and I’m part of the South Carolina Libertarian Party. I’m emailing you in response to your email asking for more information. If possible, can you let me know what area of the state you live in? I’d love to be able to connect you with your local county chapter (or the one closest to you) so you can know when they get together.
We in the SCLP are working hard to build relationships across the state, spread knowledge of Liberty, and run people for office. In 2020, we’re gearing up to become very active in our local communities, whether it’s doing our best to the care of the homeless, attending county and city council meetings, and giving people a place to come learn about libertarianism in business meetings or socials.
Here is our Facebook page, if you’re interested.
Our next state meeting is Saturday, January 4th. We’ll be meeting at the Grecian Gardens restaurant in West Columbia at noon—guests are welcome and we always love to meet new folks!
If I can help or answer any questions, don’t hesitate to let me know. Politics can be ugly, but we strive to focus on relationships, helping people, and keeping respect at the forefront of our fight for Liberty.
Thanks and happy holidays!
Alex Thornton
