Stephen from Civic Action,info@civicaction.com,The Fox News of local TV,"At Civic Action, we’re in the business of debunking conservative, trickle-down myths – and calling out those who spread them for their own selfish gain. One particularly egregious offender has caught our attention: Sinclair Broadcast Group.
Sinclair is a business that’s buying hundreds of TV stations around the country and forcing them to air “must-run,” ultraconservative propaganda under the guise of “news.” Here’s one well-known example. By doing so, Sinclair is enforcing a conservative bias on local newsrooms across the country.
But progressives can fight back by hitting far-right propagandists where it hurts: their bank accounts. And how do we do that? We switch off Sinclair stations. It’s that simple.
But for this to work, we have to act together. We need as many people as possible to make a dent in Sinclair’s profit margin and send the company a message it can’t ignore. We can’t do this without your help. Will you click here and pledge to switch off Sinclair stations?
Sign the Pledge
If we’re going to make progress in this fight, the only way we can do that is by chipping away at right-wingers’ stranglehold on our attention – and that means turning off the propaganda and tuning in to what will truly make our country better.
We believe democracy is at its best when everyday people stand up to special interests. We know we can make a difference, but only if you stand with us right now. We’re counting on you to stop Trump propagandists and right-wing fearmongers.
“News” stations shouldn’t parrot right-wing propaganda. If you agree, sign the petition now!

The Skunk is a newsletter created by Civic Action to give you news that's accurate and progressive. To read more of our coverage, head over to the Civic Skunk Works blog.
The Pitchforks Are Here
In 2014, Civic Action founder, Nick Hanauer, predicted in POLITICO that the ""pitchforks are coming ... for us plutocrats.""
Now, in nations around the world, people are protesting economic inequality and taking to the streets in political frustration. Last year, in India, thousands protested rising onion prices, and in Chile, a 4% subway fare hike mobilized hundreds of thousands of people to protest and riot. We said it here first: The pitchforks are coming. César Hidalgo joined Nick and Paul in December to discuss the unrest in Chile and explain how his political organizing app is helping protestors prioritize the issues they want the government to address.

""In a society in which people now are better prepared and better educated, they also expect something better. And at the moment, many people are not getting [[URL REDACTED]]'s a lot of anger that is based on that tension, that people are better prepared than before, but they're getting less."" -- Cesar Hidalgo
Looking for Hope in the Climate Crisis? Throw Out Trickle-Down Economics!
A study from 2017 found that just 100 companies create 71% of the world's toxic greenhouse gas emissions, which are creating a climate crisis. And, while carbon dioxide reaches record levels, a study found that humans can't psychologically process the reality of climate change. Civic Action's Jessyn Farrell writes about what we can do to find hope and take action on the impending climate crisis.
Don't Buy Into the Misinformation About the $15 Minimum Wage
In 2020, more than half of the United States and the District of Columbia will raise their minimum wages. All of these increases are a real cause for celebration, even as the federal minimum wage languishes at $7.25/hour.
But just as the minimum wage raises delivered more income to millions of workers, they also deliver something more insidious: a flurry of concern-trolling news stories about how the minimum wage is killing jobs. Let us be clear: Despite the loud complaints of a few surly business owners and conservative pundits, raising the wage hasn't killed jobs, raised costs for consumers, or closed restaurants. Click here to read more from Paul Constant about why you should be on high alert for bogus anti-minimum-wage stories.
Overtime for the Vast Majority of Americans
People are calling for a movement to restore overtime protections for the vast majority of Americans. On average, salaried American workers are working 49 hours every week – and not getting paid one penny for those extra hours. One surprising sector is resisting the push for fairer compensation: nonprofits. Read Civic Action founder Nick Hanauer's piece on why nonprofits should embrace new overtime rules.
Hey, while you're here: At Civic Action we're trying to buck the status quo and expand the middle class through activism and education. We're not afraid of making a little trouble, but we can't do it without your help. Will you pitch in to support our efforts?

HOLD BIG PHARMA ACCOUNTABLE: Demand Congress make the pharmaceutical industry fund treatments for the opioid epidemic they created!
Click here to add your name now and hold Big Pharma accountable!
Add Your Name
In America, too many industries are permitted to put profits over people. There’s no better example of this than Big Pharma, an industry that has gotten rich from the addiction of millions to prescription opioids.
For decades, Big Pharma marketed the benefits and obscured the costs of drugs they knew to be addictive and deadly. CEOs were lavishly enriched, stockholders’ investments flourished, and lobbyists won sweetheart deals from legislators – even as millions of people became addicted to opioids.
To date, Big Pharma has mostly shielded themselves from bearing any responsibility for shilling their highly addictive drugs and fueling an epidemic. That’s where we need your help:
We need to hold Big Pharma accountable for the epidemic they’ve created – and make them pay for treatment for the millions of Americans suffering from opioid addiction. Will you add your name right now to demand Congress hold Big Pharma accountable?
HOLD BIG PHARMA ACCOUNTABLE: Demand Congress make the pharmaceutical industry fund treatments for the opioid epidemic they created! Add your name to our petition now!
According to The New Yorker, between 1999 and 2010, sales of opioids quadrupled. In many cases, pharmaceutical companies irresponsibly marketed the drugs and downplayed their risks, knowing full well their addictive potential. Now, we have a full-blown epidemic: The CDC reports, on average, 130 Americans die from an opioid overdose every single day.
Big Pharma has shown they don’t care about people – unless they can profit from them. They’ve raised the prices for lifesaving drugs like EpiPens to stratospheric levels, lobbied Congress so that the government can’t negotiate drug prices, pushed doctors to prescribe opioids for pain relief, and squelched competing pain-management markets like medical cannabis.
Please, will you join us and make sure Big Pharma finally pays for their merciless greed?

Tina Podlodowski,info@wademocrats.org,That made it clear,"Hi Alex \-- I just finished watching the VP debate, and that performance made it crystal clear. Trump, Pence, and the rest of the GOP simply do not care about your health, your job, your business, or your kids. They only care about themselves and their power. We CANNOT let Joe Biden and Kamala Harris down this November.
We've got to get EVERY. SINGLE. VOTER. to return their ballot so we can send a message loud and clear that Washington state rejects this toxic agenda and the whole lot of self-serving WA Republicans spreading it in our communities. But if we're going to reach tens of thousands more people before Election Day, we need to meet our fundraising benchmarks. Earlier today, we were roughly $8,900 behind on our weekly goal -- and I’m worried about falling short.
Will you give $25, $50, or anything you can again so we can stop Trump and the far-right in our state from gaining any more ground? You can give here: [[URL REDACTED]]

I wanted to make sure you saw my statement from yesterday evening:
""We lost a legend tonight. Justice Ginsburg will go down in American history as one of the fiercest advocates for civil rights and equality under the law that we've ever been blessed to serve us in public life. Tonight, we send our love and our sympathy to Justice Ginsburg's family, and we grieve with them as we mourn her loss.""
""But tomorrow, the work of fighting to protect the rights Justice Ginsburg enshrined in decisions issued from the highest court in the land must continue. The security of so many Americans' reproductive rights, right to marry whomever they love, and the fundamental right to be treated as equals in our society should never have rested on the shoulders of a five foot tall, 87 year old giant of American jurisprudence. We must recommit ourselves to ensuring America lives up to the vision of a just society Justice Ginsburg brought to life in both the decisions she authored and the example she set for women everywhere. May she rest in peace.""
Thank you for joining us in the work that must continue today.
Onward.

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,WA GOP wholeheartedly supports Trump,"Hey Alex,
It’s no secret that Donald Trump is the least popular president in the last century according to a poll of WA state voters. Yet, Washington State Republicans wholeheartedly supported another four years of Donald Trump in the White House during their convention. And despite Trump’s net favorability plunging to -33% in WA, his mob of GOP cronies continue to mobilize resources for his re-election on November 3.
When asked, “Who do you trust to bring our country back to greatness?” Chair Caleb Heimlich and the WA GOP answered: Donald Trump. Alex, to what greatness? What’s so great about a pandemic killing at least 124,000 Americans, an administration locking up children in cages, or a government arresting protestors fighting for justice?
The WA GOP is COMPLETELY out of touch with reality and fully supports an administration encouraging racism across the entire nation. We CANNOT allow any of the Republican candidates across our state to get in the way of the progress we’ve made as Washingtonians. And we definitely can’t allow another four years of Trump.
After the WA GOP has formally pledged their full support and trust of the president, we need to know where you stand:
Do you trust Donald Trump?
YES
NO

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,We need to work like hell,"Hi Alex,
In the middle of a pandemic, the GOP wants to put an anti-vaxxer in the Governor’s Office.
In the middle of historic civil unrest and racial injustice, the GOP nominated a candidate propelled to fame by right-wing militias and accused domestic terrorists.
And in the middle of unprecedented threats to our frontline workers, Culp has told us all that we can take our masks and “do you-know-what with it.”
We never thought Trump would succeed President Obama, until it happened. And we never thought a Trump clone like Culp could succeed Governor Inslee \-- but if we don’t work like hell to stop him, that’s exactly what will happen next.
What’s more, Culp’s complete lack of conscience gives him an unfortunate campaign advantage. He’s holding in-person rallies and using them to spur direct contact with unlikely rural voters, just like Trump did in 2016. Because we care about science \-- and the lives of our voters \-- we can’t and won’t do the same. If we don’t want him to crush us the same way he crushed his vastly more qualified Republican primary opponents, we must act now to organize our voters remotely.
Our volunteers and Coordinated Campaign staff have been fighting night and day to elect and protect Democrats all across the state. We’re working tirelessly on our virtual voter outreach \-- and have made thousands of phone calls and text messages to exactly the people we need to reach.
But right now, we’re VERY short of fully funding our virtual voter outreach program, and if we don’t raise another $3,211 before midnight we’ll have to scale back our efforts to defeat Culp and re-elect Governor Jay Inslee in November.
But we can’t get there without you.
This time next year, we could have a governor who doesn’t know how to put on a mask. We cannot allow Culp to take our state from us and put all of our lives at risk. Our Coordinated Campaign is doing all it can to defeat him, and advance Democrats up and down the ticket -- but we can’t win without you. Please, to save us from a repeat of 2016, give what you can immediately.
We cannot thank you enough for your support.
You’re the only way we can win.

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,The GOP is dragging AG Ferguson’s name through the mud,"Hey Alex,
GOP attorney general candidate Matt Larkin wants you to think AG Bob Ferguson “likes to go after people who disagree with him politically. He likes to go after people who don’t fund his campaign. There’s a bent in his office toward people he agrees with.”
Larkin has even stooped to accusing AG Ferguson of selfishly neglecting his office, saying that he has “checked out. He’s not protecting the people of Washington anymore.”
Republicans are clearly scared if they’re resorting to baseless accusations against AG Ferguson’s character. They know that his legal defense record is stellar \-- he’s proven himself a fighter for all Washingtonians. In just this term alone, he’s strived to protect the USPS and the Affordable Care Act and instigated 78 other lawsuits in pursuit of our state’s interests and the interests of every American resisting the Trump agenda.
But Larkin and Washington Republicans remain hell-bent on dragging AG Ferguson’s name through the mud. It just might be enough to let Republicans seize control of the office once again after 7 years out of power. With less than a month before Election Day, we just can’t afford any more damage from the GOP’s lies. They’ll continue to smear AG Ferguson, so we’re rallying our supporters: We want our bold Attorney General to see who is behind him. If you’re standing with our AG against these baseless personal attacks, please confirm it now:
Do you support Attorney General Bob Ferguson?
YES
NO
We greatly appreciate your responses today. With your support, we can win this election.

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,Loren Culp gets a broad platform for his dangerous message,"Hi Alex,
Right now, a YouTube video of Trump loyalist Loren Culp is gaining thousands of views online. In the clip, Culp speaks with King 5’s Chris Daniels \-- and invokes some very troubling history in order to explain his philosophies.
Gun reform, Culp says, is a bit like the Japanese-American internment during World War II: they’re both things Democrats decided “needed to be done for our safety.”
Alex, just a few short weeks ago, Republican state Rep. Vicki Kraft compared Governor Inslee to Hitler over our state’s stay-at-home orders. Now, Culp is embracing a similar message on a wider platform. This is how the WA GOP is trying to win their races -- make bad-faith, misleading comparisons to the worst moments in world history and hope voters fall for it.
It’s disconcerting to see a man like Culp sitting calmly in a cafe, having a drink and heaping blame on Democrats for everything from looting to systemic racism in policing to our raging wildfires. It’s even more disturbing that no one in the video is refuting Culp’s claims \-- instead, Culp is speaking freely, addressing voters across the state while mood music plays in the background. We refuse to allow Culp, Kraft, or any WA GOPer who spreads such dangerous and inaccurate information to be normalized. We’re taking a stand now, against the alternative facts of the alt-right and for the truth \-- are you with us? Tell us now:
Do you condemn the WA GOP?

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,An American uprising,"Hi Alex,
The Washington State Democratic Party stands with the protesters calling for justice for the murder of George Floyd and so many other Black Americans who have died as a result of police violence. We know that as Democrats, we can and must do better in lifting up the voices of those who feel they are not being heard.
We hear the pain in their calls for justice and equal treatment. We hear their anger with those sworn to serve and protect us all.
Trump and his allies in the WA GOP have been instigators \-- not leaders \-- through their lies, division, and clarion calls to racism and violence. America is angry, tired, and breaking.
We MUST lead the way in extending care and compassion to every community. And today, we need to hear from you:
Do you stand with the protesters?
YES
NO

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,Come join the blue wave in WA,"Hi Alex,
We’re so thankful to have you on our team.
We know it’s vital that we continue the fight to keep WA blue this election cycle. Our grassroots efforts in 2018 helped us secure a progressive majority in both chambers of our state’s legislature for the first time since Gov. Jay Inslee took office, which has led to great progress on the issues that Washingtonians care about most \-- like health care, election reform, and protecting our environment.
But it’s clear the GOP has no interest in progress \-- or in leading based on science. That’s why, 5 months into a pandemic, Donald Trump still doesn’t have a national testing strategy \-- and why you see so many WA GOPers walking around without masks on. If the Republican party makes inroads in our state this year, they’ll open up our public lands to fossil fuel polluters, roll back health care access for thousands, and restrict our voting rights \-- ensuring they stay in power for years to come.
That’s why our team of Virtual Volunteers is fighting back against the GOP \-- and, so far, they’re winning. Our volunteers have made more than 800,000 phone calls and sent more than 150,000 texts to reach the voters we know will sway the election this year \-- and our team is the reason we’re feeling so good about our chances in November.
But 2016 showed us that polls can’t be trusted, and that elections can turn in an instant. That’s why we can’t just defend our blue majority \-- we have to go on the offensive, and mount a GOTV strategy that will overwhelm the GOP’s crooked voter suppression tactics.
That’s why we’re asking you now to join us as a Virtual Volunteer. With your help, we’ll reach out to voters to organize a massive blue wave of support in November -- and you can help us build it without ever leaving the comfort of your home.
There’s no substitute for taking action, especially with just 84 days to go until the most important election of our lifetimes. That’s why we hope you’ll join our volunteer team. But if you’re unable, know that every dollar you give will go to amplify the efforts of our frontline organizers. The link to support their work is here: [[URL REDACTED]]
We wouldn’t want to be on any other team \-- and it feels great to win when you’re fighting on the right side of history. Thank you, thank you, thank you for making it all possible.
We promise to keep up the fight.

The Washington Dems are joining the fight to advocate for national vote-by-mail. We know that in WA state, implementing a vote-by-mail process has made our elections freer and more open \-- and it helped secure record-high turnout in our presidential primary earlier this year.
But while we’re working with other state party leaders across the country, Donald Trump has been attacking the USPS, withholding relief and even calling one of the most beloved agencies a “joke.” Trump’s continued rejections of a USPS bailout could have a severe impact on our vote-by-mail process this November as well as hurt our families in rural and low-income communities.
Today, we’re conducting an instant poll of Washingtonians \-- and we want to hear from you now. Please let us know:

Tina Podlodowski,info@wa-democrats.org,Help us save our state.,"Alex,
We owe every ounce of the progress we’ve made so far to you.
You’re the reason we’ve led the nation in our efforts to stop climate change. You’re the reason Attorney General Ferguson has been able to win dozens lawsuits against the Trump administration since this failed president took office. You’re the reason we’ve raised wages, expanded health care, and made our state a textbook example of what Democratic leadership looks like.
But now, on the eve of a historic election, we stand to lose everything.
Loren Culp and the WA GOP are using every dirty trick from the Trump playbook to turn rural Washingtonians against us. And now, a no-name sheriff from a town of 1,100 has become a cult leader with a following every bit as committed as the president’s \-- and every bit as dangerous.
Culp is driving increased GOP turnout across the state. Take the case of Jaime Herrera Beutler. In July, the Cook Political Report was saying we had a real chance of flipping her seat blue. But then JHB walked away with a 14-point lead over Carolyn Long after August’s primary. Republican turnout was never forecasted to be that high \-- but Trump and Culp are riling their base into a frenzy that’s having spillover effects across the entire state. Call it a red wave.
We’re just trying to stop it before it comes crashing down on us all.
That’ll be tough \-- because Republicans are now actively suppressing our votes in order to win. Their destruction of USPS means many Washingtonians may never even have their ballots counted \-- unless we can reach them with the info they need to make a Trump-proof plan to vote. We should be answering this electoral emergency with a GOTV effort more robust than this country’s ever seen.
But we can’t do that, because donations have slowed to a trickle. Times are obviously tough \-- but they’ll only get tougher if Trump, Culp, Herrera, and the rest of the GOP seize power in November. We need to be smashing our fundraising goals.
We’re not. We’re in the hole $1,264. Which voters should we ignore? Which seats should we leave undefended? These are questions with no good answers, but we’re going to have to make brutal cuts to our organizing strategy without your help.
You’re the only one who can help us stop the march of anti-science, anti-environmental justice, anti-democratic zealots like the president and his cronies.
You’re the reason we’re writing now. We desperately need your help.
Please. If you want us to protect Washington from the GOP, give all you can right now: [[URL REDACTED]]
No one’s ever regretted giving to a winning team. But I still remember the regret I felt on November 9, 2016. I remember the regret I felt on November 7, 2018. I remember feeling like I could have done more.
Save yourself that feeling.
Save our state.
We cannot possibly thank you enough.
Onward,
Tina

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,“We’re not going to control the pandemic.”,"Hey Alex,
On CNN Sunday, Donald Trump’s Chief of Staff Mark Meadows admitted what we’ve all known for months: this administration does not have a plan to control COVID-19 and keep America safe.
That’s right. Meadows’s exact words were: “We’re not going to control the pandemic.”
This is unacceptable. We’ve seen here in Washington state that with strong and steady leadership from Governor Inslee, policies that support working families and our seniors that our Democratic majorities in Olympia enacted even before the pandemic, and a commitment from each of us to do our part to slow the spread of the virus \-- we CAN keep our communities safe.
But Trump and his cronies are just not willing \-- or simply aren’t competent enough \-- to do the hard work of keeping Americans safe. And their failures have deadly consequences: a new study from Columbia University shows that at least 130,000 of our country’s 225,000 deaths at the hands of the pandemic could have been prevented if the federal government had acted swiftly and decisively.
The study’s authors didn’t mince words when they told the Daily Beast who is to blame: “We believe that this was a monumental, lethal screwup by an administration that didn’t want to deal with reality.”
But with Trump constantly lying and trying to downplay the severity of the pandemic, we need to know just how far his disinformation has spread among Democrats in Washington state: Do you agree that Trump’s failures on COVID-19 have cost American lives?
Do you think Trump’s failures on the pandemic have cost American lives?
YES
NO

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,The Trump loyalist in disguise,"Hi Alex,
One of the leading opponents of expanding voting rights in America is Washington’s own Secretary of State.
It’s shocking to us that Republican Secretary of State Kim Wyman continues to receive credit for being nonpartisan, even though the self-identified Reagan Republican helped lead the GOP charge against the For the People Act: a bill that would have increased transparency in election spending, forced presidents to release their tax returns, and expanded voting rights across the country.
But even despite her constant covering for Trump, Wyman got over 180,000 more votes than Democratic challenger Gael Tarleton in the primary election \-- and has her allies in the national GOP prepared to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars in PAC money to tear down our incredibly qualified Democratic candidate.
If Wyman keeps this up, she’ll be rewarded for her loyalty to the president. We’re reaching out because we want to flip this seat and see a real champion for voting rights in office next year. This is going to be a tough contest, though, and we need our opinion polls accurate to know just where we stand headed into the election. So please, tell us now:
Do you approve of Kim Wyman?
YES
NO

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,Our 2020 organizing strategy,"Hi Alex,
The coordinated campaign our party runs is powerful. In 2018, we connected with voters all across the state, and our efforts delivered us historic victories.
We need to replicate and build on the strategies we ran to ensure we win across the board this November. That’s why we’ve launched our Organizing Academy series \-- this dynamic training is for people interested in running for DNC delegate to help choose our next president and bring Washington values to our national Democratic platform \-- and it puts resources and training materials in their hands so they can run and WIN.
This program is active in five of our biggest counties \-- and just this week past weekend, we were in Pierce County with DOZENS of future Democratic leaders. Here’s a glimpse in case you missed it:
WA Dems Chair Tina Podlodowski speaking to a crowd of volunteers during our Pierce County Organizing Academy
We’re also running Organizing Bootcamps and adding field training programs to our Organizing Academies across the state \-- and the plan is to hit all 39 counties by April. We’re going to win every race in every place.
But with Trump on the top of the ticket, we know we’re in for a challenge. And if we’re going to get our country out of the mess caused by the current administration, then we need to ensure our program is well-funded.
And we still have to worry about our Democratic officeholders up for re-election who, until the spring, are too busy in Olympia delivering on their campaign promises to spend time fundraising. Until the freeze ends this spring, Democrats in our state’s delegation are BARRED from raising money, but their challengers are pulling in big corporate donations left and right.
That’s why it’s more important than ever before for us to build the resources to take on the GOP extremists running to defeat our incumbents \-- but we’ve got a hole in our 2020 budget.
Right now, we’re $18,520 short of our January goal, and we’re counting on Washingtonians who care about the future of our planet, affordable healthcare, and our shared progressive values to step up and help us close the gap before Friday night.
Online contributions to our efforts have slowed to a trickle, and we really need your help today.
Will you make your first contribution of $5 or whatever you can to support our organizing strategy for our leaders up and down the ticket?

Kamala Harris is doing her best to finally talk some sense into anti-maskers, telling Americans in a recent interview: “No one likes wearing a mask. We don't like to do it, but we do it in the spirit of love thy neighbor.” Harris then went on to condemn Donald Trump’s “reckless disregard for human life,” saying this is a time to “put the health and safety and well-being of the American people first.”
That makes the choice in November all the more clear: We’ll either have a government that listens to science, or one that punishes its experts for doing their jobs. We’ll either expand the Affordable Care Act, or restrict and repeal it. We’ll either take decisive action on climate change, setting ourselves up for a brighter and cleaner future, or pillage our public lands and resources while the next global crisis looms ever closer.
And looking at the way Trump and the GOP are attempting to suppress the vote, we know that nothing less than a blue wave will do if we’re serious about carrying our Democratic champions to the White House. That’s why we need the latest data from supporters like you immediately. Almost a million voters sat on the sidelines in WA in 2016, and we can’t let that happen again. Will you commit right now to making a stand in the most important election of our lifetimes?

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,Let’s protect Washington from DC,"Hi Alex,
Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell, and their allies in the WA GOP have put Washingtonians at risk.
Republican leadership has failed to support our working families through the economic devastation of this crisis, failed to invest in the testing and contact tracing efforts needed to contain the spread of the coronavirus, and failed to educate the public on the importance of following CDC guidelines.
These failures, however, come as no surprise. For the last few months, we’ve watched while the president refused to follow any public health guidelines himself.
That’s why we’re getting serious about our GOTV efforts. We know the ONLY way to protect our state, our values, and the future of progressive politics from Trump’s far-right cronies is to elect and protect Democrats up and down the ticket.
But the GOP would love nothing more than to replace Governor Inslee with Trump loyalist Loren Culp \-- and, alarmingly, Culp is pulling ahead in Republican polls.
Even worse, we’re severely short of our $10,000 fundraising goal for July. We need to make up for lost ground before the end of the month so we can defend not only our governor but also EVERY WA Dem whose seat is threatened by the Trump sycophants leading the top of the GOP ticket. Together, we MUST empower and expand our network of virtual volunteers \-- and make sure that we reach every single voter before the November election.
But we can’t protect our representatives, our families, and our schools without YOU. The Washington Dems have come so far because of you and other engaged Democrats ready to fight for better leadership \-- and if you want our volunteers to be able to keep up their voter contact efforts, we need to raise $5,623 more before the end of July. And with fewer than 100 days until the election, we need your help today.
If we lose, WA GOPers like Jaime Herrera Beutler, Cathy McMorris Rodgers, Dan Newhouse, and Loren Culp win.
That’s why we’re reaching out to you now -- will you contribute to help defend and expand the WA Dems? We’re relying on you to make your first contribution and support the Washington Dems today.
Thanks for being part of our team.

At the Vice Presidential Debate, Kamala Harris said: “We have seen a pattern with this administration, which is they don’t believe in science.”
Washingtonians know all too well that climate change poses an existential threat. In 2020 alone, wildfires have burned 3 million hectares in the West Coast \-- the worst fire season in 70 years.
But Pence and the rest of the GOP continue to unequivocally back Trump as he denies science and scapegoats our state’s forest management in the process, solely blaming them for this environmental disaster. And, of course, Loren Culp is echoing the GOP’s blatant and severely damaging lies.
The GOP’s anti-science agenda would be devastating to our ability to responsibly manage our forests and reduce the impact of climate change on our public lands. We cannot give these climate-deniers any more years in power. Drastic measures must be taken to combat climate change \-- and that’s just one reason why we firmly back the Biden-Harris ticket.

Tina Podlodowski,info@wa-democrats.org,Update (Good news),"Hi Alex,
When I wrote to you yesterday, I was worried that we wouldn’t hit our weekly fundraising goal that helps us power our 2020 Rise & Organize program. But DOZENS of Washington Democrats stepped up to give whatever they could to help us close the gap. In fact, we exceeded it.
Thanks to your support, we have the resources to launch massive Organizing Academies in WA's 5 biggest counties to train volunteer Neighborhood Team Leads who will be organizing in their communities every day until Election Day. They’ll be on the ground helping our coordinated campaign staff run the strategy that will turn out the voters we need to ensure another sweeping victory this November.
We're also on track to have shorter Organizing Bootcamps in every county to train volunteers to host phone banks and launch our door-to-door canvassing efforts. (So please be kind when they call and ask you to sign up to knock on doors and make phone calls!)
Your contributions also help put Democratic coordinated campaign materials directly in the hands of the voters \-- and we can’t thank you enough for being a critical member of our team.
As I mentioned, we exceeded our goal \-- in fact, we’re just $1,350 short of raising a total of $25,000.
I would LOVE to bring in $25k in one week, so I’m writing to you now to personally ask you to help us raise that $1,350 more today. Will you pitch in $25, $50, $100, or whatever you can now at the link?

Subject: We cannot stop the GOP without you
Hey Alex \--
December is a powerfully important month for us, but it’s also quite busy.
With the state legislative fundraising freeze in place, the holidays next week, and the FEC filing deadline in 11 days, the Washington Dems are committed to electing leaders who will fight Trump’s dangerous agenda and keep our state safe from the corruption, racism, and greed this administration has normalized.
The far-right extremists in our state have laid out a “biblical basis for war,” generated violent and hateful rhetoric against Muslims, and outlined their plans to create a new 51st state by breaking Washington in half.
We must keep Democrats serving at all levels of our state’s government, and today I am writing to ask you to support WA Dems in their efforts to elect even more Democrats in 2020.
But Tina told me that the resources for their key Rise and Organize grassroots training program are low \-- and she’s worried they won’t have what it takes to elect progressives across the board. That’s why I’m asking you to join me in protecting vulnerable Democrats and advancing our shared progressive values by making a grassroots contribution today.
Will you give $25, $50, $100, or whatever you can to support the WA Dems Rise and Organize program to train thousands of Democratic activists across our state?

The team wrote you yesterday, but I didn’t receive a notification of your contribution to help us power our Rise & Organize program. (Our Organizing Academy and Organizing Bootcamp efforts are underway \-- and we’re going to put resources into all 39 counties by April.) If you did give and our system failed to notify me, sorry for this mix up. Thanks for your help!
But if you haven’t given yet, I need your help to ensure we don’t have to make any cuts or timeline changes on our most important voter turnout operation.
We’ll put your first contribution of $5 or whatever you can give to good use right away. But here’s the thing: if we don’t hit our January goal, we won’t have the resources to make the powerful investments we need to win in November.
We’re still SO short of our January goal \-- $10,398 to be exact \-- and I’m reaching out to you now to ask you to step up with a contribution now.

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,Who can defeat Trump in 2020?,"Alex,
There are still more than a dozen major candidates in the race, and this week, just seven of them made it to the debate stage to dive into their plans to defeat Trump. This administration’s corruption and normalization of white nationalist violence is terrifying, and if we don’t pick the right candidate in 2020, our country could end up with four more years of this president.
We can’t afford to lose this election, so today we need to know:
Do you think Democrats have a candidate who can defeat Trump?
YES NO

Tina Podlodowski,info@wa-democrats.org,77 days,"Hi Alex,
It has been 77 days since our Democratic leaders in Olympia have been able to fundraise for their re-election campaigns. In that time, they’ve been working on passing progressive legislation that will strengthen our communities and be the reason Washington state continues to lead our nation forward.
Democrats like AG Bob Ferguson, Gov. Jay Inslee, and our leaders in the state legislature have been working hard to hold the Trump administration and Republicans like Matt Shea accountable \-- and we need to have their backs now.
You see, during the legislative fundraising freeze, the far-right Republicans running to unseat our Democratic incumbents have been raking in the big bucks from lobbyists and corporate donors, so we’ve stepped up to continue raising to fund our Rise & Organize program to ensure we win statewide.
The difference between Republican control of government and the progressive policies our WA Dems put forward couldn’t be more clear: Trump and his gang of extremists have put white supremacists in the White House, ran rampant voter suppression efforts, and enacted a number of disgusting racist policies to divide our country.
All the while, Washington Democrats have enacted same-day registration, automatic registration, prepaid ballot postage, and youth pre-registration to ensure everyone has the right to vote.
We need your help today to keep our leaders in the fight. Right now, we’re $11,140 short of our February goal \-- and I know we can make that up before tomorrow night.
Please, will you rush us a contribution at this link: [[URL REDACTED]]
Your grassroots support is what keeps WA Dems strong.

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,"Sorry in advance about the profanity in the photo in the email, but you’ve got to see this:","Hi Alex,
At a Puget Sound Patriot’s round table moderated by Johnny Walker and Alisha Beeler featuring WA GOPers Jim Walsh, Jesse Young, Marcus Carter, and Jackson Maynard, the four candidates called efforts made by Governor Inslee to contain the coronavirus “autocratic,” tyrannical,” and “unconstitutional.”
Jesse Young appealed to the Trump administration by decrying national polls and insisting a “silent majority” of voters support Republican policies, and Jim Walsh made a blatantly racist comment about African American communities that went unchallenged by anyone in attendance.
To top it off, take a look at the image in the bottom right of the screen:
An image of video conference with many WA GOPers in attendance. In the bottom right is an image of Donald Trump pointing a gun at the viewer reading, “Get in p****, we’re making America great again.”
Meme of Donald Trump pointing a gun out of a car window with the text ""Get in [expletive] We're Making America Great Again""
Alex. THIS ^^^ is what we’re up against this November. We can’t allow any of these GOP candidates to get in the way of the progress we’ve made as Washingtonians.
Today we’re conducting a survey on the GOP’s unwavering support for Donald Trump despite his ignorant displays of bigotry and continued failures in leadership. Please let us know:
Will you vote to stop the GOP's racism in November?
YES
NO

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,Meet your Democratic legislators!,"Hi Alex,
Want to learn more about how the values we fight for each election become actual law?
Then please join us on Friday, January 17th for Lobby Day! While many of our partner organizations host their own lobby days, our very own Advocacy Committee is holding their own. Lobby Day gives you the opportunity to connect with our Democratic lawmakers in Olympia and hear from them directly about how they're taking action on expanding healthcare access, protecting our environment, and so much more.
No lobbying experience is required to participate, and there is no fee required to register. Everyone is welcome regardless of advocacy experience.
During Lobby Day on Friday, January 17th (8:30 AM -- 1:30 PM), you'll get a chance to:
* Hear from allies of our party about their work on issues we all care about, such as workers' rights (shout out to the Washington State Labor Council for donating their space to us!)
* Participate in Q&A sessions with our hardworking Democratic lawmakers
* Meet with other grassroots leaders working to improve the lives of our friends and neighbors across the state
If you're interested, the Advocacy Committee will also help you and anyone else coming from your legislative district schedule a meeting with your lawmakers so you can talk to them directly about priorities for the session.
This is a great opportunity to meet follow Democratic activists and learn more about the issues before the Washington State Legislature this year. Register now for this 2020 Lobby Day in Olympia. Upon registering, you'll receive a confirmation with further details.
Thank you for all the great work you do for our party!

Tina Podlodowski,info@wa-democrats.org,This time last month,"Alex,
This time last month, we were in a serious fundraising hole.
We didn’t have the resources necessary to mount a proper counter-offensive against Loren Culp \-- who is at this very moment making Ferry County taxpayers cover his “vacation” to run for Governor, despite his leave of absence being against Republic Police Department’s policy.
It just goes to show there’s no Washingtonian who Culp won’t take advantage of in order to take over the Governor’s office.
But because of you, we’ve gotten closer to closing the gap \-- and we were able to meet and then exceed our projections for the month of August. Thank you so much for that!
This funding will allow us to redouble our efforts to talk to voters, protect our WA Dems safeguarding our communities from both this pandemic and GOP disinformation, and guard the future of this great state.
But September is a whole new month \-- and now that we’re this much closer to the election, we have a new and ambitious goal we need to reach if we want to defend our blue majority from the WA GOP.
We’d like to burst onto the scene by raising $5,000 today alone. If you want to help us run up the score against Trump, Culp, and the rest of the anti-science radicals trying their best to take over our state, here’s the link to pitch in: [[URL REDACTED]]
Thank you so, so much for helping us get ahead and stay ahead. With the GOP hot on our heels, we know we can’t rest even for a second. In the words of Governor Inslee: “Early to bed, early to rise, work like hell, and organize.”
Thank you for helping us fight this thing to the bitter end.
Thank you for helping us save WA.
Onward!

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,We’re wondering about your voting plans,"Hi Alex,
Over the years, we’ve seen the immense impact that organizing Democrats across Washington can have on our election outcomes. That’s why we’re working not only for the 2020 race but also put our energy into mobilizing Democrats, educating voters, and creating a strong progressive infrastructure that will help us win as many seats as possible in elections for years to come.
Our year-round organizing will help us elect Democrats to local, statewide, and federal office long after the 2020 cycle is through \-- and this organizing will help our long-term efforts to stop the GOP from continuing to rip families apart, destroy the middle class, cover up executive abuses of power, and deny hard-working Americans affordable healthcare.
Just this week, the House Clerk released a report from ex-FBI agents on Rep. Matt Shea’s extensive ties to groups that advocate for politically-motivated violence \-- and it’s Republicans like him that we need to take on in 2020. But our big-picture Democratic infrastructure only works when every Washingtonian engages, which is why we need to know:
Will you vote in 2020?
YES NO

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,"Help us save 70,000 Americans","Hi Alex,
Masks save lives.
In fact, the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation projects that if every American begins wearing masks in August, we could save up to 70,000 lives by December.
That’s roughly the population of Redmond or Pasco.
But Republicans are fighting science every step of the way. Donald Trump railed against masks for months before begrudgingly donning a face covering one time for the media. He hasn’t been seen in one since and recently applauded a group of maskless supporters at his country club as “peaceful protesters.”
Meanwhile, Loren Culp is driving around our state, telling us to take our masks and shove them. His packed rallies only facilitate the spread of anti-science sentiment \-- and, of course, the virus.
We need to take action, now.
We need a national mask mandate \-- it’s the best way to save lives, protect frontline workers, and move us another step forward toward economic recovery.
If you agree that the GOP’s reckless endangerment of millions of Americans must come to an end, add your name to ours now.
Alex, we can’t just sit by while anti-science extremists put our most vulnerable citizens at risk. If you want to help bring an end to the virus - and a safe reopening of our economy and our schools - join us in our mission to achieve a national mask mandate. Together, we can stand up for science. But we can’t do it without you.
Thank you for standing with us today.

Pramila Jayapal,info@wa-democrats.org,Nothing happens without organizing,"Hi Alex,
As a lifelong activist, I know that change can’t happen without organizing. And right now, we need bold, transformational change in America.
Our current systems do not work for working people who can’t afford their health care or are working multiple jobs to make ends meet. Our immigration system is broken, leaving refugees and asylum seekers vulnerable to this administration’s zero humanity policies. And we need immediate and bold action on the climate crisis.
But before we can make change, we need to organize and unseat the Republicans in our state who continuously try to block our progress.
We have big choices, big fights, and so much work ahead of us. And it’s up to us to lead the way.
The WA Dems’ coordinated campaign is the kind of powerful organizing that will lead us to a sweeping victory up and down the ticket this November. But with extreme conservatives and white nationalists gaining ground across our state and country, we can’t afford to have any shortfalls this year.
That’s why I’m reaching out today.
I told Tina and the team at WA Dems that I’d help them raise $8,000 TODAY for their Rise & Organize program. And right now, I’m personally asking you to make a contribution to help me hit that goal.
I won’t tell you that your contribution today will enact progressive policies or stop this racist, authoritarian president from separating families and putting kids in cages. But your contribution to the Washington Democrats will help us organize our way to the collective vision we have for our world.
Will you give $25, $50, $100, or whatever you can before midnight? Here’s the link: [[URL REDACTED]]
I’m so glad to be in this fight with you.

Tina Podlodowski,info@wa-democrats.org,Congressional WA Dems support impeachment -- do you?,"Hi Alex,
The House has drafted two articles of impeachment against Donald Trump for his high crimes and misdemeanors, while Republicans in Congress are doing everything in their power to derail this vote.
Every single Democratic member of the Washington state congressional delegation supports impeachment \-- and they’ve led the fight to hold Trump accountable and ensure that our future elections are free from outside influence. Washington Democrats know the value of standing up for what’s right, even when it’s hard. That’s the only way justice can be served.
Our own Rep. Pramila Jayapal, who serves on the House Judiciary Committee, said this: “My message to the President is if it’s radical to stand up for the Constitution, I hope we have more radicals.”
So do we. What happens next will be a test of our leaders’ commitment to the oath they took to protect our Constitution \-- and it’s on Congress to act accordingly.
Washingtonians do not stand for corruption or the obstruction of justice, and neither should our elected officials. We will continue supporting candidates that call for accountability at all levels of government. It’s the right thing to do and the only way to preserve our state’s values.
But right now, we want to hear from you about where you stand on this issue. Can you take our impeachment poll today?
Do you stand with Congressional WA Dems in support of impeaching Donald Trump?
YES NO
Thank you for your investment in our democracy,

WE at the Washington State Democratic Party stand with the protesters calling for justice for the murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Sean Reed, Tony McDade, and so many other Black Americans who have died as a result of police violence.
As Democrats, WE can and must do better in lifting up the voices of those who feel they are not being heard until they force society to listen by marching in the streets.
Black lives matter \-- and we’re in this fight to ensure the calls for justice and equal treatment by those sworn to serve and protect us all are not only heard loud and clear but also lead to policy that will answer their demands.
WE condemn the use of unnecessary and military-style force against American citizens demanding justice. We call on every elected official, regardless of party, to be unified in rejecting this wholesale abandonment of American values and come together to listen to the calls for justice ringing out in the streets of every city in America.
While many people in this country are focused on how we get back to “normal,” we must remember that normal for Black Americans is the fear that institutional racism could end their life or take the life of a loved one.
We owe them more than words; we owe them more than legislation; we owe them a daily commitment to use whatever power each of us has to effect change until every American \-- regardless of the color of their skin \-- can move through our society without fear.
Today, we’re asking you to join us in supporting Black Lives Matter Seattle-King County by contributing $25, $50, $100, or whatever you can now help bend the moral arc of history toward justice.

Tina Podlodowski,info@wa-democrats.org,"Just $1,250 SHORT!!","Alex \-- Democrats in our state like AG Bob Ferguson, Gov. Jay Inslee, and Rep. Suzan Delbene have been working hard to advocate for Washingtonians in this time of crisis. But the GOPers running to unseat them in 2020 are using this time to try and get ahead of our WA Dems.
Our coordinated campaign strategy at the Washington State Dems is designed to turn out our voters across the state to ensure our state stays blue, especially when we’re fighting Trump and his far-right values at the top of the ticket. Every single Republican candidate challenging Gov. Inslee has even taken a personal loyalty pledge to Trump, so we’ll need you in this fight with us to make sure none of them get within a mile of victory.
That’s why we need you to be one of our May donors so we can invest more resources into our June strategy to stop Trump and his cronies from getting in the way of our progress.
We know far-right, pro-Trump Republicans are doing anything they can to gain ground, but if we organize around our Democrats now, we can stop Trump’s allies in WA from enacting dangerous policies that separate families, lock kids in cages, and take health care away from tens of thousands of us in the middle of a pandemic.
We’re fighting to drive our state and nation forward. But to do that, we MUST ensure our coordinated campaign is fully funded so we can effectively organize for our leaders up and down the ticket.
But right now, we’re short of our May fundraising target, and if we fall short this month, we’ll have to pull back on our strategy. There really couldn’t be a more important time for you to contribute now to protect our Democratic leaders across our state.
Can I count on you to pitch in $5 or whatever you can at the link to become a 2020 Member of WA Dems and support our efforts to keep Washington blue?

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,Trump rips mask off so quickly his hands blur,"Hi Alex,
After being hospitalized with the coronavirus, and still contagious with the disease, Trump responded this way after returning to the White House:
President Trump rips his mask off his face so quickly his hands are blurred, a look of utter disdain upon his face.
He told Americans not to let COVID “dominate” their lives, declared he was feeling better than he had in decades, and then ripped off his mask and marched inside. He declared on Twitter: “Will be back on the Campaign Trail soon!!!”
This sets a terrible example for all Americans. Public health guidelines MUST be followed if we want to see our way through this crisis and protect the Americans who don’t have access to presidential health care. That’s why we’re reaching out to you: we need help sending a message that Americans are more responsible than their president. Will you tell us if you’ll follow public health guidelines, even if Trump won’t? Let us know now:
Do you wear a mask in public?
YES
NO
Thanks for taking our quick poll.
We appreciate your input.

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,Our adaptation plan,"Hi Alex,
We’re living in unprecedented times \-- and many of our leaders have risen to the occasion to ensure families across Washington state and the country have the support they need.
Gov. Jay Inslee’s leadership, Sen. Patty Murray’s fight for our working families, and AG Bob Ferguson’s work to hold price-gougers accountable is moving us in the right direction. We’re united in our efforts to beat this virus and save as many lives as possible.
At Washington Dems, we’re looking ahead because what’s happening now is proof that we need to keep our Democratic leaders in office and elect even more progressives to ensure Washington continues to drive our nation forward.
We’ve adjusted our 2020 plan to fit the times. We’re investing heavily in digital organizing tools. Until this public health crisis passes, our remote phone banking and the content we put on social media will be the primary ways we contact voters to give them the information they need to know.
That said, as a member of the Washington State Democratic Party, we’d like your opinion on our new strategy:

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,Presidential Primary Turnout & COVID-19 Update,"Hi Alex,
Even with thousands of ballots still being counted across the state, the team here at WA Dems wanted to reach out to you with an update on presidential primary turnout thus far: our switch from a caucus to a primary was a resounding success! We’ve seen more than a million ballots cast in our primary so far, and nearly 40% of registered voters have participated in choosing our next president. Moving our primary up in the nomination calendar put us on the map and drew visits from all the leading contenders in the 2020 race since last summer, giving Washington Democrats more access to our party’s national leaders than we’ve ever had. Now with our primary in the rearview mirror, all that remains is to wait for every single vote to be counted and allocate our delegates to the Democratic National Convention accordingly.
We also want to pass along some news about how our Democratic leaders are handling the COVID-19 outbreak. Governor Inslee is taking responsible steps to slow the spread of the virus, including mandating the cancellation of gatherings of more than 250 people. We’ve already rescheduled our 2020 Magnuson Awards Dinner from this past Saturday to early May, and have been working on contingency plans if these public health measures require us to cancel our LD caucuses in late April. As always, public safety is our chief concern, and we’re thankful to have the Governor’s calming presence during this challenging time.
Unfortunately, that same measured leadership isn’t reflected in the White House. President Trump is irresponsibly spreading misinformation about the virus and called Governor Inslee a “snake” right when we need partnership and open lines of communication with the federal government more than ever before. But Senator Murray isn’t letting this appalling lack of concern for families in Washington State go unchallenged; she’s holding the administration accountable for their failures and leading the charge in Congress to get our state’s public health agencies and healthcare infrastructure the resources they need.
Working with Senator Murray in the House to push that aid package forward is our newest Congresswoman, Dr. Kim Schrier. She’s using her personal experience as a physician to break through the usual partisan barriers and get bipartisan support for the 8 billion dollar aid package to help address not just the public health aspects of the COVID-19 outbreak, but also the economic impact felt in our communities as a result. There’s never been a better time for Washington State to have a doctor in the House!
Thank you to all of you who support the work we do to elect these incredible Democratic leaders, and stay tuned for additional updates on the presidential primary results!

Thank you for signing up for updates from the Washington State Democratic Party! We’re so thankful to have you on our team as we fight for our values and for integrity in government on every level.
Our grassroots efforts last cycle helped us secure a progressive majority in both chambers of our state’s legislature for the first time since Gov. Jay Inslee took office, which has led to great progress on the issues that Washingtonians care about most \-- like health care, election reform, and protecting our environment.
We’re so glad to have your support as we keep pushing for progress on these and many other important issues \-- but if you believe in our mission to elect even more progressives to public office next cycle, we have an urgent question for you, that may be a very easy answer for our closest allies:
Do you approve of Trump?
YES NO

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,Get your ballots in!,"Hi Alex,
For the first time in over 75 years, Washington State Democratic voters will be participating in a state-run presidential primary to allocate national delegates to presidential candidates. Both major political parties are allocating their delegates this way, so voters have a new and exciting opportunity to have a say in who should be our next president.
The primary is TOMORROW March 10. Washington is a vote-by-mail state, so if you have registered to vote, you should have already received your mail-in ballot. Once you’ve filled out your ballot, you can drop your vote in the mail or a ballot drop box.
REMEMBER: If you are mailing in your ballot, it must be postmarked by March 10. (Be sure to check with your local post office to find out when the last time your mail will be collected before tomorrow).
You can also place your ballot in a drop box by 8 p.m. on Primary Day (tomorrow)!
Please make sure you, your family, neighbors, and friends vote in the primary \-- we’re counting on you! Right now, we’re conducting a poll to see how many Washingtonians have already dropped off their ballots. Will you please let us know:
Have you submitted your ballot yet?
YES
NO
Thanks for doing your part.

This weekend, we’re pushing to continue breaking call records like we have been the past few weeks. But we can’t do it without your help -- to make this our biggest phone bank ever, we need another 52 volunteers to join us in making phone calls this Sunday.

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,WA GOP leans into the truly bizarre -- and the truly dangerous,"Hey Alex,
Jenny Graham, Republican representative from WA’s 6th Legislative District, has been sharing some pretty wild conspiracy theories with her voters. According to the Washington Post, the tin-foil-hat ‘alternative facts’ include the idea that vaccines cause autism, that Democrats are in league with the devil, and that masks don’t work against COVID-19 \-- but hydroxychloroquine does.
Meanwhile Matt Shea, Republican from the 4th Legislative District and accused domestic terrorist, has called for children to be trained to fight the coming holy war \-- while his handpicked successor, Rob Chase, likes to spend his time reading up on QAnon forums. Chase won’t rest until he gets the straight ‘facts’ on chemtrails, Barack Obama’s real birthplace, and Hillary Clinton’s role in a global sex trafficking ring.
This may all sound funny on first reading \-- it’s not. It wasn’t too long ago that an armed gunman stormed a Washington, D.C. pizza restaurant, fired his weapon, and demanded access to the underground vault where Bill Clinton’s purported sex slaves were being hidden. This is what happens when the GOP discredits the media, lies constantly, and cocoons their voters in a propaganda environment susceptible to manipulation by Russian intelligence agencies.
When the GOP embraces conspiracy theories, they put lives at risk, plain and simple. Lives that could be lost to ignoring public health guidelines \-- or lost to the dangerous QAnon movement that the FBI has warned is fast becoming a domestic terrorist threat. If you demand our elected officials not use their office to spread their hazardous waste to unsuspecting citizens, make your voice heard now:
Do you condemn GOP conspiracy theories?
YES
NO
We greatly appreciate your responses today \-- they will help us win the election.
Thank you,

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,"Trump accuses Nevada of a “coup,” then commits one himself","Hi Alex,
Do you think Donald Trump knows what the word “coup” means?
A tweet from @realDonaldTrump reads: In an illegal late night coup, Nevada’s clubhouse Governor made it impossible for Republicans to win the state. Post Office could never handle the Traffic of Mail-In Votes without preparation. Using Covid to steal the state. See you in Court!
Source: Twitter
Nevada’s Assembly Bill 4, which makes it easier to vote by mail this election, was passed in the State Senate and then signed into law by Governor Sisolak. It’s the furthest thing from a coup \-- it’s democracy working as it should.
But Trump’s response \-- to launch a bad-faith, partisan court battle to restrict the rights of hundreds of thousands of Nevada voters before a presidential election \-- fits the definition of “coup” to a T.
We’ve had universal vote-by-mail for years, and we know firsthand how well it works (when it’s allowed to). So does Trump, which is exactly why he’s trying to clamp down on voting rights before he loses in a November landslide. Polls show as many as 70% of voters approve of vote-by-mail \-- let’s see if we can’t get that number even higher so we can stand in solidarity with the Nevadans that Trump is doing his best to disenfranchise. Tell us now:
Do you support vote-by-mail?
YES
NO
Thank you for taking a stand as we fight to keep our election secure.

Tina Podlodowski,info@wa-democrats.org,We're still short of our August digital fundraising goal,"Alex,
I've written to you this month about how important it is to keep Loren Culp and the rest of the WA GOP’s anti-maskers out of Olympia.
And look, beating Culp and his down-ballot GOP allies on Nov. 3 won't be easy. The WA GOP is mounting a massive grassroots outreach effort to rural Washingtonians while we do our best to defend ourselves from their anti-science lies and anti-progress agenda with our virtual campaign tactics.
But if we fall short of our August digital fundraising goal, we'll be forced to scale back our voter outreach, and Culp’s dangerous rage against public health guidelines and the rule of law will go unanswered \-- and he could start to win more hearts and minds all across the state.
Thankfully, hundreds of supporters have stepped up this month \-- which means we are now INCREDIBLY close to our fundraising goal. When we hit it, we’ll be able to expand our GOTV efforts, reach more voters, win this election, and grow WA’s blue majority instead of seeing our state fall to the GOP.
But right now we're still just $1,033 short of our August digital fundraising goal.
I'm not sure that I've seen a gift from you recently. (Please forgive us if we’re wrong; records can be slow to update \-- especially in the closing weeks before the election when the team is stretched thin!) If you haven't been able to support the WA Dems this month, will you help us close the rest of the gap \-- we’re so close \-- so that we can beef up our GOTV efforts and hand the WA GOP the humiliating defeat their anti-science candidates deserve? (And if you've already given this month, I'm so sorry to have missed it! And would you be so kind as to support us again so we can reach this goal?)
Chip in what you can now to bring us over the finish line: [[URL REDACTED]]
We’re so very grateful for your support.

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,The GOP is ignoring income inequality,"Hi Alex,
Washington State is one of the worst states for income inequality: The Economic Policy Institute reports that the top one percent’s average income is 24.2 times more than the other 99 percent.
As for the country? The top 1% has stolen $50 trillion from the bottom 90% of earners since 1975.
We know who is to the blame: Republicans in the other Washington who blew up our deficit by a trillion dollars to give tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations, including those in our state.
Continuing under Trump’s leadership, their focus isn’t on everyday Americans \-- rather, the GOP remains intent on passing legislation that supports corporate interests and their rich benefactors at the expense of the rest of us.
Trump is attempting to hide the problem by lauding the stock market gains, but he’s not fooling us. We know that COVID-19 has only exacerbated the extent of income inequality in America. Millions of Americans are out of work \-- or are forced to work despite serious danger to their health \-- and are plummeting to financial ruin without any safety nets in place to support them.
We know that something MUST be done about income inequality. Republicans will distract Americans with lies about voter fraud and Democratic corruption to distract the country from the real issues, so that’s why we are calling on you to make your voice heard:
We are sending a petition DEMANDING that Congress finally addresses rampant income inequality. We need you. Inaction is just unacceptable \-- too many lives are at stake.
Add your name to ours and send a message straight to Congress -- we demand that Congress take action to reduce income inequality NOW.
Thank you for standing with us.

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,How Democrats have responded,"Hi Alex,
We wanted to check in with you to share updates on COVID-19 and the Democratic response to the public health crisis here in Washington state.
On Monday, Gov. Inslee laid out our statewide plan to increase measures taken to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and save lives.
We know that we're entering a stage of the infection that could be potentially rapid and widespread, that anyone above the age of 60 is facing an increased rate of mortality, and that Seattle and King Counties are the most heavily impacted at this time.
Now, we are moving forward with the assumption that every person has been exposed. Gov. Inslee has called for us to avoid concentrated areas, isolate should you experience symptoms, and work from home if possible. Schools are closed through at least April 24, 2020, and we have been asked to self-quarantine for the next two weeks.
Currently in the U.S. Senate, Democratic Sen. Patty Murray is leading the fight for working-class Americans during the COVID-19 outbreak. She's fiercely advocating for paid sick leave and has condemned the GOP and their efforts to block legislation that could help employees in the U.S. prioritize their health and well-being over concerns of financial hardship.
In an op-ed, Sen. Murray writes, “Here’s the problem: 32 million people in our country have no paid sick days. In other words, for one-in-four workers, taking one of the most impactful steps we can to combat the virus could mean losing a paycheck or potentially a job.”
This legislation, if passed, would give 14 paid sick days in public health emergencies like the one we are facing right now. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Americans should not have to sacrifice their health or that of their families to put food on the table. With the prospect of isolation looming over communities across the country, that's just simply not a choice for impoverished and working-class families.
At the Washington State Democratic Party, we're proud of the actions leaders like Gov. Inslee and Sen. Murray are taking to mitigate the spread of this pandemic, but we want to let our leaders know how you're feeling.
Are you proud of the actions our Democratic leaders are taking to mitigate the spread of COVID-19?
YES
NO
Stay well!

There’s a new poll from KING 5 of Washington voters that shows Trump’s approval rating here is at 33% and that only 31% of Washingtonians plan to vote for Trump. This is good news for us \-- and proof that voters are ready for new leadership in the other Washington.
When it comes to support of the president, we like to keep our data points up-to-date and accurate; that’s why we’re updating our records after the president’s calls for use of chemical weapons and deadly force against Americans demanding justice in cities across the country.

Today is the day \-- Election Day. Our last chance to turn in our ballots.
Republicans know they’re headed for a defeat at the top of the ticket, so they’re trying to win themselves a consolation prize by knocking off our down-ballot candidates and lying about Referendum 90 \-- a crucial measure to allow comprehensive sex education in our public schools.
Meanwhile, the contrast between our gubernatorial candidates couldn’t be more clear \-- Loren Culp has continued to hold his superspreader in-person rallies, and Governor Inslee is campaigning safely for local candidates in close races like T’wina Nobles. One is fighting for the values that will make this state a better place, the other is just fighting for his ego.
Almost 1,000,000 registered Washington voters didn’t vote in 2016. With so much on the line, we simply can’t allow that to happen again. So please let us know your plans. It will help us know where to direct our GOTV efforts and show other Washingtonians that sitting out this election isn’t an option \-- tell us now:
Have you voted?
Yes
Not yet, but I will today
No, I'm not voting
We greatly appreciate your responses today \-- they will help us win the election.

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,Our state legislature is up for grabs,"Hi Alex,
Our state legislature is up for grabs this election. Senators like Andy Billig and Christine Rolfes, who worked so hard to deny Republicans the opportunity to unnecessarily cut billions from our state budget, need our support more than ever.
Their GOP opponents wanted to use the economic fallout from the pandemic to force a special session and cut funding for programs supporting working families, but because of their leadership and steadfast support from Governor Inslee we prevented those cuts \-- and now the latest budget forecast shows that shortfall reduced by half!
We must not only protect progressive champions like Billig and Rolfes, we must also elect Democrats who will fight for the security of our elections and for our values on the national level \-- like Secretary of State candidate Gael Tarleton and U.S. House candidate Carolyn Long.
But our fight for Democratic leaders won’t go as far without a budget to match. And right now, we’re still $5,291 short of our GOTV fundraising goal. If you can chip in to help protect and expand WA’s blue majority, then please, give whatever you can now: [[URL REDACTED]]
We can’t thank you enough for safeguarding the progress we’ve made. With you alongside us, we can’t wait to make even more.

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,“The wages of not following the science are loss.”,"Hi Alex,
“The wages of not following the science are loss.”
Those were Governor Inslee’s words upon surveying the destruction wrought in Malden last week. 80% of the town was annihilated by wildfire. Raging infernos have cost Washingtonians their homes, their businesses, and even \-- tragically \-- their very lives. We’re not alone in our devastation, as our neighbors in California and Oregon have seen similarly apocalyptic blazes redden their skies and darken their futures. It’s the most poignant, most painful example of the reality of the climate crisis in recent memory.
Governor Inslee’s response was to give the affected families a listening ear, assess the damage and offer cash assistance, and issue a statewide warning on the severity of the climate crisis. Loren Culp’s response was to mock concerns that “we’re all going to burn up,” dismissing the threat of global warming because, in his words, “In the ‘70s there was the big scare about global cooling.”
Culp is wrong: the majority of scientists were predicting global warming even in the ‘70s. And the consequences of the climate crisis aren’t “always 10-12 years down the road,” as Culp insists \-- they’re here. On our doorstep. We need to act.
With your help, that’s exactly what we’ve done. We are now so incredibly close to securing and expanding our blue majority \-- keeping a national leader on the climate crisis in the governor’s office, setting new clean energy benchmarks for the nation, and protecting Washingtonians and Americans from the worst ravages of the climate crisis that are still yet to come.
But the Republican party isn’t stopping their anti-science crusade for anything. The GOP has rolled back environmental regulations. Their acting director of the Bureau of Land Management has advocated selling off our public lands to Big Oil and Big Gas companies. And now the WA GOP’s nominee for governor is promising that, if elected, he’ll stick his head in the sand while our state turns to ash around him.
Culp won’t win \-- not if we have anything to say about it. We need to send an unequivocal message to Republicans everywhere: telling dangerous, irresponsible lies to your voters does not pay off. Campaigns have consequences. If the GOP wants to run as anti-science, they should lose in a landslide so enormous it shakes the foundation of their party.
That’s the defeat we want to deliver the Republicans trying to impede our progress. But right now, we’re falling short of our weekly fundraising goal \-- we need another $8,539 to meet our projections. If we don’t keep pace, we won’t be able to beef up our GOTV operations the way we’d like to \-- the way we’ll need to if we want to send a fractured GOP back to their campaign strategy headquarters with wounds to lick and life lessons learned.
We’re reaching out to you because we know you see this election for what it is: an all-important opportunity to affirm progressive values, protect our environment and our people, and repudiate Republican deception on a massive scale.
We’ll always be here for you. But we need your help: if you’ve got a dollar to give, give it now. You’ll be helping turn the blue victory we’re anticipating in November into a blue blowout. You’ll be helping keep our state and our country armed with the science-based policies we’ll need to face the future. And you’ll be helping vanquish some of the most despicable GOP candidates we’ve ever encountered.
For that, we cannot thank you enough.

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,Hey Alex!,"Team. We are PUMPED UP right now.
After we emailed yesterday about the clown race that is the Republican gubernatorial primary and how we need to make sure our coordinated campaign strategy is ready to take on whichever radical WA GOPer will be at the top of our ticket alongside Trump, HUNDREDS of Washington Democrats pitched in.
Alex, we’re blown away. THANK YOU!!
Because you all came through for us with such an overwhelming response, Tina asked the team if we could raise an additional $2k on top of our goal for this week, and we know we can do it with your help. Every dollar we raise before the primary gets plowed right back into supporting our Coordinated Campaign’s organizers, and our hard-working field staff needs all the help they can get during GOTV!
Right now, we’re just $580 short of that stretch goal \-- and if you could pitch in $5, $10, $25, or whatever you can to join us, it would help us close the gap. Here’s the link to give: [[URL REDACTED]]

Reproductive freedoms, affordable healthcare, a living wage, our planet, and basic human decency are all on the line this year \-- but Democrats in our state’s delegation like AG Bob Ferguson and Gov. Jay Inslee are leading the progressive fight to keep our country moving forward, not back.
But our state delegation is currently BARRED from fundraising for their re-election campaigns until the spring. That means the GOPers running to unseat them in 2020 are hustling to get ahead and cashing checks from powerful special interest groups trying to buy our elections.
Trump’s allies in WA will do anything to push his dangerous platform forward, but we can stop them from separating families and locking kids in cages if we organize early. We need to be honest about this though: those far-right GOPers like domestic terrorist Matt Shea are gaining ground.
If we’re going to drive our state and nation forward, we MUST ensure our coordinated campaign is fully funded so we can effectively organize for our leaders up and down the ticket.
But we’re $7,420 short of our January fundraising target, and falling short this month will directly impact our 2020 Rise & Organize programming. We can’t allow the GOP to have a chance to get ahead of us.
There couldn’t be a more important time for you to contribute now to protect our Democratic leaders in our state’s delegation. Can we count on you to pitch in $5 or whatever you can at the link to support our efforts to keep Washington blue?

Tina Podlodowski,info@wa-democrats.org,Washington state leads the way!,"Hi Alex,
In Washington state, we’ve built incredible Democratic coalitions of workers, unions, progressive organizations, and elected officials that have paved the way for progress in our country.
We’ve led on combating the climate crisis, increasing the minimum wage, and so much more. Now, with campaigns across the country falling back on digital as their main organizing tool, we’re sharing our best practices with dozens of state Democratic parties with competitive races so that we can turn out the voters we’ll need to take back the country from Trump and his cronies.
You know my vision for 2020 is a blue WA state and Congress, plus a new Democratic resident in the White House -- but I know we’ve got our work cut out for us. (Especially when we can’t send our volunteers out into the field to talk to voters.)
With Cathy McMorris Rodgers on board as Trump’s campaign chair here in WA and corporate donors dumping heaps of cash in races across our state to protect Trump’s GOP allies, it’s up to us to combat the GOP efforts to defeat our Washington Democrats.
We know exactly what we need to do in order to run a powerful and coordinated statewide strategy to stop the pro-Trump and far-right GOP from gaining any more ground in our state, but we need to keep building our resources to support our new digital campaign infrastructure.
That’s why WA Dems is working to raise $5,750 more TODAY so we can fund our Rise & Organize virtual volunteer training and programs \-- so I’m asking you to step up with a contribution toward these efforts today.
Will you jump in now to help us stop GOP extremists like Matt Shea from spreading his domestic terrorist agenda and Trump-enabling Republicans like Jaime Herrera Beutler from ignoring her constituents?

Our team is pushing to get ahead on our first quarter fundraising goal now because we know that GOPers in Washington state and across the country are actively working against the science, fact, and reason presented by our public health experts.
Their strategy is going to drive us back decades \-- but our Democratic elected officials are fighting hard to protect our progress and move our country forward.
Our coordinated voter outreach and communication strategies will be key to defending our Washington Dems.
But right now, WA Dems is up against our 3/31 FEC deadline \-- we’re still short of our Q1 goal. Missing this critical benchmark would mean we’ll have to scale back our April organizing efforts. That means we’d have fewer resources, organizers, and volunteers throughout the state laying the groundwork for Democrats to win up and down the ticket in November.
That’s why I’m reaching out to you today.
We need to raise $5,640 before midnight tomorrow if we’re going to stay on track to stop the far-right GOP from gaining ground in our state. Cathy McMorris Rodgers stepped up to be Trump’s Washington state campaign chair \-- and corporate donors will dump BIG money into races to boost Trump’s allies.
Our statewide strategy is powerful enough to stop them, but not without your support.
I’m counting on you to jump in now to help us stop GOP extremists like candidate for governor Tim Eyman from purposely defying public safety guidelines, Matt Shea from spreading his white supremacist values, and Trump-enabling Republicans like Jaime Herrera Beutler from neglecting her constituents.

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,Trump’s great people,"Hey Alex,
Trump is back to promoting white supremacy and uplifting white neo-Nazis on Twitter.
Recently, Trump retweeted a video of white seniors shouting “white power” to a group of protestors united against police brutality. Since the very beginning, Trump’s presidency has been a springboard for blatant white supremacists to spread their message of hate and acts of violence across our nation. Whether he’s calling the Charlottesville “Unite the Right” rally attendees “very fine people” or enacting discriminatory immigration policies, Trump consistently emboldens the worst fringes of the Republican movement.
In response to the historical uprisings against police brutality across our country, Trump unleashed the National Guard on peaceful protesters and signed an executive order to imprison protestors for ten years if they remove Confederate monuments. Yet, in his eyes, the Villages’ white supremacists are “great people.”
This November’s election is a fight for the soul of our nation, and it is clear which side Trump is on. Four more years of incendiary tweets supporting a nationwide call for white power and far-right Washington state Republicans aligning with Trump are unacceptable. We’ve already stopped one extremist GOPer who was caught plotting domestic terrorism and training children for a “holy war.” Who knows what other horrors Trump will inspire if he wins a second term?
We’re building a strategy to stop Trump, and hearing from you is critical to our success. Please let us know:
Do you condemn Donald Trump?
YES
NO

Thank you so much for everything you’ve done.
It’s because of you that the WA Dems have come this far. You carried us to victory in 2018, and we’ve been able to spend 2020 building a plan to protect all the great progress you’ve helped us make since then. Because of you we have the cleanest energy grid in the nation. We have the country’s best financial aid program for teachers and students. And we have the strongest voting rights, along with the most transparent government, anywhere in the U.S.
We want to make sure that Democrats like Jay Inslee and Bob Ferguson continue making Washington a shining example of what a blue state can look like.
But right now, we’re facing a severe digital fundraising shortfall.
We fell VERY short of our July online fundraising goal. I had to make a few tough calls as we adapted our strategy for the general election -- but to make up the difference we significantly bumped up our August fundraising goal in order to keep our ambitious GOTV campaign afloat.
But now, we’re falling short again. If we don’t turn this around immediately, we’ll have to scale back our strategy for the next 2 ½ months at the worst possible time. We could see WA GOPers like Jaime Herrera Beutler, Cathy McMorris Rodgers, Dan Newhouse, and Loren Culp gain power all across the state -- even in the governor’s mansion.
Please, Alex, I’m asking you because you’ve always been there for us in the past.

The Washington State Democratic Party stands with the protesters calling for justice for the murder of George Floyd and so many other Black Americans who have died as a result of police violence. We know that as Democrats, we can and must do better in lifting up the voices of those who feel they are not being heard.
We hear the pain in their calls for justice and equal treatment. We hear their anger with those sworn to serve and protect us all.
Trump and his allies in the WA GOP have been instigators \-- not leaders \-- through their lies, division, and clarion calls to racism and violence. America is angry, tired, and breaking.
We MUST lead the way in extending care and compassion to every community. And today, we need to hear from you:
Do you stand with the protesters?
YES
NO

735,000 Washingtonians are without internet connection in their homes. Another 500,000 people have to rely on cell phone data to stay connected \-- and then 12,000 others are still operating online using dial-up.
In the middle of a pandemic where we have all been asked to switch to remote work and learning, it’s imperative that people across Washington state and the country have access to 21st century technology.
Chris Reykdal, who serves as the Superintendent of Public Instruction here in Washington state, said we must “sow the seeds of complete innovation in connectivity for families. It is the way we will learn. It is the way of the future.”
We need leaders across the country to view internet access as a critical infrastructure \-- and investment in broadband needs to happen immediately.
Our leaders like Sen. Patty Murray and Rep. Derek Kilmer have already put forward legislation, but we need to put the pressure on to demand Congress pass legislation that will close the digital divide.
Today, we’re calling on our leaders in Washington to take action to implement nationwide broadband access, and we need you to stand with us now. Please sign your name to our petition immediately.
Thanks for being part of this,

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,Culp builds an echo chamber of misinformation,"Hi Alex,
Loren Culp is building an echo chamber of misinformation to keep swing voters from learning the truth about this campaign.
On Seattle’s Morning News, Culp accused Governor Inslee and the Democratic government of “out of control spending,” pointing to “billions of dollars” he claims are wasted each month, and even falsely claiming, “That money comes right out of the pockets of families.”
Culp is wrong, of course, because Inslee has been nothing but an advocate for working families \-- bolstering unemployment and sick leave protections, protecting tenants from evictions and rent hikes, and providing millions in grant relief to the very small businesses Culp is falsely accusing him of stealing from.
But Culp has proven that reality doesn’t matter to him \-- what else do you expect from an anti-vaxxer who’s spread conspiracy theories about mail-in voting and once compared himself to Rosa Parks for his refusal to enforce voter-approved gun safety laws?
The problem is, this is a tactic we’ve seen Republicans use to win: accuse Democrats of spending too much, repeat lie after lie about that money coming from families instead of the big corporations, and claim we run the economy into the ground (even though it’s Republicans that have presided over the last two global financial cataclysms).
Right now it’s a tactic that’s working \-- largely because Culp’s supporters aren’t exposed to any other information. (Culp prefers right-wing talk radio to mainstream outlets and likes to organize in private Facebook groups where nothing but his propaganda is ever shared.)
We MUST get the facts out. We CANNOT let Culp smear Gov. Inslee with impunity, because the effect of this misinformation isn’t just limited to the Governor’s race \-- it will have impacts for all our candidates up and down the ballot. The good news is that the facts are on our side -- but that will mean NOTHING if we don’t share them with the voters who matter.
Every time Culp tells a lie \-- especially one this potentially damaging \-- we must immediately increase our investments in our voter outreach budget, particularly to rural Washingtonians who are being targeted the most by Culp and the WA GOP with this misinformation.
But right now, we can’t do that, because we’re falling incredibly short of our online fundraising goals.
As Election Day gets closer, our goals get bigger \-- because we know if we don’t reach our rural voters with the truth, then Culp’s lies will go unchecked. This misinformation strategy could make him governor \-- and we’ll be forced to watch as he destroys our public schools, drains our natural resources dry, and leaves our state completely exposed to not only the current pandemic but to whichever crisis comes next. He won’t have Governor Inslee to blame any more \-- but by then, it will be too late.
Please, as one of our most loyal supporters, you’re the only way we can increase our voter outreach and stop Culp and the dangerous misinformation being echoed by down-ballot WA GOPers.
We MUST raise $3,250 before midnight. We CANNOT allow Culp and his down-ballot GOP allies to keep spreading misinformation unchecked -- but direct voter outreach is the only tool we have to overcome their lies. Please, if you want a pathway toward a healthy economic recovery -- not the dark road of the GOP’s deception -- chip in what you can now to help us inform voters of the stakes of this election. The future of our state is at risk.
Thank you for stepping up to defend it.

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,"We must protect our students, now","Hi Alex,
We reached out just a few days ago about the threat facing our public education system.
Current Superintendent of Public Instruction Chris Reykdal, the progressive leader who’s fought to close the achievement gap in our schools, increased salaries and benefits for our educators, and set new records in graduation rates and scholastic achievement in Washington, is up for re-election.
His opponent, Maia Espinoza, wants to defund public schools. She’s proposed a sweeping, 20% across-the-board spending cut \-- that’s $2.5 billion stolen from the next generation. She’s an acolyte of Donald Trump and Betsy DeVos and has found common cause with the 3% militia, the far-right paramilitary group hanging her campaign signs at their rallies.
Though Reykdal has our support, Espinoza is outraising and outspending him. She’s resorted to disgusting and false personal attacks against him because he supports comprehensive sex education. If she succeeds, our students and teachers will lose a staunch ally in Olympia.
Even worse, GOP down-ballot candidates are capitalizing on Espinoza’s misinformation to copy her smears against Reykdal in close races against our Democratic leaders who voted to ensure every Washington student has the opportunity for evidence-based sexual health education. We cannot let their lies go unchallenged.
Imagine if Donald Trump or Loren Culp were in charge of our schools -- that’s what we’d get with Maia Espinoza. We’re sticking up for Chris Reykdal and champions of evidence-based education up and down the ballot before it’s too late, and asking for your support in doing the same. Please, give what you can to support Democrats like Reykdal this election -- an entire generation of Washington students’ education depends on it.
Thank you for saving our schools from the GOP.

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,Here’s what we need to do,"Hi Alex!
Earlier today, Tina reached out to you personally about our February 2020 budget \-- when she wrote, we were falling behind target.
We wish we didn’t have to share this news with you, but we are still VERY short of our benchmark to fully fund our Rise & Organize program.
Missing our fundraising benchmarks at a time when all statewide elected officials are too focused on passing progressive policies to fundraise on their own will severely impact our voter turnout efforts \-- and right now, the far-right GOP challengers running against our Dems have the advantage.
If we’re going to defeat Trump and his GOP apologists up and down the ballot here in WA, we MUST lay the groundwork early for a winning Democratic strategy from Snohomish County to Spokane Valley.
That means we cannot afford to miss our goals \-- and without your contributions to our efforts, we will have to scale back on our coordinated campaign efforts right when we should be ramping up.
While the fundraising freeze is in effect, it’s up to us to continue building for our Democratic leaders.
That’s why we are counting on you to give just $25 or whatever you can to help us get back on track today.
If we can raise another $8,450, we’ll be back on track. Can you please rush us an emergency contribution immediately? Here’s the link: [[URL REDACTED]]

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,A hundred-year-old promise,"Washington State Democrats honor the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment and women’s right to vote.
Alex,
On August 26, 1920, the 19th Amendment was formally certified, granting women the right to cast their ballots for their elected representatives across the United States. Although this milestone is to be celebrated, there is a truth we must recognize:
Women of color were left out of this victory. In fact, their suffrage battle wasn’t alleviated for another 45 years -- and they still face higher barriers to voting, even when the right to vote isn’t under direct attack from the president.
Yet Black women, indigenous women, and other women of color are leading the charge toward a new reality that lives up to that century-old promise. They consistently carry Democrats to victory with high voter turnout, despite the obstacles. And this year, one hundred years after the 19th Amendment, a woman of color is on track to become vice president of the United States of America, but only if we put in the work today to make sure she gets there.
We have come a long way, but we have much further to go, together. Across the nation and in our great state.
We need leaders like Carolina Mejia, a naturalized American citizen originally from Honduras and community advocate who, if she wins, would be one of the few women of color serving in a county seat in our entire state.
And we need allies for women of color like Gael Tarleton, who will put our election security and integrity first, because protecting the right to vote should not come as an afterthought during a Secretary of State’s re-election campaign.
We give our deepest thanks to the women who have helped our country get to where we are today. But now we must focus on the work ahead and support those who will carry us across the finish line.
Happy Women’s Equality Day.

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,The consequences of the GOP’s campaigns show up in Salmon Creek,"Hi Alex,
About two weeks ago, a woman named Bethany Rivard, a Democrat who was canvassing for Tanisha Harris in Salmon Creek, was approached by a strange man.
The individual, wearing a gray hoodie and dark sunglasses, proceeded to berate Rivard. He called her a “Nazi,” a “hate-filled little (expletive),” accused her of hating white people, called her “disgusting,” and said she was “peddling terrorism.”
Rivard asked the man to step away. He declined, continuing to forcefully harass Rivard, all without wearing a mask.
Governor Inslee has condemned the man, saying, “No matter who you support politically, no one should be treated like this.” But Republicans have been suspiciously quiet -- after invoking Nazism earlier in the campaign, Loren Culp and Vicki Kraft haven’t made public statements (or denunciations) to their supporters.
Maybe they’re hoping Washingtonians will forget this event, or chalk it up to “one bad apple.” We don’t see it that way -- we see this behavior as a direct result of the GOP’s campaigns, and we want the Republicans in our state to own the conduct of their base voters that they’ve stoked for years. Right now they don’t seem to be taking accountability, though -- will you help them out? Tell us now:
Are Republicans to blame?
YES

Right now, a YouTube video of Trump loyalist Loren Culp is gaining thousands of views online. In the clip, Culp speaks with King 5’s Chris Daniels \-- and invokes some very troubling history in order to explain his philosophies.
Gun reform, Culp says, is a bit like the Japanese-American internment during World War II: they’re both things Democrats decided “needed to be done for our safety.”
Alex, just a few short weeks ago, Republican state Rep. Vicki Kraft compared Governor Inslee to Hitler over our state’s stay-at-home orders. Now, Culp is embracing a similar message on a wider platform. This is how the WA GOP is trying to win their races -- make bad-faith, misleading comparisons to the worst moments in world history and hope voters fall for it.
It’s disconcerting to see a man like Culp sitting calmly in a cafe, having a drink and heaping blame on Democrats for everything from looting to systemic racism in policing to our raging wildfires. It’s even more disturbing that no one in the video is refuting Culp’s claims \-- instead, Culp is speaking freely, addressing voters across the state while mood music plays in the background.

Sometimes I find myself worrying about reaching our fundraising goals to power our state-of-the-art organizing efforts in Washington state.

I thought we weren’t going to have what it takes to reach millions more voters to encourage them to vote. And I was worried that the far-right leaders in our state would gain more ground against our Washington Democrats. Thankfully, our state party is strong because it's made up of THOUSANDS of dedicated people who see the stakes ahead of us, share our vision for the future, and are ready to work toward that goal.

I want you to know how proud I am of this team and how grateful I am that you are with us in this fight to reclaim our democracy, advocate for better health care and a solution to the climate crisis, and ensure that our state continues to lead the way on making progressive policies a reality.

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,This doesn’t look good,"Hi Alex,
From now through Spring 2020, members of our state’s delegation are in a legislative session fundraising freeze. That means while our Democratic incumbents cannot accept any campaign contributions during this period, their far-right Republican challengers can continue raising and attacking our Democratic leaders.
Trump and GOP are running a strategy to send us back decades with their dangerous, extremist ideology. They’ve separated immigrant families and locked kids in cages, instituted the Muslim ban, and proposed the idea of putting a moat along the border wall filled with snakes and alligators and shooting immigrants crossing the border \-- and Alex, this list goes on.
Washington State and the Washington Democrats are leading the resistance and fighting for our rights to affordable and adequate healthcare, reproductive freedom, seek asylum, and clean water and air.
But now that our candidates are in the first full week of the fundraising freeze, Republicans have the advantage. And here at the WA Dems, we’re falling very short of our December fundraising goal.
We need to raise $8,630 before tomorrow at midnight so we can fight back against the incoming GOP attacks during the freeze.
If you care about keeping AG Bob Ferguson, Gov. Jay Inslee, and your local Democratic leaders in office after 2020, we need you to contribute $25, $50, $100, or whatever you can at the link right now to stop Republicans from rolling back our progress: [[URL REDACTED]]

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,our Rise & Organize budget,"Hi Alex!
March is a big month in Washington state. Our presidential primary election is in just FOUR days, the fundraising freeze is still in effect, and we have our quarterly filing deadline at the end of the month.
Right now, our WA Dems like Gov. Jay Inslee and AG Bob Ferguson are leading the progressive fight to keep our country moving forward, but the fundraising freeze is stopping them from fundraising until the spring.
In that time, the Republicans running against them and our down-ballot Democratic leaders are raking in cash like mad. We know they’re calling their dark money groups to raise the money they need to try and unseat our Dems \-- but we can’t let that happen.
That’s why we’re asking for your support for our Rise & Organize program \-- a coordinated effort that puts field organizers on the ground in communities all across the district to ensure Democrats vote. By April, we’ll have launched the program in all 39 counties, but right now, we are still VERY short of our end-of-week benchmark to fully fund our Rise & Organize program.
If we fall short now, it will directly impact our voter turnout efforts in the districts we need to win.
While our statewide elected officials are focusing on passing progressive policies and their far-right GOP challengers have the advantage, we need your help to step up BIG time.
We can’t afford to miss our goals if we’re going to lay the groundwork early for a winning Democratic strategy. Without your contributions to our efforts today, we will have to scale back on our coordinated campaign immediately.
It’s up to us to continue building for our Democratic leaders.
Today we are asking you to pitch in just $25 or whatever you can to help us get back on track before midnight. Please, will you rush us an emergency contribution immediately?
Thanks for all that you do.

To share a bit of good news on Earth Day, Newsweek recently reported that social distancing has had “a major impact on the environment, with reduced CO2 levels, better air quality, and animals roaming in the streets.”
We know that the climate crisis wreaking havoc across Washington state and our country was a serious problem before this pandemic, and we know it will be here after. That’s one of the reasons we’re working so hard to address our current challenges while remembering the critical fights that are still ahead of us.
Today, on the 50th anniversary of Earth Day, we wanted to check in with you about your commitment to protecting our planet for future generations. Please let us know:
Is the climate crisis one of your top priorities?
YES
NO
Thank you for your input. We look forward to hearing from you.

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,Republicans have set their sights on our reproductive rights,"Hi Alex,
Justice Ginsburg’s passing means that Americans’ reproductive rights \-- and our access to affordable health care across the board \-- are more threatened by the Republican Party than ever before.
We’ve seen GOPers move against a woman’s right to choose in our own state legislature. Disgraced Republican Rep. Matt Shea \-- joined by his co-sponsors, Reps. Vicki Kraft and Jesse Young \-- introduced a bill to outlaw abortion all across our state. The bill itself was illegitimate, as WA has a constitutional amendment protecting a woman’s right to choose. But the rules have never stopped the Republicans from trying to trample on our rights before.
This November, we can replace the state reps who are trying to strip away Washingtonians’ reproductive rights with Democrats who will fight for health care in all its forms. The recent Supreme Court vacancy has galvanized progressives in our state and across the country \-- and we’re on the cusp of seeing unprecedented gains at the state and federal level in 2020.
But Republicans are rallying together, too. They’re going to do everything they can to confirm Donald Trump’s Supreme Court nominee before the election \-- and if they can’t, they’re going to use the open seat as a way to fire up their base and smash turnout records in November. Our health care, our reproductive freedoms, and Justice Ginsburg’s legacy could all pay the price \-- unless we match their mobilization.
At a time when we need to be ramping up our GOTV efforts to push back against this unexpected groundswell of GOP enthusiasm, we’re falling critically short of our end-of-quarter fundraising goal. This is our last FEC deadline before the election, and it will be a key indicator of how strong we are as we go into the fight of our lives. Right now, we’re $6,481 short.
We know you support the right to choose. You support affordable health care for all. You support representatives who play by the rules \-- and you want a Supreme Court that’s fair, balanced, and impartial.
We need your help electing and protecting the leaders who are going to fight for those ideals, now more than ever. Please give whatever you can now to help us hit our end-of-quarter goal. Help us show the Republicans in Washington and in D.C. that their actions have consequences -- and help us stand up for the safety of our citizens and the future of this country.
Thank you so much for standing with us at this historic moment.
Your support makes all the difference.

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,"Thank you, Gov. Inslee","Hi Alex,
We wanted to check in with you today about the leadership Governor Jay Inslee has shown in the past several weeks.
Washington state was the first in the country to identify and confirm COVID-19 clusters back in February. Our government and public health officials under Gov. Inslee’s leadership immediately got to work to contain the outbreak.
Not only did Gov. Inslee begin holding regular briefings to keep us informed, but he also ensured testing began early across our state. He communicated the gravity of the situation when he asked us to stay home, and then when he required us to do so. Washington also implemented a command center to organize the response \-- directly impacting our containment of the virus and saving thousands of lives in the process.
And throughout this public health response, Governor Inslee worked with our Democratic leaders in Olympia to take emergency measures to help working people and small business owners in our state: passing $200 million in emergency aid, instituting a statewide ban on evictions for failure to pay rent, making emergency loans available to our neighborhood shops and small businesses, and making sure students who rely on schools for nutrition can still get food while their school is closed.
Washington state is now successfully flattening the curve, but we’ve still got work to do.
Jay Inslee has demonstrated what leadership in our country should look like. We’re thankful to have him working for families across the state and doing the work that will drive our country forward. Today, we want to hear from you:
Do you approve of Gov. Jay Inslee?
YES
NO

WA Democrats,info@wa-democrats.org,Today’s SCOTUS abortion hearing,"Morning Alex\--
Today, the Supreme Court will hear the first case on abortion since Trump appointees Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh have been on the courts. The outcome of today’s hearing on June Medical v. Russo will determine the constitutionality of a Louisiana law \-- one that is nearly identical to a case that was rejected four years ago.
The Louisiana law requires doctors who perform abortions to gain admitting privileges at nearby hospitals, but many of the state’s hospitals oppose abortion or fear the impending public outlash they would face for allowing doctor’s privileges. This attack on abortion rights could lead to a lack of access to reproductive freedom in Louisiana and open the door for a flood of anti-abortion regulations in the months to come.
Before the hearing, we’re polling engaged voters in Washington State to see where you stand on reproductive freedom. Will you please let us know:
Are you a pro-choice Democrat?
YES NO
We appreciate your participation in today’s poll of Washingtonians.
Thanks,

Way back in March, Attorney General Bob Ferguson informed Washingtonians that he’d have an emergency lawsuit ready if Trump tried to delay the election. WA GOP Chair Caleb Heimlich called Ferguson’s warning a “scam,” and demanded he apologize.
A tweet from @realDonaldTrump reads “With Universal Mail-In Voting \(not Absentee Voting, which is good\), 2020 will be the most INACCURATE & FRAUDULENT Election in history. It will be a great embarrassment to the USA. Delay the Election until people can properly, securely, and safely vote???""
Source: Twitter
Who should apologize now?
In Ferguson’s own words, “We don't wait for something bad to happen, we anticipate what [Trump is] going to do, and try to prepare.” We’re glad we have an AG who’s two steps ahead of the GOP.

Now, Trump has signed an executive order suspending immigration for at least 60 days. This is just another racist and xenophobic distraction made by Trump \-- and it’s just one of the reasons we're fighting back to ensure he doesn’t serve a second term.

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,Culp's effort to take our state,"Hi Alex,
In the middle of a pandemic, the GOP wants to send an anti-vaxxer to the Governor’s Office.
In the middle of historic civil unrest and racial injustice, the GOP nominated a candidate propelled to fame by right-wing militias and accused domestic terrorists.
And in the middle of unprecedented threats to our frontline workers, Culp has told us all that we can take our masks and “do you-know-what with it.”
We never thought Trump would succeed President Obama, until it happened. And we never thought a Trump clone like Culp could succeed Governor Inslee \-- but if we don’t work like hell to stop him, that’s exactly what will happen next.
What’s more, Culp’s complete lack of conscience gives him an unfortunate campaign advantage. He’s holding in-person rallies and using them to spur direct contact with unlikely rural voters, just like Trump did in 2016. Because we care about science \-- and the lives of our voters \-- we can’t and won’t do the same. If we don’t want him to crush us the same way he crushed his vastly more qualified Republican primary opponents, we must act now to organize our voters remotely.
Our volunteers and Coordinated Campaign staff have been fighting night and day to elect and protect Democrats all across the state. We’re working tirelessly on our virtual voter outreach \-- and have made thousands of phone calls and text messages to exactly the people we need to reach.
But right now, we’re VERY short of fully funding our virtual voter outreach program, and if we don’t raise another $2,955 before midnight, we’ll have to scale back our efforts to defeat Culp and re-elect Governor Jay Inslee in November.
But we can’t get there without you.
This time next year, we could have a governor who doesn’t know how to put on a mask. We cannot allow Culp to take our state from us and put all of our lives at risk. Our Coordinated Campaign is doing all it can to defeat him and advance Democrats up and down the ticket -- but we can’t win without you. Please, to save us from a repeat of 2016, give what you can immediately.
We cannot thank you enough for your support.
You’re the only way we can win.

Local media continues trying to hold Loren Culp accountable for campaign tactics that put our communities’ health at risk, but just like his idol in the White House, Culp refuses to take responsibility. Instead, he “brushed off” concerns from Clark County Health Director Dr. Alan Melnick, saying, “As far as super-spreader, come on. We got less than 1% of the population that’s even affected by this ... This is a virus that has killed less than 1% of our population. Any death is terrible.”
These remarks from Culp are just the latest evidence that he has no grasp of the job of governing our state. Dr. Melnick pointed out the obvious risks involved with Culp’s mask-optional rallies: “When you have a lot of activity, a lot of COVID-19 activity, and you have a large gathering, there’s going to be a good chance that there’s people at these gathering that are contagious with COVID-19.”
But Culp keeps campaigning the way he’ll govern: disregarding the scientific advice of medical experts. That’s why we have to keep organizing to make sure he’s held accountable at the ballot box for his reckless endangerment of our public health, and there’s less than a week left to reach every Washington Democrat and make sure they vote.
Even with just a few days left, we’re constantly fine-tuning our messaging to voters, which is why we’re reaching out for your input. Tell us now:
Do you think our next governor should listen to public health officials?

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,Defeating Trump and his allies is up to us,"Hey Alex,
Look, we cannot rely on this President to lead or Republicans to hold him accountable -- we must do that ourselves.
Instead of addressing rising outbreaks, he is tweeting racist videos of his supporters yelling “white power.” He won’t even wear a mask.
His administration again filed litigation to eliminate the Affordable Care Act, which would eliminate health care coverage for more than 650,000 Washingtonians and threaten tens of thousands of jobs -- in the middle of a pandemic.
Washington Democrats will continue to prioritize beating this virus, helping working families, and beginning our economic recovery. That’s why today, we need to hear from you:

Tina Podlodowski,info@wa-democrats.org,We’re not yet to goal,"Alex,
I want to update you on our progress toward our fundraising goal: we fell short last night. We’re setting aggressive targets because we know the overwhelming defeat we need to deliver to the WA GOP to force them to abandon their anti-science campaigning won’t be easy, and last night we didn’t quite make it.
Alex, it’s more important than ever that we answer the anti-public health, anti-action on the climate crisis, anti-science in general campaign tactics of the WA GOP.
We want to expand our voter outreach as much as we can. We want to reach voters all over the state, in all 39 counties \-- to ensure Republican “alternative facts” haven’t eclipsed the truth, and to get a firm commitment to vote blue from Washingtonians everywhere.
We only need $1,035 more to hit our grassroots goal.
If we’re correct, we haven’t gotten a gift from you yet (If we’re incorrect, I humbly apologize. Thank you for your generosity. Your gift will be recorded as soon as our system has a chance to update \-- and we couldn’t be more grateful to have you on our team.)
But if our records are accurate, I want to give one last chance for you to help us meet our goal, bump up our efforts, and work toward a blue landslide in 2020. Here’s the link to give: [[URL REDACTED]]

This victory will be for you.
Onward!

While our president promotes militarized policing of citizens protesting in the streets, Governor Jay Inslee has listened to the demands of protesters across Washington state.
In a press conference, Gov. Inslee said we must take big strides to ensure our communities crying out for justice are not only heard, but that their demands are met.
Gov. Inslee pledged to work alongside Black leaders and representatives, and other marginalized groups in our state, to help “rethink policing.”
Today, we want to hear from you:
Do we need to rethink policing in Washington state?
YES
NO

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,Culp is out-campaigning us,"Hi Alex,
We wish we were writing a more positive message. Unfortunately, that’s just not where we are right now.
The Republican party has united behind a dangerous, science-denying, radical Trump loyalist named Loren Culp.
It’s easy to see why they chose him. People are scared right now \-- and Culp is promising he’ll make everything alright. Promising that he’ll use Trump’s strongman law-and-order tactics to keep us safe from the civil unrest his own party helped create. Promising that we don’t have to worry about the coronavirus because science is a liberal conspiracy theory and masks are obstacles to our personal freedom.
This is the man who will be your next governor if we don’t stop him.
Right now, Culp is driving across the state, reaching voters we can’t because we’re following social distancing guidelines. He’s meeting frustrated and frightened citizens where they are \-- promising them better lives while we’re stuck campaigning behind a computer screen. He’s out-campaigning us precisely because he doesn’t care about whose health he puts at risk. If he keeps this up, he’ll win.
We’re doing everything we can to keep that from happening. Our Coordinated Campaign to elect and protect Democrats all across the state has already led over 1,000 volunteers in making more than 800,000 phone calls to the Washingtonians we need to reach to stop Culp in his tracks. And we’re mobilizing the coalition we need to win \-- we saw proof of that in the massive voter turnout this primary, which blew 2016’s numbers out of the water.
But Republican turnout could skyrocket too. And right now we’re falling VERY short of our online fundraising goals with less than three months until Election Day.
Please, Alex, we need you now. Right now, we’re $5,632 short and we’re counting on you to make up the difference.
This time next year, we could have a governor who doesn’t know how to put on a mask. We cannot allow Culp to take our state from us and put all of our lives at risk. Our Coordinated Campaign is doing all it can to defeat him, and advance Democrats up and down the ticket -- but we can’t win without you. Please, to save us from a repeat of 2016 happening right here in our state, give what you can immediately.
Thank you for stepping up to protect our state from the GOP’s dangerously misinformed choice for governor. We’re so grateful for all contributions and all the volunteer work you’ve given us already \-- it’s gotten us where we are today.
Thank you for helping us prevent Governor Culp.

Our Democratic AG Bob Ferguson has won a monumental victory.
A federal judge just granted Ferguson’s request to force USPS to stop the destructive changes designed to swing the election. Effective immediately, postal trucks will no longer be allowed to leave mail behind. All election mail will be treated as First Class. And removed mail-sorting machines will be reinstated. In Ferguson’s own words: “Americans can now confidently vote by mail and have their voices heard.”
We couldn’t be more proud. It just goes to show what when we stand behind our Democratic leaders, they stand up for us. Thank you, AG Ferguson. You’re a national hero.
If you’d like to join us in congratulating our AG, now’s your chance. We want a 100% approval rating for the man who just ensured that 100% of our votes will count in November. Tell us now:

Right now, we’ve got all hands on deck to make sure we raise the last $5,250 more before midnight that will keep our volunteer training programs, virtual town halls, and 2020 organizing efforts funded. We need leaders who will follow the science, fight for better access to health care, and protect voting rights access. But too many WA GOPers like State Rep. Matt Shea are fueling partisan fury instead of doing their part to bring people together. GOP members and candidates for office remain in lockstep with Donald Trump \-- whose continued failed, chaotic leadership in Washington D.C. has only made the choice this November even starker here in Washington state.
We’re running the strategy to expand the battleground map in our state legislature and working to build on our historic wins in 2018. But our team needs your help to help us compete in every race and every place this November \-- and falling short now will directly impact our organizing reach.

Tina Podlodowski,info@wa-democrats.org,Trump is attacking voting rights,"Hi Alex,
Trump and his GOP cronies are executing a massive voter suppression campaign. After seeing the damage they did in Wisconsin, it’s clear our democracy is under attack.
Recently, Trump called the vote by mail process in Nevada “a great Voter Fraud scenario” and threatened to “hold up funding” should the state move forward in issuing absentee ballots. These outbursts aren't random though \-- right now, presidential polls show him trailing his Democratic challenger.
National Republicans know that when we make it easier to vote, more Democrats turn out. That’s why Trump allies like Washington state’s own Secretary of State Kim Wyman (our chief elections officer) and GOP incumbents have failed to condemn Trump’s attack on voting rights.
This year, we’re putting it all on the line to ensure Democrats have sweeping victories across Washington state. We’re investing heavily in our voter contact strategies to expand access to the ballot box to take on Republican incumbents like Kim Wyman.
We need a leader in the Secretary of State’s office like Gael Tarleton, who will put our election security and integrity first, because protecting the vote should not come as an afterthought or only during a re-election campaign.
Today, I am asking you personally to join me in ensuring the Washington Dems coordinated campaign is fully funded so we can elect Democrats like Gael Tarleton by making your first contribution of $5, $10, $25, or whatever you can to become a member of the WA Dems now.
We need to raise $3,600 TODAY. Counting on you, Alex! Here’s the link to give: [[URL REDACTED]]

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,WaPo: “Postal Service workers quietly resist DeJoy’s changes with eye on election”,"Hi Alex,
US Postal Service employees have been working under harsh conditions for decades \-- and new reporting from Vice reveals that reality hasn’t changed. It’s still “an authoritarian, top-down organization in which policy is set by higher-ups who have often never done the work of sorting and delivering mail.”
Trump’s new Postmaster General Louis DeJoy is not making conditions any better, for workers or for the millions of Americans who rely on the US Postal Service for medication and other necessities.
Through anonymous interviews with employees, the Washington Post has confirmed that postal workers are “quietly” resisting DeJoy’s draconian rule. They’re fighting for our democracy, working tirelessly to make sure all Americans are able to exercise their right to vote. But Trump has been doing everything he can to cast doubt on the integrity of the election by refusing to fund the USPS in their time of need, and spewing lies about the legitimacy of mail-in voting.
Alex, now is the time to stand in solidarity with the postal workers who, at this very moment, are hard at work delivering ballots and making sure we have a functioning democracy. We need to hear from Washingtonians right now:
Do you support the United States Postal Service?

Way back in March, Attorney General Bob Ferguson informed Washingtonians that he’d have an emergency lawsuit ready if Trump tried to delay the election. WA GOP Chair Caleb Heimlich called Ferguson’s warning a “scam,” and demanded he apologize.
A tweet from @realDonaldTrump reads “With Universal Mail-In Voting \(not Absentee Voting, which is good\), 2020 will be the most INACCURATE & FRAUDULENT Election in history. It will be a great embarrassment to the USA. Delay the Election until people can properly, securely and safely vote???""
Source: Twitter
Who should apologize now?
In Ferguson’s own words, “We don't wait for something bad to happen, we anticipate what [Trump is] going to do, and try to prepare.” We’re glad we have an AG who’s two steps ahead of the GOP.

At the end of last week, statewide turnout was up to 37.7% (or 1,825,689 ballots in). That means only 3,061,734 to go \-- 4 days. Our voter turnout strategies are working, and our volunteers are making THOUSANDS of calls a day.

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,Loren Culp thinks he’s above Washingtonians and the law,"Hi Alex,
In its recent profile of Loren Culp, the Seattle Times highlighted just how dangerously unfit he is to serve.
Culp sees himself as knowing better than WA voters, opposing a gun safety measure supported by 59% of the electorate. He also thinks he knows better than the court system, absurdly declaring that “lawyers and judges don’t know the U.S. Constitution because it is not routinely taught in law schools.”
Finally, Culp thinks he knows better than the millions of Americans who’ve recently decried systemic racism in law enforcement, denying it’s a problem and saying of Jacob Blake: “I would have shot that person.”
There you have it: Culp is unquestionably an egomaniac who views himself as judge, jury, and executioner of the law. But he’s routinely drawing hundreds of enthusiastic supporters to his in-person rallies, and just got a massive amount of press from his feature in the Times. We need to make sure Washingtonians know just how dangerous Culp really is, and that starts with sending an unmistakable message. So please, if you want to make your views on Culp known, tell us now:
Do you approve of Loren Culp?
YES
NO
Thanks for making your voice heard.

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,Trump calls Dr. Fauci “a little bit of an alarmist”,"Hi Alex,
At Donald Trump’s first coronavirus briefing in MONTHS, the president failed to extend an invite to our nation’s leading expert in infectious diseases. Trump didn’t even consult Dr. Fauci before stepping in front of the press to speak about the state of the outbreak.
During the briefing, Trump stated that the outbreak “will probably unfortunately get worse before it gets better.”
Dr. Fauci has continued to reinforce his position that wearing masks, remaining physically distant, and closing bars will be key to containing the spread of the virus.
But still, the president and his top aides are trying to discredit Dr. Fauci, calling him “a leaker” and “a little bit of an alarmist.” Today, we need to hear from you on your support of this public health expert:
Do you approve of Dr. Anthony Fauci?
YES
NO

Tina Podlodowski,info@wa-democrats.org,Wouldn’t ask you if this weren’t so important,"Alex,
In 2020, we have the chance to send a bold message that we won’t tolerate any racist ideology in Washington.
Members of our state’s delegation are barred from fundraising from now through to the spring \-- their GOP challengers, however, will rake in thousands from corporate PACs and big national Republican donors during this time. So it’s up to us to continue building for our Democratic leaders.
But right now, we’re still behind our December fundraising goal.
That’s why I am counting on you to give just $1 or whatever you can to help us get back on track today so we can head into 2020 strong. Your support ahead of Tuesday night’s FEC quarterly deadline is the only thing standing between us and Trump and his GOP cronies growing their power in Washington State.
We have $8,390 left to raise if we’re going to preserve equality, integrity, and other Washington values. Will you donate even just $1 at the link below right now?

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,The future of policing,"Hi Alex,
Democrats are working hard to make police reform a top priority in 2021, with State Senator Jamie Pedersen putting the finishing touches on legislation that will, in his words, “make sure that officers who have misused their authority in various ways can be removed from service.”
But Republicans are denying any need for change inside law enforcement \-- with GOP gubernatorial candidate Loren Culp recently commending police officers for policing themselves and confirming he does not support any current police reform proposals.
Gov. Inslee has pledged to work alongside Black leaders and representatives, and other underrepresented communities in our state, to help “rethink policing.” But it’s clear there’s a stark difference in vision between the two parties, which is why we’re reaching out to you now:
Do we need to rethink policing in Washington state?
YES
NO

Earlier today we shared with you our ultimate goal for this election: to make the WA GOP history.
They deserve it. They’ve put lives at risk during the pandemic, stoked violent hate speech and far-right aggression, and stood by the shameful despot in the White House every step of the way.
We’re on track to win \-- but we want more. We want a landslide unlike anything our state or our country has ever seen, but we’re definitely not on track for that right now. The truth is, some of our down-ballot candidates still aren’t where we need them to be.
Help us fix that now. Help us hit our grassroots fundraising goal and show the Republican Party that we don’t tolerate their radical anti-science campaign tactics in our state. Not anymore.
We’re asking you because you’re one of the most engaged, informed, involved voters we have. If you don’t help us bridge the gap between a slight win and an absolute landslide, no one else will. Please, give now, and kick the GOP out of WA for good.
Thank you, Alex. We could not be more proud to be on a team with you.

The team emailed you this morning, but I wanted to personally check back in with you. The legislative fundraising freeze is coming to an end soon in Washington state, and right now, Republican challengers are running MAJOR fundraising pushes so they can defeat our Dems this November. But since the team wrote, I don’t think I received a notification about your contribution to help us hit our weekly goal to fund our Rise & Organize training and bootcamps. Is that right?
If you have given today: AMAZING. We so appreciate your help ahead of this one. (And apologies for missing our system’s notification.) Our statewide organizing efforts are well underway \-- and we’re putting resources directly into all 39 counties by April. (Next month!!)
Stopping Trump and his far-right supporters across the state will be tough \-- but our Rise & Organize program is how we swept the state in 2018. We need to replicate and build on that strategy, but we can’t do it without you.
Please, if you haven’t pitched in to help us defeat Donald Trump and his cronies yet, I need your help to ensure we don’t have to make ANY changes to our voter turnout operation or our timeline. I DO NOT want to have to push this back into May.
Right now, we’re $2,410 short of tonight’s goal. Can I count on you to step up with a contribution to help us close the gap at the link below?

Will Casey,info@wa-democrats.org,"We’ve got work to do, Alex","I know Tina wrote you earlier, but I need to check in again. In the past couple of weeks, the president has lost twice at the Supreme Court attempting to strip away the rights of DREAMers and LGBTQ+ Americans, attacked vote by mail and any GOPers who would distance themselves from his brand, and had his ads removed from Facebook for using Nazi symbols.
His ex-National Security Advisor accused him of using his office for political gain, including supporting foreign leaders who build concentration camps and execute journalists. Trump and his administration are rotten to their core \-- and Washington Republicans have shown over and over again that they’ll stand by him no matter what he does.
But look, with Facebook and Google refusing to follow our state’s campaign finance laws, our state legislative candidates can’t use the most cost-effective methods to get their message out online. That puts the WA Dems and ALL of our candidates taking on Trump’s lackeys in our state in a tough spot.
If we’re going to stop Trump, we have to ensure our Coordinated Campaign has a robust budget to get out the vote \-- without the ability to advertise on digital, our down-ballot candidates need our Virtual Volunteer army making calls to voters more than ever. Right now, we’re STILL $980 short of this week’s goal.
We can’t let the GOP get ahead of our efforts to move our nation forward. Can we count on you to help us out-communicate and out-work the WA GOPers running to stop our progress?

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,Fact must beat fiction,"Hi Alex,
As the entire west coast reels from the impact of the ongoing cataclysm of fires that has gripped our country, voters are faced with a stark choice.
They can back Democrats like Governor Inslee, who has been a national leader on climate policy his entire career: putting WA on track to be carbon neutral by 2030, giving us the cleanest energy grid in the United States, and protecting our public lands from pollution and our wildlife from extinction.
Or they can back Republicans like Loren Culp, the man who wants to take a hatchet to our Department of Ecology, seize control of our Department of Fish and Wildlife, and treat scientific expertise on the climate crisis the same way he’s treated medical advice on the pandemic: ignore it entirely.
We’ve been fighting for Democrats up and down the ballot ever since this election cycle began. We achieved historic turnout in our primary. We now have a chance to solidify our gains: elect our candidates, advance progressive policy, and accomplish everything we’ve worked so hard for.
But Republicans have turned to anti-science conspiracy theories in order to distract from their failed agenda and further divide our state. They’ve opposed public health guidelines, denied the climate crisis, and backed Donald Trump on just about everything.
Fact must beat fiction. Progress must triumph over fear. And Republicans must not be allowed to govern the way they’ve campaigned \-- with no regard for the safety of our citizens.
Thank you so much for your support yesterday \-- we’re that much closer to our fundraising goal for the week because of you. But we’re not there yet \-- we need another $5,216 before midnight if we want to be in a prime position to dominate the homestretch of this campaign.
We must crush the GOP in no uncertain terms and take WA into a bright future built on the solid foundation of science and progressive values.
If you want to see a huge win for the WA Dems in November -- and a huge victory for the voices of reason in this campaign -- please give what you can now to help us hit our goal, expand our GOTV operations, and lock down a blue supermajority in November. The future of our state is in your hands.
We’re incredibly grateful for the way you’re protecting it.

I wanted to follow up on my emails from this week about last night’s fundraising goal.
I’m disappointed to let you know that we fell short of our goal by $1,310.
After speaking with the team to review our options for the month ahead, I thought I would reach out to you one more time to ask for your support before we have to make some changes to our strategy.
If we can make up the difference this morning, we can get ourselves back on track to stop Trump and his science-denying cronies across WA state, because frankly, we cannot afford to pull back on our voter turnout plans with so much at stake.
We can make up the difference if you step up today. Our records \-- and please, excuse our data pulling mishap if this isn’t correct \-- show that you didn’t pitch in before last night’s goal. If that’s an error on our system’s part and you already gave, thank you so much for keeping the WA Dems strong. I am so thankful to have you on this team.
But if our records are correct, please, make your first contribution at this link now: [[URL REDACTED]]

December is a powerfully important month for us, but it’s also quite busy.
With the state legislative fundraising freeze in place, the holidays next week, and the FEC filing deadline in 11 days, the Washington Dems are committed to electing leaders who will fight Trump’s dangerous agenda and keep our state safe from the corruption, racism, and greed this administration has normalized.
The far-right extremists in our state have laid out a “biblical basis for war,” generated violent and hateful rhetoric against Muslims, and outlined their plans to create a new 51st state by breaking Washington in half.
We must keep Democrats serving at all levels of our state’s government, and today I am writing to ask you to support WA Dems in their efforts to elect even more Democrats in 2020.
But Tina told me that the resources for their key Rise and Organize grassroots training program are low \-- and she’s worried they won’t have what it takes to elect progressives across the board. That’s why I’m asking you to join me in protecting vulnerable Democrats and advancing our shared progressive values by making a grassroots contribution today.
Will you give $25, $50, $100, or whatever you can to support the WA Dems Rise and Organize program to train thousands of Democratic activists across our state?

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,In gratitude to our frontline workers,"Alex,
Today, we honor and thank the millions of frontline workers who have kept our country and state running during the nation’s largest public health crisis.
Frontline workers throughout Washington state have worked tirelessly for months and continuously put themselves at risk to ensure we can maintain access to essentials like food, education, and health care.
Governor Jay Inslee knows that frontline workers are disproportionately at risk of contracting the coronavirus, and he’s taken necessary steps to protect essential workers across the state \-- providing over $3 million in relief to agricultural workers in central and eastern Washington, increasing access to COVID-19 testing, and issuing strict public health guidelines for students as they return to school.
But Loren Culp doesn’t think these measures are necessary. He says, “When we go back and look at the statistics, less than 1% of people die,” Culp said. “We need to get this economy open.” By that logic, he must think the lives of over 70,000 Washington residents are dispensable.
But the fight to keep our frontline workers safe is about more than the policies put in place by our political leaders. We’ve seen in our state that when workers are able to come together and organize in a union to fight for their rights, not only do they get better wages and benefits \-- they are able to fight for the workplace safety precautions necessary to keep themselves and their communities healthy during this pandemic.
Back in April, we saw this play out in real time as two meatpacking plants a mere fifteen miles apart experienced dramatically different reactions to COVID-19 from management. The unionized plant was immediately shut down until proper precautions like bringing nurses on-site and instituting daily temperature screenings could be put in place. Unionized workers fought and won ample PPE for themselves and paid time off for anyone who contracted COVID-19 despite these precautions.
The other plant, whose workers weren’t unionized? It became an early hotspot of coronavirus infection in Eastern Washington, with 101 confirmed cases in April. Even worse, one of the non-unionized workers lost his life to COVID-19.
As we continue this fight for the soul of our nation in the last two months before the election, remember that it’s not just who wins and loses at the ballot box that we’re fighting for. As proud union members ourselves at the WA Dems, we’re fighting for the rights of every working Washingtonian to earn a family wage and be treated with respect and dignity in the workplace.
Thanks for being in this fight with us,

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,Michelle Obama steps into the 2020 election,"Hi Alex,
Michelle Obama has stepped into the 2020 election.
The former First Lady launched “Civic Cities,” a bipartisan program designed to combat rampant voter suppression by collaborating with 31 mayors across the country to increase voter registration and civic engagement in their cities.
Michelle Obama’s efforts couldn’t have started at a better time, as Trump and his GOP cronies are executing a MASSIVE voter suppression campaign.
Trump has called the vote by mail process “a great Voter Fraud scenario” and threatened to “hold up funding” should states move forward in issuing absentee ballots.
These outbursts aren’t random though \-- right now, presidential polls show him trailing his Democratic challenger. And the fact is national Republicans know that when we make it easier to vote, more Democrats turn out.
That’s why Trump allies like Washington state’s own Secretary of State Kim Wyman (our chief elections officer) and GOP incumbents have failed to condemn Trump’s attack on voting rights.
Today we’re conducting a survey to gauge your support of Michelle Obama and her plans to stop voter suppression ahead of this year’s election. Please, let us know:
Do you support Michelle Obama?
YES
NO
Thank you so much for participating in surveys like this one. Your answers will help inform our 2020 strategies, and we couldn’t run these programs without your insight.

Donald Trump thinks the USPS is a “joke,” and now, he and his GOP cronies are fighting to put an end to this beloved government agency as soon as September.
We’re enraged but not surprised by the president’s attacks on the postal service \-- especially when you consider that millions of Americans will rely on the USPS to vote-by-mail in this November’s election.
At the Washington Dems, we are strong advocates for national vote-by-mail. We know that implementing a vote-by-mail process has made our elections in Washington freer and more accessible \-- and it helped secure record-high turnout in our presidential primary earlier this year.
But while we’re working with other state party leaders across the country, Trump has continued to reject a USPS bailout that would have a severe impact on our vote-by-mail process and hurt our families in rural and low-income communities.
Today, we’re collecting signatures on our petition to save the USPS \-- and we need you to step up and use your voice today. Sign on IMMEDIATELY to tell Trump and the GOP: Stop threatening the USPS and our postal workers!

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,Five years of Trump,"Hi Alex,
Five years ago, Donald Trump announced his campaign for president and kicked off an era of bitter, divisive, and racist politics that has consumed the Republican Party at every level of government.
After the GOP failed to unite in opposition to Trump and his inflammatory rhetoric in 2016, the Party completely abandoned any shred of principles and fully embraced Trump’s racist ideology \-- and the American people are paying the price. Trump’s obsession with stirring up controversy in an attempt to distract from his incompetence has left Americans less safe, less prosperous, and less confident in our democracy.
Today, we’re conducting a poll to hear from you about some of the things Trump has done in the past five years. Please let us know:

Tina Podlodowski,info@wa-democrats.org,We didn’t make it last night,"Alex,
We wanted to raise $7,500 to support our GOTV efforts \-- and last night we missed our goal, meaning we can’t do everything we’d like to defend the liberal champions in our state legislature and elect the new Democratic leaders we know will fight for a more progressive Washington.
Alex, we’ve seen our state legislative candidates win or lose their races by just a few dozen votes, so every dollar we can invest in getting out the vote for the next month matters. These fundraising goals have a critical impact on the future of our state.
We must talk to voters about why candidates like Gael Tarleton and Carolyn Long will fight for their families instead of special interests. We must push back against the divisive and dishonest campaign tactics of the GOP.
We must raise the $2,606 we still need to hit our goal.
It looks like you haven’t given yet (if you have, you have my most profound thanks \-- your donation will be live in our system as soon as it has a chance to update). But if you haven’t yet contributed, or if you’d like to give again to get us over the finish line, here’s the link: [[URL REDACTED]]
I could not be prouder of your resolve in this crucial moment.
Thank you for fighting for this team when we need you the most.
Onward!

Good news from the Supreme Court. The court did its job to uphold the long-standing precedent that protects a person’s right to abortion access by striking down abortion restrictions in Louisiana.
But as long as Trump and his GOP cronies are in office, our work is far from over. We need to ensure reproductive care is both affordable and accessible for all who seek it.

Tina Podlodowski,info@wa-democrats.org,HOLY MOLY,"Hey Alex! After I wrote yesterday, 31 people STEPPED UP to help us put a dent in this week’s goal to get us back on track. With far-right challengers stepping up to unseat our Democratic incumbents, ensuring our statewide coordinated campaign strategy is fully funded now through November is critical \-- but as I mentioned in my email yesterday, fundraising has been down this month.
With millions of Americans losing health insurance and leaders in the White House and across our state openly ignoring and ridiculing the advice of scientists and public health experts, it’s clear that we need leaders serving our communities that we can trust to make sound and informed decisions.
Right now, we’re still pushing to right our fundraising, but we’re still $12,000 short of tomorrow night’s goal. Will you rush a contribution \-- $25, $10, $5 \-- ANYTHING you can today to help us run the expansive strategies we need to make sure our Rise & Organize program is fully funded?

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,WA GOPer Loren Culp is an atypical candidate,"Hi Alex,
“What we have right here in Washington is a leadership crisis,” Loren Culp said during his opening statement at the first and last gubernatorial debate this election cycle. Culp recounted his military service and how he started a construction business before going into law enforcement, telling voters, “I’ve been in leadership positions for my entire life.”
Loren Culp will continue to debase Gov. Inslee’s character and career until Election Day. And he’ll keep holding rallies that put thousands of Washingtonians at risk, all while falsely propping himself up as a working class hero.
The latest public polling shows these desperate tactics from the Culp campaign aren’t working \-- but we’ve learned our lesson from 2016 to not get complacent when the polling looks good. That’s why we are conducting our own poll to make sure our supporters are backing the governor. PLEASE let us know where you stand, now:

It’s communities like Flint, MI that are and will continue to suffer at disproportionate rates. Exposure to toxins, air pollution caused by fossil fuels, and contaminated drinking water are symptoms of a system that seeks to maintain rampant inequality.

Tina Podlodowski,info@wa-democrats.org,Our GOP Secretary of State Kim Wyman won’t condemn Trump,"Hi Alex,
Trump and his GOP cronies are running a voter disenfranchisement campaign. With voters relying on mail-in voting to make sure their ballots are counted, we need to fight like hell to keep the GOP from suppressing the vote.
The GOP knows that when we make it easier to vote, more Democrats turn out. That’s why Trump allies like Washington state’s own Secretary of State Kim Wyman (our chief elections officer) and GOP incumbents have been silent and have failed to condemn Trump’s attack on voting rights.
This year, we’re putting it all on the line to ensure Democrats have sweeping victories across Washington state. We’re investing heavily in our voter contact strategies to expand access to the ballot box to defeat Republican incumbents like Kim Wyman.
We need leaders serving like Gael Tarleton, who will put our election security and integrity first, because protecting the vote should not come as an afterthought or only during a re-election campaign.
Alex, I am asking you personally to join me in supporting Gael Tarleton and the Washington Dems by making a contribution of $25, $50, $100, or whatever you can ahead of tonight’s mid-month deadline.
We need to raise $5,500 TODAY. Counting on you, Alex! Here’s the link to give: [[URL REDACTED]]

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,Replacing Trump and Pence with Biden and Harris,"Hey Alex,
Joe Biden’s pick for vice president is Kamala Harris \-- a leader with a proven track record of leading based on science, fighting for criminal justice reform, and pushing back against GOP voter suppression.
With both party’s tickets officially decided, we now face a clear choice in November: we’ll either re-elect Trump and Pence or replace them with Biden and Harris.
We’ll either have a government that listens to science or one that punishes its experts for doing their jobs. We’ll either expand the Affordable Care Act or restrict and repeal it. We’ll either take decisive action on climate change, setting ourselves up for a brighter and cleaner energy future \-- or pillage our public lands and resources while the next global crisis looms ever closer.
And looking at the way Trump and the GOP are gearing up to suppress the vote, we know nothing less than a blue wave will do in order to carry our Democratic champions to the White House and carry our best hopes forward for America. That’s why we need the latest data from supporters like you, immediately. Almost a million voters sat on the sidelines in WA in 2016. Will you commit right now to making a stand in the most important election of our lifetimes?
Will you vote Biden/Harris in 2020?
YES
NO
We greatly appreciate your responses today \-- they will help us win the election.

Tina Podlodowski,info@wa-democrats.org,Matt Shea dropped OUT,"Hi Alex,
I know I usually write to you about our fundraising goals, but it’s not often you get to win an election in May.
State Rep. Matt Shea, a far-right Republican (who won his race by 15 points last cycle), has officially dropped out.
This one race has been of particular concern for all of us at the WA Dems. So much so that we’ve made it a goal to stop this domestic terrorist and far-right leader and elect a Democrat, like our friend Lori Feagan who officially filed to take Shea on last week.
While Shea’s exit from the race is cause for celebration, we know that what Shea stands for is much larger than just him. He represents a broader movement in the Republican party \-- one that’s pushing dangerous, extremist ideology throughout our state. From being an ally for white nationalists to promoting a group that trains children for a religious war, these views have no place in Washington state or our government.
Even though Matt Shea won’t be on the ballot this November, those who have protected him for the last three years in Olympia and share his values still are.
It’s up to us to take them out in November and replace them with amazing candidates like Lori Feagan, the woman running for Shea’s seat. Shea’s exit has changed our strategy, and we need to focus on other vulnerable GOP cronies like Jim Walsh, Vicki Kraft, and Jesse Young.
They’ve all propped up Shea and his far-right supporters in different ways:
1. Walsh immediately went to conservative talk radio when the domestic terrorism report dropped and defended Shea despite credible accusations of Shea’s involvement with extremist groups.
2. Kraft flaunted public health orders by taking off her mask at a Shea rally and waving it at Governor Inslee.
3. Young made supporting Matt Shea against credible domestic terrorism accusations the first plank of his “Call for Republican Unity” platform at the kickoff of this year’s legislative session.
We’ve got a lot of hard work ahead of us, Alex. Let’s use this early victory as motivation for the fight ahead. You can join us by making your first contribution of $25, $10, $5, or whatever you can to show you’re with us today: [[URL REDACTED]]

Subject: Nothing happens without organizing
Hi there,
As a lifelong activist, I know that change can’t happen without organizing. And right now, we need bold, transformational change in America.
Our current systems do not work for working people who can’t afford their health care or are working multiple jobs to make ends meet. Our immigration system is broken, leaving refugees and asylum seekers vulnerable to this administration’s zero humanity policies. And we need immediate and bold action on the climate crisis.
But before we can make change, we need to organize and unseat the Republicans in our state who continuously try to block our progress.
We have big choices, big fights, and so much work ahead of us. And it’s up to us to lead the way.
The WA Dems’ coordinated campaign is the kind of powerful organizing that will lead us to a sweeping victory up and down the ticket this November. But with extreme conservatives and white nationalists gaining ground across our state and country, we can’t afford to have any shortfalls this year.
That’s why I’m reaching out today.
I told Tina and the team at WA Dems that I’d help them raise $8,000 TODAY for their Rise & Organize program. And right now, I’m personally asking you to make a contribution to help me hit that goal.
I won’t tell you that your contribution today will enact progressive policies or stop this racist, authoritarian president from separating families and putting kids in cages. But your contribution to the Washington Democrats will help us organize our way to the collective vision we have for our world.
Will you give $25, $50, $100, or whatever you can before midnight? Here’s the link: [[URL REDACTED]]
I’m so glad to be in this fight with you.
In solidarity,

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,"If he keeps this up, he'll win","Hi Alex,
We wish we were writing a more positive message. Unfortunately, that’s just not where we are right now.
The Republican party has united behind a dangerous, science-denying, radical Trump loyalist named Loren Culp.
It’s easy to see why they chose him. People are scared right now \-- and Culp is promising he’ll make everything alright. Promising that he’ll use Trump’s strongman law-and-order tactics to keep us safe from the civil unrest his own party helped create. Promising that we don’t have to worry about the coronavirus because science is a liberal conspiracy theory and masks are obstacles to our personal freedom.
This is the man who will be your next governor if we don’t stop him.
Right now, Culp is driving across the state, reaching voters we can’t because we’re following social distancing guidelines. He’s meeting frustrated and frightened citizens where they are \-- promising them better lives while we’re stuck campaigning behind a computer screen. He’s out-campaigning us precisely because he doesn’t care about whose health he puts at risk. If he keeps this up, he’ll win.
We’re doing everything we can to keep that from happening. Our Coordinated Campaign to elect and protect Democrats all across the state has already led over 1,000 volunteers in making more than 800,000 phone calls to the Washingtonians we need to reach to stop Culp in his tracks. And we’re mobilizing the coalition we need to win \-- we saw proof of that in the massive voter turnout this primary, which blew 2016’s numbers out of the water.
But Republican turnout could skyrocket too. And right now we’re falling VERY short of our online fundraising goals with less than three months until Election Day.
Please, Alex, we need you now. Right now, we’re $5,632 short and we’re counting on you to make up the difference.
This time next year, we could have a governor who doesn’t know how to put on a mask. We cannot allow Culp to take our state from us and put all of our lives at risk. Our Coordinated Campaign is doing all it can to defeat him, and advance Democrats up and down the ticket -- but we can’t win without you. Please, to save us from a repeat of 2016 happening right here in our state, give what you can immediately.
Thank you for stepping up to protect our state from the GOP’s dangerously misinformed choice for governor. We’re so grateful for all contributions and all the volunteer work you’ve given us already \-- it’s gotten us where we are today.
Thank you for helping us prevent Governor Culp.

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,Loren Culp compares Bob Ferguson to an insect,"Hi Alex
“These minuscule lawsuits that he's got about minuscule things, it's ridiculous. He's just like a gnat that won't go away.”
That’s how GOP gubernatorial candidate Loren Culp described our Attorney General, Bob Ferguson, on his propaganda-laden Facebook live show late last month. We know Culp’s schoolyard taunt is as juvenile as it is baseless: AG Ferguson has gone to court to fight against Trump’s travel bans, family separation, and attacks on the Census and the Post Office \-- all worthy battles against an unworthy administration.
In fact, Ferguson’s most recent victory was getting a federal judge to declare Initiative 1639 constitutional \-- the same commonsense gun provision Loren Culp infamously refused to enforce back in 2018.
We’re glad we have an AG who’s two steps ahead of the GOP. But Ferguson’s Republican challengers say he’s politicized his office and deserves to be removed. Do you view sticking up for our democracy as something “miniscule”? Tell us now:
Do you approve of AG Bob Ferguson?

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,Here’s our plan for the future of the WA GOP,"Hi Alex,
We are now ten days away from the election, and Washingtonians have been voting for more than a week already! The race is almost run.
How did the WA GOP choose to run their race? They disregarded public health guidelines, as Loren Culp facilitated the spread of both COVID and ignorance at the scores of packed rallies he held, despite Governor Inslee’s public health countermeasures against the coronavirus.
They compared Democratic leaders to Nazis, compared themselves to Rosa Parks, and flirted with right-wing militias. They refused to call out Donald Trump over his lies about our elections. As Trump refused to condemn white supremacy, they refused to condemn Trump \-- making the WA GOP complicit in feeding the worst aspects of America’s psyche for their own political gain.
We can beat them, Alex. We had historic turnout in our primary. Governor Inslee leads in the polls. Thanks to our GOTV efforts, hundreds of thousands of Washingtonians are energized, activated, and ready to repudiate the despicable agenda of what was once a respectable political party.
But this is no time for half-measures. A narrow win won’t do. We must defeat the GOP so fully and soundly and completely that we redefine what the year 2020 was all about. If we succeed, it won’t be the pandemic, Trump, or the economic collapse that defines this year.
If we hit our goal, 2020 will be the year the Republican Party came to an end.
Sound ambitious? Good. That’s what we do. We set high goals for ourselves and we crush them. But right now, we’re not on track to issue the GOP a total and humiliating collapse. As a matter of fact, some of our down-ballot candidates are down in the polls. We can’t beat the GOP at the national and state level and then let them keep control at the local level. We know that’s exactly how they live to fight another day.
We need your help putting a stop to this, now.
The next 10 days will be a blitz of educating Washingtonians, expanding the electorate, advocating for the Democratic candidates still struggling, and ensuring every rural voter in the state knows exactly what’s at stake. Every cent you pitch in now goes toward growing that effort, toward growing the Democratic party, and toward showing Republicans that campaigns have consequences. Give now to teach the GOP a lesson they sorely need and cement our progress at the 11th hour. You’ll be stepping up when we need you most, at the exact moment your support will go the farthest. Please, stand with us now. Click this link and give as much as you can. You’ll be a crucial part of this moment in history.
Thank you for helping us find some meaning, some progress, some light in 2020. Thank you for helping us get back on a road toward politics we can be proud of in 2021.

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,What we need to do on this crucial registration deadline,"Alex,
Today is the last day to register to vote online or have your mail registration received in Washington state.
Back in 2016, almost a quarter of eligible WA voters didn’t register to vote -- that’s an estimated 1.28 million voters!
Republicans don’t want you to vote this election, either. They know they can only win if we stay home. In 2018, 11 WA GOP down ballot candidates won with less than a 7% margin of victory -- and 4 of those candidates won by less than 1.1%. If Washingtonians don’t mobilize in a BIG way, we run the risk of losing key seats by razor thin margins yet again.
We’ll be frank with you: it is IMPERATIVE that we don’t let that happen. The GOP is doing everything they can nationally to suppress the vote, and the only way to stop them is by exercising the most fundamental right of our democracy -- our vote! That’s why we’re checking in with all our supporters to make sure they’re registered and ready to make their voices heard in this election. Help us know how many people we still need to reach by telling us right now:
Are you registered to vote?
YES
NO
We greatly appreciate your responses today. With your support, we can win the election.
Thank you,
WA Dems

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,Loren Culp uses “bad news” to attack Inslee,"Hi Alex,
Tacoma News Tribune: “Boeing is ‘turning its back’ on Washington as the company announced it will move production of the 787 Dreamliner from Washington to South Carolina, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee said.”
Loren Culp is already desperately trying to blame the development on our governor, calling it “bad news” and saying “this will not be the last business to leave.”
We need to check in with our supporters, so we are checking in to confirm that you’re still with the governor and our WA Dems in standing against these desperate smears from Culp and his cronies. Alex \-- share your thoughts NOW to be counted:
Will you vote for Gov. Inslee and Democrats up and down the ballot?
YES
NO

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,We need you to say what Republican leaders won’t,"Hi Alex,
Republican State Rep. Vicki Kraft recently defended the presence of a Nazi flag at a right-wing rally she attended, saying, “If there was a Nazi flag let me tell you exactly what that would mean… Gov. Inslee is acting like a dictator.”
It’s unthinkably offensive that Kraft would compare Governor Inslee to Hitler. But equally troubling is the way Kraft is making excuses for Nazi iconography \-- all while her party’s leader, Donald Trump, refuses to condemn white supremacy.
We think our chair Tina Podlodowski said it best when she declared, “Politicians and organizations that associate with or support Kraft really need to take a good look in the mirror and think about who they are standing with and what that says about them and their values.”
If the GOP wants to fraternize with white supremacists, it’s all the more important that we stand with our values now and condemn them. That’s why we’re reaching out to you for a rebuke in no uncertain terms \-- will you say what Republican leaders won’t? Tell us:
Do you condemn white supremacy?
YES
NO
Thanks for making your voice heard.
We’re grateful to have you with us.

Tina Podlodowski,info@wa-democrats.org,YIKES! We could use your help,"Hi Alex,
Listen to this: Facebook won’t abide by Washington state’s campaign finance laws regarding advertising on their platform \-- so basically that means our WA Dems can’t use one of the most cost-effective digital tools to reach voters. With ballots for the primary election dropping in LESS THAN A MONTH(!), we’re relying even more heavily on our volunteers who will be on the dialer and texting voters across the state as part of our 2020 coordinated campaign strategy to get our WA Dems through to the general election.
But the GOP are focused on their powerful voter disenfranchisement campaign \-- including near-constant Trump tweets trying to undermine confidence in mail-in ballots \-- that will have grave implications on our health care systems and the future of our planet. Alex, if we’re going to stop them, I need you with us. Will you pitch in $25, $20, $5, $1, or whatever you can now?

Our team is pushing to get through the organizing challenges we’re facing because here at the WA Dems State Party we know we CANNOT slow down. (Or make ANY excuses for missing our voter contact goals.)
Voters are more engaged \-- and more enraged at GOP “leaders” in our state and in the White House \-- than ever. We know they’re ready and willing to get back in the fight to stop Trump and his cronies this November.
But listen, the GOP is actively working to stop our progress in Washington state \-- and our coordinated virtual voter outreach strategy will be key to protecting our Washington Dems. So far, we’ve held our first digital organizing academy to train volunteers on how our new remote organizing tools work and to remind them that we’re in this together to support effective public servants who won’t bungle and botch policies that help our families.
Now, we have activated more than 100 experienced volunteer leaders who are ready to train volunteers to phone bank, and we’ve had so many new volunteers already complete their first shift! The WA Dems have also been lending our voter engagement and turnout expertise to party leaders in states with key 2020 Democratic races (think MN, AK, TX, SC, DE, NC, MI, and ME). Right now, WE are leading the way.
Together, we need to ensure we don’t have to slow our efforts. In fact, we need to strengthen them \-- but we fell short of this weekend’s fundraising goal, which makes things tough. That’s why I’m reaching out to you today.
We need to raise $2,250 more TODAY if we’re going to stay on track to stop the far right GOP from gaining ground in our state and across the country. I’m counting on you to jump in now to help us stop GOP extremists like Matt Shea from spreading his white supremacist values and Trump-enabling Republicans like Jaime Herrera Beutler from neglecting their constituents any longer.
Please, I’m counting on YOU. You can make your online contribution here: [[URL REDACTED]]

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,Mark Zuckerberg needs to do the right thing,"Alex,
In a recent meeting, The Stop Hate for Profit Coalition, a group made up of civil rights organizations including the NAACP, Color of Change, Free Press, and the Anti-Defamation League, called on Facebook to update its community standards to address the spread of racist, hateful, and violent content on the platform.
But after a call with Facebook executives including CEO Mark Zuckerberg, the Stop Hate for Profit Coalition said, “It was abundantly clear in our meeting today that Mark Zuckerberg and the Facebook team are not yet ready to address the vitriolic hate on their platform.”
The Coalition also commented that Zuckerberg “offered the same old defense of white supremacist, anti-Semitic, Islamophobic, and other hateful groups.”
We've seen the impacts of Facebook's outsized influence on our elections and know that the continuation of these inactions could have grave implications on the information voters see before they vote this fall. Today, we want to hear from you:
Are you concerned about the influence Facebook has over our elections?
YES
NO

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,Just a few dozen votes could shape the future of WA,"Hi Alex,
Washington has had a Republican Secretary of State for the last five decades. This election, we have a chance to change that.
Kim Wyman has failed to denounce Donald Trump’s despicable lies about vote-by-mail. She’s opposed voting rights advancements like same-day registration and preregistration of 16 and 17-year-olds. In short, she’s not willing to do everything it takes to keep our voters safe and secure \-- unlike Gael Tarleton, who’s committed to expanding voter registration and education, stopping unnecessary and discriminatory voter roll purges, and defending our elections from Russia and other foreign powers.
This November, we can not only elect Tarleton -- we can also protect the Democrats who have fought for everyday Washingtonians in our state legislature. We can re-elect state Senators Andy Billig and Christine Rolfes, who recently blocked the Republican attempt to balance our state budget on the backs of the working and middle class. And we can replace GOPers like Steve O’Ban, who’s resorted to racist mailers in an attempt to hold onto his power in the state senate.
But these races will be incredibly close. In 2018, Democrat Emily Randall won her state senate race by just 102 votes. Democrat Pinky Vargas lost her race by just 46 votes. The margins of victory could be even tighter in 2020 -- which means we can’t let a single vote go unaccounted for.
That’s why keeping our GOTV efforts well-funded is so crucial. The future of our state will rest on whether or not our operations are broad enough to win every race in every place -- and right now, we’re $7,500 short of our grassroots fundraising goal.
If you want a secretary of state who will protect our right to vote from all enemies, foreign and domestic; if you want a state legislature that will embody progressive values; if you want to see wins for Democrats all up and down the ballot this November, then please give what you can now so we can expand our GOTV efforts and match 2018’s historic blue wave this election.
Thank you so much for not letting our vulnerable down-ballot Democrats slip through the cracks. There is so much riding on every single vote -- and every single voter. We’re so grateful for you doing your part. We promise that our leaders will do theirs.

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,What got spread at Culp’s Bellingham rally,"Hi Alex,
Loren Culp’s vanity tour of reckless endangerment has wound its way through another Washington locale \-- this time the city of Bellingham.
Though gatherings of more than 5 are banned as part of Whatcom County’s second phase of reopening, Culp assembled hundreds of his most loyal supporters to celebrate his ascendency to the GOP nomination \-- all, of course, without a mask in sight.
Culp’s rally wasn’t just a potential superspreader event for disease, its messaging also spread grossly irresponsible rhetoric \-- with Culp telling his followers that COVID is no big deal because, like AIDS, it comes and goes. Culp then finished up his sermon of death with a terrifying message of blind nationalism and left the stage to thunderous applause.
We wish we were making this up. We’re not. Culp isn’t just putting hundreds of lives at risk \-- he’s whipping his supporters into a frenzy. We have to stand against this, now, before anyone gets hurt \-- by the virus or by Governor Loren Culp. If you demand an end to this dangerous chaos, stand with us now:
Do you condemn Culp's in person rallies?

Right now, WA Dems is up against our 12/31 FEC deadline \-- and we’re still short. This is a hard month to fundraise, and it’ll get even harder next week with the holidays. Missing this goal would mean we’ll have to scale back our early 2020 organizing efforts that will lay the groundwork for Democrats to win up and down the ticket in November.
Our team is pushing to get ahead on our goal now because we know next week will throw a wrench in our numbers \-- that’s why I’m reaching out to you today.
We need to raise $6,340 more before tomorrow if we’re going to stay on track to stop the pro-Trump and far right GOP from gaining ground in our state. With Cathy McMorris Rodgers on board as Trump’s campaign chair here in WA, we know her corporate donors will be dumping cash in races across our state to protect Trump’s GOP allies and challenge our progressive leaders.
We’re running a powerful statewide strategy to stop them, and your support is critical to our funding our Rise & Organize volunteer training program that led us to historic success in 2018.

Newly released emails documenting Trump’s July 25 phone call with the Ukrainian president and the withholding of foreign aid prove that administration officials tried to cover up Trump’s crime.
An email to the Pentagon details how officials tried to conceal Trump’s illegal actions “given the sensitive nature of the request.” Following the decision, Pentagon lawyers appear to have grown anxious and another email clarifies that this was a “clear direction from POTUS to hold.”
Now that the House has impeached Trump, we’re waiting on the Senate to set the rules for the trial. We’re conducting a one question poll on your support for Donald Trump before we roll out our next strategy to stop Trump.

This year’s elections will take place in the midst of a global pandemic \-- and no American should have to risk their health and safety to make sure their voice is heard.
Right now, Trump and his GOP cronies are pushing a narrative about the alleged dangers of voting by mail, but in Washington state, we know vote-by-mail is one of the safest ways to vote.
Donald Trump doesn’t want the American people to have the opportunity to vote without putting their health at risk, so we’re sending a petition to our leaders in Congress to demand they give all Americans the option to vote by mail as well as help states with the costs.
Our most vulnerable populations, like our seniors and loved ones with compromised immune systems, deserve to vote safely. Our healthcare workers fighting this pandemic every day deserve to have their voices heard without being forced to stand in long lines at crowded polling places.
We can and must do better for the people.
That’s why we’re calling on Congress to give all Americans the option to vote by mail. If you agree, add your name to our petition to send a message directly to Congress.
Thank you for standing with us.

Members of the House just voted to impeach Donald Trump for abuse of powers and continued obstruction of Congress. Democrats in our congressional delegation like Rep. Pramila Jayapal who serves on the House Judiciary Committee have led this effort \-- but now, every Democrat who voted in support of removing Trump from office will be Republicans’ first targets as we head into 2020.
We know national Republicans will use this news to rake in hundreds of thousands of dollars from the Kochs’ dark money network, so we’re running an emergency fundraiser to protect vulnerable Democrats across the state to ensure Washington State continues leading our country forward. Every single one of WA’s Democrats in the House voted to hold Trump accountable and protect our Constitution, and now it’s our job to let them know we’ve got their backs next November.
Will you rush $25 to WA Dems right now to ensure we have the resources we need to win across the board in November? Here’s the link: [[URL REDACTED]]

You stepped up. You helped us hit our fundraising goal \-- and now we’ve been able to bolster our outreach efforts at a critical moment. Because of you, we’re one step closer to keeping WA blue.
But there’s still a dangerous shift happening in our state.

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,We’ve got a MAJOR event this week!,"Hi Alex,
The WA GOP has made it clear they are all-in for Trump and have embraced his dangerous rhetoric.
EVERY WA GOP candidate for Governor pledged loyalty to the president. Republican legislators in Olympia followed Trump’s anti-science rhetoric, resulting in a HUGE spike in infections in rural parts of our state. And our local GOP has FAILED to condemn Trump’s suppression of guidance from CDC public health experts \-- who then had no choice but to leak their recommendations to the press.
It will take a generation to heal the damage Donald Trump has done to our democracy, our reputation in the world, and countless families who have lost loved ones during this pandemic because of his rank incompetence. But we’ve known since he kicked off his campaign that Trump was dangerous, impulsive, and a racist; what we’ve learned in the last four years is that there is no price the WA GOP will refuse to pay to support him and his policies \-- no amount of death, destruction of our economy, or damage to our values will keep them from standing behind Trump.
It’s up to us to stop the GOP from gaining any more ground in our state \-- and that starts with working hard in the field to turnout every Washington Democrat we need to send a message loud and clear that WE reject Donald Trump and his cronies.
But here’s the good news: our Virtual Volunteer program has already made MORE THAN 200,000 calls to voters all over WA!! This Sunday, we’re keeping up the momentum by hosting our BIGGEST volunteer event yet \-- we’re planning to make THOUSANDS more calls to voters to get them engaged and ready for the fight ahead.
Gov. Jay Inslee and future state Senator T’wina Nobles are kicking off the night before we all jump on the dialer to make calls and send texts. Alex, we need YOU with us. Please join us and be part of the team that stops Trump this November. The event begins Sunday at 5 p.m. You can RSVP now.
We can’t keep up our breakneck pace to November 3rd without you!
Thanks for everything,
WA Dems
P.S. If volunteering and talking to voters isn’t your thing but you want to help empower our volunteers fighting the good fight, pitch in $25, $10, $5, or whatever you can here to help us sustain our efforts: [[URL REDACTED]]

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,Donald Trump wants to destroy the USPS,"Hi Alex,
The Washington Dems are joining the fight to advocate for national vote-by-mail. We know that in WA state, implementing a vote-by-mail process has made our elections freer and more open \-- and it helped secure record-high turnout in our presidential primary earlier this year.
But while we’re working with other state party leaders across the country, Donald Trump has been attacking the USPS, withholding relief and even calling one of the most beloved agencies a “joke.” Trump’s continued rejections of a USPS bailout could have a severe impact on our vote-by-mail process this November as well as hurt our families in rural and low-income communities.
Today, we’re conducting an instant poll of Washingtonians \-- and we want to hear from you now. Please let us know:
Do you support the United States Postal Service?
YES
NO

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,Republicans are dragging AG Ferguson’s name through the mud,"Hey Alex,
GOP attorney general candidate Matt Larkin wants you to think AG Bob Ferguson “likes to go after people who disagree with him politically. He likes to go after people who don’t fund his campaign. There’s a bent in his office toward people he agrees with.”
Larkin has even stooped to accusing AG Ferguson of selfishly neglecting his office, saying that he has “checked out. He’s not protecting the people of Washington anymore.”
Republicans are clearly scared if they’re resorting to baseless accusations against AG Ferguson’s character. They know that his legal defense record is stellar \-- he’s proven himself a fighter for all Washingtonians. In just this term alone, he’s strived to protect the USPS and the Affordable Care Act and instigated 78 other lawsuits in pursuit of our state’s interests and the interests of every American resisting the Trump agenda.
But Larkin and Washington Republicans remain hell-bent on dragging AG Ferguson’s name through the mud. It just might be enough to let Republicans seize control of the office once again after 7 years out of power. With less than a month before Election Day, we just can’t afford any more damage from the GOP’s lies. They’ll continue to smear AG Ferguson, so we’re rallying our supporters: We want our bold Attorney General to see who is behind him. If you’re standing with our AG against these baseless personal attacks, please confirm it now:
Do you support Attorney General Bob Ferguson?
YES
NO
We greatly appreciate your responses today. With your support, we can win this election.
Thank you,

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,Michelle: “It is up to us to add our voices and our votes to the course of history.”,"Hi Alex,
Michelle Obama has stepped into the 2020 election, telling the nation “It is up to us to add our voices and our votes to the course of history, echoing heroes like John Lewis who said, ‘When you see something that is not right, you must say something. You must do something.’”
Lucky for us, Michelle Obama is doing something. The former First Lady launched “Civic Cities,” a bipartisan program designed to combat rampant voter suppression by collaborating with 31 mayors across the country to increase voter registration and civic engagement in their cities.
Michelle Obama’s efforts couldn’t have started at a better time, as Trump and his GOP cronies are executing a MASSIVE voter suppression campaign.
Trump has called the vote by mail process “a great Voter Fraud scenario” and threatened to “hold up funding” should states move forward in issuing absentee ballots.
These outbursts aren’t random \-- right now, presidential polls show him trailing his Democratic challenger. And the fact is national Republicans know that when we make it easier to vote, more Democrats turn out.
That’s why Trump allies like Washington state’s own Secretary of State Kim Wyman (our chief elections officer) and GOP incumbents have failed to condemn Trump’s attack on voting rights.
Today we’re conducting a survey to gauge your support of Michelle Obama and her plans to stop voter suppression ahead of this year’s election. Please, let us know:
Do you support Michelle Obama?
YES
NO
Thank you so much for participating in surveys like this one. Your answers will help inform our 2020 strategies, and we couldn’t run these programs without your insight.

Trump named one of his BIG campaign donors as the new postmaster general. We’re already seeing delays in critical mail deliveries to people across WA state and the country because Postmaster General Louis DeJoy has banned overtime work in his first budget cuts.
In November, our nation will rely on the USPS and our postal workers to deliver their ballots to their local board of elections, but with a Trump ally who has no experience handling mail leading the agency, we’re concerned about the potential impacts on the outcome of the 2020 election.
Alex, we need you to stand with us in demanding our leaders in Congress take action to save the U.S. Postal Service. Please add your name immediately!

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,Who will you support in the March 10 primary?,"Hi Alex,
Almost every day, we’re hit with a new scandal about the current administration \-- another racist tirade, unconstitutional policy, or sordid story of corruption \-- and we know that our country cannot survive another four years of Donald Trump.
We have to work to elect a president who shares Washington state values, not one who emboldens dangerous white supremacists. And each day, we get closer and closer to finding out which of our incredible Democratic candidates will be that president.
With exactly two weeks until Washingtonians vote in the presidential primary, and with eight candidates left in the race, we’re prepared to run a strong coordinated campaign to make sure Democrats win big in November.
But before tonight’s Democratic debate in South Carolina, we need to hear from 78 more engaged Democrats, so please let us know:
Do you know which Democratic candidate you're supporting in the primary?
YES NO

And if you did give and I missed our system's notification, I apologize for this mix up. I so appreciate your support of this critical program.
However, if you haven’t pitched in to help us stop Trump and his cronies yet, I need your help to ensure we don’t have to make any cuts or changes to our voter turnout operation timeline.
When you give $25, $50, $100, $250, or whatever you can, we’ll put your contribution to good use right away getting boots on the ground and training the community leaders who will secure us victory in November. But here’s the thing: if we don’t hit our February goal, we won’t have the resources to make the powerful investments we need to win in the general election.
We’re still SO short of our February goal \-- $5,860 to be exact \-- and I’m reaching out to you now to ask you to step up with a contribution now.
Can I count on you? Link to give here: [[URL REDACTED]]

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,Loren Culp has got to be stopped,"Hi Alex,
Big thanks to everyone who shared their thoughts in yesterday's gubernatorial poll. Today, we wanted to check in with you about another leading GOP candidate for governor.
Police Chief Loren Culp is a man who rose to prominence for defying a voter-approved initiative to enact commonsense gun safety reforms that won with nearly 60% of the vote. He’s also a fervent anti-masker who continues to flaunt public health guidelines. In response to Governor Inslee’s public health order on masks, Culp said, “I will not comply. You can take your masks and do you-know-what with it.”
But most alarming of all, Culp was accused in a lawsuit of “botching a child sexual-abuse investigation and intimidating the victim.” As the victim alleged that Culp failed to protect her and accused her of “made up” allegations, Mr. Culp defended himself by blaming her, saying of the man who eventually pleaded guilty to abusing a 12-year old, “Not everyone who takes a plea deal is actually guilty.”
We've GOT to hear from you. Let us know:
Do you approve of Loren Culp?
YES
NO
Thank you for taking today's GOP gubernatorial poll.

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,Gov. Inslee needs our help,"Hi Alex,
As Washingtonians, we are appreciative of the strong, forward-thinking national leadership Governor Jay Inslee has shown the last eight years.
He’s led Washington state to build a strong social safety net that has protected families during these uncertain times and led the nation in implementing progressive policies like paid family and medical leave, mandated sick days, health care expansion to 800k more Washingtonians, and the highest minimum wage of any state.
At the WA Dems, we’re proud of Gov. Inslee’s leadership. And Alex, there has never been a time when strong, thoughtful leadership is more necessary than right now. That’s why we’re reaching out to you about Governor Inslee and the resources he needs to win re-election.
Jay hasn’t raised money for nearly six months due to the legally mandated legislative fundraising freeze ending right at the start of the pandemic.
Rather than raising money, our governor has been focused on the health and safety of Washingtonians and the recovery of the state. But this puts him in a tough spot ahead of a critical re-election campaign.
Inslee has stood up to Trump and the reckless, pro-Trump acolytes he’s running against who are anti-science and reckless with our public health. Trump has personally targeted Gov. Inslee, but through it all, Inslee has remained thoughtful, steady, and strong.
Governor Inslee is one of only three Democratic governors up for re-election nationwide and we CANNOT let the GOP roll our progress back decades by letting them target our governor. But with threats of major national GOP spending in Washington state to defeat Inslee, we need to help bolster their resources immediately.
Today, we are asking you to make a contribution of any amount to help us re-elect Gov. Inslee. Please use this link to show your support for Gov. Inslee.
Thanks for standing with us today and always,

We can’t knock doors to reach voters in the coming weeks (and maybe months) \-- so, we’ve stocked up our organizing toolbox with techniques that allow us to reach voters and make sure they turn in their ballots without face-to-face contact.

We purchased a predictive dialer to up our outreach volume and a new texting tool called GetThru for volunteers who don’t want to get on the phone.

Tina Podlodowski,info@wa-democrats.org,We’re still short.,"Alex,
We wrote yesterday to ask for your help in defeating Loren Culp and the rest of the WA GOP.
We know it won’t be easy \-- Republicans are mounting a massive grassroots outreach effort to rural Washingtonians while we do our best to defend ourselves from their anti-science lies and anti-progress agenda with our virtual campaign tactics.
If we fall short, we'll be forced to scale back our voter outreach. If we scale back, Culp’s dangerous rage against public health guidelines and the rule of law goes unanswered \-- and he starts to win more hearts and minds all across the state.
Thankfully, dozens of supporters have stepped up since yesterday, helping us raise $978 \-- which means we are now INCREDIBLY close to our fundraising goal. When we hit it, we’ll expand our GOTV efforts, reach more voters, win this election, and grow WA’s blue majority instead of seeing our state fall to the GOP.
We don’t yet see a gift from you. (Please forgive us if we’re wrong; records can be slow to update!) Will you help us close the rest of the gap \-- we’re so close \-- so that we can beef up our GOTV efforts and hand the WA GOP the humiliating defeat their anti-science candidates deserve? Chip in what you can now to bring us over the finish line: [[URL REDACTED]]

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,Your ballot is safe -- so use it!,"Hi Alex,
“Your ballot is safe and our elections are secure.”
That’s a quote from our chair, Tina Podlodowski \-- and if you take only one thing from this message, we hope it’s the above. Despite the GOP doing their best to manufacture doubt about our electoral process every chance they get, your vote DOES matter, which is why it’s so crucial that you vote by 8 p.m. tomorrow, November 3, to permanently shape the future of our state and our country (if you have questions about voting, you can call (206) 309-VOTE to get them answered by our team of volunteer attorneys).
But our elections are safe and secure despite the Republicans in power, not because of them. GOP Secretary of State Kim Wyman has failed to repudiate Donald Trump’s lies about voter fraud. Just recently, Wyman held a private fundraiser exclusive to her biggest donors featuring the Republican Secretaries of State in Kansas and Iowa \-- officials who have both made it harder for their constituents to vote during the pandemic. She’s also featured county auditors in her campaign ads \-- in so doing politicizing the very office she insists she’s kept above the partisan fray.
Wyman is a wolf in sheep’s clothing. That’s why it’s so important that we vote her out, along with all of the other down-ballot GOPers who aren’t polling as poorly as the failed commander-in-chief at the top of the ticket -- they could do just as much damage to our state, if not more, if they remain in power.
Whether they keep their seats or Democrats take control is entirely up to you. If you’ve already voted, we’d encourage you to do even more by clicking this link and giving what you can so we can mobilize as many yet-to-be-voters as possible.
If you haven’t voted yet, we’d encourage you to return your ballot at a dropbox today -- but for your vote to count you must get your ballot in no later than 8 p.m. on November 3. We’re in the final days to make your voice heard.
Your commitment to safe elections, robust health care, clean energy, and protecting our public health is exactly what inspires us to keep fighting for all those issues and more. We hope to see massive improvement in every single one of those areas once the ballots are counted, but you’re the one who’ll make it all possible.
So thank you, truly, for participating in the great experiment of American democracy. You really are helping to reclaim the soul of our nation.
In gratitude,
WA Dems

Subject: The gap in our budget
Hey Alex \-- The legislative fundraising freeze is in place to prevent any of our leaders in Washington state from making policy decisions beneficial to their donors. But at the same time, it’s a big opportunity for the far-right Republicans candidates working to unseat the leaders who fight for our shared Washington state values every day.
So while Democrats in our state’s delegation are BARRED from accepting ANY campaign contributions between now and the spring, we’re stepping it up and building the resources to take on the GOP extremists running to defeat them in 2020.
Our coordinated campaign is powerful. We delivered sweeping victories in 2018 \-- and if we’re going to continue driving our state and nation forward, we need to make sure our program is fully funded.
But truthfully, our online support has fallen this week, and we can’t stop Trump’s allies in WA from gaining more ground without your contribution now.
Right now, we’re $9,250 short of this week’s goal, and with the GOP raking in the big bucks, we can’t afford to miss this goal. Can we count on you to help us close the gap before tomorrow at midnight so we don’t have to pull back on any of our voter outreach strategies?

GOP candidate for governor Loren Culp held a rally in Kitsap County where he delivered a message to Gov. Jay Inslee \-- who has been leading the fight to keep our essential workers and our communities safe. Culp stated, “Gov. Inslee, Loren Culp is coming to Olympia and the citizens of Washington state are coming with me.”
We watched the video \-- and we couldn't spot a single mask among any of the people gathered together, in violation of public health orders, for a man seeking to run our coronavirus response. Today, we're checking in to see if you're still following Gov. Inslee's public health guidelines about wearing a mask. We hope you are, but we've got to ask on behalf of every grocery store worker, nurse, and EMT in Kitsap County and across our state:
Do you wear a mask in public?
YES
NO

Last night spoke for itself.
The stakes were enormously high \-- USA Today said the event “could be Trump's last chance to turn the race around.”
Public opinion can often be a self-fulfilling prophecy. If enough people think a candidate won, that becomes the truth and what gets reported \-- and possibly what shapes swing voters’ minds in the last few days before the election.
That’s why, no matter what Trump tries to do today to spin what he did last night into a victory, we need to send a clear message now: Trump lost, Biden won. That’s easy for us to say \-- proving it true takes your help. So please, will you help us now? Tell us what you think:
Who won?
Joe Biden
Donald Trump

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,We must lift up all the Democrats fighting to protect us,"Hi Alex,
We are locked in a battle for the future of health care in America.
GOPers in our own state have tried to outlaw abortion \-- and Republicans in Congress are seeking to confirm a justice who could overturn Roe v. Wade. Losing the right to choose would put the lives of thousands of Americans at risk \-- and cause another public health crisis in the midst of this pandemic.
We have a chance to channel the growing wave of progressive outrage into a sweeping repudiation of Republicans in November. We have the opportunity to protect the lives of our citizens \-- along with our most fundamental civil liberties.
But Republicans are more united than ever before. They see a chance to reverse decades’ worth of progressive policy \-- and they’re seizing on it.
We still need $4,018 before midnight to hit our end-of-quarter goal. Smashing our projections for the last FEC deadline before the election would mean lifting up all the Democrats who want to stop the GOP’s assault on our health. Falling short would be unthinkable.
You’ve been with us through this entire campaign. Please, be with us now.
Give what you can to help us smash our goal -- and show the GOP their attacks on our health care, our reproductive freedom, and our Supreme Court won’t stand.
Thank you for helping us show the Republicans that their actions have consequences.
And thank you for protecting us all from the consequences of the GOP.

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,Mitch McConnell is stopping critical election reform,"Hi Alex,
One of the first actions the new Democratic House majority took in 2019 was drafting a massive anti-corruption legislative package called H.R. 1, or the For the People Act. This bill comprehensively targets government corruption wherever possible, from voter suppression to unlimited spending from special interest donors to a lack of oversight.
And when it’s passed into law, it will strengthen our democracy.
Every single member of Washington’s Democratic House delegation voted for H.R. 1, because they represent Washingtonians who value transparent and effective governing. And we know that, should the legislation be brought to a vote in the Senate, Senators Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell would support the expansion of voting rights and get rid of dark money in our elections \-- but right now, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell refuses to let the bill reach the Senate floor.
We need our federal legislators to take responsibility for the preservation of our democracy and its values, and we need it now. If you agree, add your name to help us call on the Senate to bring H.R. 1 to a vote immediately.
Thank you for being invested in our democracy,

He “planned, engaged in, and promoted a total of three armed conflicts of political violence against the United States government.”
Shea wants to turn our government into a theocracy. He’s worked to spread his extremist ideologies across our state with his pamphlet, Biblical Basis for War. And he’s already promoted the training of young boys to fight in a “holy war.”
He’s been in office for six terms \-- and in 2020, we need to vote him out. But before we can run the voter outreach strategies we need to win, we’d like your input:

Joe Biden’s pick for vice president is Kamala Harris \-- a leader with a proven track record of leading based on science, fighting for criminal justice reform, and pushing back against GOP voter suppression.
With both party’s tickets officially decided, we now face a clear choice in November: we’ll either re-elect Trump and Pence or replace them with Biden and Harris.
We’ll either have a government that listens to science or one that punishes its experts for doing their jobs. We’ll either expand the Affordable Care Act or restrict and repeal it. We’ll either take decisive action on climate change, setting ourselves up for a brighter and cleaner energy future \-- or pillage our public lands and resources while the next global crisis looms ever closer.
And looking at the way Trump and the GOP are gearing up to suppress the vote, we know nothing less than a blue wave will do in order to carry our Democratic champions to the White House and carry our best hopes forward for America. That’s why we need the latest data from supporters like you, immediately. Almost a million voters sat on the sidelines in WA in 2016. Will you commit right now to making a stand in the most important election of our lifetimes?
Will you vote Biden/Harris in 2020?
YES
NO
We greatly appreciate your responses today \-- they will help us win the election.

We’ve led on combating the climate crisis, increasing the minimum wage, and so much more. My 2020 vision is a blue WA State and Congress, plus a new Democratic resident in the White House -- but I know we’ve got our work cut out for us. (Especially with Cathy McMorris Rodgers on board as Trump’s campaign chair here in WA.)
We know corporate donors will dump heaps of cash in races across our state to protect Trump’s GOP allies and stop our progressive leaders. We can’t let the GOP interfere with our progress.
We’re running a powerful statewide strategy to stop the pro-Trump and far right GOP from gaining ground in our state, but we need to continue building our resources early in the year.

The White House doesn’t want Dr. Anthony Fauci to stand before the Democratic-led Congress in a House Appropriations subcommittee hearing regarding the outbreak and its handling. A White House spokesperson claimed it would be “counterproductive” for Fauci to appear before the committee.
Dr. Fauci has been focused on delivering scientific information that will keep Americans safe, often recommending a cautious approach and contradicting Trump and the GOP’s statements pushing for the reopening of our economy.
We know that Trump hates it when anyone disagrees with him \-- Dr. Fauci included. A few weeks back, Trump even retweeted a post calling for Fauci to be fired. And we know that Trump doesn’t want our Democrats in the House to ask Fauci a question that could expose Trump’s failure in managing this crisis.

In September, Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler pledged “to put an end to the political gameship we’ve been seeing here in D.C.”
But in October, she’s singing a different tune: JHB voted against providing $200 billion in aid to help small businesses, $175 billion to help schools reopen safely, and $600 per week in expanded unemployment benefits for those who have lost their jobs due to the pandemic.
It’s utterly despicable \-- she’s playing political games at the expense of Washington’s most vulnerable residents. Rep. Herrera Beutler’s vote prioritizes toeing the Republican party line while her constituents in Southwest Washington are simply an afterthought. That’s no surprise coming from a congresswoman who sides with Trump more than 80% of the time.
We can’t allow this blatant disregard for Washingtonians and the country’s well-being to continue. We need to send the message that Washington’s 3rd Congressional District is being led by just another GOP politician committed to politicizing public health. To do this, we need to know where our most ardent supporters stand. So please, tell us:
Do you approve of Jaime Herrera Beutler?

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,A red wave on the horizon,"Hi Alex,
There are less than two months until Election Day. And given how our primaries went, we know we have a lot of work ahead to prevent a red wave surging from rural Washington.
Consider the following: enthusiasm in our primary smashed records, with over 2.5 million votes cast \-- the highest turnout in over 50 years.
But much of that enthusiasm was from the GOP given the hotly contested race for the honor of losing to Gov. Inslee. Republicans won a higher share of the vote in 2020 than they did in 2018 in 8 of our 10 congressional districts. That means the WA GOP is on track to do even better this election than they did last time.
Even if we manage to fend off Trump and Culp (two monumental achievements on their own), we still have to prevent the additional GOP base turnout they’ll generate from turning into a down-ballot massacre.
If Jaime Herrera Beutler not only keeps her seat in SW WA but is joined by a legion of Republican allies who flip our rural districts and take over our state legislature, they’ll create a disaster for our state and our nation. They’ll destroy the Affordable Care Act, defund our public schools, and expand the Trump tax cuts that have burdened our working families and dug a gaping chasm of inequality between the haves and the have-nots.
We still have time to stop them. We have two months to reach EVERY ELIGIBLE VOTER in our state and explain to them that commonsense gun reform, clean air and water, access to lifesaving medication, and even our most foundational safety nets \-- Social Security and Medicare \-- are on the ballot and on the chopping block this November. If we put the stakes of this election in direct, personal, immediate terms, voters will understand what’s at stake -- and we’ll win.
But there’s a loose cannon, anti-science radical named Loren Culp driving across our state, reaching voters where they are, and making the case that Democrats can’t be trusted \-- all while the Republican Party pours millions into the down-ballot candidates who are eager to ride the coattails of rural unrest right into office.
We must fight back. But with less than two months to go until the election, we’re falling short of our fundraising goals \-- and need another $5,037 before the end of the week if we want to hit our GOTV projections and stop the building red wave from crashing down on us all.
You’ve been with us from the very start. If you don’t want to see our Democratic leaders lose their seats \-- or be held hostage to the GOPers who could gain just enough control to block our agenda like Mitch McConnell has done in the other Washington \-- we need your help.
Please, pitch in what you can now. Help us crush our goal - and crush the rising red tide.
We are so incredibly grateful for your support.
It’s the only thing protecting our state.

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,Let’s make it a landslide,"Hi Alex,
At the same time our Democratic senators are fighting for the funding our families and frontline workers need, the Trump administration is moving to block billions in aid for states and for the CDC.
The Republicans ought to be ashamed of themselves.
Especially WA GOPers like Cathy McMorris Rodgers and Dan Newhouse \-- who are leading the charge for Trump’s re-election, despite the fact that only 32% of Washingtonians approve of the job the president is doing.
We can’t allow Trump’s lackeys to keep putting us all at risk for their own political gain.
We need to mount a counteroffensive.
We need to activate as many voters and volunteers as possible \-- and deliver a blue wave that will hand a humiliating, landslide defeat to every single one of the far-right Trump loyalists running for office in WA.
Our virtual volunteers are pulling out all the stops in order to do just that. But they’ve had to work under incredibly challenging circumstances \-- and right now, they just don’t have the resources they need to defend Washington from the GOP.
That’s why we’re reaching out to you \-- we set a goal to raise $10,000 before the end of July. But we’re falling behind, and we need to raise $4,240 more before midnight to stop the rising tide of Trump loyalists threatening our state. Thank YOU, Alex, if you’ve already pitched in \-- we’re incredibly grateful for the support you’ve shown.
But with only 3 full months until the election and so much on the line, we can’t afford to miss a single goal.
That’s why we’re reaching out to you now -- will you contribute to help defend and expand the WA Dems? We’re relying on you to make your first contribution and support the Washington Dems today.
Thanks for being part of our team.

For the past five years, State Rep. Matt Shea has been working to create a secession movement for eastern Washington state to create “Liberty State.”
He's not the first to do this though. GOP gubernatorial candidate and State Senator Phil Fortunato started the “secession is the new black” trend even before domestic terrorist Matt Shea, justifying his free republic fantasy by saying he's sick and tired of the Seattle Democrats’ “crazy, wacko stuff.”
Fortunato even went so far as to file SB 5932 in 2017, a bill in the Senate to separate Eastside King County from Seattle to make a new county.
In our last GOP gubernatorial survey, we need to hear from you about your approval of Phil Fortunato:

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,An anti-vaxxer in the Governor’s Office,"Hi Alex,
In the middle of a pandemic, the GOP wants to send an anti-vaxxer to the Governor’s Office.
In the middle of historic civil unrest and racial injustice, the GOP nominated a candidate propelled to fame by right-wing militias and accused domestic terrorists.
And in the middle of unprecedented threats to our frontline workers, Culp has told us all that we can take our masks and “do you-know-what with it.”
We never thought Trump would succeed President Obama, until it happened. And we never thought a Trump clone like Culp could succeed Governor Inslee \-- but if we don’t work like hell to stop him, that’s exactly what will happen next.
What’s more, Culp’s complete lack of conscience gives him an unfortunate campaign advantage. He’s holding in-person rallies and using them to spur direct contact with unlikely rural voters, just like Trump did in 2016. Because we care about science \-- and the lives of our voters \-- we can’t and won’t do the same. If we don’t want him to crush us the same way he crushed his vastly more qualified Republican primary opponents, we must act now to organize our voters remotely.
Our volunteers and Coordinated Campaign staff have been fighting night and day to elect and protect Democrats all across the state. We’re working tirelessly on our virtual voter outreach \-- and have made thousands of phone calls and text messages to exactly the people we need to reach.
But right now, we’re VERY short of fully funding our virtual voter outreach program, and if we don’t raise another $3,211 before midnight we’ll have to scale back our efforts to defeat Culp and re-elect Governor Jay Inslee in November.
But we can’t get there without you.
This time next year, we could have a governor who doesn’t know how to put on a mask. We cannot allow Culp to take our state from us and put all of our lives at risk. Our Coordinated Campaign is doing all it can to defeat him, and advance Democrats up and down the ticket -- but we can’t win without you. Please, to save us from a repeat of 2016, give what you can immediately.
We cannot thank you enough for your support.
You’re the only way we can win.

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,We won’t get another chance for a decade,"Hi Alex,
The Census is CRUCIAL.
The official count of the U.S. population, taken every ten years, determines where federal funding is allocated and decides how many seats each state receives in the House of Representatives for the next decade.
But the Trump administration has moved to sabotage the Census by cutting it short before every American has a chance to be counted.
If their plan succeeds, vulnerable communities \-- particularly communities of color \-- won’t get the resources they need. We the people won’t receive the political representation we deserve.
And Trump will leave his mark on the country until 2030.
We can stop Republicans from rigging the rules of the game for the next decade. But not without your help.
Alex, if you demand that every American be counted -- if you demand the Congressional balance of power not shift to white nationalist GOPers and their allies -- add your name now to condemn the Trump administration’s cutting the Census short and insist that it be extended for the good of us all.
Thank you for standing with us today.

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,Will you vote to stop Trump/Pence 2020?,"Hi Alex,
You might have heard that Donald Trump and Mike Pence are getting back on the campaign trail for 2020.
Originally, the president’s first rally was planned for June 19, the day we observe and celebrate Juneteenth \-- a holiday meant to commemorate the emancipation of enslaved Black people in America. Not only did he plan to hold his first rally on an African American holiday but he’s also holding it in Tulsa, OK, where a white mob destroyed Black Wall Street during the 1921 race riot.
The Trump campaign moved the rally to Saturday “out of respect” for Juneteenth in an attempt to claim ignorance, but we know better than to believe his denials when he gets caught saying the “quiet part” of his racist rhetoric out loud.
And Trump’s disrespect for Americans he knows won’t support him doesn’t end there. On the anniversary of the Pulse Night Club shooting, the administration rolled back transgender health care protections.
The GOP’s actions are not only informed; they are precisely calculated to continue oppressing historically marginalized people. That’s why \-- as Trump gets back on the campaign trail for this November’s election \-- we need to hear from 76 more engaged Washington Democrats before midnight.
So please, take the survey now to inform our 2020 strategy to stop Trump and his cronies.
Will you vote to stop Trump and his WA GOP allies in 2020?
YES
NO

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,The GOP is using our complacency against us,"Alex,
During times of crisis, we’ve seen small men leverage racial and economic tensions to gain power. We saw it as recently as 2016 with the rise of Donald Trump. And we’re seeing it happen now, in real time, with Trump’s loyal mini-me \-- Loren Culp.
Culp has now declared himself a savior of the common man \-- and is using race-baiting tactics condemned by the Anti-Defamation League and The Black Collective to rationalize his rejection of the rule of law in favor of the rule of Culp.
Let’s not watch, mouths agape and clutching our pearls, as he slowly but surely succeeds. We tried that last time.
This election, our team knows what’s coming \-- and we’re doing everything we can to stop it.
We’re reaching out to voters all over the state. We’ve seen our output of texts, dials, and volunteer shifts soar at the same time that our voter turnout numbers have broken records. We’re well on our way to repudiating Culp and the rest of the WA GOP \-- but this fight is nowhere near over.
The Republican Governors Association is licking its chops over the prize that is Washington state. They’d love nothing more than to see Governor Inslee out of the picture \-- and they know there’s no better place to strike than a state that’s thought of as “safely” blue.
They’ll seek to use our complacency against us to install a stark-raving-mad, racist, anti-vaxxer Trump loyalist in the Governor’s office.
Our only hope is to reach more voters than they do. But we’re stuck behind computer screens and smartphones, and the GOP’s candidates up and down the ballot are out in the field \-- hunting for the “silent majority” that handed Trump the presidency almost four years ago.
If we keep falling short of our goals, we’ll fall short in November. And right now, we’re $2,754 short.
Please help us close this gap. Our urgency may seem like an overreaction \-- and if we wake up on November 4th to another term of Governor Inslee, we’ll happily agree.
But, much like the current pandemic, an under-reaction will mean catastrophe \-- the kind that won’t be fixed for years to come.
If you think our blue majority is worth fighting for -- if you want to keep making progress on the environment, public health, and the economy -- if you want to protect our blind side from the GOP’s guerilla campaign warfare before it’s too late, we’re urging you to give what you can now.
We will never get another shot at this election.

We have an opportunity to flip a seat that’s belonged to Republicans for years -- and to expand health care for millions of Washingtonians.
Steve O’Ban, the GOP state senator from the 28th legislative district, has extensively criticized the Affordable Care Act. He has also voted against the Cascade Care public option and opposed the historic Long-Term Care Trust Act endorsed by the AARP -- the first plan in the nation to provide social insurance for long-term care.
His opponent, Democratic challenger T’wina Nobles, wants to provide and protect health care for Washingtonians and their families. Nobles was even endorsed by health care champion Senator Elizabeth Warren, who called T’wina “an experienced community leader and fighter for big, structural change who knows what working families need to get ahead.”
But Nobles led O’Ban by just 235 votes in the primary election -- meaning she has nowhere near the margin she needs to ensure victory for Democrats and for health care in November.

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,Culp moves into race-baiting,"Hi Alex,
Even the Republican Party won’t defend Loren Culp this time.
Prominent Black and Jewish groups have forcefully condemned Culp for his obscene and offensive remarks. According to Culp, his refusal to enforce the gun safety measure passed by 60% of WA voters makes him like Rosa Parks \-- while, in Culp’s mind, enforcing the law would be akin to the horrors of the Holocaust.
These are the ravings of a dangerously misinformed, racist zealot with a god complex. We know because we’ve seen this story before.
We need to stop this before it goes any further.
The good news is we can shut down this wannabe Trump clone before he gets any closer to Olympia. We know our GOTV efforts are working \-- they’re the reason we broke 50% voter turnout in our primary this year, the highest engagement we’ve had in half a century.
And our volunteers are the most committed in the nation \-- making 50,000+ phone calls in a single night and leading other Democratic state parties across the country. This is exactly the kind of fine-tuned and hard-working team we need to take down Culp before he reaches the steps of the Governor’s Office.
But Culp is doubling down on his Trumpian tactics, calling the attacks on him “hit pieces” by a lying media at the same time that he falsely blames Governor Inslee for the unemployment crisis in our state. We know the truth: if Republicans like Culp and Trump would stop undermining public health measures, we could be reopening our economy like other industrialized nations around the world.
But many of our rural voters don’t have all the facts because Culp is relentlessly gaslighting them on social media and in every interview he does on right-wing radio.
As hard as we’ve been working, we need to work even harder to counter Culp’s dangerous and divisive messaging before he leverages this crisis to win in November.
But we’re falling short of the funds we need to mount a counter-offensive. In order to meet our revised GOTV outreach goals, we need to raise another $3,876 by midnight tomorrow.
That’s why we’re reaching out to you. Please, if you find Culp’s bid for power by any means necessary as vile as we do, support our cause. We’re the only ones who can stop him and the “movement” he’s cultivated among down-ballot Republicans \-- but only if we band together.
Give now to keep racist Trump clone Loren Culp out of Olympia. Give now so we can prepare for the next ugly deception that will come spilling out of his mouth. Give now so we can reach all the voters Culp is doing his best to turn against us -- and protect our state from the dark future that we see inching closer every single day if Culp’s groundswell of support helps Republicans win back the state legislature.
We never thought we’d be here. You have our utmost gratitude for helping us correct course and send this deluded bigot back to obscurity where he belongs.
Thank you.

This November is the most consequential election of our lifetime.
We need to make sure that every Democrat across Washington state and the country uses their right to vote to take back our country.
Last month, Congressman John Lewis turned 80 \-- and to celebrate his life, we're partnering with Democrats across the country to ensure we win big this year.
Rep. John Lewis has marched, protested, and advocated for the right to vote for millions of Americans. And in 1965, he was beaten on the Edmund Pettus Bridge while he was working to create a more just society.
At Washington Dems, we believe in empowering others to get out and vote for the future they want to see -- and today, we're asking you to pledge to vote in this year's election. Sign the pledge to vote now. >>
We can protect the House, take back the Senate, and defeat Donald Trump, but we need to make sure YOU vote.

If the embarrassing June 20 rally in Oklahoma did not alert Trump about his potential to lose in November, his former political advisor Sam Nunberg just did: “Under the current trajectory, President Trump is on the precipice of one of the worst electoral defeats in modern presidential elections and the worst historically for an incumbent president.”
Trump’s campaign is also facing a growing disadvantage in the polls as a recent release by The New York Times/Siena College shows Biden ahead in the majority of battleground states Trump won in 2016.
Trump knows he’s losing \-- and that means he’ll do ANYTHING to keep his power in the White House. We need to keep our data accurate, that’s why we’re conducting our own poll. Let us know now:

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,The plan to save our elections from dark money,"Hi Alex,
If you’ve had it with the corruption in Washington, there’s a new solution you should consider.
Democratic congressional candidate Carolyn Long has proposed a sweeping anti-corruption plan that The Daily Chronicle reports “has two major parts: addressing the influence of corporate funding in elections, and tackling the ‘revolving door’ of those in politics moving to lobbying for interest groups and vice-versa.”
Carolyn’s plan calls for a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United and a lifetime ban on members of Congress becoming lobbyists, among many other provisions designed to keep our government as transparent and trustworthy as possible.
We support the plan, and we support Carolyn Long \-- and recent data shows her opponent, Republican incumbent Jaime Herrera Beutler, ahead in the polls by just 2 points. At 49-47, the race is still close enough for us to turn it around \-- but not without drawing more attention to Carolyn and her policies. That’s why we need your help. Please, help us flip a key seat in the House of Representatives by telling us now:
Do you want big money out of politics?
YES
NO

Loren Culp held his recent rally, quite fittingly, near Battle Ground, WA.
500 people attended his latest superspreader event, breathing in air that was hazardous because of both the threat of the virus and the presence of wildfire smoke.
Culp, the anti-vaxx, anti-science, climate denying Republican running for governor, echoed Trump’s lies about our fires being caused by poor forest management. At the end of his remarks, Culp reminded his rally-goers that “We need to remember that we are part of the greatest nation in the history of the world.”
If that’s true, it’s in spite of men like Culp \-- not because of them. We cannot allow this destructive behavior and dangerous sentiment to continue one more day. If you agree, tell us now:

The Washington Post reports that “The coronavirus crisis is energizing America’s anti-vaccine movement and expanding its reach.”
You can say that again. This radical, dangerous movement is right here in our state \-- GOP gubernatorial candidate Loren Culp is an anti-vaxxer, and the way the mainstream Republican Party has embraced him shows just how little they care about science and about our lives.
Unfortunately, this toxic strain of anti-establishment conspiracy theories has now become incredibly prolific. According to Pew Research Center, these days only 51% of Americans say they would either “definitely” or “probably” get a coronavirus vaccine. We need to stand up for science and save lives by standing with the truth: vaccines vetted by the career officials in our national public health agencies are safe, secure, and effective. If you agree, please make your voice heard, and help us stand strong against this latest unacceptable GOP fearmongering. Tell us now:
Do you trust vaccines our public health officials say are safe?
YES

In 2016, Mitch McConnell denied Barack Obama a Supreme Court appointment because there was an election 8 months away.
Now there’s an election already underway, and hundreds of thousands of votes have already been cast for the presidency. But before those ballots are counted, McConnell and his allies want to advance a far-right justice to serve on our highest court for life.
We can’t let them get away with this. The right to choose, the right to vote, the right to health care \-- they’re all at stake. We’ll only get one shot at protecting them from GOP nominee Amy Coney Barrett. That’s why it’s so crucial we make our voices heard now.
Please, Alex, add your name to ours now. Tell Mitch McConnell that Justice Ginsburg’s seat CANNOT be filled before the November election. It’s what she wanted. It’s what we want. And it’s the precedent Republicans already set in 2016. We must hold the GOP accountable, but we can’t do it without you. Please, click here now to help us save SCOTUS and save America.

We need to mobilize voters like we never have before \-- we cannot afford to allow any more science-denying Republicans to make any policy decisions that impact our communities.

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,WA Post reports Michelle Obama is stepping into the 2020 election,"Hi Alex,
As demands for justice were made worldwide, Michelle Obama stepped into the 2020 election.
The former First Lady launched “Civic Cities,” a bipartisan program designed to combat rampant voter suppression by collaborating with 31 mayors across the country to increase voter registration and civic engagement in their cities.
Michelle Obama’s efforts couldn’t have started at a better time, as Trump and his GOP cronies are executing a MASSIVE voter suppression campaign.
Trump has called the vote by mail process “a great Voter Fraud scenario” and threatened to “hold up funding” should states move forward in issuing absentee ballots.
These outbursts aren’t random though \-- right now, presidential polls show him trailing Vice President Biden in key swing states. And the fact is national Republicans know that when we make it easier to vote, more Democrats turn out.
That’s why Trump allies like Washington state’s own Secretary of State Kim Wyman (our chief elections officer) and GOP incumbents have failed to condemn Trump’s attack on voting rights.
Today we’re conducting a survey to gauge your support of Michelle Obama and her plans to stop voter suppression ahead of this year’s election. Please, let us know:
Do you support Michelle Obama?
YES
NO
Thank you so much for participating in surveys like this one. Your answers will help inform our 2020 strategies, and we couldn’t run these programs without your insight.

“Mike Pence literally does not believe in science.”
That’s a quote from Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and it’s more than born out by the facts. Pence has refused to acknowledge climate change is a threat. He refused to wear a face mask at the Mayo Clinic; the move was not only blatantly disrespectful, but also a danger to everyone in the room. Perhaps worst of all, he’s been a national role model for the kind of anti-science sentiment we’ve seen in our state \-- giving men like Loren Culp an implicit endorsement of all their most reckless rhetoric and harmful behavior.
Kamala Harris, on the other hand, has called climate change an “existential threat,” and has repeatedly highlighted the importance of public health guidelines as well as vigorously called for environmental justice.
But Pence has said he “can’t wait” to debate Harris, accusing her of representing the “radical left.” We’re sure that’s the case he’ll try to make onstage tonight \-- and are reaching out to show our support for our Democratic ticket in advance of Pence’s factless smears.

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,"Trump says mail-in ballots are ""dangerous""","Hi Alex,
Last week in Wisconsin, voters stood in line to vote in the primary in the middle of a global pandemic because the conservative state legislature and the Republican majority on the state supreme court refused to allow the election to be postponed until June.
Forcing people to put health and the safety of their neighbors on the line to cast their ballots is shameful when mail-in ballots could have been distributed to prevent the spread of the virus.
Unfortunately, Trump and his GOP cronies know that increasing access to ballots and ensuring more people vote results in larger turnout for Democrats \-- and they’ll do anything to keep the power they’ve won by suppressing voter turnout for decades.
Trump even directly attacked mail-in ballots, calling them “horrible,” “corrupt,” and “dangerous.” (Even though the liar in chief voted absentee in Florida just last month.)
Today, we need to hear from you in our new voting access survey. Please let us know:
Do agree with Trump that mail-in ballots are “dangerous”?

KING5 reported Tim Eyman’s heinous and indefensible comments comparing the actions of the policeman who murdered George Floyd to Governor Inslee’s actions to keep us safe during COVID. On a Facebook live, Eyman said it’s hard to watch the video of the murder of George Floyd without “visualizing Jay Inslee with his knee on the back of the necks of 7 million people in the state of Washington.”
He responded to press inquiries with a ranting, unhinged 21-minute speech where he never apologized, doubled down on his attacks, played the victim, and demonized the “media” \-- somehow reaching a new low even for him. (Before this, we considered the time he stole a $70 chair from Office Depot as his lowest low.)
Tim Eyman is the top-polling WA GOP candidate for governor according to the most recent poll, and he’s growing quite the following in his far-right circles. That’s why we need to hear from you on your approval of Eyman:
Do you approve of Tim Eyman?
YES
NO
Thank you for taking today's survey.
We can't stop far-right GOPers like Eyman without YOU.

Trump and his gang of extremists have put white supremacists in the White House, ran rampant voter suppression efforts, and enacted a number of disgusting racist policies to divide our country. All the while AG Bob Ferguson, Gov.

Listen, I don’t think I’ve seen a contribution from you yet \-- is that true? (If you did give, thanks and apologies for the extra email. The 2020 race is just so important.)
This year, we’re working to mobilize Democrats across the state so we can stop Trump allies like Matt Shea and GOP leaders who have fallen silent like Jaime Herrera Beutler. Right now, we’re still $7,850 short of what we need to raise before tomorrow night’s town hall, so whatever you can give TODAY is absolutely essential.

Trump’s continued threats and actions against citizens rising up to protest police brutality are nothing less than a complete betrayal of his office and the sacred obligation of the President to comfort the country in a time of crisis.
Every elected official, regardless of party, should be unified in rejecting this wholesale abandonment of American values. We should all come together to listen to the calls for justice ringing out in the streets of every city in America.
This November, it’s all on the line \-- and we can’t take a single thing for granted in our effort to stop Trump and his GOP cronies from rolling our country back decades. Right now, we’re keeping track to ensure every Washington Democrat votes in November, that’s why we need you to pledge to vote now.
Do you pledge to vote this November?
YES
NO
We can’t build on our progress without you.

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,Loren Culp thinks he’s above WA voters -- and the law,"Hi Alex,
In its recent profile of Loren Culp, the Seattle Times highlighted just how dangerously unfit he is to serve.
Culp sees himself as knowing better than WA voters, opposing a gun safety measure supported by 59% of the electorate. He also thinks he knows better than the court system, absurdly declaring that “lawyers and judges don’t know the U.S. Constitution because it is not routinely taught in law schools.”
Finally, Culp thinks he knows better than the millions of Americans who’ve recently decried systemic racism in law enforcement, denying it’s a problem and saying of Jacob Blake: “I would have shot that person.”
There you have it: Culp is unquestionably an egomaniac who views himself as judge, jury, and executioner of the law. But he’s routinely drawing hundreds of enthusiastic supporters to his in-person rallies, and just got a massive amount of press from his feature in the Times. We need to make sure Washingtonians know just how dangerous Culp really is, and that starts with sending an unmistakable message. So please, if you want to make your views on Culp known, tell us now:
Do you approve of Loren Culp?
YES
NO

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,We really didn’t want to have to send this email,"Morning, Alex!
Tina has been reaching out about our April 2020 budget \-- when she wrote yesterday, we were STILL falling behind target.
We wish we didn’t have to tell you this, but we fell short of goal yesterday.
Missing our fundraising benchmarks at a time when all statewide elected officials are too focused on keeping people in our state safe to fundraise on their own will severely impact our voter turnout efforts \-- and right now, the far-right GOP challengers running against our Dems have the advantage.
Matt Shea and his far right friends turned out more than 2,500 people for a rally in Olympia earlier this month \-- that puts so many of us in danger. Now, he has another planned for tomorrow.
Luckily, tonight we’re hosting a town hall with the Democratic candidate who is running against him in 2020, and at WA Dems, we’re going to make sure this is Shea’s last term.
If we’re going to defeat Trump and his GOP apologists up and down the ballot here in WA, we MUST lay the groundwork for a winning Democratic strategy across the state.
But we cannot afford to miss our goals \-- and without your contributions to our efforts, we will have to scale back on our coordinated campaign efforts right when we should be ramping up.
While the GOP are running strategies to set us back decades, it’s up to us to continue building for our Democratic leaders.
That’s why we are really counting on you to give just $5, $25, $50, or whatever you can to help us get back on track today.
If we can raise another $5,210 TODAY, we’ll be back on track. Can you please rush us an emergency contribution immediately? Here’s the link: [[URL REDACTED]]

We saw a video last week of a GOP candidate forum where the moderator asked the candidates for governor to raise their hands if they identified as “pro-Trump.” This was their response:
Screenshot of GOP candidates Joshua Freed, Phil Fortunato, Anton Sakharov, Loren Culp, and Tim Eyman during a GOP candidate forum on Zoom hosted by Marty McClendon. All candidates have their hands raised.
We can’t allow any of these GOP candidates to get in the way of the progress Gov. Jay Inslee is making. That’s why our team is working around the clock to ensure every voter we need to generate a sweeping Democratic victory this November turns their ballot in. We’re organizing virtual trainings and events every day, hosting our own candidate forums to elevate the message of Democrats running to stop Trump-allies and far-right incumbents, but we can’t do this without you.
Today we’re conducting a survey on the GOP’s unwavering support for Donald Trump despite his ignorant displays of bigotry and continued failures in leadership. Please let us know:
Will you vote to stop the GOP in November?
YES

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,The danger of Culp's rallies,"Hi Alex,
On the eve of his primary victory, Republican gubernatorial candidate Loren Culp held an in-person rally. It included food, live music, and according to Culp, about 1,500 attendees.
Culp’s staff called it the “biggest party of the year.”
We won’t comment on that \-- but it was certainly the grossest disrespect for public health we’ve seen in Washington.
Per Governor Inslee’s reopening guidelines, any gathering of more than 5 people is banned in Cheval County. But Culp’s ego and ignorance endangered 300 times that number of people in a single night \-- as well as everyone those rally-goers went on to interact with in the following days. Here’s the worst part: Culp’s campaign didn’t even require attendees to wear masks, the simplest and most effective countermeasure to prevent coronavirus spread at any gathering.
This isn’t the first rally Culp has held during the pandemic, but with your help, it will be the last. We need to send a message NOW denouncing Culp’s reckless endangerment of the people of our state and demanding it not go any further. Will you help us? Tell us your view:
Do you condemn in-person, maskless rallies during the pandemic?
YES
NO

First, thank you so much for all you’ve done to help us lay the framework for our 2020 strategy to stop Trump and his far-right cronies in our state. Your support helps us launch voter turnout campaigns to support Democrats running in every race in every place.
We’re doing game-changing work on the ground, but the fact is, we can’t sustain these efforts if we miss our goals. And last night, I’m sorry to say we failed to reach our goal. I have to check in with Tina and our team to see how we can adapt, but I can tell you that none of the options are good for our chances of defending our historic majorities in Olympia this fall.
If we can make up the difference by tonight, however, our strategy will be fine \-- but if we fall short, we’ll have to make cuts to next week’s strategy in order to account for this gap in our resources.
Here’s the thing: because Facebook and Google refuse to follow our state’s campaign finance laws, our state legislative candidates can’t use the most cost-effective digital advertising methods to get their message out. That means they’re even more reliant on our Coordinated Campaign to get out the vote, and with primary election ballots arriving in voters’ mailboxes in about a month, we’re in crunch time.
I am hopeful that we can catch back up to where we need to be by midnight, but that means I’m counting on YOU and every engaged Democrat who knows we can’t let the GOP get ahead of our efforts to move our nation forward. We’ve got to raise $3,120 TODAY.
Please, will you pitch in $1, $5, $10, $25, or whatever you can now?

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,The president’s use of military-style force,"Hi Alex,
Amid the pain and anger in American cities in response to systemic racism, the President called for shooting and violence. Trump has called himself the “President of law and order.”
After bunkering down in the White House from peaceful protesters standing in Lafayette Square, Trump and his cronies made a plan to deliver an address from a historic church in D.C. But first, they needed to get the people out of the way so Trump could walk to the church and wave a bible for a photo op.
D.C.’s curfew came into effect at 7 p.m., but before people could disperse, Attorney General William P. Barr ordered their removal. This led to the use of rubber bullets, tear gas, and flash-bang grenades against peaceful citizens.
Today, we want to hear from you about your thoughts on the president’s use of unnecessary and military-style force against his own people.
Do you support the militarization of the police?
YES
NO

The COVID-19 outbreak has cost many Americans their wages, but before the global pandemic spread, income inequality in the United States ranked among the worst of any developed nation.
The top 1% has continued to see wage increases \-- growing 138% since 1979. The wages of the bottom 90% of Americans, however, only increased by 15% in the last four decades. And that trend is set to continue.
The fact is not all jobs provide quality health insurance, living wages, a sense of dignity, or a safety net of savings \-- and economic disparity is on a rise, furthering the gaps between the haves and the have-nots.
Alex, right now, America’s top 10 percent average more than nine times as much income as the bottom 90 percent of us.

I’ve never been more proud of the Democrats fighting to protect this state, its people, and our rights. I’ve also never been more disgusted by the behavior and the rhetoric of the GOP.
But late last night, when I saw that we’d crossed over the threshold and so many of you stepped up to crush our end-of-quarter FEC goal \-- well, that’s just about the happiest I’ve felt all cycle long. At a time when we’re all still so isolated to protect the health of our community, knowing there are so many of you out there standing with us in the home stretch of this fight means so much to not just me, but all our staff working tirelessly to get out the vote.

Your generosity is going to send a clear message to the world: that everyday Americans control the future of this country and will do anything to ensure we’re protected.

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,We need to protect the ACA,"Hi Alex,
In the middle of a global pandemic, Americans shouldn’t have to worry about how they’ll cover the hospital costs if they or a loved one falls ill. Having strong public health infrastructure is more important than ever \-- right now, the Affordable Care Act should be something Americans can depend on.
Instead, we know that the GOP and Trump’s allies across the country are still working to destroy the ACA right when Americans need expansive coverage most.
Every day, our coverage is under threat of another GOP lawsuit while real people are getting sick without the resources they need to fully recover.
That’s why at the WA Dems, we’re working to protect the ACA \-- and we need your help to do so.
Alex, if you believe no American should be left without coverage, sign our petition IMMEDIATELY to show your support of this landmark policy. We need 250 signers TODAY.
It’s up to us to protect the ACA.
Thank you for joining us.

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,Your next president and vice-president,"Hey Alex,
Joe Biden’s pick for vice president is Kamala Harris \-- a leader with a proven track record of leading based on science, fighting for criminal justice reform, and pushing back against GOP voter suppression.
With both party’s tickets officially decided, we now face a clear choice in November: we’ll either re-elect Trump and Pence or replace them with Biden and Harris.
We’ll either have a government that listens to science or one that punishes its experts for doing their jobs. We’ll either expand the Affordable Care Act or restrict and repeal it. We’ll either take decisive action on climate change, setting ourselves up for a brighter and cleaner energy future \-- or pillage our public lands and resources while the next global crisis looms ever closer.
And looking at the way Trump and the GOP are gearing up to suppress the vote, we know nothing less than a blue wave will do in order to carry our Democratic champions to the White House and carry our best hopes forward for America. That’s why we need the latest data from supporters like you, immediately. Almost a million voters sat on the sidelines in WA in 2016. Will you commit right now to making a stand in the most important election of our lifetimes?
Will you vote Biden/Harris in 2020?

NO
We greatly appreciate your responses today \-- they will help us win the election.

Tina Podlodowski,info@wa-democrats.org,We need to ensure every person votes,"Hi Alex,
Trump and the GOP operate on a strategy to roll back decades of hard-won progressive policies with their dangerous, extremist ideology.
We cannot forget that they have separated immigrant families and locked kids in cages, instituted the Muslim ban, and proposed the idea of putting a moat along our southern border filled with snakes and alligators and shooting any immigrants who try to cross.
Now, they’re pushing to re-open the economy with complete disregard for our seniors and those who are immunocompromised. And just last week, Trump told reporters he wants to “terminate” health care under the Affordable Care Act.
Not one WA GOPer has spoken out against this decision to strip health care from their constituents.
Look, the GOP is still pushing their lawsuit to destroy the Obama-era policy which provides 3.1 million Washingtonians with pre-existing conditions affordable health care coverage. We have to stop them.
At WA Dems, we know that we can’t coast through the 2020 presidential election simply because our state has a history of voting blue \-- we need to work harder than ever to reach every voter and ensure widespread voter turnout to stop Trump and his cronies.
Right now, we’re at a major benchmark in our efforts: our mid-quarter goal. And we are SHORT.
Today, I am counting on you to help us raise $10,420 before Friday at MIDNIGHT to help us power our aggressive voter turnout efforts in Washington state. Alex, will you make your first contribution of $1, $5, $10, $25, or whatever you can now?
Here’s the link to put more digital tools in the hands of our organizers, train THOUSANDS of volunteers on our new strategies, and turn out every voter we need to win: [[URL REDACTED]]

Best,

In Portland, we've witnessed an alarming abuse of power against American citizens. The president deployed badge-less federal agents across the city. These agents have used violence against peaceful protesters, assaulting people in the streets before throwing them into unmarked vehicles.
Now, we've read reports that Donald Trump is planning to deploy more federal law enforcement agents to Chicago and other American cities. The WA GOP candidates, who call themselves ""constitutional conservatives,"" have failed to condemn Trump's lawless actions and dog-whistle politics.
As the GOP candidates for governor and every far-right extremist down the ballot imitate the president, we need you to add your name to denounce the behavior of Donald Trump and his use of federal force against protesters.
Thank you for standing up for our actual Constitution by adding your name and supporting our work to resist this lawless administration.

Donald Trump is attacking our schools and spreading anti-science lies. And his lack of leadership has caused this virus to kill nearly 150,000 Americans and sink our economy. Yet the GOP is running on his record as this administration seeks to block funding for testing, tracing, and the CDC.
While Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump continue to ignore their duty to protect the American people from this pandemic, our Washington Democrats remain focused on defeating this virus, reopening our economy responsibly, and building a Washington that is fairer and more equitable.

We are finally getting the chance to say no to Trump and his administration’s tyranny.

That’s why we won’t relent in checking in with our supporters to ensure that all ballots will be cast.

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,Loren Culp thinks he’s above Washington voters -- and the law,"Hi Alex,
In its recent profile of Loren Culp, the Seattle Times highlighted just how dangerously unfit he is to serve.
Culp sees himself as knowing better than WA voters, opposing a gun safety measure supported by 59% of the electorate. He also thinks he knows better than the court system, absurdly declaring that “lawyers and judges don’t know the U.S. Constitution because it is not routinely taught in law schools.”
Finally, Culp thinks he knows better than the millions of Americans who’ve recently decried systemic racism in law enforcement, denying it’s a problem and saying of Jacob Blake: “I would have shot that person.”
There you have it: Culp is unquestionably an egomaniac who views himself as judge, jury, and executioner of the law. But he’s routinely drawing hundreds of enthusiastic supporters to his in-person rallies, and just got a massive amount of press from his feature in the Times. We need to make sure Washingtonians know just how dangerous Culp really is, and that starts with sending an unmistakable message. So please, if you want to make your views on Culp known, tell us now:
Do you approve of Loren Culp?

Loren Culp’s vanity tour of reckless endangerment has wound its way through another Washington locale \-- this time the city of Bellingham.
Though gatherings of more than 5 are banned as part of Whatcom County’s second phase of reopening, Culp assembled hundreds of his most loyal supporters to celebrate his ascendency to the GOP nomination \-- all, of course, without a mask in sight.
Culp’s rally wasn’t just a potential superspreader event for disease, its messaging also spread grossly irresponsible rhetoric \-- with Culp telling his followers that COVID is no big deal because, like AIDS, it comes and goes. Culp then finished up his sermon of death with a terrifying message of blind nationalism and left the stage to thunderous applause.
We wish we were making this up. We’re not. Culp isn’t just putting hundreds of lives at risk \-- he’s whipping his supporters into a frenzy. We have to stand against this, now, before anyone gets hurt \-- by the virus or by Governor Loren Culp. If you demand an end to this dangerous chaos, stand with us now:

During a Senate testimony on Capitol Hill, Dr. Anthony Fauci, America’s leading health expert, warned that states reopening too quickly would cause economic damage and “suffering and death that could be avoided.”
After, Trump did a Fox Business interview and attempted to discredit Fauci and lead the public to believe the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases gave him bad advice early on.
The round-the-clock attacks on Dr. Fauci and the GOP political stunts are proof that Trump and his cronies are running on an anti-science platform.
Despite the recommendations of experts and poll after poll showing the vast majority of Washingtonians and Americans support following health guidelines and science, the Washington GOP is running on mass infection, herd immunity, and partisan stunts to support Trump’s message.

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,Culp’s rallies: Washingtonians are dying to get in,"Hi Alex,
On the eve of his primary victory, Republican gubernatorial candidate Loren Culp held an in-person rally. It included food, live music, and according to Culp, about 1,500 attendees.
Culp’s staff called it the “biggest party of the year.”
We won’t comment on that \-- but it was certainly the grossest disrespect for public health we’ve seen in Washington.
Per Governor Inslee’s reopening guidelines, any gathering of more than 5 people is banned in Cheval County. But Culp’s ego and ignorance endangered 300 times that number of people in a single night \-- as well as everyone those rally-goers went on to interact with in the following days. Here’s the worst part: Culp’s campaign didn’t even require attendees to wear masks, the simplest and most effective countermeasure to prevent coronavirus spread at any gathering.
This isn’t the first rally Culp has held during the pandemic, but with your help, it will be the last. We need to send a message NOW denouncing Culp’s reckless endangerment of the people of our state and demanding it not go any further. Will you help us? Tell us your view:
Do you condemn in-person, maskless rallies during the pandemic?
YES
NO
Thanks for taking our quick poll.
We appreciate your input.

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,Chair Thief Extraordinaire vs. Gov. Jay Inslee,"Alex,
2020 primary ballots are hitting mailboxes starting today. That means in just a couple of weeks, we’ll know who the WA GOP has nominated to take on Gov. Jay Inslee in the November 4 gubernatorial contest.
Over the next couple of days, we'll be sending out a series of surveys to ensure you know exactly who we'll be up against this November. First up is Tim Eyman, who is perhaps most famous for stealing a $70 office chair from the Office Depot in Lacey, though we think his decades of running deceitful ballot measures and flouting campaign finance laws for his personal profit are also ‘notable’ accomplishments.
Mr. Eyman is accustomed to bad headlines, but his unhinged and deplorable comparisons between the cop who murdered George Floyd and Governor Inslee’s actions to protect Washington from COVID-19 are beyond the pale. Did Eyman apologize? Of course not. Instead, he and his lawyer continued to use inappropriate and racially inflammatory language to distract from the issues and play the victim.
This week, we need to hear from you about your support for the GOP gubernatorial candidates. Please let us know:
Do you approve of Tim Eyman?
YES
NO
Thanks for your participation \-- we're looking forward to the result.

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,Let’s not let the national race distract us from the battle for our schools,"Hi Alex,
There’s a monumental threat facing our public education system.
Current Superintendent of Public Instruction Chris Reykdal, the progressive leader who’s fought to increase teacher pay and close the student achievement gap as Superintendent, is facing a Republican challenger cast straight from the mold of Betsy DeVos.
That challenger, Maia Espinoza, wants to defund public schools. She’s lied to voters about having a master’s degree. She’s lied about Chris’s record, equating comprehensive sex education with teaching “sexual positions to fourth graders.” She’s never even been a public educator \-- instead, Espinoza is an acolyte of Donald Trump and Betsy DeVos, and has found common cause with the 3% militia (the far-right paramilitary group hanging her campaign signs at their rallies.)
Reykdal has our firm support. But Espinoza is outraising and outspending him. If she wins this race, our students and teachers will pay the price.
Imagine if Donald Trump or Loren Culp were in charge of our schools -- that’s what we’d get with Maia Espinoza. We’re sticking up for Chris Reykdal and champions of evidence-based education up and down the ballot before it’s too late, and asking for your support in doing the same. Please, give what you can to support Reykdal and support our work to back Democrats all up and down the ballot this election -- the future of WA depends on it.
Thank you for saving our schools \-- and our state \-- from the GOP.

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,Culp gets a broad platform for a dangerous message,"Hi Alex,
Right now, a YouTube video of Trump loyalist Loren Culp is gaining thousands of views online. In the clip, Culp speaks with King 5’s Chris Daniels \-- and invokes some very troubling history in order to explain his philosophies.
Gun reform, Culp says, is a bit like the Japanese-American internment during World War II: they’re both things Democrats decided “needed to be done for our safety.”
Alex, just a few short weeks ago, Republican state Rep. Vicki Kraft compared Governor Inslee to Hitler over our state’s stay-at-home orders. Now, Culp is embracing a similar message on a wider platform. This is how the WA GOP is trying to win their races -- make bad-faith, misleading comparisons to the worst moments in world history and hope voters fall for it.
It’s disconcerting to see a man like Culp sitting calmly in a cafe, having a drink and heaping blame on Democrats for everything from looting to systemic racism in policing to our raging wildfires. It’s even more disturbing that no one in the video is refuting Culp’s claims \-- instead, Culp is speaking freely, addressing voters across the state while mood music plays in the background. We refuse to allow Culp, Kraft, or any WA GOPer who spreads such dangerous and inaccurate information to be normalized. We’re taking a stand now, against the alternative facts of the alt-right and for the truth \-- are you with us? Tell us now:
Do you condemn the WA GOP?
YES
NO

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,Michelle Obama is stepping into the 2020 election,"Hi Alex,
As demands for justice were made worldwide, Michelle Obama stepped into the 2020 election.
The former First Lady launched “Civic Cities,” a bipartisan program designed to combat rampant voter suppression by collaborating with 31 mayors across the country to increase voter registration and civic engagement in their cities.
Michelle Obama’s efforts couldn’t have started at a better time, as Trump and his GOP cronies are executing a MASSIVE voter suppression campaign.
Trump has called the vote by mail process “a great Voter Fraud scenario” and threatened to “hold up funding” should states move forward in issuing absentee ballots.
These outbursts aren’t random though \-- right now, presidential polls show him trailing Vice President Biden in key swing states. And the fact is national Republicans know that when we make it easier to vote, more Democrats turn out.
That’s why Trump allies like Washington state’s own Secretary of State Kim Wyman (our chief elections officer) and GOP incumbents have failed to condemn Trump’s attack on voting rights.
Today we’re conducting a survey to gauge your support of Michelle Obama and her plans to stop voter suppression ahead of this year’s election. Please, let us know:
Do you support Michelle Obama?
YES
NO
Thank you so much for participating in surveys like this one. Your answers will help inform our 2020 strategies, and we couldn’t run these programs without your insight.

Tina Podlodowski,info@wa-democrats.org,We need to keep our distance,"Hi Alex,
For the past week, our team members at the Washington State Democratic Party have been working remotely and practicing social-distancing. We sincerely hope you’re doing the same if your job allows for it.
As Governor Inslee said on Monday, normal life just can’t be in our game plan for a little while. We all have to come together to slow the spread of this virus to help save the lives of those whose immune systems can’t fight it off if they get it. By following public health officials’ guidance, we’re all helping to keep our hospitals from being overwhelmed and keeping the number of Washingtonians who suffer from the disease as low as possible. That’s why we’re all dealing with difficult disruptions to our daily lives with gyms, restaurants, and other entertainment and social spaces closed temporarily.
But unfortunately, even this national emergency isn’t enough to stop Republicans in the other Washington from playing partisan politics. Instead of immediately reconvening to pass emergency aid to working families, Sen. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other Senate Republicans have reportedly been making overtures to judges on the federal bench who are eligible for retirement \-- and are asking them to retire sooner rather than later. In response to this deadly pandemic, members of the national GOP are still focused on packing the courts for generations to come instead of helping people who are suffering right now.
And in Washington state, the GOP’s leading candidate for governor and long-time conman, Tim Eyman, decided he was above these precautions. He called for 251 “patriots” to meet up in Oak Harbor to discuss the pandemic \-- and so he could claim that our government’s measures to protect public health were an overreaction to the virus’s rapid spread here in Washington state. Thankfully, only about 60 people showed up to the event that Eyman said he would bring a “six pack of Corona” to. There’s no question that Eyman can’t be trusted to take the job of governing our state seriously.
We’re disappointed \-- but frankly not surprised \-- to see the national GOP and people like Tim Eyman spreading misinformation and putting people in danger.
That’s why we wanted to check in with you today to ensure you are taking the necessary steps to flatten the curve of this pandemic:
1. Practice strong “social” or “physical” distancing \-- if possible, do not go into places where people gather. Be prepared to stay home for several weeks. By isolating yourself during this process, we can reduce the spread and the number of people infected. Your decision to isolate yourself will save lives \-- so thank you for doing your part.
2. Stay connected! Check your local news for more guidance, and also, check in with one another by phone or online. We’re entering a period where many folks will feel the impact of social distancing, but there are small actions we can take to keep ourselves connected.
3. If you are feeling sick, call your primary healthcare physician or 311 if you do not have a provider. They will tell you what your next steps for care should be. Follow their recommendations!
With GOP leaders pushing partisan spin and burying their heads in the sand during a public health crisis, it has never been more clear: our country can’t afford another four years of Trump and his fellow science-deniers in the GOP here in Washington state.
That’s why, even in this tough time, our organizing strategy cannot stop. We’re pivoting to remote organizing strategies, spinning up new tools for our thousands of trained volunteers to keep reaching out to their neighbors without door-to-door canvassing, and will be ready to hit the ground sprinting when this outbreak passes.
If you and your family are in the position to keep our statewide strategy fully-funded and ever-adapting, then we need your help. Will you rush a contribution of $25 or whatever you can now to help us protect our country from another four years of Trump?
Thank you and stay safe,
Tina (and everybody at the WA Dems)

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,What Culp is spreading at his in-person rallies,"Hi Alex,
Loren Culp’s vanity tour of reckless endangerment has wound its way through another Washington locale \-- this time the city of Bellingham.
Though gatherings of more than 5 are banned as part of Whatcom County’s second phase of reopening, Culp assembled hundreds of his most loyal supporters to celebrate his ascendency to the GOP nomination \-- all, of course, without a mask in sight.
Culp’s rally wasn’t just a potential superspreader event for disease, its messaging also spread grossly irresponsible rhetoric \-- with Culp telling his followers that COVID is no big deal because, like AIDS, it comes and goes. Culp then finished up his sermon of death with a terrifying message of blind nationalism and left the stage to thunderous applause.
We wish we were making this up. We’re not. Culp isn’t just putting hundreds of lives at risk \-- he’s whipping his supporters into a frenzy. We have to stand against this, now, before anyone gets hurt \-- by the virus or by Governor Loren Culp. If you demand an end to this dangerous chaos, stand with us now:
Do you condemn Culp's in person rallies?

With anti-science, Trump-loving gubernatorial candidates running to defeat Gov. Jay Inslee, our coordinated campaign is absolutely key to protecting the progress our governor and ALL our down ballot Democrats have made.
We’re not about to let the far-right GOPers get ahead of us.

But like we mentioned, we’re just a bit behind on tonight’s goal. With your support today, we’ll crush this goal. Here’s how close we are to goal as of this morning:
image of a progress bar showing $12,590 raised from 67 donations towards a $15,000 goal

Alex, we’re counting on YOU and every engaged Democrat who knows we can’t let the GOP get ahead of our efforts to move our nation forward.
Please, will you pitch in $1, $5, $10, $25, or whatever you can now? Thanks so much for standing with us today.

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,The GOP is dragging AG Bob Ferguson’s name through the mud,"Hey Alex,
GOP attorney general candidate Matt Larkin wants you to think AG Bob Ferguson “likes to go after people who disagree with him politically. He likes to go after people who don’t fund his campaign. There’s a bent in his office toward people he agrees with.”
Larkin has even stooped to accusing AG Ferguson of selfishly neglecting his office, saying that he has “checked out. He’s not protecting the people of Washington anymore.”
Republicans are clearly scared if they’re resorting to baseless accusations against AG Ferguson’s character. They know that his legal defense record is stellar \-- he’s proven himself a fighter for all Washingtonians. In just this term alone, he’s strived to protect the USPS and the Affordable Care Act and instigated 78 other lawsuits in pursuit of our state’s interests and the interests of every American resisting the Trump agenda.
But Larkin and Washington Republicans remain hell-bent on dragging AG Ferguson’s name through the mud. It just might be enough to let Republicans seize control of the office once again after 7 years out of power. With less than a month before Election Day, we just can’t afford any more damage from the GOP’s lies. They’ll continue to smear AG Ferguson, so we’re rallying our supporters: We want our bold Attorney General to see who is behind him. If you’re standing with our AG against these baseless personal attacks, please confirm it now:
Do you support Attorney General Bob Ferguson?
YES
NO

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,Trump called the USPS a “joke”,"Hi Alex,
While the far-right WA GOPers in our state are holding mass protests, the Washington Dems are joining the fight to advocate for national vote-by-mail. We know that in WA state, implementing a vote-by-mail process has made our elections freer and more open \-- and it helped secure record-high turnout in our presidential primary earlier this year.
But while we’re working with other state party leaders across the country, Donald Trump has been attacking the USPS, withholding relief and even calling one of the most beloved agencies a “joke.” Trump’s continued rejections of a USPS bailout could have a severe impact on our vote-by-mail process this November as well as hurt our families in rural and low-income communities.
Today, we’re conducting an instant poll of Washingtonians \-- and we want to hear from you now. Please let us know:
Do you support the United States Postal Service?
YES
NO

“The problem with democracy \-- and you can look at quotes from infamous Chinese leaders like Mao Zedong, Mikhail Gorbachev, they love democracy \-- because democracy is a step toward socialism, which is a step toward communism.”
Who else would say that but Loren Culp?
First, Culp refused to enforce a gun control initiative supported by the majority of the electorate because he thought he knew better than the Washingtonians he served. Then he refused to follow the public health guidelines set by our governor, holding packed rallies in open defiance and again taking the law into his own hands.
Now Culp is speaking out against democracy itself. This is dangerous, Alex. We need to stand against this anti-democratic ideologue before it’s too late. Let us know in no uncertain terms what you’d prefer the future of American government to look like, and make Loren Culp look like the alt-right fool he is \-- as opposed to the Wild West strongman he’s pretending to be. Tell us now:
Do you want to live in a democracy this time next year?
YES
NO
We greatly appreciate your responses today. With your support, we can win this election.

Way back in March, Attorney General Bob Ferguson informed Washingtonians that he’d have an emergency lawsuit ready if Trump tried to delay the election. WA GOP Chair Caleb Heimlich called Ferguson’s warning a “scam,” and demanded he apologize.
A tweet from @realDonaldTrump reads “With Universal Mail-In Voting \(not Absentee Voting, which is good\), 2020 will be the most INACCURATE & FRAUDULENT Election in history. It will be a great embarrassment to the USA. Delay the Election until people can properly, securely, and safely vote???""

Who should apologize now?
In Ferguson’s own words, “We don't wait for something bad to happen, we anticipate what [Trump is] going to do, and try to prepare.” We’re glad we have an AG who’s two steps ahead of the GOP.

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,The pile of lies grows,"Hi Alex,
Earlier this month, Donald Trump authorized U.S. troops to kill Iranian Adm. Qassem Soleimani without Congress’s approval.
The administration first claimed Soleimani posed as an “imminent” threat to the United States, but Secretary of State Mike Pompeo admitted on Fox News that they didn’t know when or where the attack would occur. Now, the administration is breaking away from their own narrative stating the killing was carried out to deter attacks.
In the days since, the situation in the region has been tumultuous, and at our Peace Arch Border Crossing in Blaine, WA, more than 60 Iranian Americans were detained and questioned.
Reports show that they were questioned on their political views and allegiances for up to ten hours \-- these were American citizens coming back home from an Iranian pop concert in Vancouver. And they were targeted because of where they were born. We cannot stand for this blatant discrimination against Americans.
We know that’s just another GOP lie on the growing pile to run clean up for the president. With the November elections quickly approaching, we want to hear from you on your plan to vote in 2020. Please let us know:
Will you vote to stop Trump in November?
YES NO

Late last month, postal workers in Tacoma, Wenatchee, and Dallas restored the mail sorting machines that Postmaster General Louis DeJoy ordered decommissioned.
Just a few weeks ago, Democrats announced an investigation into DeJoy for, among other things, lying to Congress about attempts to influence the election.

Long story short? Everyday people \-- in the post office, in our virtual field offices, and even in the Capitol \-- are fighting GOP voter suppression and WINNING. But the fight’s not over yet \-- and it won’t be until DeJoy is removed from office, the USPS is restored, and all our WA Dems are protected and elected up and down the ticket. In this crucial homestretch, we need you to join the fight forward unto victory \-- are you with us? Tell us now:

When a reporter from The Washington Post asked Trump if he was concerned about the climate crisis, Trump replied, “Climate change is very important to me.”
Governor Jay Inslee, however, was quick to call the president’s bluff.
image of Jay Inslee’s Verified account @JayInslee from Dec 3. Inslee retweeted Aaron Rupar’s video tweet captioned: “TRUMP: ‘Climate change is very important to me. I’ve done many environmental impact statements over my life and I believe very strongly in very, very crystal clear, clean water and clean air. That’s a big part of climate change.” Inslee tweeted: “I want to be very, very crystal clear: He’s lying.”
Since taking office, Trump has rolled back 85 environmental protections. Air pollution and emissions, drilling and extraction, water pollution, animals, infrastructure and planning, and so many other protections have all gotten worse under Trump’s leadership.
Today, we need to hear from you before we roll out our 2020 strategy to stop Trump and the GOP from wreaking more havoc on our environment. Please add your response before midnight:
Should the U.S. take immediate action on climate change?
YES NO

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,Culp claims our leaders shouldn’t “even encourage” public safety,"Hi Alex,
NBC has reported that COVID-19 superspreader events are now a focus of concern for public health experts, as Donald Trump and 34 of his Republican officials have tested positive for the coronavirus.
But despite these growing public health concerns, Loren Culp has stayed true to his extremist anti-science views, claiming that our leaders shouldn’t mandate “or even encourage” the use of masks to prevent the deadly spread of the coronavirus \-- all while re-pledging his commitment to hosting maskless campaign rallies.
There have been over 95,000 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in Washington since the pandemic began, and Governor Inslee rightfully condemned Culp’s actions, stating that “it’s too dangerous to have a mini-Trump right now, in the middle of this pandemic.”
But Culp is hoping to gain political points by smearing Gov. Inslee’s public health measures, baselessly claiming that they infringe on freedom and liberty. We believe that Gov. Inslee’s swift actions have saved countless lives, especially since Donald Trump has continued to downplay this pandemic \-- and we are firmly standing with Gov. Inslee’s claim that “our fundamental duty is saving [American] lives.” But voters are still divided on the ethics of political rallies in our current climate, and today we need to know your view:
Do you condemn super-spreader events?
YES
NO

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,All the president’s lies,"Hi Alex,
Make no mistake about it: Donald Trump’s lies are costing American lives.
The president has tried his best to pass the blame for his failed COVID-19 response to ANYONE he could. Dr. Anthony Fauci, Democratic governors like our own Jay Inslee, former president Barack Obama, and 2020 Democratic nominee Joe Biden have all been targets of Trump’s lies.
Trump went as far as to claim that the Obama/Biden administration didn’t leave behind anything that could have helped handle such a major pandemic. But the truth is, our former White House duo left behind a ""pandemic playbook"" to help guide the Trump administration in the event of a health crisis. But Trump and his science-denying, far-right administration might as well have thrown the book in a dumpster fire when they cut funding from the CDC and withdrew from the World Health Organization.
Words matter, and THIS president DOES NOT use them wisely. We must cast our ballots as if our lives depend on it. Because at this point, they do. Alex, we need to hear from you:

Source: Twitter
Donald Trump’s efforts to delay the election and create doubt around its outcome are proof positive of how dangerous a rogue president can be. Even though Democratic control of the House will keep him from moving the election, it won’t stop him from trying to undermine confidence in our elections.
Even worse, Republicans in Congress have already allowed the president to usurp the power of the purse \-- happily adjourning for summer recess while Trump tried to take pandemic relief measures into his own hands. It’s clear they won’t check his abuse of power, even as it grows more blatant by the day. Only our Democrats in the House are standing in Trump’s way as he tries to undermine our elections.
As President Obama said during the DNC last week, we have to vote like never before, because Trump will try to tear down our democracy if he thinks it will help him win.
That’s exactly why we, the American people, have to answer President Obama’s call and protect our democracy.
Alex, the only thing that’s “INACCURATE” is Donald Trump's repeated lie about mail-in voting. We cannot allow the national embarrassment in the White House to delay, distort, or damage the electoral process any more. Add your name to ours now so we can DEMAND the election be held on time -- and hold Trump accountable to the will of the people in November.

Our Rise & Organize program needs to grow. If we can’t bring on more staff and recruit more volunteer leaders to help us turn out voters across Washington state, our paths to victory in races in every community will be tough to pull off.

Loren Culp’s vanity tour of reckless endangerment has wound its way through another Washington locale \-- this time the city of Bellingham.
Though gatherings of more than 5 are banned as part of Whatcom County’s second phase of reopening, Culp assembled hundreds of his most loyal supporters to celebrate his ascendency to the GOP nomination \-- all, of course, without a mask in sight.
Culp’s rally wasn’t just a potential superspreader event for disease, its messaging also spread grossly irresponsible rhetoric \-- with Culp telling his followers that COVID is no big deal because, like AIDS, it comes and goes. Culp then finished up his sermon of death with a terrifying message of blind nationalism and left the stage to thunderous applause.
We wish we were making this up. We’re not. Culp isn’t just putting hundreds of lives at risk \-- he’s whipping his supporters into a frenzy. We have to stand against this, now, before anyone gets hurt \-- by the virus or by Governor Loren Culp. If you demand an end to this dangerous chaos, stand with us now:

Republicans like Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler are a-okay with sacrificing our state’s values to their BIG special interests donors.
In fact, over the past ten years, she’s taken more than $3 million in PAC money. Her strongest supporters? Big Pharma. Real estate. Investment industries. She answers to her donors, not the people who elected her. She won’t even check in with her constituents. She’s neglected to hold a real town hall in 1,056 days.
So we were wondering what you think:
How much money would it cost you to get Jaime Herrera Beutler to call you back?
I shouldn’t have to give her money -- I’m a constituent!
$100 monthly, but she won’t listen until I give at least $1,000 total
$5,600 -- the highest amount individuals can give
The amount does not exist because I don’t have a big corporate PAC

We cannot afford another four years of Donald Trump’s toxic racism and we cannot allow white supremacists like Matt Shea to gain any more ground in our communities. We have 6 hours left to hit our midnight FEC goal and there’s $2,400 left to raise. Pitch in now: [[URL REDACTED]]

Diane Bedwell,info@wa-democrats.org,Checking in about our coordinated campaign,"Hi Alex \-- my name is Diane Bedwell, and I’m the Coordinated Campaign Director for the Washington Democrats.
I wanted to check in with you about the work we’re doing throughout our Rise & Organize program.
We’ve hired 8 organizers, 6 regional field directors, and a veteran team of senior staff who are hustling to ensure each and every volunteer has a strong grasp of not only how to persuade and influence voters to get their ballots in but also training volunteers individually now that we can’t host large group in-person training events. Our team gets volunteers set up on our dialer and our texting service \-- and every dollar contributed has helped make this happen.
With the primary right around the corner, I’m talking with Tina about the budget we need to win statewide and making adjustments to our strategy every single day based on whether we’re hitting our fundraising goals. Since we can’t rely on door knocking, we have to invest every penny we raise into direct voter outreach on our dialer and through our mass texting program \-- there’s just no other way to get our Democratic candidates across the finish line.
I’ve run the numbers. We’ve already had our Virtual Volunteers make more than 200,000 calls, but we’ve got to keep increasing our pace to get our candidates through the primary election in every swing district. To do that, we need to raise $18,250 before Tuesday night.
I know the power of grassroots energy; it’s what fuels our voter outreach strategy every day \-- and it’s why I’m reaching out now.
We need your help to boost our Rise & Organize program to ensure we stop Trump and his GOP allies across the state. Will you pitch in $25, $20, $5, $1, or whatever you can right now?
If you join us with a contribution now, I know we can close the gap. Please give what you can here: [[URL REDACTED]]

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,Another four years of Trump?,"Hi Alex,
Recently, Donald Trump announced his 2021 Federal Budget. His plan includes cuts to federal spending on Medicaid and funding for the National Institute of Health. Trump proposed completely eliminating the Public Service Loan Program despite its popularity, and he wants to move public school and pre-k funding to block grants, which will end funding for 21st Century Community Learning Centers. Those centers fund critical after-school programs for low-income families, programs in rural school districts, and education funding for homeless and migrant students.
To top it off, The New York Times reports that some of the deepest cuts proposed in Trump’s budget will impact the Environmental Protection Agency, reducing its budget by 26% and eliminating 50 programs that Trump believes to be “wasteful.”
His budget isn’t all cuts though. He wants to INCREASE the budget for the Space Force, the defense budget, ICE, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection.
At WA Dems, we’re working to ensure Trump is a one-term president and to elect Democrats up and down the ticket to reverse the dangerous policies enacted under his four years in office. But before we roll out our new strategy to win big this November, we need to hear from you:
Do you want another four years of Trump?
YES NO
We appreciate your feedback!

With a White House actively refusing to take responsibility for their actions (or lack thereof) and the WA GOPers who don’t give a damn about public safety, the stakes have never been higher.
I’m worried about the future of our state \-- and especially concerned about people in our rural areas that are hardest hit by GOP policies steeped in “false morality,” rather than community, caring, and good old-fashioned common sense.
Look, I take personal responsibility for ensuring our coordinated strategy is powerful enough to result in sweeping Democratic victories \-- and I hope you will join us in this critical fight.
We have $4,240 left to raise TODAY. Please, pitch in right now to help us hit our goal to stop Trump and his GOP cronies running strategies to roll us back decades.

Matt Shea’s “May Day Mutiny” is planned for today. Shea claims to be starting a rebellion \-- one that will put the health of thousands at risk \-- but this is just another show of far-right political theater.
The complete disregard the WA GOP has for the lives of Washingtonians is embarrassing and downright shameful. The so-called “pro-life” party would rather open up our state prematurely than protect the lives of people across our state.
Right now, an overwhelming majority of Washingtonians, including 78% of Republicans, strongly support taking necessary measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 \-- measures Governor Inslee is implementing \-- but GOP Minority Leader JT Wilcox refuses to criticize or hold members of his caucus responsible for endangering public safety by promoting these protests.

There’s a lot of talk about how Tim Eyman wants to run for Governor of WA \-- there are only two things you need to know about Eyman: one time he stole a $70 office chair from Office Depot, and he thinks white nationalist Matt Shea is “awesome.”
This man is a crook, a liar, and a grifter whose record of malfeasance includes everything from petty theft to defrauding campaign donors and taking hundreds of thousands of dollars in kickbacks.
We know he is completely unfit to run our state or manage our tax dollars \-- and if he launches his bid for Governor of Washington, we’re ready to expose him for exactly what he is.
With just a few weeks until 2020, we’re finalizing our strategy to unseat the GOP incumbents and elect Democrats up and down the ballot, but before we can put our strategy into play, we need to hear from YOU.

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,Matt Shea's far-right rally is TOMORROW,"Hi Alex,
State Rep. Matt Shea is organizing a far-right rally TOMORROW \-- this is a mass gathering in Olympia that he’s been promoting as his “May Day Mutiny” to protest our statewide shelter-in-place that will save lives.
In a post to Facebook, Shea wrote, “Please prepare yourself, your friends and your family for political action in the coming days and weeks. Enough is enough.” Another read, “Freedom is the cure.”
We’ve known it for a long time: Matt Shea is a danger to our democracy and the people around him. He wants to turn our government into a theocracy. He’s worked to spread his extremist ideologies across our state with his pamphlet, “Biblical Basis for War.” And he’s already promoted the training of young boys to fight in a “holy war.” And now, he’s calling members of the far-right and Trump allies to rally alongside him \-- a choice that will certainly cause a spike in COVID-19 cases and delay reopening our economy.
Today, we need to hear from you to see where you stand. Please let us know:
Do you approve of Matt Shea?
YES
NO
Thank you so much for your input, as it helps us build our strategy to defeat far-right leaders like Shea.

Without a doubt, these Charlottesville-like protests are a grave threat to our public health and our economy. Unfortunately, GOP leaders in our state, like Minority Leader J.T. Wilcox and Congresswoman Jaime Herrera Beutler, have been silent.

Trump has emboldened the worst in our country. Right now, Chinese-Americans are not only doing their best to avoid the coronavirus but also facing racist verbal and physical attacks.

On Facebook Live, Eyman said it’s hard to watch the video of the murder of George Floyd without “visualizing Jay Inslee with his knee on the back of the necks of 7 million people in the state of Washington.”
He responded to press inquiries with a ranting, unhinged 21-minute speech where he never apologized, doubled down on his attacks, played the victim, and demonized the “media” \-- somehow reaching a new low even for him. (Before this, we considered the time he stole a $70 chair from Office Depot as his lowest low.)

All candidates for elected office in Washington state have officially filed \-- and now, we know who we’re up against.
WA GOPers across the state have stepped up to take on our Washington Democrats, and it’s up to us to run a powerful coordinated campaign strategy that will protect the progress we’ve made to improve policy around voting rights, health care, and our environment.
And look, here’s the thing: state parties get Democrats elected \-- but if we don’t meet our goals, we can’t rush the early support we need to the candidates we need to win.
Because you’ve been so reliable in supporting our field team, we just expanded our staff and brought on a statewide field director, a King County regional field director, and 6 field organizers across the state who are working to train and recruit volunteers on our new digital strategy.
Our move to virtual volunteering requires more one-on-one time from our staff though. Each of our field organizers will play a critical role in ensuring our volunteers understand how to access and use our digital tools right from their computers \-- thanks to you, we’ve had the funds to expand our staff to meet this need.
But we’ve got to keep building our resources to ensure a sweeping victory for Democrats in every corner of the state. And right now, our resources are LOW.
I’ll be honest with you: fundraising has been challenging this month, and we’re doing everything we can to get back on track by the end of the week. Right now, we are $16,500 short -- and I’m personally asking you to give $25, $10, $5, or whatever you can now.
Thank you so much \-- we’ve got work to do, Alex!

Their strategy is going to drive us back decades \-- but our Democratic elected officials are fighting hard to protect our progress and move our country forward.
We’ve got to have their backs. Our 2020 Coordinated Campaign efforts are well underway, and we’re contacting HUNDREDS of voters a day \-- and THOUSANDS over the weekend thanks to our incredible volunteers. They’re making phone calls using our dialer tool and sending direct messages with the help of our texting tool, too.
Our voter outreach and communication strategies on the phones and through texting will be key to defending our Washington Dems now that we can’t rely on Facebook and Google to abide by WA state political advertising regulations \-- which means our candidates can’t advertise on their platforms.
Supporting our Rise & Organize program has never been more important \-- it is the sole way we can ensure Washingtonians have all the information they need to make their voice heard. And right now, we’re short of our June quarterly filing deadline, and I’m hoping I can count on you to help us raise $15,250 more before Tuesday night.
Missing this critical benchmark would mean we’ll have to scale back our July organizing efforts, which means we’ll have fewer resources, organizers, and volunteers throughout the state laying the groundwork for Democrats to win up and down the ticket in our August 4 primary.
That’s why I’m reaching out to you today. If we’re going to stay on track to stop the far-right GOP from gaining ground in our state, we’ve got to close this gap, and we can only count on WA Democrats like you to close it. And after his national embarrassment in Tulsa last weekend, you can bet that Trump will be leaning on his WA campaign chair Cathy McMorris-Rodgers to bring in mountains of national corporate cash to prop up his cronies across our state to avoid another crushing defeat.
Our statewide strategy is powerful enough to hand every Trump ally in WA a humiliating loss in our August primary, but not without your support. Please make your online contribution here: [[URL REDACTED]]

Trump and his far-right advisors in the White House just put out a set of rules in an attempt to block immigrants from entering the country based solely on their income.

Please, we need you to add your name to our petition now to demand Congress stand up to the administration's latest attack on immigrants.
Thank you for standing with us today.

Rep. Frank Chopp,info@wa-democrats.org,2019 year in review from Speaker Frank Chopp,"Dear Friends and Neighbors,
The 2019 state legislative session was one of the most productive and progressive in decades. I championed policies prioritizing affordable housing; health and wellness, including behavioral health; free higher education for those who need it most; fully funding K-12 education, and protecting the environment.
But there is more work to be done. I am leading efforts to develop thousands of affordable homes for low-wage workers and low-income people in need.
Below is a round-up of all the progress we've made this year, and if you'd like to be involved in continuing to move our state forward you can sign up to join me here: [[URL REDACTED]]

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,Birther conspiracy theorists descend on WA,"Hi Alex,
Unless you live in Thurston County, you probably don’t recognize the name Carolina Mejia, but she’s exactly the type of candidate we should all be excited about representing the future of the Democratic Party here in Washington: after immigrating to the U.S. with her parents from Honduras at 11 years old, she helped her parents adjust to life in a new country, and has now made a home for her own family here while giving back to her community.
Now, she’s running for a seat on the Thurston County Commission to make sure the people of her community have their voices heard in local government \-- and she’s winning. With more than a 10% lead on her GOP opponent heading into the general election, we’re excited to see Carolina get across the finish line in November and serve her community. In fact, if she wins, Carolina could be the only woman of color serving as a county legislator in the entire state of Washington!
But Republican operatives in Olympia are using the dirtiest trick in the books to try to stop her. Vile conspiracy theorists have accused Carolina of being ineligible to run for office by alleging she’s not an American citizen. Their baseless, hateful rhetoric echoes what we’ve heard come out of Donald Trump’s mouth for the better part of a decade. But let’s get this straight out of the gate: Carolina is a naturalized citizen, full stop.
Now, Carolina has been the target of a hideous intimidation campaign and has seen her full social security number and private home address released online. She now has to deal with threats to her and her family’s personal safety on top of all the normal stress of running for office.
This is beyond inexcusable. Trump needs to go. Republicans need to go. Barack Obama, Kamala Harris, and Carolina Mejia are AMERICANS \-- and the right-wing hatemongers behind attacks like these are the ones who don’t belong. If you agree, stand with us and against them. Answer now:
Do you condemn racist birther conspiracies?
YES
NO
Thanks for standing up for what's right.

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,The right to vote should not be up for debate,"Hi Alex,
The Voting Rights Act of 1965 helped put an end to the detestable tactics of voter suppression practiced in the Jim Crow south.
The law, signed by President Lyndon Johnson, meant that Black Americans would no longer be subjected to voter intimidation, poll taxes, and “literacy tests” deliberately designed to be unpassable.
It meant all Americans could finally have a voice in our democracy.
But in 2013, the Supreme Court decided the law \-- or at least its most crucial provision \-- was unnecessary. In her dissent, Justice Ginsburg compared scrapping the Voting Rights Act because voter suppression had decreased to “throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet.”
Now, seven years after that disastrous mistake, we’ve seen a torrential downpour of voter suppression across the country \-- predictably, from the very same states with a history of racially discriminatory laws overturned by the VRA. Racist voter ID laws, mass voter purges, and restricted early voting and voter registration windows have been enacted all over the country. America is sliding backwards at just the time when we should be pressing forwards.
Not every state has Democratic majorities in their state government to pass universal mail-in voting, pre-paid postage on all ballots, or same-day registration and pre-registration for young voters. Not every state has a Governor and Attorney General willing to fight the Trump administration’s attempts to suppress votes by sabotaging the USPS. And not every state has a coalition of empowered and committed supporters like you backing up the Democratic leaders who work so hard to protect our most sacred right in our democracy.
There’s still time to enfranchise American voters before the election. But we need your help.
Alex, join us in calling on the Senate to pass the Voting Rights Advancement Act. Help us restore American democracy. Help us speak out for those who have seen their voices muzzled. Help us protect the votes of our fellow citizens and protect this election -- before it’s too late.
Thank you for making your voice heard.

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,The domestic terrorist in our state legislature,"Hi Alex,
State Representative Matt Shea is a domestic terrorist \-- and the investigative report is proof that Shea poses a dangerous threat to our democracy and our state.
The report has uncovered the fact that Shea has personally directed activities of militia groups opposing the federal government. And that within hours, Shea can mobilize thousands of armed militia members.
He’s compromised the personal safety of law enforcement officials and their families by sharing a document with militia leaders that includes names, home addresses, badge numbers, and cell numbers of WA’s law enforcement officers, along with the FBI’s Joint Terrorism Taskforce and even the Washington State Patrol’s SWAT team. He’s even led operations to spy on them and their families.
Shea has repeatedly used his political office to gather intelligence on law enforcement, but the GOP in our state has yet to remove him from our legislature. That’s why we need to hear from you:
Should the WA GOP expel Matt Shea from our government?
YES NO

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,Our wannabe “wartime” president,"Hi Alex,
Amid the pain and anger in American cities in response to systemic racism, the President called for shooting and violence. Trump has called himself the “President of law and order.”
After bunkering down in the White House from peaceful protesters standing in Lafayette Square, Trump and his cronies made a plan to deliver an address from a historic church in D.C. But first, they needed to get the people out of the way so Trump could walk to the church and wave a bible for a photo op.
D.C.’s curfew came into effect at 7 p.m., but before people could disperse, Attorney General William P. Barr ordered their removal. This led to the use of rubber bullets, tear gas, and flash-bang grenades against peaceful citizens.
Today, we want to hear from you about your thoughts on the president’s use of unnecessary and military-style force against his own people.
Do you support the militarization of the police?
YES

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,Stopping the GOP’s war on truth,"Hi Alex,
The Loren Culp misinformation campaign has kicked into high gear.
Just last week, Culp spent the day handing out backpacks to schoolchildren \-- at the same time he assured them it was safe to return to class without a mask.
That lie came just a few days after Culp smeared mail-in voting on Twitter \-- joining in Donald Trump’s attempts to deceive the public, suppress votes, and steal the election in November. And while Culp’s down-ballot GOP allies aren’t as brazen as he is, make no mistake \-- they’re benefitting from his appeal to the GOP’s extremist base just as much as he is.
We know Culp’s (and Trump’s) rejection of science isn’t the way back to normalcy. It’s the reason we’ve seen our coronavirus cases spike even as other parts of the world have successfully completed their reopenings.
We MUST get the facts out. And the facts ARE on our side. But it takes more money and more resources to reach voters the right way. It’s tougher to reach constituents virtually, or to have meaningful conversations via phone or text, than it is to just march up to their doors and start lying to them like Culp and down-ballot Republicans are doing.
That’s exactly why we need to immediately increase our investments in our voter outreach budget, particularly to rural Washingtonians who are being targeted the most by Culp and the WA GOP’s candidates up and down the ballot.
But right now, we can’t make this essential boost in our investment because we are VERY short of our online fundraising goals.
If we don’t reach our rural voters, Culp will. They’ll make him governor \-- and we’ll watch as he destroys our public schools, drains our natural resources dry, and leaves our state completely exposed to not only the current pandemic but to whichever crisis comes next.
Your support is the only way we can improve our get-out-the-vote efforts. You’re the only way we can stop Culp. You’re one of the most committed WA Dems we have \-- if you don’t give to our cause, who else would?
We have a clear choice: move WA forward, or let the GOP take it back.
We need to raise $2,750 before midnight. Please, if you want to protect our schools and our school children -- if you want to save our natural resources and safeguard our environmental future -- if you want to answer Culp’s lies about our agenda with the truth, give what you can now. The price of inaction is nothing more or less than the future of our state.
Facts have few allies these days.
Thank you for being one of them.

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,Can we count on you?,"Hi Alex,
Today is the final deadline for ballots to be mailed to Washington voters.
Despite the GOP’s brazen attempts to suppress the vote by attacking mail-in ballots, our Democratic leaders have stepped up to defend our electoral process and reassure voters that Washington “will conduct free and fair, safe and secure elections to protect every vote and every voter” \-- just as it has done every election cycle.
We know that Washingtonians are more committed than ever to taking a stand against Donald Trump, Loren Culp, and all the down-ballot GOPers who have continued to undermine our democracy for their own political gain. And now, we have a chance to send a resounding message that the GOP’s far-right agenda and voter suppression tactics have no place in our state.
Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal has urged voters to make sure their voices are heard, saying, “Let’s vote early, let’s use the ballot boxes our state legislature was so good to provide and let’s make sure we get our votes counted quickly.” But in 2016, nearly 1 million Washington voters didn’t cast their ballots. Today, as the last ballots go out, we need to know we can count on you to make your voice count. Please, tell us now:
Will you commit to vote in this election?
YES
NO
We can’t build on our progress without you.

Right now, WA Dems hold the state Senate 28-21 and the state House 57-41.
Just over half of the Senate is up for grabs this election \-- along with all 98 House seats.
What happens next all depends on who shows up to vote. If 900,000+ voters stay home, like in 2016, we could lose to the WA GOP and see our trifecta of Democratic government vanish before our eyes. If turnout is a little higher, we could hold our own and keep the balance of seats the way it is \-- leaving Republicans with the power to block our constitutional amendments and hold our school bonds hostage for political purposes.
But if we can secure a larger majority in Olympia, so much more progressive policy becomes possible. That’s why we want to grow our numbers \-- giving us Democratic leaders at all levels of government and a supermajority in the state legislature. With the primary now behind us, that’s exactly what we’re setting our sights on as the grand prize in November. Republicans would love nothing more than for us to get complacent now so they can continue to be a thorn in our side for the next two years. But we’re not quitting while we’re ahead. Instead, we’re taking this opportunity to surge voter turnout to previously unheard-of levels \-- and pull the WA GOP out by their roots. Tell us if you’ll be a part of the blue wave:

Trump and his GOP cronies are running a voter suppression campaign. We saw the damage they did in Wisconsin \-- and we know they’re going to try and replicate it across the country.
The GOP knows that when we make it easier to vote, more Democrats turnout. That’s why Trump allies like Washington state’s own Secretary of State Kim Wyman (our chief elections officer) and GOP incumbents have been silent and have failed to condemn Trump’s attack on voting rights.
This year, we’re putting it all on the line to ensure Democrats have sweeping victories across Washington state. We’re investing heavily in our voter contact strategies to expand access to the ballot box to defeat Republican incumbents like Kim Wyman.
We need a leader in the Secretary of State’s office like Gael Tarleton, who will put our election security and integrity first, because protecting the vote should not come as an afterthought or only during a re-election campaign.
Alex, I am asking you personally to join me in supporting Gael Tarleton and the Washington Dems by making a contribution of $25, $50, $100, or whatever you can ahead of tonight’s mid-month deadline.

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,We need you more than ever,"Hi Alex,
Thousands of Washingtonians continue to protest the murder of George Floyd and the lack of accountability police departments face for excessive force across the country.
While Democratic local leaders are listening to and engaging with the people demanding justice, while we are vowing action and reform to address their concerns, WA GOPers continue to show their complete lack of compassion for the systemic injustice faced by communities of color. They also show their unyielding support for Donald Trump.
Their silence as they continue to stand with Trump and his barbaric rantings and actions instead of the people of Washington state is exactly why we MUST ensure they lose this November.
Right now on Trump’s 2020 campaign website, there is a call for supporters to “Stand with Trump against Antifa.” Alex, there is no clearer sign that we are living under a wannabe authoritarian than Trump’s attempt to use the military to suppress these protests, and now it’s clear that tactic was solely for his own political benefit.
Community leaders of color are organizing these protests, not “Antifa,” but here in Washington, we’ve seen these false rumors cause hundreds of far-right militia members to flood the streets of small towns armed to the teeth and looking for trouble. In at least one instance in Snohomish, we’ve seen these far-right militias engage in violence against peaceful protesters. Trump’s toxic ideology is undeniably growing in influence, even in a progressive state like ours.
Each day, the GOP across our state are gaining ground, but at the WA Dems, we’re fighting to stay ahead of them through aggressive voter contact strategies, intense volunteer recruitment, and fully supporting our Democrats running for office this November.
But there is a $4,350 gap in today’s budget \-- and we cannot afford to fall short on our fundraising goal if we’re going to stop Trump and his cronies. Please, join us in our work to drive historic turnout throughout our state and lead our country forward in enacting progressive policies immediately.

In 2018, they eliminated the U.S. pandemic response team from the National Security Council to cut costs \-- and consequently left our country unprepared to handle this crisis.
Now that the economy is suffering, millions of vulnerable Americans are jobless, and many more are at risk of losing their employment.
Today, we need to hear from you.
Are you disappointed by Trump's handling of the outbreak?
YES
NO

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,Following Jaime Herrera Beutler’s money trail,"Hi Alex,
As voters begin to tune in to the fiercely competitive race between Republican Congresswoman Jaime Herrera Beutler and Democratic challenger Carolyn Long, the people of southwest Washington deserve to know just who has been funding Herrera Beutler’s re-election campaigns for the last decade.
We’ve recently launched a website to document the nearly $1.7 million in corporate PAC contributions the Republican congresswoman has taken in her decade in D.C. \-- and when you follow the money, it’s painfully obvious that there’s one possible explanation for why Herrera Beutler has consistently voted for the interests of lobbyists and big corporations while neglecting the needs of her constituency.
Now more than ever before, our democracy depends on voters having access to accurate and up-to-date information about the records of their elected officials. That’s why we’re making sure Washingtonians know exactly where Jaime stands. Spoiler alert: it isn’t with the people she represents.
Today, we need to know where you stand:
Do you approve of Jaime Herrera Beutler?
YES
NO
Thank you for your input on one of the worst WA GOPers in the state.

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,Culp’s parties: Washingtonians are dying to get in,"Hi Alex,
On the eve of his primary victory, Republican gubernatorial candidate Loren Culp held an in-person rally. It included food, live music, and \-- according to Culp \-- about 1500 attendees.
Culp’s staff called it the “biggest party of the year.”
We won’t comment on that \-- but it was certainly the grossest disrespect for public health we’ve seen in Washington.
Per Governor Inslee’s reopening guidelines, any gathering of more than 5 people is banned in Cheval County. But Culp’s ego and ignorance endangered 300 times that number of people in a single night \-- as well as everyone those rally-goers went on to interact with in the following days. Here’s the worst part: Culp’s campaign didn’t even require attendees to wear masks, the simplest and most effective countermeasure to prevent coronavirus spread at any gathering.
This isn’t the first rally Culp has held during the pandemic, but with your help, it will be the last. We need to send a message \-- now \-- denouncing Culp’s reckless endangerment of the people of our state and demanding it not go any further. Will you help us? Tell us your view:
Do you condemn in-person, maskless rallies during the pandemic?
YES

Subject: Birther conspiracy theorists descend on WA
Hi Alex,
Unless you live in Thurston County, you probably don’t recognize the name Carolina Mejia, but she’s exactly the type of candidate we should all be excited about representing the future of the Democratic Party here in Washington: after immigrating to the U.S. with her parents from Honduras at 11 years old, she helped her parents adjust to life in a new country, and has now made a home for her own family here while giving back to her community.
Now, she’s running for a seat on the Thurston County Commission to make sure the people of her community have their voices heard in local government \-- and she’s winning. With more than a 10% lead on her GOP opponent heading into the general election, we’re excited to see Carolina get across the finish line in November and serve her community. In fact, if she wins, Carolina could be the only woman of color serving as a county legislator in the entire state of Washington!
But Republican operatives in Olympia are using the dirtiest trick in the books to try to stop her. Vile conspiracy theorists have accused Carolina of being ineligible to run for office by alleging she’s not an American citizen. Their baseless, hateful rhetoric echoes what we’ve heard come out of Donald Trump’s mouth for the better part of a decade. But let’s get this straight out of the gate: Carolina is a naturalized citizen, full stop.
Now, Carolina has been the target of a hideous intimidation campaign and has seen her full social security number and private home address released online. She now has to deal with threats to her and her family’s personal safety on top of all the normal stress of running for office.
This is beyond inexcusable. Trump needs to go. Republicans need to go. Barack Obama, Kamala Harris, and Carolina Mejia are AMERICANS \-- and the right-wing hatemongers behind attacks like these are the ones who don’t belong. If you agree, stand with us and against them. Answer now:
Do you condemn racist birther conspiracies?
YES
NO
Thanks for standing up for what's right.

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,Is voting a right or a privilege?,"Hi Alex,
Many of us take the right to vote for granted.
But throughout our history, that right has been treated more like a privilege. Black Americans were kept away from the polls for more than a century through racist voter suppression tactics, including intimidation, poll taxes, and absurd and offensive “tests” \-- like having to guess the number of jelly beans in a jar before being able to vote.
Before we celebrate how far we’ve come, we need to realize why those unforgivable practices broadly came to an end \-- the Voting Rights Act. Passed in 1965, the Voting Rights Act outlawed these discriminatory voting practices and empowered the federal government to step in and stop states from changing voting laws to keep Black voters away from the polls.
The Voting Rights Act was incredibly successful. It resulted in 250,000 new Black voter registrations within its first year \-- and the law was reauthorized roughly once a decade so that its protections could stay powerful and stay relevant in an ever-changing nation.
But in 2013, the Supreme Court struck down the law’s most crucial provision.
Shelby v. Holder meant states no longer had to be “precleared” by the federal government before changing voting laws. Since that time, racist voter laws have made a return \-- in the form of strict voter ID requirements, targeted voter purges, and shortened windows for early voting and voter registration.
That’s why one of John Lewis’s last actions before he passed was to fight to restore the Voting Rights Act \-- something that Congress now has the power to do.
Alex, the Democratic House has already passed a bill to restore the Voting Rights Act. We need you to add your name to ours now and DEMAND the Republican Senate bring the legislation to the floor for a vote. With an election in under 3 months, we can’t wait any longer to speak out for the millions of disenfranchised voices across the country.
Thank you for standing with us today.

While our country was focused on the police violence and the president’s calls for military force against our people protesting the murder of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Tony McDade, and many other black Americans killed by the police, Trump appointed a known Islamophobe to serve as religious freedom adviser at the U.S. Agency for International Development.
Former tea party activist Mark Kevin Lloyd has stated he believes Muslims are part of a “barbaric cult” and has stated that Muslims are dangerous extremists. Lloyd is not qualified to fill a role meant to protect religious freedoms, but Trump has a history of surrounding himself with like-minded people who share his views. Today, we need to hear from you:

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,Democrats are banding together to save our election,"Alex,
The GOP is working to sabotage the election.
Ignore Trump mega-donor Louis DeJoy’s empty promises to suspend further changes to the U.S. Postal Service. Even if he’s telling the truth, the changes ALREADY implemented have slowed vital correspondence, lifesaving prescription medication, and much-need Social Security checks to our citizens. The same will happen to our ballots if we don’t reverse the Trump administration’s destructive policies immediately.
The good news is that the WA Dems are uniting to make sure that’s exactly what happens.
Candidate for Secretary of State Gael Tarleton has publicly demanded that DeJoy rescind his attacks on USPS and confirm that every mail-in ballot will be counted. Attorney General Bob Ferguson is leading a coalition of states in a lawsuit that will challenge DeJoy’s policies in court. And Democratic state legislators are working in conjunction with Governor Inslee to expand ballot boxes, extend election deadlines, and equip local county auditors with the $2 million in funds our WA Dems have allocated to secure our election.
But GOP Secretary of State Kim Wyman has accused us of “politicizing” ballot delivery. And now, she’s calling on USPS and the Department of Homeland Security to investigate “illegal electioneering” that she’s laying at the feet of Democratic candidates.
We need to fire Wyman, hire Tarleton, and make sure EVERY SINGLE DEMOCRAT who has been so crucial in defending our elections keeps their seats this November. That’s why we’re setting an ambitious goal \-- to raise $5,000 before midnight tonight in order to bolster our campaigns and keep our blue coalition safe. Right now, we’re $3,879 short.
Please, if you want to show your appreciation for our Democratic leaders by helping them keep their jobs, give what you can now: [[URL REDACTED]]

We have got to do something about Republicans like Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler and all the other GOP leaders in WA state that continue to turn their backs on the people they’re supposed to serve.
Representatives like Herrera Beutler don’t lead with Washington values. They just follow the pockets of their big money donors. In 2020, we’re going to flip GOP-held seats throughout WA and bring Washingtonians the changes in leadership that they deserve.
Last night, we exceeded our fundraising goal by just about $500! If you were one of those donors who helped us close the gap, thank you so much for being a critical member of this team!
Reaching goals like this one will help us equip the hundreds of volunteers dialing every night for our WA Dems with the tools they need to overcome Republican incumbents funded by dark money, and we’re relying on your help to raise the funds necessary to win up and down the ballot in Washington next November.
We can’t allow incumbents like JHB to skate through reelection. That’s why we’re checking back in with you today.
Folks across the state need to know the truth about the Trump-cronies and GOPers who turn their backs on constituents. That’s why our coordinated campaign is working without tire to exceed our voter contact goals on the dialer and through our texting tool.
In fact, we’ve got exciting news: We have made MORE THAN 300,000 CALLS to voters across the state about making their voices heard in the 2020 election. If we can raise another $1,200 TODAY, we’ll surpass this week’s goal AND invest that money right back into our Rise & Organize fund to protect and elect more Democratic leaders.
Will you join us today with a contribution of $1, $5, $10, $25, or whatever you can to help us power through the week?

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,What Justice Barrett means for us and for the WA GOP,"Hi Alex,
Senate Republicans are getting exactly what they want \-- a shiny new Supreme Court justice who’ll serve for life. What’s the price of their big partisan win?
Well, if Amy Coney Barrett’s supporters get the ruling they want, the Affordable Care Act will be struck down the week after Election Day. 565,000 Washingtonians could lose their coverage. 3.1 million could lose their protections for pre-existing conditions. And our state could lose over $4 billion in federal funding \-- money that supports Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program.
Republicans will pay dearly for this on the national level. Polls point to a blue House, a blue Senate, and a Biden-Harris administration. But what about in our state?
What about state Reps. Vicki Kraft and Jesse Young, who tried to restrict health care by banning all abortion in WA? What about state Senator Steve O’Ban, who’s supported the battle to overturn the ACA in court?
Kraft got about 3,000 more votes than Democratic challenger Tanisha Harris in the August primary. Jesse Young got just less than 7,000 more votes than his Democratic challenger, Carrie Hesch. Steve O’Ban is fighting hard to keep his seat \-- he’s got an incumbency advantage and a tried-and-true fundraising machine. Shouldn’t these GOP sycophants also pay the price for the way our citizens could soon see their health care threatened?
We think so. Our opinion is that a blue wave on the national level just isn’t good enough. We want the blue wave to hit here at home too. We want the WA state GOPers who chose their party over the people to be left in the same boat as Trump when this is all over, not still in power and planning a Republican party rebrand.
Please, help us make the WA GOPers pay for their anti-health care agenda. Expand the national blue wave to Washington. Fill our state government with progressives who’ll protect us from the crises to come. Please give what you can now, 8 days before the election, to help us give our all.
We are the Washington Democrats. But we’re nothing without you.
Thanks for standing with us in this critical moment in American history.

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,An important deadline approaching,"Hi Alex,
Happy National Voter Registration Day! There’s just about a month left to register to vote online \-- the last day you’ll be eligible to do so is October 26.
In 2018, almost 25% of the voting age population in WA wasn’t registered to vote. That means over a million Washingtonians didn’t get to shape the future of our state. If they had, our blue wave might have been even BIGGER in 2018!
We’re doing everything we can to mobilize every single voter in WA this election cycle \-- and our efforts are paying off! Our primary turnout was the highest we’ve seen in decades. Our volunteer GOTV crew is working day and night to make sure every eligible voter is registered, informed, and energized. And we have another full month to grow the electorate by as much as we possibly can.
But there are still hundreds of thousands of voters in WA who are unregistered. And as we saw in 2016, just a few thousand votes can swing the fate of an election.
We’d like to reach 100% voter participation this year. It’s an ambitious goal, and it’ll require a budget to match \-- which is why we’re aiming to raise $2,500 today on National Voter Registration Day to amplify our efforts and strengthen our democracy.
You’re an engaged voter. You know how important civic participation is to a healthy society. You know how easy it is to vote in WA \-- and hopefully, you can help us share that message with as many of our fellow Washingtonians as we can.
If you want to see every single voter in our great state make their voice heard in 2020, please, chip in whatever you can now to support our voter mobilization efforts and expand our electorate. Voting is nothing less than a sacred duty in a democracy, and this is our chance to make sure everyone participates.
Thank you so, so much for helping us get every Washingontian engaged in our democracy.
Thank you for making your voice heard!

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,The lies Republicans told about us last night,"Hi Alex,
Last night, the Republican party told lie after lie in an effort to scare Americans into voting against Democrats. They said Joe Biden wants to defund the police. They said “vengeful mobs” will destroy our cities and towns. They said, almost laughably, that our party wants to “abolish the suburbs.”
What isn’t laughable is just how many Americans will believe them.
We MUST get the facts out. And the facts ARE on our side. But it takes more money and more resources to reach voters the right way. It’s tougher to reach constituents virtually, or to have meaningful conversations via phone or text, than it is to just march up to their doors and start lying to them like Trump, Loren Culp, and down-ballot Republicans are doing.
That’s exactly why we need to immediately increase our investments in our voter outreach budget, particularly to rural Washingtonians who are being targeted the most by Culp and the WA GOP’s candidates up and down the ballot.
But right now, we can’t make this essential boost in our investment because we are short of our online fundraising goals.
Your support is the only way we can improve our Get-Out-The-Vote efforts. You’re the only way we can stop Trump and his loyalists. You’re one of the most committed WA Dems we have \-- if you don’t give to our cause, who else would?
We have a clear choice: move WA forward, or let the GOP take it back.
If you want to protect our schools and our school children -- if you want to save our natural resources and safeguard our environmental future -- if you want to answer the GOP's lies about our agenda with the truth, give what you can now. The price of inaction is nothing more or less than the future of our state.
Facts have few allies these days.
Thank you for being one of them.

Trump won the 2016 election on a message of hate, fear, and division.
He claimed he’d go to Washington to “drain the swamp,” but four years later \-- we know that was just another lie from our liar in chief. He’s surrounded himself with convicted felons like Cohen, Flynn, Gates, and Manafort.

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,"While voters are distracted, GOP ideology is threatening our schools","Hi Alex,
There’s a crucial race that will permanently shape the future of our students, our schools, and our state \-- and up until now, you may not have even heard of it. It’s the race to elect the Superintendent of Public Instruction, the public servant who oversees K-12 education throughout Washington, a position that could soon fall into Republican hands.
Our Democratic incumbent, Chris Reykdal, has increased inclusivity for disabled students and students of color, increased educator salaries and expanded health care for over 10,000 school employees, and helped Washington State achieve record high graduation rates \-- as well as move our language arts and math scores into the top third of all states across America.
His challenger, Republican Maia Espinoza, is a right-wing ideologue from the school of Donald Trump and Betsy DeVos. She wants to make sweeping cuts to education funding ($2,500 per student) and supports the privatization of public schools as well as sending taxpayer subsidies to religious institutions.
Reykdal has a strong chance of defeating his opponent; he received hundreds of thousands more votes in the primary election, and his record speaks for itself. But Espinoza is outraising Reykdal, and isn’t afraid to traffick in misinformation just like the rest of her party. Her campaign has accused Reykdal of promoting policies that “taught sexual positions to 4th graders,” a claim so egregiously mistaken Reykdal successfully had it proven false in court. But that hasn’t stopped Espinoza from repeating the lie to every voter she speaks with: just like with Trump and DeVos, the truth is negotiable to Espinoza.
We have two key concerns over this race: with just a month to go, not nearly enough voters know the stakes \-- and unfortunately, Reykdal is currently being both outraised and outspent.
We’re writing to you because we know you want our schools well-funded, our teachers well-paid, and our students well-educated. Right now, all of that is on the line.
If you don’t want to allow the GOP to take over our public schools, please, give what you can now to help us get the word out about Espinoza’s disqualifying lack of honesty. Over a million students have their futures riding on this election. We cannot fail them.
Thank you for protecting our public schools from the toxic ideology of the GOP and electing Democrats up and down the ballot. You’re making an investment in the next generation of Washingtonians, and we’re incredibly grateful for your support.

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,An important anniversary for human rights,"August 28 has long been a significant date in Black history.
It was on this day in 1833 that the British Parliament passed the Slavery Abolition Act.
It was on this day in 2008 that Barack Obama gave his speech accepting the Democratic party’s nomination for the Presidency of the United States of America.
And it was on this day in 1963 that late Congressman John Lewis gave a speech at the historic March on Washington \-- a speech that inspired a generation of activists and changed the national discourse on civil rights forever. 57 years later, we remember the March on Washington as one of the greatest rallies for human rights in U.S. history.
In his speech, John Lewis called on our government to protect the lives of people of color and put an end to the harsh brutality and inequality they experience in America. He called for immediate freedom and equality for all in his famous quote: “We do not want our freedom gradually, but we want to be free now!”
Today, we’re seeing that fight continue.
As crowds now gather for a 2020 March on Washington, it’s important to remember the lessons that John Lewis taught us with his speech. In the midst of ongoing police brutality and racial tension, we remember Congressman Lewis’s legacy on this anniversary and continue to fight for equality and justice for all \-- not gradually, but now.
Thank you for standing with us in that fight.

I owe you a huge debt of gratitude.
You stepped up over the last few days, right when we needed you to. Because of your support, we were able to raise $5,468 just since Thursday! That’s exactly the kind of funding our GOTV efforts need if we want to succeed in stopping Culp’s march toward Olympia.
I know we’re giving everything we have to fight this battle for the soul of our state \-- and sometimes, it can take a lot out of us.
But I made a commitment in 2016: I’d never see an election go that wrong again. And right now, the hairs on the back of my neck are starting to stand up because I’m seeing the same signs now that I saw four years ago.
I see Republicans lining up behind a strongman. I see science being thrown in the trash. I see our rural and suburban voters starting to doubt if Democratic values are the right way forward.
And the worst part? We tried to warn the country of the horrifying consequences if Trump won \-- and now we’re all living through them. Every. Single. Day. While some European countries are reopening schools and crowds thousands strong are gathering in stadiums in Taiwan to watch baseball, we’re all still stuck at home watching our economy crumble under Trump’s failed leadership.
But none of that is keeping the GOP from plowing ahead with the same dangerously unqualified candidates they flocked to in 2016.
It’s terrifying. So know that we won’t stop asking for your help anytime soon. There are 11 weeks left in this race \-- and we need you here for all of them.

During Trump’s 2016 campaign rallies, he’d have protesters, often Black Americans, forcefully removed in front of his hoards of far-right supporters.
He said things like, “Knock the crap out of them, would you? Seriously.” And, “I’d like to punch him in the face.”
At one point during a rally, he commented on the removal of a protester, “I love the old days. You know what they used to do to guys like that when they were in a place like this? They’d be carried out on a stretcher, folks.”

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,Four WA GOP gubernatorial candidates fall out of a clown car...,"Alex: Seattle Times reports that Republican leaders are FREAKING OUT over the field of extremist candidates vying to lead the GOP race for governor \-- and this is the week voters receive ballots. One GOP candidate for Governor even called the Republican primary “a Clown Race.”
We get it \-- Tim Eyman, Loren Culp, Joshua Freed, and Phil Fortunato ARE NOT the kind of leaders we need right now. In fact, Loren Culp (the anti-gun safety advocate and anti-masker who has been accused of intimidating a molestation victim and continues to defend the molestor’s innocence despite a guilty plea) was the GOP candidate members of the Washington Dems like you agreed would be the WORST person to go up against Gov. Jay Inslee this November in our surveys this week.
Culp, unfortunately, has come out as the strongest fundraiser of all the GOP candidates in the race \-- bringing in HUNDREDS of thousands more in the last month, and now has the most cash in his campaign coffers.
With Culp about to make use of all that money in the final days of the primary race, we know he’ll give a boost to the down-ballot conservative extremists running to take on our Washington Democrats facing tough elections in November.
Right now, our volunteers are working hard to ensure every voter we need to win commits to mailing in their ballot. With Facebook considering a full ban on political ads and the drastic changes we’ve had to make to our field operation, ensuring our coordinated campaign is fully funded is absolutely critical to our candidates’ success.
We need to work harder than ever before \-- but we’ve handled the challenges 2020 has brought so far, and we’re ready for whatever comes next. As long as you’re with us, we’ll deliver a historic victory for Democrats in this year’s election.
Yesterday we fell behind on our fundraising goal, but if you and 45 more first time donors pitch in $5, $10, or even $1, we know we can make up the difference before tomorrow at midnight.
Can we count on you to give what you can to help keep the WA Dems strong and ready for the fight ahead? You can pitch in here: [[URL REDACTED]]

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,Protect our backyard from Pendley,"Hi Alex,
The U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is tasked with overseeing almost 250 million acres of public lands \-- mostly in Western states like ours.
But the crony Trump has now nominated to serve as full-time Director of BLM, William Perry Pendley, doesn’t think public land should exist at all. According to Pendley, it was the Founding Fathers’ wish that all federal lands be sold off to private companies -- and that’s exactly why Pendley can’t be trusted with our backyard.
Pendley has already been Acting Director of BLM for months \-- despite never having been confirmed by the Senate. Now that his role could become official, we need to demand our representatives stop this anti-environmentalist radical in his tracks.
That’s why we’re reaching out to you.
If you don’t believe our public lands should be handed over to logging, mining, and fossil fuel interests \-- if you think Washington and our neighboring states should have a say in keeping our public lands in public hands \-- then please, add your name now to stop Pendley from selling off our natural splendor just to make the Trump administration a quick buck.
Alex, add your name now to join us in demanding the Senate reject William Perry Pendley’s nomination for Director of Bureau of Land Management.
Thank you for standing with us today.

Each day, we learn about a new way the president has emboldened white nationalists. Whether it’s another racist 5 a.m. tweet, letting wannabe-fascist Stephen Miller fill his speeches on race with Nixonian dog-whistles, or the horrific policy decisions he's made on immigration, Donald Trump has given white nationalists a platform under his leadership. We’re appalled by every new report of Trump’s actions that advance the far-right agenda \-- and we know that this November, voters need to make their voices heard at the polls.
Before things continue to get even worse in communities across the country, we need you to take a stand with us.
Add your name with hundreds of other Washington Democrats to condemn Donald Trump and the white nationalist agenda.

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,Trump called Gov. Inslee a “snake”,"Hi Alex,
As you know, there is a COVID-19 outbreak in Washington state and across the world. Governor Inslee, after a briefing with Vice President Mike Pence, stated that in combating the outbreak, it’d be helpful if the Trump administration “stuck to the science and told the truth” when speaking about the coronavirus.
At the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, GA, Donald Trump called Jay Inslee a “snake” for his criticism. And earlier this month, Trump went on Fox News with Sean Hannity where he yet again contradicted health officials and sciences \-- and floated his own “hunch” about the coronavirus instead of informing the American public about how to stay safe and healthy.
Right now, 42.8 percent of Americans approve of Donald Trump. Today, we’re conducting a live poll here in Washington state to see where you stand. Alex, let us know:
Do you approve of Donald Trump?
YES NO

This is exactly the kind of dedication we’ll need to prevent a repeat of 2016 and 2018. This is the way we save the environment, stick up for science, and save our state from the clutches of the WA GOP.
The Republican field is taking after Donald Trump \-- they’re wildly unfit for office, grossly out of touch with the American people, and only in politics for themselves.

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,Demand Congress implement national vote-by-mail NOW,"Hi Alex,
This year’s elections will take place in the midst of a global pandemic \-- and no American should have to risk their health and safety to make sure their voice is heard.
That’s why we’re calling on Congress to give all Americans the option to vote by mail. If you agree, add your name to our petition to send a message directly to Congress.
Right now, Trump and his GOP cronies are pushing a narrative about the alleged dangers of voting by mail, but in Washington state, we know vote-by-mail is one of the safest ways to vote. Trump even took to Twitter this week to repeat his lies about mail-in ballots, stating “2020 will be the most RIGGED election in our nations history” \-- but we know the only “rigging” happening is the GOP’s effort to suppress safe voting nationwide.
Donald Trump doesn’t want the American people to have the opportunity to vote without putting their health at risk, so we’re sending a petition to our leaders in Congress to demand they give all Americans the option to vote by mail as well as help states with the costs.
Our most vulnerable populations, like our seniors and loved ones with compromised immune systems, deserve to vote safely. Our health care workers fighting this pandemic every day deserve to have their voices heard without being forced to stand in long lines at crowded polling places.
We can and must do better for the people.
Alex, add your name with ours today to demand our leaders in the other Washington pass funding to make sure every state can send mail-in ballots to voters today.
Thank you for standing with us.

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,"When Trump attacks the press, we need to defend them","Alex,
POLITICO reports that, on the eve of the final presidential debate, Donald Trump “again amplified accusations of bias against a debate moderator.”
According to Trump, Kristen Welker has “always been terrible & unfair, just like most of the Fake News reporters.”
Trump said a similar thing about Savannah Guthrie, who he claims went “totally crazy” during his town hall. Neither did Trump spare Chris Wallace, who he accused of teaming up with Joe Biden to go “two on one” on him during the first debate.
The president knows what he’s doing. When he impugns the moderator, he turns a debate loss into a debate win. We can’t let him do that tonight. So, in advance of the final debate, we need a mandate from the people \-- we need to defend the press from Trump’s attacks and show the president and the voting public that we’re not buying what he’s selling. Will you help us? Tell us now:
Are moderators biased against Trump?
YES
NO
We greatly appreciate your responses today. With your support, we can win this election.

We’re hosting our first Facebook Live town hall with the Democratic candidate running against far-right Rep. Matt Shea on Thursday night. After his protest in Olympia that brought out more than 2,500 radicals and gun activists, it’s never been more clear that we MUST take down dangerous leaders like Shea and his allies in Olympia this November.
But right now, we’re $11,050 short of our April fundraising goal. And when we fall short of our critical fundraising benchmarks like this one, our Rise & Organize efforts are in danger of getting cut back.
Look, our victories this year are dependent on our ramping up our efforts \-- not pulling back on our strategy to mobilize Democrats across the state \-- so we can stop Trump allies like Matt Shea and Jaime Herrera Beutler in November.
I know we’ve been asking a lot from you, but we CANNOT take on Trump and the $100,000,000+ his GOP cronies have in the bank if we don’t hit our goals. Can I count on you to help us get back on track before Thursday night’s town hall? Link to make your first contribution below!

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,Loren Culp is an atypical candidate,"Hi Alex,
“What we have right here in Washington is a leadership crisis,” Loren Culp said during his opening statement at the first and last gubernatorial debate this election cycle. Culp recounted his military service and how he started a construction business before going into law enforcement, telling voters, “I’ve been in leadership positions for my entire life.”
Loren Culp will continue to debase Gov. Inslee’s character and career until Election Day. And he’ll keep holding rallies that put thousands of Washingtonians at risk, all while falsely propping himself up as a working class hero.
The latest public polling shows these desperate tactics from the Culp campaign aren’t working \-- but we’ve learned our lesson from 2016 to not get complacent when the polling looks good. That’s why we are conducting our own poll to make sure our supporters are backing the governor. PLEASE let us know where you stand, now:

But while we’re working with other state party leaders across the country, Donald Trump has been attacking the USPS, withholding relief and even calling one of the most beloved agencies a “joke.” Trump’s continued rejections of a USPS bailout could have a severe impact on our vote-by-mail process this November as well as hurt our families in rural and low-income communities.

Tina Podlodowski,info@wa-democrats.org,I want YOU to join us as a Virtual Volunteer!,"Hello Democrats!
I hope you’re all staying healthy and staying home if you can!
I’m reaching out today not to ask you for money, but for something even more valuable: your time. I know we’re all dealing with a lot of uncertainty right now, but one thing is certain: this November is the chance we’ve all been waiting for since 2016 to get our country back on the right track.
But guess what? We can’t get rid of Trump and force his Republican allies here in Washington to pay the price for supporting his hateful agenda without your help. We need YOU to join our team of Virtual Volunteers who are making calls to voters to check in on them during this pandemic. We’re reminding voters that when all of this ends, we have to hold Trump responsible for the lives and jobs lost due to his horrifyingly inept management of this crisis.
SIGN UP FOR OUR NEXT TRAINING EVENT HERE!
We know campaigning in this new environment is a challenge. Thankfully, we’ve got the best field team in the country to lead the way. Our Coordinated Campaign team took the lessons they’ve learned being in the field since 2017 to completely overhaul our organizing program and in just two weeks they have moved it entirely online. Nothing is going to stop our volunteer army, not even a pandemic.
So sign up to join one of our Group Virtual Phone Banks, held Sunday through Thursday evenings from 5PM to 8PM. As with all of our events, we will start off with a training on our script and can help answer any questions you might have via Zoom conferencing.
We’ll also be rolling out a text-banking campaign that you can join very soon, and all of our volunteering opportunities come with an invitation to a private Facebook group of our statewide network. In that group, you’ll be able to make new friends just as you would coming into one of our regional field offices!
And if you’ve never phone banked or volunteered before, don’t worry! We’ve got training videos, virtual webinars, and a team of experienced Regional Field Directors ready to walk you through every step of the process.
I’m even personally kicking off our Virtual Organizing Academy this Saturday at 10am, so stop by, stay hi, and get trained!
Onward,

State Rep. Matt Shea is organizing a far-right rally on May 1 \-- something he’s promoting as “May Day Mutiny” to protest our statewide shelter-in-place to slow the spread of the virus.
In a post to Facebook, Shea wrote, “Please prepare yourself, your friends and your family for political action in the coming days and weeks. Enough is enough.” Another read, “Freedom is the cure.”
We’ve known it for a long time: Matt Shea is a danger to our democracy and the people around him. He wants to turn our government into a theocracy. He’s worked to spread his extremist ideologies across our state with his pamphlet, “Biblical Basis for War.” And he’s already promoted the training of young boys to fight in a “holy war.” And now, he’s calling members of the far-right and Trump allies to rally alongside him \-- a choice that will certainly cause a spike in COVID-19 cases and delay reopening our economy.
Today, we need to hear from you to see where you stand. Please let us know:
Do you approve of Matt Shea?
YES
NO
Thank you so much for your input, as it helps us build our strategy to defeat far-right leaders like Shea.

After Tina wrote you yesterday about our coordinated campaign \-- and how it’s our best defense against the far-right GOPers gaining ground across our state \-- 112 Washington Democrats pitched in to help us get closer to our goal of bringing on additional field organizers!
While the president and his down-ballot cronies gaslight the American people and deny the facts presented by scientists, at the WA Dems, we’re working hard to stop the GOP’s incompetence from causing generational damage. This November, we’re going to leave it all on the field \-- and we’re pulling out all the stops.
We’ve built a powerful strategy to win statewide, but we’ve got to get more organizers on the ground as quickly as possible. Before we can do that, we need to make sure we have the resources to pay our organizers through November.
Thank you so much to every Democrat who pitched in yesterday \-- YOU are the key to our 2020 success.
With ballots being mailed out in about a week, we can’t wait to grow our field team. Their work to stop Trump and defend our WA Dems like Gov. Inslee starts NOW.
We cannot hit our aggressive GOTV goals without bringing on more organizers, and that’s why we’re asking you to help us build our staffing budget today to protect our WA Dems like Gov. Jay Inslee, AG Bob Ferguson, and Rep. Pramila Jayapal.
Will you pitch in now to help us bring on some incredibly talented organizers to help us turn out voters and protect our WA Dems? You can pitch in here.

The Postal Service crisis has hit home.
USPS General Counsel Thomas Marshall addressed a letter to Secretary of State Kim Wyman late last month. He warned that “certain deadlines concerning mail-in ballots, particularly with respect to voters who register to vote or update their registration information shortly before Election Day, may be incongruous with the Postal Service's delivery standards.”
We’ve been running universal vote-by-mail elections successfully for years. But now that Trump and his cronies have taken over USPS \-- the agency that delivers our ballots \-- they’re doing their best to destroy it in an attempt to suppress votes and steal the election.
This is unacceptable. We’re fighting back by informing voters of this partisan ploy to sow doubt in our democracy. If you care about the assault on election integrity happening in plain sight, there’s no time to waste. Stand with us in fighting back against the GOP by making your voice heard now:
Do you condemn GOP voter suppression?
YES
NO

Tina Podlodowski,info@wa-democrats.org,I didn’t want to send this email,"Morning, Alex!
Earlier this week, I reached out to you personally about our January 2020 budget -- when I wrote, we were falling behind target.
I wish I didn’t have to tell you this, but we missed our goal this week.
Missing our fundraising benchmarks at a time when all statewide elected officials are too focused on passing progressive policy to fundraise on their own will severely impact our voter turnout efforts -- and right now, the far-right GOP challengers running against our Dems have the advantage.
If we’re going to defeat Trump and his GOP apologists up and down the ballot here in WA, we MUST lay the groundwork early for a winning Democratic strategy across the state.
But we cannot afford to miss our goals -- and without your contributions to our efforts, we will have to scale back on our coordinated campaign efforts right when we should be ramping up.
While the fundraising freeze is in effect, it’s up to us to continue building for our Democratic leaders.
That’s why I am really counting on you to give just $5 or whatever you can to help us get back on track today.
If we can raise another $2,420 TODAY, we’ll be back on track. Can you please rush us an emergency contribution immediately? Here’s the link: [[URL REDACTED]]

Democrats in our state like AG Bob Ferguson, Gov. Jay Inslee, and Rep. Suzan DelBene have been working hard to advocate for Washingtonians and meet the demands of communities across the state. But the GOPers running to unseat them in 2020 are using this time to try and get ahead of our WA Dems.
Our coordinated campaign strategy at the Washington State Dems is designed to turn out our voters across the state to ensure our state stays blue, especially when we’re fighting Trump and his far-right values at the top of the ticket.
Every single Republican candidate challenging Gov. Inslee has taken a personal loyalty pledge to Trump, so we’ll need you in this fight with us to make sure none of them get within a mile of victory.
We need you to be one of our June donors so we can invest more resources into our strategy to stop Trump and his cronies from getting in the way of our progress.
Far-right, pro-Trump Republicans are doing EVERYTHING they can to gain ground, but if we organize around our Democrats now, we can stop Trump’s allies in WA from enacting dangerous policies that separate families, lock kids in cages, and take health care away from tens of thousands of us in the middle of a pandemic.
We’re fighting to drive our state and nation forward. But to do that, we MUST ensure our coordinated campaign is fully funded so we can effectively organize for our leaders up and down the ticket.
But right now, we’re short of where we need to be today, and if we fall short now, we’ll have to pull back on next week’s voter contact strategy.
With Trump leaning into the extreme far-right of his party, there really couldn’t be a more important time for you to contribute now to protect our Democratic leaders across our state. Can we count on you to pitch in $5 or whatever you can at the link to become a 2020 Member of WA Dems and support our efforts to keep Washington blue?

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,"Trump and his love for the “good ol’ days""","Alex,
During Trump’s 2016 campaign rallies, he’d have protesters, often Black Americans, forcefully removed in front of his hoards of far-right supporters.
He said things like, “Knock the crap out of them, would you? Seriously.” And, “I’d like to punch him in the face.”
At one point during a rally, he commented on the removal of a protester, “I love the old days. You know what they used to do to guys like that when they were in a place like this? They’d be carried out on a stretcher, folks.”
As Americans across all 50 states and in communities large and small have taken to the streets in an uprising, we need to hear from you today:
Do you condemn Donald Trump?
YES
NO
Thank you for your participation in surveys like this one.
Stay safe, and keep fighting,

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,Culp will use the economic downturn against us,"Hi Alex,
History has shown that greedy, power-hungry liars aren’t above leveraging economic tension in order to gain power. We saw it in 2016 with Donald Trump. And we’re seeing it happen now, in real time, with wannabe governor Loren Culp.
Culp is positioning himself as savior of the common man \-- falsely accusing Governor Inslee of taking money from Washington families and promising he will be the one to give it back.
We can't just fume about this. We need to act.
And that’s exactly what we’re doing \-- reaching out to voters all over the state through texts, phone calls, and virtual volunteer shifts. This Herculean effort is working: voter turnout numbers skyrocketed in the primary. We like to think that means we’re well on our way to a blue wave in November \-- but we’re not there yet.
The Republican Party has been trying to make inroads in our state for a long, long time. Now, they finally have the perfect puppet to install in Olympia \-- and they’re counting on our wishful thinking to make us comfortable while they out-work us on the ground.
If they succeed, it means that we’ll see Culp every time we turn on our televisions or take out our phones for the next four years. We’ll watch, helpless, as he enacts his nonsensical, anti-science, anti-environment, anti-truth agenda on our state \-- and the down-ballot Republicans that are lifted by his rise and follow him into the state legislature will help codify every destructive GOP policy on Culp’s wishlist into law.
The only way to stop the GOP is to reach more voters than they do. But we’re campaigning virtually while Republicans like Culp are shaking hands and kissing babies \-- potentially spreading illness but also building bonds, trust, and personal rapport with the community.
If we don’t smash this goal, the GOP will smash us. And right now, we’re $2,129 short.
Please, campaign virtually with us. Chip in whatever you can by clicking the link below. Our concern may seem overblown \-- and we’d certainly be thrilled to be wrong.
But we remember the last time we underreacted to a growing Republican threat.
We’ll never do it again.
If you would do anything to keep WA blue - if you want to move forward with our environmental progress, public health priorities, and economic recovery instead of seeing all three washed away - and if you want to defeat the GOP’s toxic falsehoods with the truth, then please, give whatever you can now.
This battle for our state is almost over. If we don’t act now to ensure victory, we should expect defeat.
Thank you for standing with us.

Tina Podlodowski,info@wa-democrats.org,2020 budgeting shortfall,"Hi Alex,
Our team is pushing to get ahead on our goals now because we know that the GOP is actively working to stop our progress across Washington \-- and our coordinated voter outreach and field strategy will be key to protecting our Washington Dems.
Right now, WA Dems is up against our 3/31 FEC deadline \-- but we’re still short of our mid-March fundraising benchmark. Missing this goal would mean we’ll have to scale back our April organizing efforts. That means fewer resources, organizers, and volunteers in the field to lay the groundwork for Democrats to win up and down the ticket in November.
That’s why I’m reaching out to you today.
We need to raise $1,940 more TODAY if we’re going to stay on track to stop the far right GOP from gaining ground in our state. With Cathy McMorris Rodgers on board as Trump’s campaign chair here in WA, we know her corporate donors will be dumping cash in races across Washington state to protect Trump’s GOP allies and challenge our progressive leaders.
We’re running a powerful statewide strategy to stop them, and your support is critical to funding our Rise & Organize volunteer training program that led us to historic success in 2018.
I’m counting on you to jump in now to help us stop GOP extremists like Matt Shea from spreading his white supremacist values and Trump-enabling Republicans like Jaime Herrera Beutler from neglecting her constituents. Please make your online contribution here: [[URL REDACTED]]
In this together,

We’re hosting the Snohomish County Organizing Academy in Everett, WA tomorrow as part of our Rise & Organize program, but right now, we’re $638 short of this week’s fundraising goal. (Our weekly goals keep us on track to continue training programs like tomorrow’s.) And when we fall short of our fundraising benchmark, our Rise & Organize efforts are in danger of getting cut back.
Look, our victories this year are dependent on our ramping up our efforts \-- not pulling back on our strategy to mobilize Democrats across the state \-- so we can stop Trump allies like Matt Shea and Jaime Herrera Beutler in November.
I know we’ve been asking a lot from you, but we CANNOT take on Trump and the $100,000,000+ his GOP cronies have in the bank if we don’t hit our goals. Can I count on you to help us get back on track before tomorrow’s training? Link to make your first contribution below!

WA Dems,info@wa-democrats.org,Culp explains why he supports Trump -- his answer is more telling than he knows,"Hi Alex,
“How can you argue with what he’s done?”
When asked about his support for Donald Trump, that’s what Loren Culp had to say.
Well, Loren Culp, we’ve got more than a few grievances. Like the way he sued to overturn the Affordable Care Act and kick hundreds of thousands of Washingtonians off their health insurance. Or the way he’s blatantly condoned white supremacy, telling the Proud Boys to “stand back and stand by” and calling the neo-Nazis in Charlottesville “very fine people.”
How about the way Trump has fed anti-masker sentiment, calling the coverage of the pandemic a “hoax” in its early stages, mocking people for wearing masks, and even commanding reporters to remove their face coverings before they ask him a question? That’s to say nothing of his withdrawing the country from the Paris Agreement, nominating an anti-choice activist to fill Justice Ginsburg’s Supreme Court seat, tear-gassing BLM protesters so he could have a photo-op, and separating migrant children from their families \-- as well as overseeing involuntary and unnecessary hysterectomies on ICE detainees.
It is indeed hard to argue with what Donald Trump has done. And it’s hard to argue that the WA GOP is now the party of Trump. We’re on track to defeat both the president and his copycat running for the Governor’s office. That’s great news; it’s exactly what they deserve.
But we’re not on track to remove the Trump-allied GOPers at the local level. Republican leaders like Steve O’Ban, Jaime Herrera Beutler, Kim Wyman, and many others would love nothing more than to see Trump and Culp lose while they keep power \-- and then afterwards, they can act like this era was just a passing fad they had nothing to do with.
We know better. We know that all the Republicans who have benefited from Trump’s reign of terror should pay the same price he’ll pay at the polls. We’d love to beef up our outreach efforts to ensure a blue wave at the federal, state, and local levels \-- but right now, we’re falling behind our fundraising projections.
If you’re as reviled by Trump’s actions in office as we are -- if you agree the spineless Republican officials who stood by him as he destroyed our nation have got to go -- if you want this election to be a complete and total referendum on the GOP -- please, click here and give what you can now to help us hit our goal and kick the down ballot WA Republicans out of office. We have two choices in the homestretch of this election: decide that a win at the top of the ticket is good enough, or push for a lasting change in our state and our nation. The local Democratic candidates who have opposed Trump’s agenda every step of the way deserve to claim the power the GOP hopes to hoard post-election. But to win, our candidates need your support.
Thank you for helping us fight hard for every race in every place. Thank you for helping us show the GOP that campaigns have consequences.
Thank you for standing with us as a proud Washington Democrat.

Friends,
With less than two weeks left, and it will be that special time of year again- Election Day. The next candidate I'd like to be featured in our candidate highlight segment is - Chris Gildon.
As a 23-year Veteran Army Officer, Chris has made it his lifelong mission to represent our country, state, and community. After retiring from the military, he began a career as a realtor and, most recently, as the current House Representative for District 25. Yet now, he wishes to take this service to the community one step further and become the next Senator out of District 25.
DONATE
If you live in or near District 25, you may have seen Chris's two campaign ads. If not, I encourage you to view them here and here.
A donation of $25, $50, or $75 towards Chris's campaign will help keep his ads on the air through election day.

Friends –
We’ve told you about him before, but I want to introduce you again to Sen. Ron Muzzall from Whidbey Island. Ron was appointed last fall to fill the seat of a retiring senator and hit the ground running with the 2020 Legislative Session starting just a few months later.
Ron and his family have been farming on Whidbey Island for over 100 years. With this family so ingrained in our community's history, Ron has developed a passion for serving friends, neighbors, and associates. This has led him to be involved in agricultural and industry associations. He has also served as a firefighter and Fire Commissioner with North Whidbey Fire and Rescue.
It often takes newcomers to the legislature some time to establish themselves but not Ron, he was elected to leadership his first session. Not only was he elected Deputy Republican Whip, he was also appointed as the Assistant Ranking Member on the State Government, Tribal Relations & Elections committee.
I think one of the reasons that Ron has been a successful senator is that he has distinguished himself with his colleagues as a civil and pragmatic voice who looks for common-sense solutions. He believes in a responsible government that spends taxpayer money sensibly and pragmatically to ensure that citizens have the best services available.
Please consider chipping in a few bucks to Ron’s campaign to ensure that he returns to Olympia next year. You can make a secure online donation at [[URL REDACTED]]

While Washington Democrats push to defund your local police, Democrat legislators will continue their push to release more convicted criminals back into your communities. They want Seattle’s CHAZ/CHOP Summer of Love to come to your neighborhood. Meanwhile, Jay Inslee’s refusal to call a special session to lawfully address serious budget shortfalls due to COVID-19 shutdowns threatens the future of every community in our state.
It’s never been more important to take action and hold out-of-control Democrats accountable. The safety of our communities depends on it; the stability of our economy depends on it.
We’re just $1988 away from meeting our goal before today’s deadline. Will you help put a much-needed check on Washington Democrats by putting Republicans back in control of the state Senate?

Begin forwarded message:
Washington Democrats cannot be trusted in leadership positions - the last few months prove their incompetence.
Friends –
The last few months in Washington serve as a lesson of what happens when Democrats control every state government branch – and our major cities. Democrats allowed lawlessness to take over Seattle. Their incompetence led to the loss of taxpayer dollars, amounting to hundreds of millions. And their negligent inaction threatens to derail our state budget for decades.
You cannot trust Democrats with leadership. We’re $4561 away from reaching our monthly fundraising goal. Helping us reach our goal means helping Republicans retake the state Senate. Will you help us place a check on out-of-control Democrats today?
Democrat extremists defunded the already overburdened Seattle Police Department, opening the door to more violence and rampant homelessness. We know what’s next – what happens in Seattle doesn’t stay in Seattle.
Democrats in the state legislature will pick-up the call to “defund the police.” That means Seattle-style law and order may be coming to a neighborhood near you. Put Republicans back in control of the state Senate with a contribution of $25, $50, or $100 – help us meet our monthly goal and block Democrat extremists.
Washington Democrats and their unaccountable bureaucrats lost hundreds of millions of dollars to preventable unemployment security fraud. Thousands of Washingtonians are left dealing with the repercussions, including waiting for needed benefits.
Democrats refuse to hold the gross incompetence accountable. Republicans will fight back for you. We’ve done it before, and we’ll do it again. Will you help us by ensuring we retake the state Senate?
For months, Republicans called for a special session to deal with the fallout of COVID-19 shutdowns. Jay Inslee and his fellow Democrats’ refusal to call a special session will impact our state budget for decades, placing an unprecedented strain on hardworking Washington families.
It’s time to put an end to the chaos caused by Washington Democrats in our state. Help Republicans retake the state Senate. You can count on us to place a must needed check on out-of-control Democrats. Donate today - with your help, we can ensure Republicans win their state Senate races and regain the majority.

Friends –
For this week, we couldn’t forget to highlight our wonderful Curtis King! Senator King represents South Central Washington’s 14th Legislative District in the Washington State Senate.
He is a Yakima native, and since his original appointment to the Legislature in 2007, he has been a member of the Senate Transportation Committee on which he currently serves as the Ranking Minority Member. He is also the Ranking Minority Member on the Senate Labor & Commerce Committee and serves on the Rules Committee, as well.
Senator King has served as chair of the Senate Transportation Committee from 2015 through 2017, following two years as a bipartisan co-chair. During that time, he was the primary sponsor of the first successful transportation revenue package in more than a decade. The $16 billion infrastructure package funds six transportation megaprojects, more than 140 regional congestion-relief and road safety projects, and invests $1.4 billion for the maintenance and preservation of existing roads and bridges.
Another of King’s top priorities is improving Washington’s business climate to encourage new businesses to develop and existing businesses to flourish. He believes that having successful businesses in our state means more jobs for our citizens, something that will help drive our economy and improve our overall quality of life.
Senator King is a past president of the Central Washington State Fair Board and has served as an active member for 16 years. He ran a commercial cabinet shop with his father and brother, growing it into a successful company with 40 employees.
He holds B.S. degrees in Physics and Mathematics from the University of Washington. While working for General Electric on the East Coast, he received his M.B.A. from Clemson-Furman Universities.
Please visit his website [[URL REDACTED]] and consider making a donation that will help send him back to Olympia, where he can continue to be the voice and represent the values of the 14th District!

In just a few short weeks, candidates across the state will officially declare their candidacy for offices up and down the ballot. Over the past few months, we’ve introduced you to our tremendous candidates – some familiar faces, and some new – who have stepped up to serve their communities. They have committed their time and treasure to running strong campaigns to take back our Republican majority in the State Senate.
Most of them announced their candidacy before the COVID-19 pandemic, which has not only changed how we operate in our daily lives but also how we run campaigns. It’s very possible that large public events, fundraisers, and even door knocking won’t be allowed for the foreseeable future. This means the traditional playbook has gone out the window. While it has, we will all be working even harder to get our message out.
The voters need know that Democrats passed an inappropriate sex education bill for kindergartners. They need to know that Democrats are blocking $30 car tabs. They need to know that Democrats are the reason our rainy-day fund won’t be sufficient to weather economic challenges we’re facing.
The only way we can let voters know the truth about what exactly the Democrats are up to in Olympia is with your financial support. We need your help to get this message in front of voters. With COVID-19, we can’t go out and knock on doors, so we have to adjust our campaign plans.
This pivot also means that we will have to spend more money on paid advertising like mailers, digital ads, TV, and radio to get the message out. And that means that we have to increase our budgets and raise even more money to be able to execute a winning campaign plan.
Will you commit to helping propel our 2020 candidates to victory by making a contribution to our Majority Fund?
Tonight at midnight is our monthly campaign finance reporting deadline and we’re coming up just short of our goal? We need to raise another $1,477 to meet our April fundraising goal. Can you chip in $50, $25, or just $10 to help us close the gap?
Thanks for your support!

We want to join Connie Beauvais, our candidate for State Senate on the Olympic Peninsula, in congratulating everyone involved in the effort to gather signatures for Referendum 90. Parents, grandparents, and other concerned citizens had the seemingly impossible task of gathering signatures during the COVID-19 restrictions to get the repeal of the perverse ""sex-ed for kindergarteners"" bill on the ballot. This bill was a priority for the Democrats last session and we knew, from the moment it passed, that there was going to be overwhelming opposition. In the end, they were able to gather more than 266,000 signatures—nearly double the amount required—to ensure the referendum qualified for the ballot.
Stay tuned, there is more work to do! We'll be letting you know ways you can help get-out-the-vote and make sure the repeal passes.

Port Commissioner Connie Beauvais Praises Referendum 90 Signatures Totals
Nearly 260K signatures turned in to eliminate sex education for Kindergarteners
Joyce, WA—Port Commissioner Connie Beauvais, 24th State Senate Candidate, released the following statement upon receiving the news that Referendum 90 (concerning the repeal of the mandatory sex education for Kindergarteners) likely received more than enough signatures to be on the ballot in November.
> “I was appalled when Seattle influenced State Senator Van De Wege supported comprehensive sex education for kindergarteners putting his extreme views over the rights of parents.
>
>  I am immensely proud of the 260,000 people who signed the petition to put Referendum 90 on the ballot.
>
>  I want to give a shout out to some of our local community members that worked hard on protecting our kids like parents Jason Peterson and Jenna West. As well as local teachers like Marcia Garret that raised concerns about what they were teaching our children.”

Friends –
Today's candidate spotlight is Sen. Michael Padden, who represents the 4th District, which includes parts of Spokane Valley. Mike was first elected to the Senate in 2011 in a special election and re-elected in 2012 and 2016.
Mike is a 33 year resident of the 4th District. He has lived in the same house and the same neighborhood. His wife Laura was born in Spokane and raised in the Valley since the age of two. Together they have been honored to live, work, and raise a family in a great community.
When Mike's not in session, he's back home in the Valley with his wife Laura, where they raised five boys who are all adults now.
During that time, Mike has developed an understanding of the concerns, interests, and needs of those in the 4th district because he and his family share those same values. Mike was first elected to the State Legislature in 1980 and was re-elected by the 4th District voters for seven more terms. Mike served as a citizen legislator in Olympia for 14+ years. During that time, Mike held many different leadership roles, including Majority Floor Leader and Chairman of the Law and Justice Committee. After serving in the house, Mike was appointed District Court judge and served in that role for 12 years.
Mike has earned the reputation of standing strong on principle \- no higher taxes, smaller government, and a defender of life. Still, Mike was willing to engage the process and was successful in forging coalitions to pass legislation even when in the minority. Mike is currently ranking member on Senate Law & Justice committee and a member of the Transportation and Early Learning & K-12 Education committees. Mike ran a successful campaign in 2016 and is now running for re-election. Please visit his website at [[URL REDACTED]] and consider contributing to his campaign while you are there.
Thanks!

Johnny Alvarado,info@srcc.org,Inslee’s latest 2020 failure? Preventable wildfires.  ,"I wanted to follow up on Josulan and Johnny’s emails. Thanks to the generousity of our supporters, we are just $844 short of our August online fundraising goal!
Friends,
We can all agree – 2020 has been a tough year, and Jay Inslee has not made it any easier. The latest failure of Inslee’s leadership to harm the lives of Washingtonians? Preventable wildfires.
Inslee blames the massive wildfires on climate change. But that’s not the full story – not even close. According to experts, wildfires are also the result of poor forest management practices. Solutions include thinning forests through “logging prescribed burns and allowing naturally occurring fires to be managed instead of extinguished.”
Smart forest management prevents air pollution, saves taxpayer dollars, brings more revenue to the government, and – most importantly – saves lives. Of course, that would leave Inslee without his yearly climate change talking points. It’s time to put a stop to careless governance. Will you help us place a check on out-of-control Inslee today?
Given his reckless disregard for preventing wildfires, it’s more important than ever to hold Inslee accountable. With your help, Republicans can win back the state Senate. We’ve done it before. Will you help us do it again?
The 2020 wildfires have cost lives, homes, and livelihoods. Yet, Inslee refuses to acknowledge reality. UW Atmospheric Science Professor Cliff Mass called Inslee’s climate change assertions “180 degrees of wrong.” He points out the easterly winds that create massive fires weaken under climate change, lessening risks of rapid spread.
Our state needs leadership capable of addressing major challenges with real solutions. Your help is critical. Help Republicans win the state Senate, prevent Inslee and fellow Democrats from doing even more damage to our state.
At a time when hardworking families face unprecedented challenges as a result of Inslee’s failed leadership, Democrats will push to raise taxes during the 2021 legislative session. It’s why Inslee refuses to call a special session to manage our state’s pressing budget shortfall – only made greater by the recent wildfires. Their solution isn’t to solve problems; it’s to create more problems with heavier tax burdens.
We’ve seen it happen before. Democrats’ obsession with higher taxes will make our economic challenges worse – and lives more difficult. Now is the time to act. Put a check on Democrats’ tax agenda. Help Republicans take back the state Senate by donating $75, $50, or $25 today.

Despite the challenges, we must move forward, but we need your help! If you can, please make a contribution of any amount to our Majority Fund and help us propel our candidates to victory!
Washingtonians are disapproving of with political way Jay Inslee is handling the pandemic and are furious with his mismanagement resulting in us losing perhaps $1 billion to Nigerian scammers. We know we have a good chance to win, with your help.
Are you in?
We have a tremendous opportunity to take back the majority in the State Senate thanks to our first-class candidates and this unexpected political environment. The Democrats are looking to use this crisis and the economic downturn to push for more taxes - both by renewing their push for an income tax and Jay Inslee pushing his extreme environmental policies - because, as they say, “never let a good crisis go to waste!”
It’s up to us to stop them and the only way we can do that is by regaining our majority. Will you make a contribution of any amount to the Majority Fund right now?

Democrats want to defund the police in your community. It’s time to fight back and preserve public safety.
Friends –
Jay Inslee and the Democrats do not have a high regard for law and order – that’s the lesson of the last few months. Between attacks on innocent people and the destruction of businesses, lawlessness rules the day under Democrat leadership. It’s clearer than ever, Democrats have embraced extremists at the expense of public safety.
We cannot leave the safety of our communities in the hands of Democrats. That’s why it’s imperative for Republicans to regain control of the State Senate. Watch our new commercial and chip in to help keep it on the air!
Seattle Democrats’ move to defund their already under-resourced police department sends an important warning. The extreme policies implemented in Seattle all too often become mainstream Democrat positions, impacting communities across Washington State.
We need your support to stop well-funded Democrats and place a check on their extreme agenda. Help us re-take the State Senate with a $25 contribution.
True to form, Democrats lost no time pushing their extreme positions beyond Seattle. Two Democrat-backed ordinances in King County seek to strip voters of their right to elect the King County Sheriff and place control – from appointments to budgeting to job duties – in the hands of the Democrat-controlled and highly partisan county council.
Democrats behind the ordinances are speaking the quiet part out loud. They openly admit the ordinance represent the “first-step” to defunding the police at county levels. It’s time to fight back and place a check on Democrats’ unrestrained power in our state. Will you help Republicans win back the State Senate?
And where’s Jay Inslee? It should come as no surprise that Washingtonians cannot depend on the last person to know about CHOP for real leadership. Inslee’s inaction speaks volumes. His refusal to implement the law and preserve public safety sends a clear message: he isn't for law abiding citizens and he won’t defend the innocent.
Republicans are the party of law and order. Help Republicans re-take the State Senate. You can count on us to fight for your safety and the wellbeing of your community.

Team –
It has been 60 long days and the Legislative Session has finally come to an end. The campaign to take back our majority in the state Senate starts today!
In 60 days, the Democrat majorities were able to pass a bloated budget that increases spending by 20%, a B&O tax hike on businesses despite bringing in an additional $1.5 billion in unanticipated revenue, and an outrageous and pornographic mandatory sex ed bill that starts in kindergarten.
The Democrats managed to find time to decide on the state dinosaur and micro animal while refusing to take action on upholding the will of the voters and implement $30 car tabs, provide adequate solutions to address the homeless crisis, or get rid of title-only “ghost” bills that only serve to raise taxes and take away more of your rights.
While Republicans fought hard against their constant stream of bad ideas, we don’t have the numbers to stop them. Majorities matter and we must regain our Senate majority to restore our firewall against Jay Inslee and his extremist allies.
Can you step up and make a contribution of at least $5 to our 2020 Majority Fund?
Over the past few weeks we have been introducing you to some incredible community leaders who have stepped up to run for the state Senate this year and we need you to step up to support them. I’m very excited about our slate of candidates this year but only with your support, will we be able to provide them the support and resources to be victorious in November.
It’s going to take all of us doing our part to put an end to one-party control in Olympia. Can we count on you?

We are in unprecedented times. The 2020 legislative session ended with a vote to approve $200 million in funding to combat the coronavirus. Senator O'Ban was the first Senator to introduce a bill to set aside funds from our surplus to help pay for additional testing, nurses and unemployment benefits.
Steve O'Ban is a Republican leader in addiction, homelessness and mental illness. He has seen how our mental health and addiction recovery systems are overdue for major policy changes and focused investment. So this year he helped shape the state's mental health budget, helped bring a new mental health clinic for veterans and their families, and establish a crisis facility for the mentally ill.
Senator O'Ban also sponsored novel legislation to require the substance-addicted and mentally ill, often in and out of jail, to get treatment. We know too many parents heartbroken over adult children enslaved to their addictions, who become chronic criminals, and waste their God-given human potential. They must be compelled to get treatment to literally save their lives.
Senator Steve O'Ban is also known for battling the skyrocketing Sound Transit car tab fees and fighting for $30 car tabs. He filed an amicus brief in defense of taxpayers in the $30 car tabs lawsuit. And he authored a bill, #Trexit, to exit Pierce County from Sound Transit (ST3). Despite a$5.3 billion surplus in tax revenues, Democrats who control Olympia raised new [[URL REDACTED]] time: $25 billion in new taxes.
At a time when small businesses are under tremendous strain from the coronavirus shut downs, Olympia didn't need the money but raised their taxes anyway.
Senator Steve O'Ban is a leading Republican voice in Olympia, fighting the spending and extremism of the left.
As you can see, Steve is a fighter and although this campaign is going to be tough, I know he's up for it. Please visit his website at [[URL REDACTED]] and consider making a contribution to help propel him to victory.

Friends –
The Left and many in the media are attempting to paint the “CHAZ” in Seattle as a peaceful “block party” protest where people are sharing ideas, planting community gardens, and creating some sort of peaceful utopia. While there might be some of that happening during the day, what happens at night seems to be a different story.
Brandi Kruse, the political reporter with Q13 FOX, posted an uncut video on Facebook this morning that shows her and her crew being, in her words, “targeted, stalked, harassed, and assaulted.” I encourage you to take the time to watch it and see what it looks like when mobs roam the street and the police aren’t there to intervene. Beware, there is a significant amount of profanity in the video.
Not only is that video just plain frightening, it also gives a raw, inside look into the lawlessness that’s occurring. The politics of appeasement by Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan doesn’t seem to be working too well either. Just the other day, her police chief Carmen Best openly criticized city leaders for abandoning the East Precinct after they told officers to just stand there and be assaulted while protecting it. Then, just yesterday, after coming to an agreement with “leaders” of protest to shrink the area of the CHAZ to allow for better mobility in the area by adding new barriers while opening up some lanes, the lanes are already being blocked again by protesters’ cars. How can you negotiate with a leaderless organization anyway?
This is mayhem, plain and simple. This appeasement strategy is only going to embolden people and spiral further out of control. Seattle is the Left’s testing ground for bad ideas that they then attempt to duplicate around the state. We need to have a firewall in Olympia to be able to stop the spread of Seattle’s failed policies around the state.

P.S. If this wasn’t all bad enough, with a $500 million budget shortfall looming for the city, Kshama Sawant and her socialist colleagues have introduced new ideas to “Tax Amazon” and other large businesses.

Friends –
By now I’m sure most of you have heard about the outrageous sex ed bill that the Democrats pushed through last week. ESSB 5395 was bill sponsored by Sen. Claire Wilson (D-Federal Way). The companion House bill HB 1407 was sponsored by Rep. Monica Stonier (D-Vancouver).
ESSB 5395 is also known as the Sex Ed For Kindergartners bill. It will force sex ed curriculum on every school kid in the state from kindergarten through 12th grade. Kindergartners will be encouraged to question the traditional role of genders. In each subsequent grade, the material gets more graphic and more controversial.
The bill passed after hours of highly charged debate in both the House and Senate chambers. Republican Caucus members in both chambers pleaded for amendments to allow parents more control of their kids’ education on this matter. Democrats rejected almost every effort to significantly reform the bills and let parents keep their rights.
In order to become law, Governor Inslee still has to sign the legislation. I have told him that this “Sex Ed for Kindergartners” bill deserves his veto. Parents from all over the state are outraged at this being forced on their children. Though I am doubtful that he will veto it since this was priority legislation for Planned Parenthood and some of the Democrats’ other biggest funders. Stranger things have happened so I’m urging you to sign our petition calling on Governor Inslee to veto ESSB 5395.
We have formed an organization called Parents for Safe Schools which is committed to helping overturn this terrible bill by referendum if the governor signs it. If a referendum is needed, 129,811 signatures will need to be gathered by June 10 to get the repeal on the November ballot.
Please sign our petition calling on Governor Inslee to veto ESSB 5395 and get ready to fight even harder for our kids if he signs it.
We’ll keep you updated on future developments and how you can help.

Ron Muzzall was appointed to the Senate late last year and then was immediately thrust into his first legislative session in January. Sen. Muzzall quickly distinguished himself as a civil and pragamatic voice in Olympia.
Ron and his family have been farming on Whidbey Island for over 100 years. With this family so ingrained in our community's history, Ron has developed a passion for serving friends, neighbors, and associates. This has led him to be involved in agricultural and industry associations. He has also served as a firefighter and Fire Commissioner with North Whidbey Fire and Rescue.
He served 15 years on the board of Skagit Farmers Supply, including serving as its Chair. He also put his expertise to work on the National Council of Farmer Cooperatives and on the board of the Land O’Lakes Cooperative.
Ron always looks for common-sense solutions, and believes in a responsible government that spends taxpayer money sensibly and pragmatically to ensure that citizens have the best services available.
The hard-working families and small businesses of Washington are overburdened with taxes, especially after the Democratic-controlled legislature increased taxes that go into effect this year, when our local companies are already struggling due to coronavirus closures. Senator Muzzall will fight to roll back those taxes and save our important small businesses!

Our July fundraising deadline is tonight at midnight and we’re still $3,450 away from hitting our goal. We can’t afford to go into election week short of our fundraising numbers. The primaries are going to be neck and neck, and we need the funds to hit the ground running the morning after election day.
Will you pitch in $10, $25, $50 or $100 today?
We’ve already seen that the majority of the money that Democrats have been spending is from major corporations and special interest groups. If everyone who reads this email pitches in today, we can show the Far-Left that we’re ready for a fight.

We appreciate your continued support, and for stepping up when it counts the most.

Friends –
Anyone who knows Senator Lynda Wilson knows she's driven and she's a fighter. Lynda is running for her second term after establishing herself as a leader in the Republican caucus over the past four years.
She is a native Washingtonian and has lived in Clark County since 1973. Lynda and her husband Tracy have been married for over 35 years, and have three grown daughters and five grandchildren. Lynda and Tracy are owners of DeWils Industries, a kitchen cabinet manufacturer that employs over 130 people in family-wage jobs.
Lynda started her political career as a Precinct Committee Officer in 2010 and later became Chairman of the Clark County Republican Party until early 2014. She resigned from the party’s leadership position to dedicate her full attention to run for the House. She was elected to the House, defeating the incumbent, in 2014 and cut her teeth during the 2015 session which was 176 days long – the longest in state history.
During her time in the House, Lynda was appointed to the leadership role of Assistant Minority Whip. She was also appointed to the bipartisan Joint Administrative Rules Review Committee and served as Ranking Member of the Community Development, Housing, and Tribal Affairs Committee. She became known as a strong advocate for creating jobs, lowering taxes, reducing regulations, and protecting our freedoms from big government.
In 2016, Lynda decided to run for the state Senate and won her race, one of the most hotly contested in the state. She serves as the ranking member on the Financial Institutions, Economic Development & Trade Committee, secretary of the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Committee, on the budget writing Ways & Means Committee, as well as the Joint Committee on Veterans and Military Affairs, among others. She has made it her priority to increase job opportunities, hold government accountable, and reduce unnecessary regulations that hold our economy back.
We're really blessed to have leaders like Lynda Wilson in the caucus and we need her back next year. Please visit her website at [[URL REDACTED]] and support her campaign if you are able.
Thanks for your continued support,

Friends –
As we continue our series of introducing our incredible 2020 candidates, I want to introduce you Jeff Wilson, who is running in the 19th District. The 19th District is one of our state's only true ""swing"" districts.
Jeff currently serves as the Vice President for the Port of Longview Commission, Washington’s fourth largest port. He was elected to that position in 2015 and has also served as Port Commission President. His main priority moving from Port Commissioner to the state senate will be to ensure rural Washington has a voice in Olympia, and any plans or stimulus effort to revitalize the economy are fairly dispersed across the state.
As an advocate for economic growth and fiscal responsibility, Jeff has been a uniting force in leading the Port’s effort to reduce taxes, eliminate fees, and promote Southwest Washington as an economic region. More importantly, he has worked to bring good-paying jobs to his community. Jeff has pointed to the need to protect and shore up jobs in the community as a top priority given the devastating impact the coronavirus outbreak is having across the state.
Along with his wife Trisha, the Wilsons are well-known in Southwest Washington for their support of local charities and success in building small businesses. Jeff's resume includes serving as Port of Longview Commissioner; Past President Longview 23 Club; Co-Founder 100 Men/Women Who Care Lower Columbia; Co-Founder Extreme Machines; Longview School and Facilities Advisory Committee; Hospice Foundation past president; Shay Locomotive; Housing Task Force; elected salaries commission; and was recently awarded the Longview Extra Mile Award & the Key to the City award for outstanding efforts to promote their community.

Johnny Alvarado,info@srcc.org,Keep Our Ad on the Air!  ,"Democrats want to defund the police in your community. It’s time to fight back and preserve public safety.
Friends –
Jay Inslee and the Democrats do not have a high regard for law and order – that’s the lesson of the last few months. Between attacks on innocent people and the destruction of businesses, lawlessness rules the day under Democrat leadership. It’s clearer than ever, Democrats have embraced extremists at the expense of public safety.
We cannot leave the safety of our communities in the hands of Democrats. That’s why it’s imperative for Republicans to regain control of the State Senate. Watch our new commercial and chip in to help keep it on the air!
Seattle Democrats’ move to defund their already under-resourced police department sends an important warning. The extreme policies implemented in Seattle all too often become mainstream Democrat positions, impacting communities across Washington State.
We need your support to stop well-funded Democrats and place a check on their extreme agenda. Help us re-take the State Senate with a $25 contribution.
True to form, Democrats lost no time pushing their extreme positions beyond Seattle. Two Democrat-backed ordinances in King County seek to strip voters of their right to elect the King County Sheriff and place control – from appointments to budgeting to job duties – in the hands of the Democrat-controlled and highly partisan county council.
Democrats behind the ordinances are speaking the quiet part out loud. They openly admit the ordinance represent the “first-step” to defunding the police at county levels. It’s time to fight back and place a check on Democrats’ unrestrained power in our state. Will you help Republicans win back the State Senate?
And where’s Jay Inslee? It should come as no surprise that Washingtonians cannot depend on the last person to know about CHOP for real leadership. Inslee’s inaction speaks volumes. His refusal to implement the law and preserve public safety sends a clear message: he isn't for law abiding citizens and he won’t defend the innocent.
Republicans are the party of law and order. Help Republicans re-take the State Senate. You can count on us to fight for your safety and the wellbeing of your community.

Senator Ann Rivers is known around Olympia as someone who works hard and gets results for her constituents. She also serves in the top 4 republican leadership as the Republican Whip.
Ann was first elected to the State House in 2010, in the middle of the Great Recession. After a successful term in the House, she ran for the State Senate in 2012 at the same time that the Democrats' lost their majority. Her caucus colleagues quickly elected her as Majority Whip, one of the top four leadership positions.
She has served on the powerful Ways and Means, Transportation, Government Operations and Tribal Affairs, Early Learning K-12, Environment, Energy & Technology, Healthcare, and Rules committees. Ann served as the Chair of the Healthcare Committee while in the majority and championed improving access to medical and dental care in rural areas of our state. In addition, she got significant funding for foundation public health emergency response fund which prepared us for current and future health risks.
Ann resides in La Center with her husband Fred. Ann currently serves on several boards that are vital to her district, region, and state.
I encourage you to support Ann's campaign by visiting [[URL REDACTED]] and making a contribution so she can keep working for all of us in Olympia.

Over the past few weeks we’ve been introducing you to some our great senate candidates who are challenging incumbent Democrats to help us retake the majority. Today, I want to introduce you to a candidate who is running in a seat where Randi Becker, one of our members who is retiring. Keeping seats like these in Republican hands is also an essential part of our plan.
Ronda Litzenberger is a native of Eatonville where she and her husband of more than 30 years have raised five children and built a successful small business together. She has also spent the past 11 years serving on the Eatonville School Board and as the chair of the small schools committee for the Washington State School Directors Association (WSSDA).
Through her time as a business owner and community leader, Ronda has learned how to build diverse coalitions to solve problems in the community. Her WSSDA experience has taken her to Olympia and equipped her with knowledge of the challenges and opportunities that await her in the legislature.
Ronda will be a strong advocate for the 2nd District and will stand up for family values, educational opportunity, and be a good steward to taxpayer dollars by prioritizing state spending.
Senator Becker has strongly endorsed Ronda saying, “I have carried the people of the 2nd district in my heart for over 40 years; I share their views, values, beliefs and character. I say confidently that Ronda best represents the views, values and character of the 2nd district and hope you will join me in supporting her!”
We’re excited about Rhonda’s campaign and encourage you to learn more about her at [[URL REDACTED]]

Team –
One of the highlights of my job in the legislature is being your advocate at the budget negotiation table as the ranking Republican on the Senate Ways & Means Committee. Ways & Means is the budget writing committee and it’s where your Senate Republicans fight for fiscal responsibility and sensible taxation.
Just a few years ago, when Republicans were in the majority, I was the Chairman of Ways & Means committee. I’m proud to say that we passed a bi-partisan budget that made historic investments in our K-12 education system, improved our mental health system, and more without the $8 billion in tax increases that the Democrats wanted. With Democrats back in the majority, the same can’t be said anymore.
This year, with our state’s revenue situation being $1.5 billion ahead of projections, Democrats simply spread the excess between state agencies instead of providing you tangible tax relief. Instead, they passed a budget that increased spending by $1 billion dollars and passed a billion-dollar tax hike on businesses. And, while they didn’t make a serious effort for a capital gains income tax this year, you can bet it’s at the top of the agenda for next year.
If you’re ready to take back the majority in the State Senate and stop the Democrats’ reckless tax and spend policies, please make a contribution to the 2020 Majority Fund today!
Since the legislature adjourned a few weeks ago, our world has changed, and our priorities should change. There’s no telling what the short-term and long-term impact of the coronavirus pandemic will have on our economy but what we do know right now is that many of our neighbors are losing their jobs and their small businesses. This is no time for us to be raising taxes and spending beyond our means.
I hope Governor Inslee will seriously consider using his veto power to bring this budget back to reality. But we should have never been in this situation, we didn’t need more revenue and we should have been saving for a rainy day. If this outbreak has taught us anything, it’s that our economic picture can change drastically over the course of a week.
We must return some fiscal sanity to Olympia and make sure that, once again, Senate Republican can be the firewall against the Democrats taxes and spending spree. Please make a secure online contribution of $5 or more and help is get back to the majority.
Thanks for your support,
John Braun

Today I am emailing you to advocate for my dear friend Connie Beauvais. Changing our State for the better hinges on winning this seat. That's why I need to talk with you about Legislative District 24 – a battleground race that experts are saying could decide the Senate majority.

She is running against incumbent Democrat Kevin Ven De Wege. Kevin has been in office since 2007, and during the COVID19 pandemic, he has been MIA. We're pretty sure he's around somewhere, but it's a bit hard to find him.
While Kevin has been missing in action, Connie has been spotted all throughout the district. During the pandemic, Connie worked tirelessly to obtain Personal Protection Equipment and has delivered over 100,000 pounds of food to families in need.
If this pandemic has shown us one thing, it has shown us that Kevin Ven De Wege needs to be voted out and that Legislative District 24 needs to elect Connie Beauvais. You can help Connie today by going to her website and donating to her campaign.

Friends –
Tonight, at midnight is our June fundraising deadline and we’re still about $2,900 short of our online fundraising goal. Can you help us close the gap?
Primary Election ballots go in the mail in less than three weeks and we’re relying on grassroots supporters like you to help us raise the necessary resources to take back our majority. Will you contribute $100, $50, $25, or just $5 to the Majority Fund and help us reach our goal?
Both Josalun and Johnny underscored what we’re facing: the “Seattle Spread” of some of the worst policy ideas, Democrats in Olympia talking about new taxes to address our budget deficit, and silence from Jay Inslee on the lawlessness occurring in the CHAZ/CHOP area of Seattle. We need to fight back, and I can’t think of a better way than ensuring we have the votes in the State Senate to stop these bad ideas.
Please make a secure online contribution of whatever amount you can afford to help us regain our majority.
We are very excited about the caliber of candidates we were able to recruit this cycle and we are working tirelessly to ensure they have the resources they need for victory.
Thank you for your continued support!

In these trying times due to COVID-19, you would think we would stand by those who protect us. You know who I'm talking about \- the men and woman in blue.
But as we see time and time again, that's simply, not the case. The defund the police or, in some cases, abolish the police movements are spreading. That's scary, that must stop.

It looks like our website had technical difficulties this weekend and many of you had trouble accessing it. We have resolved the issue and it’s back up and running!
I also want to make sure you saw Johnny’s email from Friday (below).
The CHAZ/CHOP in Seattle is fun to joke about but it is a perfect representation of the “politics of appeasement” practiced by the far-Left Seattle leadership. And Democrat leaders at the state-level – all the way up to Jay Inslee – are silently consenting to the lawlessness and violence there. Violence that left another person dead within its “borders” overnight.
Every day is a fresh reminder of why we must regain our Republican Majority in the State Senate to be a critical check on the Democrats. It will allow us to stop the steady flow of bad ideas that start in Seattle, come to Olympia, and end up in a neighborhood near you.
Please help us meet our month-end online fundraising goal by making a contribution of any amount of our Majority Fund. We need to raise an additional $5,147 by tomorrow at midnight to meet our goal.

Sen. Mark Schoesler,info@srcc.org,Fwd: Icky Inslee's Maggots  ,"Friends,
Have you heard? Jay Inslee brought maggot-infested homegrown apples to families impacted by wildfires in Douglas County. By transporting apples from maggot-infested Western Washington to a maggot-free agricultural zone, Inslee broke the law.
The Chelan-Douglas Horticultural Pest and Disease Board is now taking quick action, looking to locate Inslee's maggot-infested apples to prevent an infestation. County officials stated, ""Apple Maggots are an incredibly serious pest and could have dire consequences for the orchardists of Douglas County if we are unable to find the infected apples and mitigate the effects immediately.""
Inslee called the dire mistake a ""good reminder of the importance of awareness around apple quarantine."" To be clear, Washington produces 70% of the nation's apples. Our state's governor should be well aware of top agricultural concerns – especially when Douglas and Chelan counties have worked tirelessly through the years to ensure the health of orchards.
Rather than pay attention to our state's challenges, Inslee prefers to squeeze himself into the national limelight. Between his embarrassing bid for President to his unproductive bickering with the President, Inslee doesn't have much time for the concerns of hardworking families in Washington state.
It's time to elect leaders who care – leaders who will hold Inslee accountable and protect our communities. Will you help put Republicans back in control of the state Senate with a contribution of $10, $20, or $40?
We've done it before; we can do it again. But we need your help to win.
Thank you,

Public Health Advisory –
Check your fruit, everyone; Governor Inslee has been seen distributing tarnished food to wildfire victims.
In a ploy to warm hearts and fill stomachs, our Democrat Governor ILLEGALLY gifted maggot infested apples to Washingtonians affected by the recent wildfires.
Will you chip in $75, $50, or just $25 today to help us stop Icky Inslee's squirmy ethics?
These wildfires have already caused enough destruction to our land (over 600,000 acres), property (400+ buildings), and our health. We don't need to add fuel to this devastation by adding contaminated food to the mix.
Simply put, this is another example of grotesque oversight by our state's commander in chief.

Friends –
It’s time to fight back.
For many parents in Washington, the outrageous “comprehensive sex education” bill that the Democrats rammed through was the breaking point. The bill was pushed by special interests on the far left and promotes extreme curriculum like teaching kindergarteners to explore their gender identity.
This is just one of many examples of what happens when Democrats control both chambers of the legislature and the governor’s office. We must do everything possible to bring this to an end and that starts with taking back our Senate Majority. Can I count on you to chip in $20 to our 2020 Majority Fund?
With the uncertainty surrounding COVID-19 and how long “social distancing” measures will be in place, the way we communicate with voters will change. Events, parades, and even doorbelling likely won’t be possible for the foreseeable future, leaving much of the campaigning to be done online, on TV, and in print. Unfortunately, that is far more costly to reach people.
That’s why we really need your support! Please make a secure online contribution today.
We cannot allow the Democrats to maintain their control of Olympia. If they are able to maintain or expand their majority, we know what is coming next: a capital gains income tax, a carbon tax, more gun control, and whatever else they can dream up. These are all things they tried to pass this session and will undoubtedly be on the top of their list in January.

Seattle voted to defund their police department significantly – will the disregard for public safety impact your community?
Friends –
What happens in Seattle should stay in Seattle – at least, that’s the hope. Unfortunately, that’s not always reality.
Time and time again, Seattle’s absurd policies eventually find their way into communities across Washington State. Democrats do not have the incentives—and often not even the principles—to push back and protect Washington’s families.
That’s why it’s so important to elect representatives who will fight for you. With your help, Republicans can win back the state Senate. We’ve done it before, will you help us do it again?
Seattle Police Chief Carmen Best announced her resignation yesterday. Who can blame her? For years, Democrats have worked to make it more difficult for the police to keep our communities safe. This week, Seattle Democrats (and Socialists) delivered a hard blow—they voted to defund the Seattle Police Department significantly—including cutting the salaries of the police chief and her command staff.)
The extreme Left will not stop at slashes to police funding. Despite the devastation to public safety, they’re on a mission to defund police departments across Washington State. Will you help us fight back by donating $25 today?
With complete control of Olympia, Democrats’ can push their extreme agenda with virtually no resistance. That means Seattle Democrats’ attack on public safety may very well find its way into your community.
Your help is critical. Will you help block the spread of Democrats’ extreme agenda? Help put Republicans back in control of the state Senate and prevent Democrats from destroying public safety.
We’ve seen it happen before. From the small business destroying $15 minimum wage to arbitrary new local taxes, what seems a Seattle absurdity becomes mainstream Democrat policy.
Now is the time to act. Help protect communities across Washington State, put a check on Democrats’ extreme agenda. Donate $25 or more today.
Thanks for your help!

Filing week ended last Friday at 4:00pm and the races are set.
As Josalun and I have said before, we are very excited about the caliber of candidates that were recruited to run this year and their ability to help us regain the majority.
COVID-19 has impacted almost every part of our lives, and campaigns are no exception. The impacts are felt in both the issues that campaigns are talking about and how they reach out to voters. While this has provided a lot of challenges, there are also a lot of new opportunities.
The conversation is going to be focused in new areas that we don’t normally talk about. There are likely to be legal challenges but also a renewed focus on the governor’s authority and the legislature’s role in times like these. But there is no doubt that voters – especially business owners – are waking up and getting engaged.
We need your support to give us the resources to reach these voters and let them know that Republicans offer a better way. Will you chip in $50, $25, or just $5 today to help us take back the majority in the State Senate?
I know times are tough and not everyone is able to give right now. If you can’t make a donation right now, please consider reaching out to your friends by email or posting on Facebook and letting them know about the SRCC or about the Republican candidates in your area.
We have a tremendous opportunity to talk about keeping taxes low, reducing regulations to get our economy going again, getting people back to work, and increasing local control. We excited about the opportunities ahead over the next 6 months and I hope you are too. Please consider supporting Senate Republicans with a donation of any amount today.

I just wanted to take a minute and highlight an amazing community effort that Connie Beauvais, our candidate on the Olympic Peninsula organized.
Inspired by news reports on TV showing potato farmers dumping surplus crop on the ground for anyone to take, she sprung into action to organize a plan to get them into the hands of her community. Working with community leaders, Connie was able to organize an effort to get donations to acquire and transport thousands of pounds of potatoes and onions from Washington farmers.
Within a week, Connie and her team were able to get the product sourced, processed, transported, and distributed to the community at locations in Port Angeles and Forks. Connie told the Peninsula Daily News, ""My thought was to get these in the hands of as many as possible, especially essential workers. That’s why we are doing this on a Saturday, and anybody who is experiencing any kind of hardship, we want to let them know there are people in the community who care.”
We're proud to support community leaders like Connie and are excited to have her join the Senate Republican Caucus. Please consider making a donation to Connie's campaign right now to help ensure she has the resources to win in November.

Jeff has been a staple in the 19th District for over 50 years. Since 2015, he has served as the Vice President of the Port of Longview Commission. During his time on the Commission, Jeff has made reducing taxes, eliminating fees, promoting our regions, and bringing good-paying jobs to SW Washington his main priority. Now he wants to bring this expertise to Olympia and represent District 19 values.
DONATE
District 19 has been controlled by Progressive Liberals who vote with Seattle like tendencies and priorities. It is time that we get Jeff's fiscally responsible leadership into office.
A donation of $25, $50, or $75 towards Jeff's community-oriented campaign will help him be one step closer to overthrowing the democrat regime in the 19th Senate District.
Onward to Victory,
Johnny Alvarado

Johnny Alvarado,info@srcc.org,Seattle’s absurdities are tomorrow’s realities  ,"Seattle voted to defund their police department significantly – will the disregard for public safety impact your community?
Friends –
What happens in Seattle should stay in Seattle – at least, that’s the hope. Unfortunately, that’s not always reality.
Time and time again, Seattle’s absurd policies eventually find their way into communities across Washington State. Democrats do not have the incentives—and often not even the principles—to push back and protect Washington’s families.
That’s why it’s so important to elect representatives who will fight for you. With your help, Republicans can win back the state Senate. We’ve done it before, will you help us do it again?
Seattle Police Chief Carmen Best announced her resignation yesterday. Who can blame her? For years, Democrats have worked to make it more difficult for the police to keep our communities safe. This week, Seattle Democrats (and Socialists) delivered a hard blow—they voted to defund the Seattle Police Department significantly—including cutting the salaries of the police chief and her command staff.)
The extreme Left will not stop at slashes to police funding. Despite the devastation to public safety, they’re on a mission to defund police departments across Washington State. Will you help us fight back by donating $25 today?
With complete control of Olympia, Democrats’ can push their extreme agenda with virtually no resistance. That means Seattle Democrats’ attack on public safety may very well find its way into your community.
Your help is critical. Will you help block the spread of Democrats’ extreme agenda? Help put Republicans back in control of the state Senate and prevent Democrats from destroying public safety.
We’ve seen it happen before. From the small business destroying $15 minimum way to arbitrary new local taxes, what seems a Seattle absurdity becomes mainstream Democrat policy.
Now is the time to act. Help protect communities across Washington State, put a check on Democrats’ extreme agenda. Donate $25 or more today.
Thanks for your help!
Johnny

Hold onto your wallets folks, Jay Inslee and the Democrats in Olympia are coming for more of your money!
In June, under Majority Leader Andy Billig’s leadership, Senate Democrats released their version of the ""Economic & Budget Stabilization"" plan. Former Speaker Frank Chopp has also released his own version as well, which would create a payroll-style tax.
Simply put, both of these plans include nothing but taxes. You name the tax, and Democrat Leadership made sure they included it in their plan:
* Income Taxes
* Taxes on Services
* Carbon Fuel Taxes
* Sin Taxes
Inslee famously pledged that no tax would get across his desk when he ran for election against Rob McKenna. We have all come to learn that he promptly signs anything and everything tax-related that comes across his desk.
Donate $100, and we will send you a copy of this poster!
We cannot allow the Democrats to maintain their control of Olympia and on our wallets. Elect more Democrats, and we'll all be left with more crushing debt.
It's up to us to stop them, and the only way we can do that is by regaining our majority.
Help us stop them!

Friends –
We have a week left in the legislative session and it really can’t be over soon enough. Democrats have been able to do a lot of damage in these 54 days and it has certainly underscored for me the importance of restoring our Republican majority in the state Senate.
We can’t win back the majority without great candidates. I’m thrilled we have great candidates announcing their campaigns every week and I’m particularly excited about one who launched his campaign the other day. His name is Rey Reynolds and he is running in the 49th District in southwest Washington. Rey is a unique candidate that we think can provide a real challenge in a tough district for Republicans.
Rey is a decorated 21-year veteran of the Vancouver Police Department who has been recognized as “Clark County Officer of the Year.” Before his career in law enforcement, Rey put his degree in Water Resources with a minor in Biology to work with the Department of Fish and Wildlife for 12 years.
A fixture in the community, Rey is a “super volunteer” who has been recognized with the “Distinguished American Award” which recognizes people who “set the standard for excellence in a life of service to the community.” Through his career and volunteer work, Rey has on the ground experience with homelessness and drug addiction. Additionally, as a school resource officer, he understands the needs of students and their families.
Rey and his wife Kathryn have been married for 28 years and have six children.
I hope you’ll take a moment to learn more about Rey Reynolds on his campaign website - [[URL REDACTED]] As I’ve said before, regardless of where you live in Washington, we need to support these outstanding candidates to make sure we win back enough seats to retake the majority.
Thank you for your continued support!

Friends –
The Primary Election is over and the matchups for the General Election are set.
Voter turnout in the Primary was higher than almost anyone predicted which shows the level of enthusiasm for change this November. Jay Inslee and Democrats have been asleep at the wheel when it comes to addressing our massive budget shortfall due to the COVID-19 shutdowns and Washingtonians have taken notice. The election results showed that there are several real pickup opportunities as we march toward regaining the majority in November.
We could not be prouder of our outstanding roster of Senate Republican candidates. They have adapted well to this challenging political environment and we are poised to be able be competitive in traditionally Democrats seats. They need your continued support – through your time, talent, and treasure – to be successful in November.
Below you will find a list of all of our endorsed candidates. Please take a moment, if you haven’t already, to find a candidate in your area to support.
Together, we can take back the majority in November and restore some balance to Olympia.
Thank you!

Friends –
I want to say first and foremost: Thank you!
The Washington Senate Campaign Committee truly appreciates your support. Because of generous donations from folks like you, we blew past our fundraising goal for the month of June. We raised more money online this past month than we have any other month within the past 4 years. Our mail donations were right on par for a record high as well.
With COVID and all the uncertainty, we were not sure if we would be able to reach our goal. I know there's so much going on throughout our state and country, and so many of us are facing unprecedented challenges every day. Your donations are an investment in our candidates and a testament to your belief that our state should be heading in a different direction.
With Referendum 90 qualifying with record signatures, this month and all the unrest and chaos going on in CHAZ/CHOP, our state deserves better than the Democrat Majority in the Senate.
We have an election coming up on August 4th and on November 3rd, and it makes the work we do right now that much more critical. Thank you for supporting our great candidates, our caucus, and in believing in our message. We promise to continue to listen to you and to all of Washingtonians.
We hope that you enjoy your 4th of July weekend with your family and friends, and please stay safe. God Bless America!
Thank you,
Mark

Friends –
Our featured candidate highlight this is week is Senator Brad Hawkins, who has been serving the people of the 12th District since 2013. This includes Douglas and Chelan Counties, as well as parts of Grant and Okanogan Counties.
Senator Hawkins grew up in the Wenatchee Valley and received his K-12 education in the Wenatchee School District. After graduating magna cum laude from Central Washington University, he completed his Master’s in Public Administration at George Washington University in Washington, D.C. and returned to the Wenatchee Valley after graduation. He and his wife, Shawna, live in East Wenatchee with their two young children.
Brad has been active in his community, serving on the North Central Educational Service District Board of Directors, Wenatchee Valley YMCA Board of Directors, and the Eastmont School Board, including two years as school-board president. As for his service in the Legislature, he is currently the Deputy Floor leader and serves as Ranking Member on the Early Learning & K-12 Education Committee as well as on the State Government, Tribal Affairs & Elections Committee. His legislative priorities focus on the essential services of government: education, transportation and public safety.
As a former school-board member, he believes quality public schools and higher-education institutions can prepare a workforce to help the economy prosper. Maintaining state roads and bridges are vital to transporting the 12th District’s world-class agricultural products. He believes providing necessary law enforcement, judicial oversight and corrections will help maintain a safe environment for our businesses and families. Senator Hawkins supports state budgeting efforts that are aligned to deliver these services in the most cost-effective manner possible.
Improved tax treatment for hydropower has been a key priority for Senator Hawkins, as well. Last session he sponsored a Hydropower tax incentive bill (SB 6012) that helps acknowledge hydropower’s important role in providing clean energy. He has also been awarded the Washington PUD Association’s “Legislative Champion” Award for securing the passage of SB 5588 (PUD renewable hydrogen) during the 2019 session.
Additionally, Senator Hawkins has been a leading voice in forest health and wildfire response within the caucus. Sponsoring and passing multiple bills in 2017 (SB 5545 and SB 5720) and in 2018 (SB 6211) following back to back years of the state’s largest wildfires in his district.
We're very lucky to have leaders like Brad Hawkins in the caucus and we would like to have him back next year. Please feel free to contact him at any time at: [[URL REDACTED]] and help support his campaign if you are able, by making a check out to:

Josalun Hasz,info@srcc.org,Fwd: Peaceful?  ,"I want to make sure you saw Johnny’s email on Thursday about the situation in Seattle. The CHAZ (or I guess they might be calling it the CHAD now?) is clearly out of control and the Seattle leadership seems to be fine continuing their policy of appeasement. Maybe things will change with the shooting this morning that left one person dead and one person critically injured?
Governor Inslee, who just the other day claimed to know nothing about the situation, now appears to have finally turned on the news. When asked about the state intervening during a press conference last week, he made it clear that he had no interest in getting involved in the situation. He said, “I am not the Mayor of Seattle” and that it was their responsibility to figure it out but he “wished them well.”
It seems that Democrats at all levels are fine with this situation and the lawlessness that is ensuing. The socialists on the Seattle City Council are also feeling emboldened to introduce a steady stream of new taxes in this political environment. In addition to the revival of the “head tax” proposals that Johnny mentioned, they have now introduced a capital gains income tax proposal.
The cascading effect of the “Seattle Spread” can’t be overstated. Success at Seattle City Hall means seeing these ideas proven and exported to Olympia and the rest of the state. A Republican Senate Majority is critical to stopping crazy legislation dead in its tracks. Please make a secure online contribution to our Majority Fund so we can make meaningful investments to propel our candidates to victory!

The Left and many in the media are attempting to paint the “CHAZ” in Seattle as a peaceful “block party” protest where people are sharing ideas, planting community gardens, and creating some sort of peaceful utopia.
Friends –
The Left and many in the media are attempting to paint the “CHAZ” in Seattle as a peaceful “block party” protest where people are sharing ideas, planting community gardens, and creating some sort of peaceful utopia. While there might be some of that happening during the day, what happens at night seems to be a different story.
Brandi Kruse, the political reporter with Q13 FOX, posted an uncut video on Facebook this morning that shows her and her crew being, in her words, “targeted, stalked, harassed, and assaulted.” I encourage you to take the time to watch it and see what it looks like when mobs roam the street and the police aren’t there to intervene. Beware, there is a significant amount of profanity in the video.
Not only is that video just plain frightening, it also gives a raw, inside look into the lawlessness that’s occurring. The politics of appeasement by Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan doesn’t seem to be working too well either. Just the other day, her police chief Carmen Best openly criticized city leaders for abandoning the East Precinct after they told officers to just stand there and be assaulted while protecting it. Then, just yesterday, after coming to an agreement with “leaders” of protest to shrink the area of the CHAZ to allow for better mobility in the area by adding new barriers while opening up some lanes, the lanes are already being blocked again by protesters’ cars. How can you negotiate with a leaderless organization anyway?
This is mayhem, plain and simple. This appeasement strategy is only going to embolden people and spiral further out of control. Seattle is the Left’s testing ground for bad ideas that they then attempt to duplicate around the state. We need to have a firewall in Olympia to be able to stop the spread of Seattle’s failed policies around the state.

P.S. If this wasn’t all bad enough, with a $500 million budget shortfall looming for the city, Kshama Sawant and her socialist colleagues have introduced new ideas to “Tax Amazon” and other large businesses. Make no mistake, if they succeed in implementing these in Seattle, you’ll see them proposed statewide. Let’s make sure we can stop them.

In just a few short weeks, candidates across the state will officially declare their candidacy for offices up and down the ballot. Over the past few months, we’ve introduced you to our tremendous candidates – some familiar faces, and some new – who have stepped up to serve their communities. They have committed their time and treasure to running strong campaigns to take back our Republican majority in the State Senate.
Most of them announced their candidacy before the COVID-19 pandemic, which has not only changed how we operate in our daily lives but also how we run campaigns. It’s very possible that large public events, fundraisers, and even door knocking won’t be allowed for the foreseeable future. This means the traditional playbook has gone out the window. While it has, we will all be working even harder to get our message out.
The voters need know that Democrats passed an inappropriate sex education bill for kindergartners. They need to know that Democrats are blocking $30 car tabs. They need to know that Democrats are the reason our rainy-day fund won’t be sufficient to weather economic challenges we’re facing.
The only way we can let voters know the truth about what exactly the Democrats are up to in Olympia is with your financial support. We need your help to get this message in front of voters. With COVID-19, we can’t go out and knock on doors, so we have to adjust our campaign plans.
This pivot also means that we will have to spend more money on paid advertising like mailers, digital ads, TV, and radio to get the message out. And that means that we have to increase our budgets and raise even more money to be able to execute a winning campaign plan.
Will you commit to helping propel our 2020 candidates to victory by making a contribution to our Majority Fund?
Tonight at midnight is our monthly campaign finance reporting deadline and we’re coming up just short of our goal? We need to raise another $1,477 to meet our April fundraising goal. Can you chip in $50, $25, or just $10 to help us close the gap?

Friends,
A mere few months ago, Seattle Democrats put forth and passed a bill (SB 5395) that forces comprehensive sexual education on our students – starting in kindergarten.
Not only is this a grotesque curriculum for our children, but it is mandatory \- so our parents and teachers have little say in what materials their children are exposed to.
Simply put, this is an over-reaching power grab by politicians to have unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats, and special interest groups design the statewide sex education curriculum.
Yet, don’t be deterred, it’s now up to YOU if this atrocity passes. Referendum-90 is on the ballot this year – have your voice be heard and vote to REJECT R-90.
Show your opposition to R90 - get a sign today.
Now, close your eyes for a second and ask yourself this- what do you remember about Kindergarten? Learning your ABC's? An informative field trip? Or if you're like me, it was recess. The never-ending games of tag were my favorite.
But now, I worry, what will our innocent children remember?
When the Washington State Public Broadcast censored the material, I can't imagine it being anything ""G-rated.""
This is isn't acceptable.
Will you chip in, $25, $50, or even $75 to STOP Democrats from tarnishing, corrupting, and scarring our Kindergartners with their liberal teachings?
We need to get back to the days where parents and school boards can have a say in their child's education. We need to preserve our children’s innocence.

Our featured candidate this week is Rep. Chris Gildon. He currently serves the citizens of the 25th Legislative District in the State House. The 25th District has a tradition of great leadership in the Senate. Chris will continue and even enhance that tradition.
Chris spent his life in service to our country as a U.S. Army Officer. With multiple tours of duty in the Middle East, he negotiated peace with insurgents, managed huge budgets, and led thousands of soldiers and civilians.
In his first term in Olympia, Chris Gildon stood up to the pressures of Seattle's failed policies that are creeping into every community in the state. He fought to give voters the $30 car tabs they voted for, voted against tax increases on families and small businesses, and pushed back on the barrage of new regulations that make it tougher to create jobs.
Chris Gildon is in touch with the needs of his district and our state. He understands that we’re fighting an ideology of political extremism, and that we must win.
Chris lives in Puyallup with his wife of 26 years, Autumn. They have two children. After retiring from the military, he began a career as a commercial real estate broker.
Please visit Chris's campaign website at [[URL REDACTED]] and consider chipping in $5 to help propel him to victory.

One of the highlights of my job in the legislature is being your advocate at the budget negotiation table as the ranking Republican on the Senate Ways & Means Committee. Ways & Means is the budget writing committee and it’s where your Senate Republicans fight for fiscal responsibility and sensible taxation.
Just a few years ago, when Republicans were in the majority, I was the Chairman of Ways & Means committee. I’m proud to say that we passed a bi-partisan budget that made historic investments in our K-12 education system, improved our mental health system, and more without the $8 billion in tax increases that the Democrats wanted. With Democrats back in the majority, the same can’t be said anymore.
This year, with our state’s revenue situation being $1.5 billion ahead of projections, Democrats simply spread the excess between state agencies instead of providing you tangible tax relief. Instead, they passed a budget that increased spending by $1 billion dollars and passed a billion-dollar tax hike on businesses. And, while they didn’t make a serious effort for a capital gains income tax this year, you can bet it’s at the top of the agenda for next year.
If you’re ready to take back the majority in the State Senate and stop the Democrats’ reckless tax and spend policies, please make a contribution to the 2020 Majority Fund today!
Since the legislature adjourned a few weeks ago, our world has changed, and our priorities should change. There’s no telling what the short-term and long-term impact of the coronavirus pandemic will have on our economy but what we do know right now is that many of our neighbors are losing their jobs and their small businesses. This is no time for us to be raising taxes and spending beyond our means.
I hope Governor Inslee will seriously consider using his veto power to bring this budget back to reality. But we should have never been in this situation, we didn’t need more revenue and we should have been saving for a rainy day. If this outbreak has taught us anything, it’s that our economic picture can change drastically over the course of a week.
We must return some fiscal sanity to Olympia and make sure that, once again, Senate Republican can be the firewall against the Democrats taxes and spending spree. Please make a secure online contribution of $5 or more and help is get back to the majority.
Thanks for your support,
John Braun
State Senator

Josalun Hasz,info@srcc.org,Will you place a check on out-of-control Democrats?  ,"Washington Democrats cannot be trusted in leadership positions - the last few months prove their incompetence.
Friends –
The last few months in Washington serve as a lesson of what happens when Democrats control every state government branch – and our major cities. Democrats allowed lawlessness to take over Seattle. Their incompetence led to the loss of taxpayer dollars, amounting to hundreds of millions. And their negligent inaction threatens to derail our state budget for decades.
You cannot trust Democrats with leadership. We’re $4561 away from reaching our monthly fundraising goal. Helping us reach our goal means helping Republicans retake the state Senate. Will you help us place a check on out-of-control Democrats today?
Democrat extremists defunded the already overburdened Seattle Police Department, opening the door to more violence and rampant homelessness. We know what’s next – what happens in Seattle doesn’t stay in Seattle.
Democrats in the state legislature will pick-up the call to “defund the police.” That means Seattle-style law and order may be coming to a neighborhood near you. Put Republicans back in control of the state Senate with a contribution of $25, $50, or $100 – help us meet our monthly goal and block Democrat extremists.
Washington Democrats and their unaccountable bureaucrats lost hundreds of millions of dollars to preventable unemployment security fraud. Thousands of Washingtonians are left dealing with the repercussions, including waiting for needed benefits.
Democrats refuse to hold the gross incompetence accountable. Republicans will fight back for you. We’ve done it before, and we’ll do it again. Will you help us by ensuring we retake the state Senate?
For months, Republicans called for a special session to deal with the fallout of COVID-19 shutdowns. Jay Inslee and his fellow Democrats’ refusal to call a special session will impact our state budget for decades, placing an unprecedented strain on hardworking Washington families.
It’s time to put an end to the chaos caused by Washington Democrats in our state. Help Republicans retake the state Senate. You can count on us to place a must needed check on out-of-control Democrats. Donate today - with your help, we can ensure Republicans win their state Senate races and regain the majority.
Thanks,
Josalun

Can you give $3 or more to help us close the gap?

Friends –
This week I want to introduce you to Dave Lucas, our great Republican candidate running against Senate Majority Leader Andy Billig. It’s no small task to challenge the Democrats’ leader in the State Senate but if anyone is up for the task it’s Dave Lucas.
Dave is a retired Marine Corps Lieutenant Colonel who served in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Africa. In the Marines, Dave distinguished himself with his integrity, leadership, and commitment.
Since retiring, he has continued his service to his fellow veterans as a member of the Mann-Grandstaff VA Medical Center PFAC Committee and the Homeless Veteran Leadership Subcommittee of the Continuum of Care (CoC) Board.
Outside of his military service, Dave has also distinguished himself as a community leader through his service as chairman of his neighborhood council, a member of the Inland NW Boy Scout Council Executive Board, and as a Cub Scouts Den Leader.
Dave is committed to being a true voice for the citizens of Spokane as he continues his lifetime of service to his country and community. He is focused on finding solutions for the growing homelessness crisis and finding ways to streamline government so working families can keep more of their hard-earned money.
I hope you will take a moment and learn more about Dave Lucas by visiting his website at [[URL REDACTED]] and consider chipping in $5 to help him get his message out.

Senator Curtis King,info@srcc.org,FWD: One Week until Election Day  ,"Friends,
I wanted to see if you saw Johnny’s email the other day. Our state faces a lot of challenges in 2020. We cannot allow Democrats to maintain complete control in our state. They’ve proved time and time again, they cannot be trusted with the future of our communities.
We’re fighting back, working to re-gain a majority in the state Senate. But we need your support to help Republicans win next week.
We’re so close to meeting our Get out the Vote fundraising goal by the end of this week. With just $1782 away from the goal, will you help us fight for our communities today?
