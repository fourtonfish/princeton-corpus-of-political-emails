New Mexico House Dems Campaign Staff,info@nmhdcc.com,Your State Legislators Hard At Work,"#
Holding our majority in the state House is critical.
#
Alex,
In this challenging time, our work to move New Mexico forward continues.
In conversations with constituents, business owners, educators, and other state leaders, our House Democrats are working on solutions that center New Mexico’s public health needs and that support families and businesses that are struggling.
But right now, they’re facing unprecedented backlash from Trump and from politicians here in New Mexico who are putting politics ahead of responsible policymaking. In fact, just yesterday in a committee meeting, a GOP state senator suggested that New Mexico stop testing for COVID entirely!
This is why it’s so critical that we hold our Democratic majority in the state House. But we need your help. The legislature is our firewall against the Trump administration's regressive agenda, and our members will continue fighting for all New Mexicans.
If you can, please consider rushing a $10 contribution right now to help us hold our Democratic majority. Our people-powered campaign is exactly what Republicans are most afraid of, and with your support, we’ll usher in another blue wave in NM this November.

New Mexico House Dems,info@nmhdcc.com,Happy Independence Day,"#
Happy Independence Day, Alex,
Nearly 250 years ago, American colonists declared their independence from a foreign power and rose up to chart a new course toward freedom, liberty, and equality. A commitment to the ideals of freedom, cooperation, and progress were secured into our country’s founding, and every year since, Americans have continued to fight to draw those ideals forward. We have yet to realize the promise of our Nation, but the American way is to constantly strive to make the promise of America a reality for every American.
Today, we see that spirit all around us. The urgent fight for freedom, equity, and an end to racial oppression continues. So does the fight for fairness and dignity in health care, education, and economic opportunity. And millions of Americans are making personal sacrifices to protect the lives of their neighbors during this pandemic – despite the lack of leadership from our country’s highest office.
Americans continue these fights because they are necessary, they are urgent, and because we know that progress is possible in America.
On July 4th, we are reflecting on the ideals expressed by our founders, we are grateful for the Americans today, and throughout history, who fought for them, and we are holding everyone who is facing hardship in our thoughts.
It’s a difficult time for so many in our state. As COVID cases spike around our country and in neighboring states, we all have to do our part to follow the emergency health orders and refrain from large gatherings. Our health, safety, and the reopening of our state depend on each and every one of us doing our part.
We hope that however you are celebrating, that you and your loved ones are having a peaceful and happy Independence Day.
Sincerely,
The NM House Democrats

BREAKING: Trump’s $110k Ads in New Mexico
#
Alex, this is a development we can’t afford to ignore.
Trump is spending $110,000 on TV ads in New Mexico this week alone, and tens of thousands more online, to ramp up his efforts to win New Mexico in November.
That’s a huge sum of cash to spend in our small state with months still to go until Election Day. And with no signs of slowing down, it’s going to dramatically alter the political landscape in New Mexico.
We have to fight back to ensure that our candidates can still compete and get their message out. Will you rush a donation to our campaign today and help reach swing voters?
Because of the level of spending by the Trump campaign, our Democratic House candidates will have to work twice as hard to break through Trump’s toxicity. The margins in our key districts are very tight, and we can’t afford to get drowned out by a message of divisiveness.
Why is Trump spending so much money in New Mexico?
According to his own advisors, Trump needs to win states like New Mexico to get re-elected. His polls are slipping in the Midwest and now he’s doubling down on New Mexico, New Hampshire, and Nevada.
We have to be ready for months of partisan ads designed to divide us and rile up Trump’s base. We can keep New Mexico blue and elect new Democratic champions, but we need your help now more than ever.
Together, we’re going to send Trump and the GOP packing.

Alex,
On Memorial Day, New Mexicans remember the men and women who made the ultimate sacrifice and gave their lives for our country. This year, without large gatherings, many of our traditions will be different. Still, we are able to honor and remember those who have served.
Moreover, this Memorial Day, we also pay tribute to the frontline healthcare workers, first responders, and other essential workers who have tragically lost their lives to COVID-19. We owe them and their loved ones our deepest respect and gratitude.
New Mexicans have served throughout our nation’s history to protect the freedom and safety of all of us at home. Today we honor these sacrifices, and the ongoing service of our Gold Star families, for whom every single day is Memorial Day. We take time to recommit ourselves to making our communities and our country a beacon for the values for which they fought.
It is difficult, especially for our military families, to be unable to gather in person this year, but we know how important our caution is, and that continued social distancing is saving lives. We want our Gold Star families to know that they are still in our thoughts. We are wishing a peaceful Memorial Day to them, to our veterans, and to everyone joining in remembrance of these heroes.
Our ability to pursue our dreams, to speak openly, and to live peacefully in diverse communities are freedoms that our fellow New Mexicans have given their lives to protect. We are forever grateful for their service.

The New Mexico House Dems,info@nmhdcc.com,"Today, We Thank New Mexico Labor","#
Alex, Labor Day is a time to reflect on the hard work New Mexicans do every day to support our communities, and to remember the struggles that working people have faced in order to secure new rights for every one of us. Today we honor workers for the sacrifices they have made to help those who come after them.
Moreover, this Labor Day, we pay tribute to the frontline healthcare workers, first responders, grocery store employees, truck drivers, food service workers, builders, municipal employees, teachers, and every other essential worker who has kept New Mexico running through this tragic pandemic. We owe them and their loved ones our deepest respect and gratitude.
We know that Labor Day is more than just an occasion to share our thanks. It is a call to action.
Your New Mexico House Democrats will continue to fight for workers and their families. We believe that every worker should be treated with the dignity and respect they deserve. We know that New Mexico is stronger when our laws and policies support, rather than exploit, working families. That’s why we continue to fight for safer working conditions, a living wage, and earned sick leave. And it’s why we stand firmly against Republicans' continued attempts to undermine organized labor and make New Mexico a so-called “right to work” state--where, ironically, workers would have few or no rights at all.
Today, we hope you take the time to consider the contributions and sacrifices made by New Mexico’s workers and labor organizations, especially in these challenging times. It has never been more important for all of us to stand alongside our union brothers and sisters to defend workers’ rights. Your NM House Democrats are proud to be partners in that fight.

BREAKING: Trump’s $110k Ads in New Mexico
#
Alex,
A new report revealed that Donald Trump is spending $110,000 on TV ads in New Mexico just this week. With four months still to go until Election Day, Trump is showing that he’s ready to spend big from now until November to flip New Mexico red.
We have 17 weeks to go, and this type of spending is exactly what we were worried about. As Trump’s poll numbers slip nationally, he is being forced to double down on his strategy to flip new states, and New Mexico is at the top of his list.
Will you rush a donation today so we can fight back?
According to Politico, winning states like New Mexico has become a “matter of survival” for the Trump campaign. His mammoth spending in our state will have a huge impact on down-ballot races. Our state House candidates will have to fight twice as hard to break through his noise and combat his toxic messages.
Unfortunately, Trump’s investment in New Mexico can't be matched by Democrats nationally who remain focused on the traditional swing states. But we can’t let Trump swamp the efforts of our House Democratic candidates who are fighting for progress.
Can you chip in right now so we can fight back against Trump’s spending?
We’re ready to take the fight to Trump and the GOP. New Mexico’s House Democratic campaigns are focused on the issues that really matter. They’re fighting to protect health care, improve our schools, save our land and water, and launch a recovery from coronavirus that will protect New Mexicans and support our local economies.
We’re ready to keep New Mexico blue and elect new Democratic champions – but we can’t do it without you. Will you chip in today?
Thanks for being in this fight,
Rep. Liz Thomson, HD-24

Alex,
We have a huge goal to hit this month, and the truth is, we’re behind where we need to be. We need at least 132 donations by the end of the week to keep our campaigns on track, so we wanted to ask you specifically to help us get there.
If you were thinking about making your first contribution to the New Mexico House Democrats, there’s no better day than today to pitch in your first $5 to help protect and grow our Democratic majority in the state House.
Your contribution will go a long way in helping us hit our May goal so we can continue building the campaign infrastructure we need to ensure that Republicans don’t take back the House in November. The GOP won the majority with our current election maps in 2014 and, with the Trump campaign behind them this year, there’s no reason to think they can’t do it again.
Our May goal is critical to ensuring that we have the resources we need to run strong campaigns for each of our Democratic champions. We can’t afford to fall behind.
Pitch in $5 or any amount now.
Thanks for all that you do,
The NM House Dems

If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
$5 $10 $15
$35 $50 Other
Your contribution will go a long way in helping us hit our May goal so we can continue building the campaign infrastructure we need to ensure that Republicans don’t take back the House in November. The GOP won the majority with our current election maps in 2014 and, with the Trump campaign behind them this year, there’s no reason to think they can’t do it again.
Our May goal is critical to ensuring that we have the resources we need to run strong campaigns for each of our Democratic champions. We can’t afford to fall behind.
Pitch in $5 or any amount now.
Thanks for all that you do,
The NM House Dems

Holding our majority in the state House is critical.

Alex,
The primary election is behind us, a critical special session is over, and now we’re full steam ahead to the general election on November 3rd. It feels like so much has happened over the past three weeks. In this time of dramatic change and crisis, one thing is clear: we need bold, progressive champions in the New Mexico House.
The NM HDCC is working every day to build and support strong campaigns to win in November – despite a global pandemic and millions of dollars from the Trump campaign being poured into New Mexico – but we need your help.
Your contribution means we can expand our digital footprint to reach more voters while door knocking is still not possible. It means we can do more for these hard-working candidates who will fight for New Mexico’s families. Can you pitch in $5, $10, $25 or whatever you can right now?

We can’t forget, the GOP won the House majority with our current election maps in 2014. With the Trump campaign behind them this year, there’s no reason to think they can’t do it again.
Our June goal is critical to ensuring that we have the resources we need to run strong campaigns for each of our Democratic champions. We can’t afford to fall behind.
Pitch in $10 or any amount now.
