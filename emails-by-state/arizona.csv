# PROTECT ARIZONANS...
VOTE JIM O'CONNOR FOR ARIZONA CORPORATION COMMISSION
I refuse to cave to the dangerous agenda that Democrats on the Commission are proposing!
The Democrats running for Corporation Commission are proposing an agenda to INCREASE your utility rates & kill thousands of jobs!
This is unacceptable. Arizona has worked too hard over the years to create a diversified, robust, reliable energy infrastructure. I won't allow the Democrats' out-of-state political agenda to hurt the people of our state.
It should scare all of us that the Democrats running for the Commission want to INCREASE our utility rates and kill thousands of Arizona jobs by putting in place California-style energy policies—the very same policies that have led them to face annual rolling blackouts in the middle of summer.
I'm sorry, but policies that could lead to rolling blackouts during an Arizona summer aren't just bad energy policies... they put lives at risk. I make you this promise: I will always work to save you money, protect Arizona jobs, and keep Arizonans safe.

# VOTE JIM O'CONNOR FOR ARIZONA CORPORATION COMMISSION
Radical leftists are working overtime to take over the Arizona Corporation Commission, intent on turning Arizona into California.
Democrat dark money operatives are spending MILLIONS on disinformation to mislead Arizona voters about this race, not to mention attack me and your Republican team for Arizona Corporation Commission.
Why would they do this? Simple. Democrat special interest groups want Commissioners who will answer to them, not you.
To put it as plainly as I can, they know that I won't support their job killing political agenda.
I'm running to give everyday, hardworking Arizonans a voice at the Corporation Commission and to fight for you. I will work tirelessly to save you money in everything I do.
I make you this promise—YOU are my priority, nothing else.

Friend
With our mid-month goal coming up next week, and Election Day right around the corner, we’ve been running the numbers on where we need to be in order to compete with Silicon Valley, Hollywood, Wall Street, and all the other globalist elites who are funding the Democrats.
All we need is 100 Patriots to step up today with a donation of as little as $4, to make sure we’re on track for a BIG victory on November 3rd!
We know that our grassroots support here in Arizona is more powerful than what these out-of-state millionaires can muster. Let’s show the world that we won’t let them buy our votes and defeat their far-left agenda on Election Day!
RUSH IN YOUR $4 DONATION!
RUSH IN ANY AMOUNT
Join the fight, and protect our state and country from extreme, far-left policies, by pitching in to help Republicans win Arizona!
We can deliver a victory for President Trump, and all of our down-ballot GOP candidates, but only if we stand together against the far-left!

"Patriot,
Did you watch last week's Corporation Commission debate? Our amazing slate of Republican candidates — Lea Marquez Peterson, Eric Sloan, and Jim O'Connor — faced off against their far-left Democrat opponents to talk about the real issues that matter to Arizonans.
Click to watch some of the top moments from the debate!
Top 7 Moments From the Arizona Corporation Commission Debate
We saw the three Democrats on stage propose their extreme, California-style energy policies that will raise energy costs, increase taxes, and create new government mandates that will negatively impact millions of Arizona ratepayers.
Arizona cannot afford more far-left Democrats on the Corporation Commission — especially not ones bought and paid for by leftist California billionaire Tom Steyer!
Help us protect Arizona's energy future this election, and #VoteTheSlate to send Lea, Eric, and Jim to the Arizona Corporation Commission.

Tonight, in Utah, Vice President Mike Pence will go head-to-head with far-left Democrat Kamala Harris in the first and only VP Debate.
Pence has admirably served our nation during his tenure as VP, standing up for our religious freedom and supporting our military families and veterans.
Because of his track record of putting America First, we want to show our loyal support for Vice President Pence in his debate against our country’s most liberal Senator.
Will you sign the Good Luck Card that we’ll be sending to Pence and his team? We want him to know that Republicans here in Arizona will be backing him BIGLY in tonight’s debate!
SIGN THE CARD
Pence’s debate opponent is as extreme and radical as they come, supporting the trillion-dollar Green New Deal, pushing for free healthcare for illegal immigrants, and even comparing ICE to the KKK!
We know that her extremism will be no match for our Vice President’s responsible, conservative leadership. To wish him good luck in tonight’s debate, sign Mike Pence’s Good Luck Card!
CLICK HERE TO SIGN THE CARD
Thank you for helping us show our support for VP Pence in tonight’s debate!
We’re With Mike,
Arizona Republicans
P.S. In order to make sure our great Vice President isn’t replaced by the far-left Kamala Harris, we need to do everything we can to support the Trump/Pence ticket here in the battleground state of Arizona! Will you help us do that by pitching in as little as $5 today?

With President Trump set to make another visit to the Grand Canyon State, it’s worth reminding our team just how important Arizona will be to the President’s re-election in 2020.
Out-of-state millionaires have been pouring in donations to the Democrats, and the corrupt mainstream media and Big Tech oligarchs have also been working with them hand-in-hand.
As a result, this fight for our conservative, American values is looking neck-and-neck with Arizona likely to decide the winner of the entire race!
When the President arrives, we need to show him that he has our support and that Arizona is ready to fight for our future.
To give President Trump and his team confidence that we won’t stand by and let our state be taken over by the Democrats’ extreme agenda, add your name to Trump’s Top Arizona Supporters List by making a donation right now!

Early voting has started here in Arizona, meaning our mission to protect our state and country from an Open Borders, globalist agenda is now underway.
And while it may feel like everyday Americans like us don’t have the power to fight for our values the way that the powerful, liberal elites at Big Tech can, we have three simple tasks you can do TODAY that are GUARANTEED to make a huge difference for our conservative values in this last stretch of election season.
#1) Vote early TODAY to make your voice heard!
#2) Text 5 FRIENDS and ask them if they’ve also voted early. The more people we have on our team fighting for strong borders and economic recovery, the more likely we are to be successful.
#3) Donate as little as $5 to groups like us here at AZGOP so that we can have a RED Arizona!
While Silicon Valley and Hollywood elites can Censor and Cancel anyone they disagree with, or throw in millions of dollars towards elections in states they don’t even live in, this is no reason to get discouraged.
In fact, it’s even more of a reason to do everything we can to fight back!
If our entire team can follow our 3 easy steps TODAY, it will go a long way towards making sure Arizona stays RED on November 3rd.
KEEP ARIZONA RED!
We’re glad to have you in the fight!
For Arizona,
Political @ AZGOP

President Trump’s record of looking out for everyday Americans is second to none.
He and his administration have worked to improve our border security and keep our great country safe from drug trafficking and MS-13 gangs. They have also worked to protect our religious liberty and constitutional rights. And, before the China coronavirus plagued the globe, Trump had brought back jobs and gotten our economy running at record levels.
But right now, our great President’s re-election is in jeopardy thanks to a few far-left billionaires, the Fake News Media, and censorship from Big Tech.
Trump needs our help here in Arizona if we want Four More Years of strong, conservative leadership. Can we count on you to help our President today?
Arizona could be THE battleground state that decides the 2020 Election, so we can’t let our state be the reason Joe Biden and Kamala Harris undo all of President Trump’s hard work.
Help our efforts in this last stretch so that Arizona stays RED, and President Trump gets Four More Years to Keep America Great.

I know it’s Sunday, and we’ve already reached out to you a lot this week, so I’ll keep my message brief.
The 2020 Election is Tuesday. The future of our country, our way of life as we know it, our safety and security, and the economic prosperity of future generations will all be on the line in just two short days.
And although we’re so close to the finish line, our work isn’t over yet. This crucial election is still looking like it could be anyone’s race, and since there’s still time left to reach out to Arizona voters, we need your support for one last push in these two days.
Help Us Finish Strong! [[URL REDACTED]]
With our battleground state playing such a big role in deciding this entire election, everything that we do here in Arizona will go a long way towards stopping the Open Borders, endless wars, and lawlessness that will be enacted under Joe Biden and Mark Kelly.
And while it may sound far-fetched, your urgent support before Tuesday is going to be crucial for the future of our country!
With the stakes this high, all I’m asking for today is for you to take two minutes of your time to Donate $2 in this mission to Keep Arizona Red. Let’s finish our hard work so that we can be successful on Tuesday and stand up for Arizona and America!

"As payback for President Trump’s triumphant 2016 victory over the establishment elites...
[[URL REDACTED]]
Friend
As payback for President Trump’s triumphant 2016 victory over the establishment elites, the globalist ruling class seems to be pulling out all the stops this year to crush the voices of everyday conservatives and get back to work destroying our country.
We’ve seen this in the way that billionaires (like failed-candidate Mike Bloomberg) have been pouring in money to places like Arizona, hoping to buy our votes and dupe us with liberal propaganda.
These elites have also been working with their cronies in Silicon Valley to silence our voices and CENSOR anything negative about their liberal agenda and the corrupt candidates who trumpet it. These Big Tech platforms have selectively censored a number of conservatives -- including myself and the President of the United States!
STOP THE DEMOCRAT ELITES
It’s clear that these elites are doing everything they can to try to push their destructive, anti-American platform this year. Because of that, we need to do everything WE can in order to counter them and deliver a victory for Arizonans!
This starts with giving our Republican candidates the resources they need to WIN in this final stretch. We set a goal here at the Republican Party of Arizona to do just that, but we still are $17K SHORT OF OUR GOAL!
If you pitch in now to help us make up this ground, our grassroots support can go the extra mile and Republicans like President Trump can once again be successful in putting America First!

I just met President Trump and gave him the Welcome Card that so many of you took the time to sign.
And while this was an incredible gesture to show for a fighter who has already done so much for our Borders, our Economy, and our Military, there’s still work to be done before the President leaves the Grand Canyon State to continue his Keep America Great campaign tour.
I’m asking for just 65 MORE PATRIOTS to join Trump’s Top Arizona Supporters List by making a donation today! We NEED to show the President that our enthusiasm is legit here in Arizona, and the only way to do that is by displaying the strength of our grassroots team.
Pitch in RIGHT NOW to show your support for our President who has done more in 47 Months than corrupt, establishment Biden has done in 47 YEARS as a D.C. Swamp politician!
Pitch in Here: [[URL REDACTED]]
If we can show President Trump that Arizona is ready for this fight before he leaves town, we can give him and his team confidence in this final stretch of the election season.
Only 65 more patriots are needed for the Supporters List! Rush in a donation of any amount to add your name!
Add Your Name to the List!

It’s crunchtime for our final monthly goal here at the Republican Party of Arizona.
Patriots have been stepping up to protect our borders and our communities this week, and now JUST $9K stands between us and a successful fundraising campaign for our Republican candidates.
This is one of our last chances to make sure our conservative values are victorious next week! Falling short would mean giving the far-left free rein to pack our Supreme Court with Late-Term Abortion liberals, and giving Beijing Biden another chance to get rich sending our jobs overseas to Communist China.
Our country can’t afford another Swamp Democrat administration. Help us reach our last goal so that President Trump and his America First allies can revive our economy AGAIN and continue keeping promises for our country!
PITCH IN TO REACH THE GOAL
The entire 2020 Election could come down to what happens in Arizona, so we need to make sure our battleground state is ready for this fight.
We need just $9K MORE from our grassroots conservative team to give our Republican candidates the resources they need to take on the Democrat donor network.
Will you pitch in to make up this ground before tomorrow night? Conservatives across the country are counting on us to stop the left-wing takeover of America!

"Become a Poll Butler!
4 DAYS TO GO
Fellow Patriot!
Due to the limited number of polling locations in Maricopa County, and local health guidelines requiring social distancing of six feet or more, we are expecting polling lines to be very long on Election Day.
The question then, is how do we keep voters standing in line from becoming discouraged and leaving?
We provide them with food and water.
To support voters in this historic election, we're hiring ""Polling Butlers"" to pass out water and granola bars at key polling locations.
Polling Butlers will work in pairs for 4.5 hour shifts and receive $13 an hour. There are two shifts available: 10:00 AM - 2:30 PM and 2:30 PM - 7:00 PM. Polling Butlers will also be required to wear ID badges and masks.
We will have several training sessions on Sunday evening, November 1, to go over specific information and hand out badges.
Sign up for a shift using this form!
There are two slots per shift we need to fill at each location. Once you have signed up, you will receive a confirmation call with additional training information.
Thank you for helping support our Arizona voters!
Onward To Victory,
Arizona Republicans

There are a lot of groups that would like nothing more than to see Mark Kelly flip the great state of Arizona blue this year.
One of the most concerning, though, is actually a competitor to the very country Kelly wants to represent!
The Chinese Communist Party is in the Democrat nominee’s corner this year, since he personally sought their investment in his business prior to his Senate run.
That’s right, the same regime that disregards freedom and human rights - and tried to OBSTRUCT our country’s COVID-19 research - backed Mark Kelly in the past, and we can bet is still supporting him to this day.
DON’T LET KELLY PUT CHINA FIRST!
It’s clear why China would love to have this “moderate” Democrat as our next Arizona Senator.
His policies would ship all of our American jobs to them, and make the United States weaker and more chaotic with unchecked illegal immigration, the destruction of the nuclear family, and less support for our law enforcement.
A Mark Kelly win is a win for China, not our American values.
Pitch in now to stop this America Last Democrat from ruining our country before it’s too late!

If the Supreme Court has an empty seat on Election Day, we're asking for trouble
Chairwoman Kelli Ward | September 29, 2020
With her passing, it’s good that our nation paused to pay respects to Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s memory, the second female Supreme Court justice to ever serve on the high court. It is also important that we acknowledge her contributions to securing rights for women in her early years, something that I, as a female health care professional, can appreciate and admire.
But these are tumultuous times and the business of our country must move forward. America needs a new Supreme Court justice before Election Day.

Arizona’s economy does not need a tax increase
Chairwoman Kelli Ward | October 13, 2020
Arizona’s economy is just starting to come back from a devastating spring and summer due to the pandemic shutdowns. The last thing we should do is pump the breaks on the recovery by putting in place the largest permanent tax increase in state history.
The proposed $1 billion-per-year tax increase is marketed as going to K-12 education, but how exactly will it be spent? Over the last few years, we have invested a lot in education in Arizona. In three years, enough money was designated to give teachers a 20% raise, and we currently allocate more than 50% of our state’s $11 billion general fund to support K-12 education. That percentage runs even higher if you add in funding for colleges and universities.

Friend,
With just 15 days to go, here's an important question: Are you excited for FOUR MORE YEARS of America First led by President Donald Trump?
How could you not be?
We're encountering voters energized at levels we haven't seen since 2016. With voter interest at record highs, we launched a MAJOR Peer-to-Peer (P2P) program to translate this presidential-year enthusiasm into down-ballot performance that will lift Republicans at all levels to big wins!
We've doubled down on our latest texting campaign with a strong six-figure commitment to ensure that we put our message directly into the pockets of voters.
With over a half-million key voters on our list, we're mobilizing the Silent Majority to elect Republicans across Arizona with a customized electronic golden ticket for each recipient.
Arizona is a key state in the 2020 election and we're not resting for one minute between today and Election Day!

After all of our progress this week, we’re STILL SHORT with just hours to go until the deadline of our FINAL monthly fundraising goal!
If we don’t reach our final goal of election season, the consequences could be dire for our state and country. Our Republican candidates won’t have the resources they need to defeat the far-left, and we can say goodbye to border security, law enforcement, and our way of life as we know it!

RUSH IN ANY AMOUNT HERE
DONATE THE FULL $5,567 HERE
DONATE HALF = $2,783.50
Republican candidates up and down the ballot here in the Grand Canyon State are ready to go to work for you.
President Trump, Senator McSally, and a whole host of down-ballot conservatives want to secure our country’s borders, fight for working families, and protect our Second Amendment rights.

Friend,
Early voting is now underway, and we need your help to spread the word to your friends, neighbors, and social circles to VOTE NO on PROP 208!
Proposition 208 is the wrong plan at the wrong time. It will have far-reaching negative impacts on our economy and cause further damage to small businesses as they continue to battle back from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Passing the largest tax increase in Arizona history at our most vulnerable time is the wrong strategy!
Even worse, Proposition 208 is being bankrolled by out-of-state special interest groups that are attempting to raise our taxes to the top 10 highest in the country, while ignoring the devastating impacts that will have on our economy. More details here!
Here are just a few of the many reasons Proposition 208 is the wrong plan:
* Education funding advocates have long asked for a sustainable revenue source. Prop 208 is not it. Having a strong economy is key to increased funding for education. The booming Republican-led economy is why teachers started this year with a 20% pay raise and why, since 2015, we have been able to invest billions of new sustainable funding for K-12 education. Prop 208 uses the most volatile portion of our tax code and it will fall far short of helping teachers the way proponents claim. There are no caps on administrative spending and no guarantees for teacher pay. Prop 208 will be a shock to the economy that will result in lower revenues.
* Voters want transparency and accountability in what their taxpayer dollars are funding. Currently only 55 cents out of every dollar makes it into the classroom and Prop 208 does nothing to change this. Prop 208 has no mandate for accountable use of money and no performance metrics. We need to make sure that students and teachers benefit from new education spending and that those dollars don't just go to pay administrative overhead.
* More than 50% of those who will be negatively impacted by Prop 208 will be small business owners. Small businesses are the backbone of our economy and it is critical that they thrive. Prop 208 would add an incredible burden on our job creators at this most vulnerable time.
* Prop 208 will have profound impacts on Arizona’s economy, reducing competitiveness and our ability to attract new business. It will result in slower job growth and reduced wages. If passed, the combined economic impact over the first ten years alone would result in 124,000 jobs lost and a reduction of $2.4 billion in state and local tax revenue.
Arizonans deserve better than Prop 208. Our students, our teachers, and our state's small business community across all industries need your help.
HOW CAN YOU HELP?
1. Follow @NOProp208AZ on Twitter and Facebook and share updates with your followers using the hashtag #NOon208.
2. Share critical updates with your networks and encourage them to do the same by visiting [[URL REDACTED]]
3. Join the coalition in opposing Prop 208 by signing up here!
With your help, and your vote, we can defeat this devastating Proposition and preserve our strong Republican track record of delivering for Arizonans where they need it most.

Friend,
Across the state, Arizonans are now voting, and that's why it's urgent that you tell your friends and family to Vote NO on Proposition 207!
Prop 207 is 17 pages of sweeping new laws that are neither smart nor safe for Arizona. The initiative is written and funded by marijuana industry insiders looking to cash in on a new commercial industry in Arizona. The consequences will harm our kids, our safety, and our economy.
So, what will Prop 207 do?
Cause harm to Arizona children.
* More kids will use it — harming developing brains
* Won't stop daycare workers from using marijuana before coming to work
* Marijuana-laced candies, cookies, and vape pens will be marketed to teens on TV and social media
Put you in more danger on the road.
* Lead to an increase in impaired drivers and traffic deaths — 69% of Colorado users admit to driving stoned
* Removes current marijuana DUI standards
* No roadside test exists to gauge marijuana impairment
Negatively impact Arizona's economy.
* Weakens employers’ right to maintain a drug-free workplace
* Creates a monopoly for marijuana industry insiders
* Caps the marijuana tax at 16% regardless of the cost to Arizona — CO spends $4.50 in marijuana costs for every $1 of revenue
* Would allocate no money for K-12 education
Key takeaway: Laws passed by ballot propositions in Arizona are nearly impossible for lawmakers to change or update, leaving Arizonans stuck with the consequences.
A large coalition is opposing Prop 207, including Congressman Andy Biggs, Congresswoman Debbie Lesko, Congressman Paul Gosar, Senate President Karen Fann, House Speaker Rusty Bowers, Arizona Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Greater Phoenix Chamber, Southern Arizona Leadership, Center for Arizona Policy Action, Arizona Free Enterprise Club, Arizona Sheriffs Association, Arizona State Troopers Association, Arizona Medical Association, and more! Click here to read the full list of parties opposing Prop 207.
Even if you support the idea of marijuana legalization or decriminalization, this is the wrong way to do it. Arizona can — and must — do better.
HOW CAN YOU HELP?
1. Follow @No207AZ on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram
2. Get informed by visiting [[URL REDACTED]] and share updates on social media using the hashtag #No207
3. Join the fight by becoming a #No207 Ambassador today
4. Educate others and request a speaker for your group
5. Vote No on Prop 207!
Republican leadership has made Arizona one of the best states in the country to raise a family, run a business, work for a living, and, ultimately, retire. Defeating Prop 207 will go a long ways toward keeping it that way.

20 DAYS TO GO
Fellow Republican,
Early voting is underway in Arizona and it's critical that Republicans show up in massive numbers so that we can stave off the Left's attack on our state and country! We must vote and get everyone we know to vote for President Trump, Senator McSally, and all our Republican candidates down the ballot!
Even if you do not intend to vote by mail, it is critical that you vote early! If you do have a mail-in ballot, but would prefer to vote in-person, take your completed ballot to an early voting center. To search for an early voting center near you, visit [[URL REDACTED]] today! Enter your name, email, and zip code, and you will be directed to a Voter Portal where you can view a list of locations operating in your area. It's that simple!
If you live and vote in Maricopa County, we have also compiled a list of all locations that are currently open and serving voters in your county. This list of locations will expand as we draw closer to Election Day.
Don't forget to review, fill out, and turn in your early ballot as soon as possible, so that Republicans can send a loud and clear message on Election Night that Arizona will stay RED in 2020!

"3 DAYS TO GO
Fellow Patriot,
During this election cycle, we have fielded digital and static billboards across Arizona to showcase our ""Vote Republican"" messages ahead of the November 3rd election. Check a few of them out!
This is the most important election of our lifetime, and it's critical that we educate voters about the differences between the two parties, our candidates, and our platforms. If you're driving around the great state of Arizona and spot one, be sure to have someone in the vehicle take a photo, post it on your personal social media account, and tag us on Facebook (@ArizonaGOP), Twitter (@azgop), or Instagram (@azgop)!
We can't risk losing even one vote in this election. Remind your friends, relatives, and neighbors to get out and vote for Freedom, Liberty, the Constitution, Law and Order, and TRUTH!
Win 2020,
Arizona Republicans
Long lines are expected on Election Day.
Don't take chances with your vote and lose your voice.

The Republican Party of Arizona has been working hard to reach as many patriots as we can in order to elect responsible, conservative candidates and stop the increasingly radical Democrats.
To date, we have had nearly 5,000 different donors pitch in to help us in this effort.
If you make your first donation today and help us support Law and Order Republicans, you could be donor No. 5,000 that helps us win in November!
DONATE NOW TO BE DONOR #5000!
Our approach here in Arizona has been different than that of the socialist Democrats. They have been courting the support of billionaire donors from New York and California, while we have been relying on grassroots contributions from everyday Americans.
If you pitch in now, you could be the 5,000th individual donor that helps us win on Election Day!
Help us show the Democrats that the support of our hard-working base is stronger than the dark money donations they’ve received from coastal elites!
BE DONOR #5000: CHIP IN $5
BE DONOR #5000: CHIP IN $20.20
BE DONOR #5000: CHIP IN $50
BE DONOR #5000: CHIP IN ANY AMOUNT
Thank you for your grassroots support!

With the 2020 Election just THREE WEEKS AWAY, our campaign for a Red Arizona is finalizing its budget tomorrow so that we can maximize our campaign operations in this final stretch.
But in order to make sure we have the funds we need in these final weeks, the support of our grassroots team is going to be more important than ever. This is the most crucial moment in our mission so far, and if we don’t get the resources we need, Joe Biden, Mark Kelly, and the Democrat Machine will use Arizona to get their lawless, open borders agenda passed nationwide.
STOP THE FAR-LEFT BEFORE IT’S TOO LATE
We need our team of patriots to chip in for this final stretch to save the Grand Canyon State! Democrats are on the cusp of making our state a hotbed for increased illegal immigration, anarchy and crime, and infringement upon our Second Amendment!
And if they get their way, they could use our battleground state to propel their extreme agenda to the White House and Senate as well!

Friend
With November 3rd right around the corner, we are getting to the final stretch of what could be the most important election season in our state’s history.
My team and I here at the Republican Party of Arizona will be working around the clock to make sure we do everything we can to Keep Arizona Great in these final weeks.
But without your crucial support in helping us reach our critical fundraising goals, we won’t have the resources we need to see our mission through!
“Marx” Kelly and “Beijing” Biden could win here, and the interests of China and Big Tech could prevail over the interests of everyday Americans.
Pitch in to Put America First: [[URL REDACTED]]
Your support has been crucial in helping us compete with the coastal-elite, liberal donors up to this point. You’ve been with us through a global pandemic, which Democrats tried to politicize at every turn, revealing their hypocrisy in the process. You stuck with us while our counterparts on the Left began to endorse and encourage political violence and domestic terrorism.
But now, if we don’t get your continued support, all of our hard work could be washed out by these out-of-state, far-left elites!
The only way we can use this last stretch to propel our conservative values to victory is by making sure we have the resources on hand to do so.
Pitch in so that we can finish this election season strong, defeat the radical Left, and KEEP ARIZONA RED!

"Joe Biden & Bernie Sanders want to pass a massive tax increase on Arizonans & small businesses!
[[URL REDACTED]]
Dear Arizona Republican,
In case you missed the news, Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden are trying to pass massive tax increases on the backs of hard-working Arizonans. With only 11 days left until Election Day, we need your help and your voice to stop them! Spread the word, VOTE YES for President Donald Trump and NO on Proposition 208!
Under the Biden/Bernie plan you could be paying up to 57% total income tax rate! This is too extreme and totally wrong for Arizona. We should be supporting Arizona workers and small businesses and helping our economy recover, not passing massive tax increases that will kill jobs and destroy our economy.
The Biden plan is so extreme, even rapper 50 Cent (Curtis James Jackson) came out this week, saying, “I don’t want to be 20 Cent.”
Watch the video below of President Trump in Tucson this week defending Arizonans from the extreme Left:
Vote Yes Trump-Pence, No on 208
Share the news with your friends and family: VOTE YES FOR TRUMP and NO ON PROP 208!

We’ve known for a while now that “Woke” elites in Silicon Valley have been trying to boost their Democrat allies. But after months of this tacit support for Democrats, and the censorship of prominent conservative accounts including that of the PRESIDENT, these Big Tech giants are now actively censoring news stories that are negative towards Joe Biden!
FIGHT BACK AGAINST BIG TECH CENSORSHIP
The New York Post broke a BOMBSHELL story that proves Joe Biden LIED about his involvement in, and knowledge of, his son Hunter’s shady business dealings in Ukraine. Yet the “Thought Police” over at Twitter and Facebook quickly moved to BLOCK the story, and SUSPEND users who shared it!
Click below to read the forbidden story that Big Tech doesn’t want you to see.
CLICK HERE TO READ THE ARTICLE
It’s obvious that Big Tech has been in the pocket of the Democrat Party, especially with the way they’ve been throwing their millions behind liberal candidates even right here in the state of Arizona.
That’s why it’s more important than ever that we re-elect President Trump and other Republicans who will fight alongside him to make sure far-left billionaires don’t infringe on our Constitutional rights!
If we don’t fight back now, our Freedom of Speech will be in serious jeopardy. Democrats and their far-left, Silicon Valley cronies will do whatever it takes to SILENCE US and push their extreme, socialist agenda down our throats.
We can’t let them crush our voices and wield their power to stop our grassroots conservative movement. Donate now to support President Trump in Arizona, and help Republicans stand for FREEDOM for generations to come!

I just finished meeting with President Trump in Prescott, and I gave him the Welcome Card that many of you took the time to sign. Thank you!
President Trump knows that our state has some of the most passionate patriots in the country, and that we are with him every step of the way as he looks to take on a radical, left-wing agenda that would see Late-Term Abortion and Open Borders defile our country.
DEFEAT THE DEMOCRAT AGENDA
But because the Democrats are hauling in millions from out of state to boost their efforts here in Arizona, the President also knows that we urgently need to keep up our support in this final stretch.
His team ran the numbers, and it looks like if 137 donors take the time to make a contribution of at least $10 today, President Trump will be on a better track for a re-election victory just over two weeks from now!
Will you be one of the 137 Donors the President needs?
DONATE NOW TO BE ONE OF THE 137
I let President Trump know that Arizonans aren’t the type to stand by while our state and country are ruined by corrupt, far-left politicians.
Let’s show our President that we’ll answer the call and help his re-election campaign in order to give him FOUR MORE YEARS to fight for us!
TRUMP NEEDS 137 DONORS! RUSH IN ANY AMOUNT

Election season is coming to a close, with just TWO WEEKS to go until everyone who hasn’t already voted early makes their way to the polls to decide the future of our country.
But with election season winding down, our work needs to be only ramping up!
There are still thousands of undecided voters who don’t know that the Democrat Party plans to “pack” the Supreme Court, invite in millions of illegal immigrants with the promise of free healthcare, and wreck the rebuilding of our economy with Socialist tax hikes.
We are trying to spread the word here at AZGOP through efforts like texting campaigns, putting out ads, mailing golden tickets, distributing flyers, and coordinating volunteers.
Yet all of these key campaign operations require continued resources. With just TWO WEEKS until Election Day, can we count on you to pitch in and help us fund our efforts so that we can grow our team?
DONATE $2 FOR A WIN IN 2 WEEKS
DONATE $20.20 FOR A WIN IN 2 WEEKS

DONATE WHAT YOU CAN
When the Democrat Party wants a boost in fundraising, they can always ask for a check from some Woke Hollywood millionaire that’s never done a day of hard work in their life.
But our contributions come from everyday Americans like you - who just want a more prosperous future for yourself and your family.
If you’re able to today, can we count on another contribution to help our efforts with just two weeks until November 3rd?

After facing a litany of attacks from bitter Democrats over her faith and family, Judge Amy Coney Barrett is set to have her SCOTUS confirmation vote TOMORROW!
After tomorrow’s proceedings, we could have a highly-qualified justice who will dutifully uphold the Constitution - including the right to life and the Second Amendment - for generations to come.
HELP AZGOP STAND UP FOR OUR RIGHTS
This would be an incredible victory for our conservative values, and a testament to President Trump’s great leadership.
But although we’re on the cusp of a great victory for our highest court, we can’t rest on our laurels now.
If Democrats come to power this year, and use Arizona to do so, all of this progress on the Supreme Court would be undone at the hands of the rule-breaking radical Left.
They would use their power to pack our nation’s highest court, and completely overhaul our system of government by haphazardly adding activist liberal judges who will attempt to legislate from the bench!
Only your grassroots support can stop this from happening. Make sure our state breaks for Republicans like President Trump and Martha McSally to ensure our conservative values prevail for future generations!

[[URL REDACTED]]
Friend
So much is on the line here in Arizona -- and Senator Martha McSally’s race is right at the top of the list.
If Senator McSally isn’t successful on Election Day, not only will Arizona Republicans lose the voice of a principled conservative in the Senate, but she will be replaced by someone who routinely lies about his extreme, far-left views. Worst of all, our once-in-a-lifetime chance for a conservative Supreme Court could also slip out of reach!
Tonight, Senator McSally will square off against the Democrat Machine’s handpicked, anti-Second Amendment candidate. Can we count on you to help us build on McSally’s debate performance tonight and get her elected here in Arizona?
McSally’s opponent, Mark Kelly, will be a lackey for Chuck Schumer if elected to the Senate. He’s trying to be coy by not saying if he would vote for Schumer as Senate Majority Leader, but we know he won’t go against his party bosses.
Despite the Democrat allies in the media attempting to portray him as a “moderate” and “independent,” Kelly will work to send our taxes to the moon, strip us of our Second Amendment rights, and be weak on crime and border security.
We know our great Senator will work to call out these reckless policies on the debate stage tonight. But, unless we help her build on her performance, the Democrat network of California and New York millionaire donors could drown out Senator McSally’s message!

"After facing a litany of attacks from bitter Democrats over her faith and family, Judge Amy Coney Barrett is set to have her SCOTUS confirmation vote TODAY!
[[URL REDACTED]]
Friend
It’s official - after being confirmed by the Senate today, the highly-qualified Amy Coney Barrett is set to become the next Justice to serve on the United States Supreme Court!
The Democrats’ attempts to block and smear ACB were unsuccessful, and our country now has a brilliant legal mind set to serve on the highest court in the land for generations to come.
HELP BUILD ON THIS CONSERVATIVE VICTORY
We can file this victory as yet another instance of President Trump keeping his promises to the American people. Our conservative values are often pitted against an immoral, left-wing agenda in the courts, and our great President has worked to fill multiple court vacancies with strong, conservative candidates.
When our values are often going up against powerful forces like Big Tech oligarchs, globalist billionaires, and the DC Establishment, it takes fighters like President Trump to make sure we prevail at the end of the day.
But this year, our President is in a tough re-election fight, and Arizona is shaping up to be the battleground state that will decide our country’s future on November 3rd!
To give President Trump the boost he needs here in the Grand Canyon State, and to build on the victory of ACB’s confirmation today, can we count on you to pitch in to Keep Arizona Red on Election Day?

You have your golden ticket, right?
As we approach Election Day, you need to be prepared.
Too often, voters are excited about a candidate or two, but they don't know the full Arizona Republican slate. That's where we can help!
﻿Here in Arizona, every one of our offices—from the Corporation Commission down to municipal boards—is under attack by radical leftists who want to turn Phoenix into Portland, and Arizona into California.
Golden tickets are your key to knowing which candidates believe in putting the American Dream, your personal freedom, and our amazing Constitution ahead of extreme social engineering schemes.
We mailed golden tickets out to voters earlier this year, and pushed them to hundreds of thousands of cell phones multiple times, but we know that sometimes things get misplaced or ignored—so we're making sure you have access to this digital copy as well.

With such extreme, far-left rhetoric and policies now becoming mainstream in the Democrat Party, it’s crucial that we defeat them everywhere we can this year.
In order to stop multi-trillion dollar spending increases, huge tax hikes, open borders, the revocation of our Second Amendment rights, and defunding the police, we need to make sure these radical Democrats don’t come to power in any branch of government if we want to truly Keep America Great.
At the Republican Party of Arizona, we are working to support Republican candidates up and down the ballot, from the President of the United States all the way down to the local leaders in our state. We know that doing so is the only way to stop far-left policies from completely overhauling our way of life in the worst way!
But in order to see this mission through, we need our grassroots conservative team to help us obtain the resources we need to support our GOP candidates in all of their races.
If we can get the continued support of patriots like you, we can be successful in our mission to protect the White House, the Senate, the House of Representatives, and our State Legislature from the radical Left!

As extreme, far-left Democrats like Nancy Pelosi look to sabotage the re-election of President Trump and take control of our country, they are turning their sights to ARIZONA to help them accomplish their goals.
Pelosi and her allies believe they can drown out the voices of hard-working conservatives here in Arizona by pouring in money from out-of-state liberal groups. We need to show her that we won’t let this happen, or else their socialist agenda could prevail here in November!
HELP US STOP PELOSI TODAY
Make no mistake, if the Democrats are successful here in Arizona, they will radically reshape our country to fit their socialist vision. Our home state will likely be the battleground of the entire 2020 election! We need to win here if we want to help the entire country defeat Pelosi and her far-left agenda.

"2 WEEKS LEFT
TO SAVE ARIZONA
Friend,
Did you see Dr. Ward on Fox & Friends First this morning? Being an early morning show, we wanted to make sure and send you the clip just in case you missed it when it aired live.
In the interview, Chairwoman Ward talked about the President's Prescott and Tucson rallies yesterday and the great work he's doing for the American people.
In addition, Chairwoman Ward penned an exclusive op-ed on Big Tech censorship that ran in The American Spectator over the weekend. Check it out below!
Twitter and Facebook’s Selective Censorship Is an Attack on Free Speech
Chairwoman Kelli Ward | October 16, 2020
A few weeks ago, the New York Times published a story on President Trump’s tax returns, which was shared far and wide across the internet. In fact, Twitter and Facebook helped promote the story on their platforms, despite pushback from the White House and Trump businesses.
With that in mind, consider a different story that broke a few days ago: The New York Post, America’s oldest newspaper, published a bombshell report that revealed newly uncovered emails between Hunter Biden, Joe Biden’s son, and a Ukrainian business associate. In one email, the Ukrainian businessman thanks Hunter for introducing him to his father, then vice president of the United States and point person for U.S. policy in Ukraine.

Did you catch Tuesday's Arizona Senate debate between Republican U.S. Senator Martha McSally and her far-left Democrat challenger Mark Kelly?
Click to watch a few of the key moments from the debate!
Top 7 Moments From the Arizona Senate Debate
After months of hiding in his basement, Arizonans finally got a chance to see Democrat Mark Kelly, and hear about his disturbing ties to the Communist Party of China, as well as, his extreme plans to destroy Arizonans' Second Amendment rights, raise taxes on the middle class, vote for Chuck Schumer as Senate Majority Leader, and block Judge Amy Coney Barrett's appointment to the United States Supreme Court.
Arizona is still the home of Barry Goldwater and millions of independent men and women who value their rights, liberties, and freedoms. Kelly made clear he would fast-track our rights straight into the gutter, proving he's the wrong choice for Senator.
Make sure Arizona remains the land of the free, not California 2.0, by voting to send Martha McSally back to the U.S. Senate!

President Trump moved to fulfill his Constitutional duties over the weekend by nominating the highly-qualified Amy Coney Barrett to fill the open seat on the Supreme Court.
But Democrats immediately made clear their plans to stall and obstruct this pick at any cost.
We want to hear from YOU! Is this obstruction from Chuck Schumer and the Democrats the right way forward? Or should the Senate work with President Trump to #FillTheSeat, and confirm Judge Barrett?
Take our poll below and let us know!

The mainstream media is more focused on making this a divisive issue, and they will likely join Senate Democrats to try to spread lies about Judge Barrett the same way they did with now-Justice Kavanaugh in 2018.

I know it’s the weekend, but this is an urgent time for our campaign to Keep Arizona Red.
We are approaching our FINAL end-of-month fundraising goal, and I just got off the phone with our finance team to see what we’ll need to raise in order to execute our strategy for this last leg of election season.

I know this may sound like too high of a bar to reach.
But with Democrats raising the stakes by threatening to reshape our republic with court packing and unprecedented Open Borders policies, this goal is the absolute bare minimum we need to raise in this next week.
And in fact, if our entire grassroots team pitches in, we can easily reach this $40K goal and give our Republican candidates the resources they need to fight for strong borders, a strong economy, and strong law enforcement.
With everything that’s at stake, will you protect Arizona and America by rushing in as little as $10 this weekend?

After hiding in his basement for the better part of this election season, Joe Biden is now trying to hide his agenda from the American people.
Biden was recently asked about his plans to “pack” the Supreme Court, an extreme proposal that would fundamentally alter our system of government for generations to come.
But rather than shoot down such an idiotic idea, Sleepy Joe refused to even muster an answer, and instead said that Americans don’t deserve to know where he stands on the matter.
PITCH IN TO STOP BIDEN
Joe Biden is trying to dupe the American people by not answering a question that is crucial for the future of our country.
But we won’t be fooled. We know that Biden and his far-left running mate are only keeping quiet because they sincerely do plan to pack our Supreme Court and ensure that their left-wing, Late-Term Abortion, anti-Second Amendment agenda will be the law of the land!
These are the stakes of the 2020 Election: We can either support Republican candidates that want a safer and more prosperous future for all, or stand by as Joe Biden and his cronies reshape our republic to fit their far-left vision.
The future of America as we know it will come down to our actions in these last few weeks. If you want to preserve what makes our country great before the Democrats bend the rules with authoritarian tactics, then we need your urgent support here in Arizona.

Recently, we held even more tele-town halls with dozens of candidates running in key statewide races and in battleground legislative districts to protect our majorities at the State Legislature and stave off the Green New Dealers backed by far-left Silicon Valley donors. Additionally, we've hosted a diverse slate of nominees during our State of the Race Facebook Live series, and promoted important information about our Republican candidates on our voter information site at [[URL REDACTED]]!

Just yesterday, we hosted a statewide tele-town hall with U.S. Senator Martha McSally and our three Republican candidates for Arizona Corporation Commission, Lea Márquez Peterson, Jim O'Connor, and Eric Sloan. We targeted and reached hundreds of thousands of Arizonans by phone, many of whom voted in 2016 for President Trump but stayed home in the 2018 midterm election.
All of these candidates also recently squared off with their Democrat opponents in debates that highlighted what's at stake in this election. In case you missed it, you can click below to watch the top moments from both of those debates:

2 DAYS TO GO
Fellow Patriot,
Arizona Republican U.S. Senator Martha McSally kicked off the final weekend of the 2020 election in style, announcing the launch of her #AZFighter Tour — an 11-stop rally blitz across the state of Arizona.
If you would like to attend any of these events and hear from Senator McSally, you can visit [[URL REDACTED]] for more details and to RSVP!
On Sunday, Senator McSally was joined by Republican Party of Arizona Chairwoman Kelli Ward, Arizona State Treasurer Kimberly Yee, and Texas Republican U.S. Senator Ted Cruz! The group made stops in Tucson, Sierra Vista, Casa Grande, Payson, Show Low, and Yuma.
Hundreds of Arizonans came out to show their support for Senator McSally because they know, unlike her far-left Democrat opponent, she will always fight to protect their freedoms and future in the Senate.
“The people of Arizona deserve a fighter who will go to bat for them on the kinds of day-to-day issues that really matter to them—from border security to quality healthcare to holding China accountable—Senator McSally has been, is, and always will be that fighter they can trust and be proud of,” Chairwoman Ward said in a statement to the media before the tour began.
The tour wrapped up its first day of stops on Sunday night in Yuma, AZ with a special event featuring Donald Trump Jr! The President's eldest son rallied voters in southern Arizona for President Trump and Senator McSally, urging Arizonans in attendance and across the state to vote straight Republican up and down the ballot in 2020.
The action will resume at 9:00 AM on Monday, November 2, at a rally in Flagstaff, AZ, followed by stops in Safford, Phoenix, Kingman, and Prescott, AZ. The tour will conclude in grand fashion with a traditional Election Eve rally on Prescott's courthouse steps, which will be the 11th and final stop on Senator McSally's barnstorming #AZFighter Tour.
To attend any of Monday's events, be sure to visit [[URL REDACTED]] for more details and to RSVP!

There’s just one week left in the fight to protect our country!
Ever since President Trump started fighting the DC Swamp, and getting our government to work for AMERICANS again, power-hungry billionaires and Democrat elites have been plotting to get back to enacting their destructive agenda.
They’ve been teaming up with pals like George Soros and Mike Bloomberg, as well as Woke millionaires in Hollywood and Silicon Valley, to get back to selling out American workers and turning ARIZONA into a hub for unchecked illegal immigration.
Now there’s just one week left in our fight to stop them to ensure the globalists don’t Make America Last Again.
PITCH IN TO STOP THE LIBERAL ELITES
Will you answer the call to help us protect America in this last week?
At the Republican Party of Arizona, we’re putting together one last push to ensure Arizona stays RED by kicking off a $40K fundraising campaign in this final week before Election Day.
We still have about $28K left to raise though, and it’s going to take the support of our entire team if we want to reach this benchmark and compete with the Democrat donors.
Rush in your support today to make sure we don’t fall short! President Trump is counting on us here in the Grand Canyon State!

"Friend
The Republican Party of Arizona has been working hard to deliver a fun and safe experience on Election Night for Republicans so that we can all meet together (in person) to celebrate the historic re-election of President Trump and all of our other great Republican nominees down the ballot. Several weeks ago, we sent out a ""Save the Date"" notice to our nominees, legislators, and elected state party leaders, stating our intention to host this event at a well-known venue in Phoenix.
Due to Mayor Kate Gallego’s tyrant-like policies, this venue had to put in place very stringent COVID-19 restrictions, including major occupancy level restrictions and social distancing rules. Not only this, but we were also presented with evolving and credible security concerns due to the radical left's violent tendencies, which we've seen on full display across America.
Given the intense political climate, as well as the nature of the downtown Phoenix area, the Republican Party of Arizona determined it could not adequately ensure the safety of all of its guests while hosting this event as originally planned. For this reason, we successfully canceled our contract with the venue and received a full refund.
Fortunately, planning under highly uncertain circumstances is something the State Party is not new to this year. We continue to adapt and plan in preparation for our Election Night Party, and we hope to announce a new destination in the coming days. We are very excited to celebrate with all of our Republican Party members and can’t wait to host a welcoming, safe, and unforgettable event for all of you on November 3rd!

With less than three weeks left until one of the most important elections in our country’s history, it’s worth remembering what’s at stake if we don’t support our Republican candidates up and down the ballot this year.
The far-left is pushing for radical policies, like a complete government-takeover of our healthcare and the defunding of our law enforcement, that would turn America into a third-world dystopia.
Since the mainstream media won’t be honest with the American people about this, it’s up to us to defeat this agenda by supporting our Republican candidates here in the battleground state of Arizona.
With our healthcare, our economy, and our security all at stake, can we count on you to pitch in for a big Republican victory in 2020?
PITCH IN $20.20
PITCH IN ANY AMOUNT
We know that if the Democrats come to power in Arizona and D.C., the American people will suffer tremendously from the Left’s reckless and radical policies.
The Democrats have been openly plotting a complete overhaul of our democracy, saying they plan on tampering with elements of our government that have been in place for centuries by “packing” the Supreme Court and ending the filibuster.
That’s why we need to make sure we stop them this year and support our responsible, conservative candidates instead. With Democrats planning to upend our entire system of government, let’s be sure we don’t give them the go-ahead to ruin our country.
Pitch in so that we can Keep Arizona Red, and Keep America Great!

Democrat run-cities like Portland, Seattle, and Minneapolis have seen unprecedented lawlessness and mob violence this year.
This is in no small part thanks to the ineptitude of the local far-left officials in these cities, who abandoned entire police precincts, and later worked to defund law enforcement - all just to stay on the good side of radical domestic terrorists.
If we want to make sure this reckless leadership gets nowhere near the Grand Canyon State, then we need to elect Republicans to ALL levels of government here in Arizona.

"11 DAYS TO GO
Democrats Have Launched A Massive Spending Blitz To Take Over State Governments
10/16/2020 05:45 am ET | Updated 5 days ago
Millions of dollars being spent for control of the Arizona State House
Posted at 5:34 PM, Sep 22, 2020
We saw it coming months ago,
The Democrat Party's win-at-all-costs strategy doesn't end with attacking the duly elected President every minute since his election. They want to dominate every aspect of your life and crush any dissent from their totalitarian policies. Just try going to church in California or opening a gym in New Jersey.
When the Tea Party movement erupted in 2010 in response to the Democrat-dominated Congress' overreach, Republicans across the country were able to unite and stop their extreme plans for our country. But now they're back, and they've got another scheme for 2020.
Right here in Arizona, Democrat dark money spending is flooding into our state elections. The question is why?
New York Democrats like Mike Bloomberg want to control the Arizona legislature.
We've been watching outside dark money flooding into Arizona. In one Legislative District alone, Democrat front groups have spent close to $1.5 million to deceive voters about the three Republican candidates on the ticket!
That's $500,000 in out-of-state dark money targeting each of our Republican candidates!
Arizonans won't fall for the lies and slick ads being produced by outside special interest groups trying to flip our State Legislature and take over our Corporation Commission.
Return or mail in your ballot today and help us send Mike Bloomberg packing with a clear message: Keep your elite, coastal politics in New York. The Arizona Legislature isn't for sale!
Onward to Victory,
Arizona Republicans

Republican Voter Registration Surges in AZ
If you, a family member, or a friend, are not registered to vote,
the deadline is Monday, October 5!
Visit [[URL REDACTED]] TODAY
﻿to register to vote or to check your status.
New Republican voters are being registered at a record pace in Arizona! We made huge investments to increase Republican voter registration numbers earlier this year and we’ve seen it pay incredible dividends over the summer and in these months leading up to the November election.
Here’s the latest breakdown of the over 2.5 million active voters registered in Maricopa County:
* 885,510 — Republican (35.36%)
* 807,003 — Other (32.23%)
* 788,334 — Democrat (31.48%)
* 23,024 — Libertarian (0.91%)
Best of all, Republicans continue to see our numbers surge! Statewide, since April 1, 2020, Republicans have added 55,988 new voters while Democrats have added only 39,946 — a 16,042 margin in our favor.
Over that same period, Republicans out-registered Democrats in Maricopa County by about 9,000 new voters. To put all these numbers into perspective, a few months ago Republicans had a registration advantage in Maricopa County of around 80,000. Last month, we saw that advantage spike to over 87,000. Today, it’s almost at 97,000 — and we’re not slowing down!
If you, a family member, or a friend, are not registered to vote,

Legislative District Tele-Town Halls
Last week, the Republican Party of Arizona dialed out to tens of thousands of critically important voters in LD17 and LD21 as part of a series of tele-town halls with our Republican nominees for the Arizona State Legislature.
Moderated by Chairwoman Kelli Ward, voters in those districts heard a discussion between her and our Republican nominees on topics like education, tax cuts and policy, criminal justice reform, defending the police, election integrity, and other relevant issues.
Joining as speakers on our LD17 tele-town hall were State Senator J.D. Mesnard, State Representative Jeff Weninger, and LD17 GOP nominee Liz Harris.
Later that same evening, on our LD21 tele-town hall, callers heard from State Senator Rick Gray, State Representative Kevin Payne, and LD21 GOP nominee Beverly Pingerelli.
These calls were specifically targeted to reach thousands of important swing and undecided voters in both LD17 and LD21. Additional tele-town halls have already been scheduled to take place in the coming days and weeks in legislative districts 4, 6, 9, 11, 20, and 28 ahead of the November 3rd election.
Important Home Stretch Resources
We are now 31 days from Election Day 2020. This election will be won or lost in the trenches. In the end, the better-prepared side that invested more energy and resources and fought harder until the final bell will most likely be crowned the winner. At the Republican Party of Arizona, we are executing on all fronts to secure a victory for our country and our American values. Here are a just a few updates on efforts the State Party is actively engaged in:
* Latest ""State of the Race"" Facebook Live Event: The Republican Party of Arizona hosted another episode of our weekly ""State of the Race"" Facebook Live events this week! These events are designed to help voters learn more about the Republican nominees running to represent them in 2020. In this week's episode of our ""State of the Race"" series, Chairwoman Kelli Ward chatted with Maricopa County Attorney Allister Adel, House Speaker Rusty Bowers (LD-25), LD-4 State Senate nominee Travis Angry, LD-6 State Senate nominee Wendy Rogers, LD-4 State House nominee Joel John, LD-23 State House nominee John Kavanagh, and Maricopa County Community College Governing Board candidate Shelli Boggs! If you missed our latest episode, you can rewatch it now by at: [[URL REDACTED]]
* Voter Education Resources Available: Voters can also brush up on their knowledge of the Republican nominees running for federal, statewide, and legislative offices in 2020 by visiting our custom voter education website at [[URL REDACTED]] today!
* ""Defend Your Ballot"" Campaign to Enlist Poll Workers: The Republican Party is recruiting people to sign up to be volunteers by directing them to [[URL REDACTED]] We need an army of observers and poll workers to provide vital, real-time information on in-person voting, as well as to monitor the counting of mail-in ballots. Upon enlistment in our Army for Trump, our volunteers will receive training to learn all about the poll-watching process. Loyal volunteers are vital to free and fair elections. Any information about changes to election procedure, voting, and absentee requests can be sent to our Arizona State Election Day Operations Director, Gina Swoboda, by emailing [[URL REDACTED]]
* Positively Framing the Media Narrative: Chairwoman Kelli Ward appeared on Newsmax TV to speak with former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer about the importance of Arizona in deciding the outcome of the 2020 election. The interview covered President Trump's margin of victory in 2016 and how he will look to build on that margin in 2020, President Trump and the Republican Party's shared values with the LDS community, and a question about Biden's absence on the campaign trail while President Trump has traveled all over the country. Watch the full interview here: [[URL REDACTED]]
You've Got Mail: Golden Tickets Incoming!
In the past, Golden Tickets have proven to be an invaluable resource for making sure our Republican nominees win on Election Day!
For your average voter, learning who the candidates on the ballot are can sometimes be a daunting and laborious endeavor. That's why the Republican Party of Arizona has worked to make voting easy for them by ensuring EVERY legislative district in the state receives Golden Tickets this election cycle!
We've used cutting-edge data to maximize our efforts by targeting specific universes of voters who may need encouragement and guidance to get out and vote for all of our Republican candidates down the ballot. We have also provided multiple training sessions for our legislative district and county chairs, partnered with a print house to deliver professional and approachable designs — check out the example above of our LD21 Golden Ticket! — and utilized our unique mailing permit to ensure we gained the biggest bang for our buck when it came to printing hundreds of thousands of tickets.
Best of all, these Golden Tickets are slated to hit voters' mailboxes at the same time as early ballots next week! We are so excited to see the impact these have across our state. With efforts like this one, we will ensure that we keep Arizona red, re-elect President Trump, send Senator McSally back to the U.S. Senate, and hold onto our Republican majorities in the State Legislature.
We thank all the district and county chairs who worked collaboratively with us on this project! From designing unique grassroots pieces, to compiling candidate lists, and by supporting our robust efforts, the Republican Party of Arizona encountered incredible buy-in from leaders all across the state. Now, we are thrilled to be able to deliver on this promise to our candidates and their campaigns!
Presidential Debate Watch Party at HQ
The Republican Party of Arizona hosted a Presidential Debate Watch Party at our Phoenix headquarters on Tuesday, September 29. Guests cheered on Donald Trump as he demolished Democrat challenger Sleepy Joe Biden.
Before the debate, Chairwoman Ward addressed the attendees with a brief update on the state of the 2020 race here in Arizona and special guest Richard Grenell called in with breaking national updates.
Chairwoman Ward released the following statement after the debate ended:
“Tonight, millions of Americans learned why Joe Biden has been hiding from voters in his basement. Biden is a career politician whose only accomplishments are shipping millions of jobs overseas and raising taxes on hard-working Americans. Now, contrast Biden with President Trump, a political outsider when he ran in 2016, who has already done more in his 47 months in office than Biden has done in 47 years. The choice in this election couldn't be more clear: President Trump will uphold the rule of law in our nation, negotiate better and fairer trade deals that put American workers first, and demonstrate that he is the man to continue to lead our Great American Comeback.”

"AZGOP Election Integrity Fund
6 DAYS TO GO
Have you heard about our Election Integrity Fund?
We hope we never have to use it, but if anyone tries to unfairly influence (or outright steal) this election by breaking the law... We're ready to go.
FLASHBACK: ""But Mr. Podesta, playing Mr. Biden, shocked the organizers by saying he felt his party wouldn’t let him concede. Alleging voter suppression, he persuaded the governors of Wisconsin and Michigan to send pro-Biden electors to the Electoral College. In that scenario, California, Oregon, and Washington then threatened to secede from the United States if Mr. Trump took office as planned. The House named Mr. Biden president; the Senate and White House stuck with Mr. Trump. At that point in the scenario, the nation stopped looking to the media for cues, and waited to see what the military would do.""
That excerpt isn't from some political thriller — it's from a widely circulated New York Times story that examined some of the strategies Democrats were already gaming out months ago.
The key takeaway? If Democrats have their way, the ""blue wave"" that the mainstream media has been blathering on about for ages now would materialize weeks, or maybe even months, after the election. But it would materialize — legally or not.
Our great state isn't a beltway suburb dominated by liberal activists. Here in Arizona, we follow the law. And if anyone tries to cheat in our elections, we're prepared to stop them.
That's why generous donors have made investments into our Election Integrity Fund — a first ever for our state party.
How is this different? For starters, this is a dedicated fund to protect the integrity of our election and challenge illegal practices, fraudulent ballots, and defend the interests of Arizona voters. As you might expect, legal fees can be YUGE, including the need to appeal decisions and fight on multiple fronts.
We all know President Trump will win Arizona, and we already know that his win will be contested almost instantly. The Democrats have shown for the last four years that they don't just go quietly into the night after losing power. So we need to be ready for them.
Will you chip in $5 today to our Election Integrity Fund to ensure the Republican Party of Arizona can fight for you when the times comes to make sure our elections are fair this November?
For Arizona,
Arizona Republicans
This is the most important election in our lifetimes and we know problems happen on Election Day. Long lines, broken machines, or sick staff can all complicate your opportunity to cast your vote in this decisive election.

LET'S FINISH THIS!
Election Day is finally here!
The Republican Party of Arizona has been preparing for this moment since the day after the 2016 election. Tomorrow morning, the polls will open at 6:00 AM, and from sun up to sun down, we'll be working overtime to protect the integrity of our elections.
In case you haven't heard, the Election Integrity Fund we established months ago is one of our best tools in the fight for a free and fair election. But we can't do it alone! We need your help.
Report any issues at the polls to our state hotline: (602) 926-2877
During this unprecedented time, the nation has been forced to keep up with several last-minute changes to how we vote.
We've seen new and untested mail-in balloting practices hastily rolled out across the country. We've seen plans for socially distanced lines and voting centers. And we've seen people trying to take advantage of these measures to stack the deck and to rig an otherwise fair election.
NOT IN OUR STATE!
We've already been successful at preventing several attempts to weaken the security of our vote. With an election this important before us, we can't allow outside interests to influence, or try to steal, the legitimacy of your vote. We will not allow them to disenfranchise the citizens of Arizona!

To elect officials with a far-left ideology (even in down-ballot positions) can be a disaster for American neighborhoods and suburbs.
We’ve seen in Portland, Minneapolis, and Seattle how mayors and city council members have enabled the mob, putting the anti-American demands of domestic terrorists ahead of their constituents’ safety.
STOP THE FAR-LEFT MOB
But if we want to stop this chaos from spreading elsewhere in our country, and coming to Arizona, then we need YOUR HELP! Show your support and VOTE for our strong Republican candidates up and down the ballot this year so that we can keep our communities safe!
Republican candidates in the Grand Canyon State are going up against lawless, far-left Democrats who won’t lift a finger when the mob starts to terrorize our communities, topple our statues, and put Arizonans in harm's way.
These radicals need to be defeated next week, and you can greatly help this effort by voting Republican up and down the ballot!
Thank you for working to keep our communities safe by Keeping Arizona Red!
KEEP AZ RED IN 2020!
For Arizona,
Greg Safsten
Executive Director
Republican Party of Arizona
P.S. Lawless Democrat candidates here in Arizona are being propped up by far-left billionaires. To help us compete with them, will you show your grassroots support for Republican candidates by donating today?

Friend
I won’t try to sugarcoat it - this last full week before Election Day is going to be an all-out blitz to protect our state and country.
With how neck-and-neck the race is looking in Arizona, letting undecided voters know the true endgame of the far-left Democrat Party is sure to bring them over to our side.
When Arizonans see that these corrupt politicians and their globalist donor network plan on inundating our state with unchecked illegal immigration, and letting the drug-flow from south of the border wreak havoc on our communities, it will be clear to everyone that the Democrats don’t have our best interests at heart.
And when this Open Borders position is coupled with plans to ship jobs overseas and hike up taxes to criminal levels \- all in the middle of a PANDEMIC \- the people of our state will realize that the America Last platform of puppets like Joe Biden and Mark Kelly is the opposite of what we need.
Don’t Let the Far-Left Agenda Win! - [[URL REDACTED]]
At AZGOP, we’re doing everything we can to get this message across in this final week. But in order to do this and preserve all that makes our state and country great, we need your urgent help for one last push.
You can help our efforts tremendously by helping us get a head start on this week’s fundraising and rushing in a contribution before the week gets too crazy.
Can we count on your generosity today so that we can be on track for a conservative victory next week?

I can’t thank you enough for your continued support. Let’s finish strong and Keep Arizona Red!

Friend
Our counterparts on the Left seem to know just how crucial Arizona will be in the 2020 Election.
That’s why they are pouring millions of dollars into our state, asking their wealthy donors in Hollywood and Silicon Valley to chip in so that our country can be reshaped to fit their extreme, far-left vision.
But we know that the agenda of these out-of-touch California and New York donors aren’t what our country needs. If their wishlist of open borders, defunded police departments, and a weakened Second Amendment ever gets passed in D.C., our country will be set back for generations -- and the America we know and love may never be the same.
DONATE NOW TO STOP THIS HOSTILE TAKEOVER OF AMERICA
We need your help to compete with these elites and their liberal agenda to make sure they don’t buy the 2020 Election here in our state.
By pitching in for this final stretch, you can help us counter the Democrat Machine and deliver a massive victory for the values of everyday Americans.
Can we count on you to join us in this fight with the election less than 30 days away?

Grassroots Mobilization Stays in High Gear
The Republican Party of Arizona has designed, printed, and shipped hundreds of thousands of ""Golden Tickets"" to residents living in every legislative district in the state, targeting key swing voters and encouraging them to vote straight Republican down the ballot in 2020. This is a critical grassroots campaign to move the needle in battleground districts where a few hundred votes here or there could be the real difference-makers in holding, and potentially increasing, our majorities in the State House and State Senate.
We have also designed, printed, and stocked new ""Vote Republican"" signs, and we need YOUR help to get them out before Election Day! You can stop by our headquarters, or our field offices deployed around the state, to pick up these signs (while supplies last) and show your support for the Republican Party!
Last, but certainly not least, we have launched a massive campaign in recent weeks to design, print, and hand out hundreds of thousands of political literature, including door hangers, in legislative districts across the state. (See below for an example of the door hanger we designed and distributed to voters in LD23.) Voters are being reminded every day why they should vote Republican this election, and the Republican Party of Arizona is leading the way on that effort.
Legislative District Tele-Town Halls
LD6 TeleTown Hall \(Highlight Clip\)
Chairwoman Dr. Kelli Ward hosted six tele-town halls across the state this past week to support Republican candidates in LD4, LD6, LD9, LD11, LD20, and LD28. These calls reached thousands of voters and let candidates speak directly to the electorate on the issues that matter.
Joining as speakers on the tele-town halls were:
LD4: State Senate Candidate Travis Angry and State House Candidate Joel John.
LD6: State Senate Candidate Wendy Rogers, State Representative Walt Blackman, and State House Candidate Brenda Barton.
LD9: State House Candidate Brendan Lyons, Pima County Sheriff Mark Napier, and Pima County Supervisor Candidate Gabby Mercer.
LD11: State Senator Vince Leach, State Representative Mark Finchem, and State Representative Bret Roberts.
LD20: State Senator Paul Boyer, State Representative Anthony Kern, and State Representative Shawnna Bolick.
LD28: State House Candidate Ken Bowers, Corporation Commissioner Candidate Jim O’Connor, Phoenix Mayoral Candidate Merissa Hamilton.

McSally Wins Senate Debate
Top 7 Moments From the Arizona Senate Debate
Arizonans finally got a chance to see far-left, extreme Democrat Mark Kelly emerge from his basement to debate Senator Martha McSally. The contest wasn't even close.
Viewers heard about McSally's record of achievement, transparency, and principled conservative leadership. They also learned about Mark Kelly's disturbing ties to the Communist Party of China, his extreme plans to destroy Arizonans' Second Amendment rights, raise taxes on the middle class, vote for Chuck Schumer as Senate Majority Leader, and his desire to block Judge Amy Coney Barrett's appointment to the United States Supreme Court.
Click on the video above to watch the top 7 moments from the Arizona Senate debate!
Arizona is still the home of Barry Goldwater and millions of independent men and women who value our rights, liberties, and freedoms. Mark Kelly's extreme views and dismal performance on the debate stage show he's not the man to represent Arizona in the U.S. Senate.
Must Watch Corp Comm Debate Highlights
Top 7 Moments From the Arizona Corporation Commission Debate
Did you catch the recent Corporation Commission debate?
Our amazing slate of Republican candidates — Lea Marquez Peterson, Eric Sloan, and Jim O’Connor — faced off against their far-left Democrat opponents to talk about the real issues that matter to Arizonans.
While the Republicans delivered strong, focused debate performances, their Democrat opponents used their time to propose an extreme, California-style agenda with energy policies that will raise energy costs, increase taxes, and create new government mandates while negatively affecting millions of Arizona ratepayers.
Arizona cannot afford more far-left Democrats on the Corporation Commission — especially not ones bought and paid for by leftist California billionaire Tom Steyer!
Click on the video above to watch the top 7 moments from the debate!
Help us protect Arizona’s energy future this election, and #VoteTheSlate to send Lea, Eric, and Jim to the Arizona Corporation Commission.
Ballot Harvesting Remains Illegal in Arizona
Last weekend, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear a defense by Arizona Republicans, led by Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich, which seeks to keep in place Arizona’s election integrity laws concerning ballot harvesting and out-of-precinct voting that were previously struck down by the liberal Ninth Circuit.
Republican Party of Arizona Chairwoman Kelli Ward issued the following statement when news broke:
“The Arizona Legislature carefully crafted our election laws to balance integrity and accessibility while ensuring every voter has an opportunity to cast a vote and make their voice heard at the ballot box. Many states in our country currently have anti-ballot harvesting laws on the books similar to Arizona’s.
""Protecting the security and integrity of our elections should not be a partisan issue — and it used to not be. Not so long ago, the bi-partisan Commission on Federal Election Reform, chaired by former President Jimmy Carter (D) and former Secretary of State James Baker (R), wrote in defense of laws to address the risks posed by ballot harvesting: ‘State and local jurisdictions should prohibit a person from handling absentee ballots other than the voter, an acknowledged family member, the U.S. Postal Service or other legitimate shipper, or election officials. The practice in some states of allowing candidates or party workers to pick up and deliver absentee ballots should be eliminated.’
I am incredibly thankful for Republican leadership fighting to make sure our elections remain safe, secure, and accessible for every voter. In addition, our Republican state legislators deserve a great amount of credit for using commonsense and prudent judgment in crafting our state election laws. Even as Democrats seek to delegitimize our laws and sow seeds of doubt in an attempt to compromise the results of our elections, Republicans remain steadfast and unwavering in defense of law and order and election integrity.”

Tomorrow is the day that our mission to stop a left-wing takeover of Arizona will meet its final test.
Two Democrat candidates who have a long and shady history of supporting the Chinese Communist government are at the top of the ballot this year in Arizona. And with the support of millionaires in Silicon Valley, Beijing Biden and Marx Kelly are hoping to turn our proud Republican state into a pawn for their far-left agenda!
HELP US STOP THEM TOMORROW!
At the Republican Party of Arizona, we’ve been working hard for months to stop the Left’s plans and ensure that hard-working, conservative values prevail for future generations of Arizonans.
And to tell you the truth, this fight would not have been possible without the incredible support of patriots like you! But now, in order for all of this hard work to pay off, we need to come together for an Election Day win TOMORROW to finish this campaign strong!
I know my team plans on making one last voter outreach push in order to show Arizonans how the Democrats’ Anti-Second Amendment, economy-destroying policies HURT working families in our state.
Can I count on you to make a FINAL contribution today to assist my team’s efforts and lead us to a landslide victory tomorrow?
MAKE ONE LAST DONATION TODAY!

It’s not enough for out-of-state elites to use their power and influence in the media and Big Tech to try to destroy our conservative values. They are also pouring in millions of dollars to left-wing candidates right here in Arizona to make sure their radical agenda wins on Election Day.
That’s why we need your urgent support to compete with them in order to preserve the values of everyday Americans. Help us do so by pitching in toward this LAST fundraising goal!

With Arizona playing such a pivotal role in the 2020 Election, this means that the actions of grassroots patriots like YOU in these next few days are going to determine the future of our entire country as we know it!
PROTECT OUR FUTURE! PITCH IN TO AZGOP
Democrats are trying to hide just how much they plan to reshape America if they’re given the keys to D.C. this year.
The liberal candidate for Senate here in our state won’t say who he’ll vote for as Majority Leader if his party comes to power, even though we know he’ll fall in line and support far-left New Yorker Chuck Schumer.
Others like Joe Biden are trying to conceal their plans for court packing, even though we know they’ll wield the Judicial Branch to make sure their immoral Late-Term Abortion agenda is the law of the land for generations to come.
The truth is that Democrats plan on overhauling everything we love about America if they’re given the chance to do so.
By stopping them here in Arizona, we can protect our values and show these radicals that we reject the left-wing takeover of our country!

Be on the lookout for a lot of obstruction from the Do-Nothing Democrats this week…
The process of getting President Trump’s highly-qualified nominee, Judge Amy Coney Barrett, confirmed to the Supreme Court starts TOMORROW!
We’ve already seen Democrats start to stoop as low as they can go, taking swipes at Barrett’s faith and even her family! The obstructionist far-left is sure to make this process a circus, one that will make even the Kavanaugh hearings look like a walk in the park.
SIGN AMY’S GOOD LUCK CARD
In the state of Arizona, it could fall on US to decide whether Amy Coney Barrett eventually gets confirmed to the bench. If the Democrats succeed in their mission to drag out this confirmation process, the winner of Arizona’s 2020 Senate special election will end up being the deciding vote for this Supreme Court seat!
For this reason, and MANY others, we’re working hard to make sure Mark Kelly, the preferred candidate of Communist China and Big Tech, is defeated at the ballot box this year, and that Senator McSally wins a decisive victory.
But we need your help to make this happen! To help us Keep Arizona Red, and to help an intelligent and qualified constitutionalist get appointed to the Supreme Court, pitch in today for a big 2020 Election victory!

The agenda that Democrats are hoping to see prevail next week is a victory for the Communist government in China, drug trafficking gangs south of the border, and out-of-touch Hollywood millionaires - not working Americans like you.
Republican candidates, from President Trump and Senator McSally to all of our strong down-ballot conservatives, are prepared to protect our communities and get our country back to work by ushering in another record-setting, booming economy.
But they need help with this mission, and grassroots donors like YOU hold the keys to getting these America First candidates in office!
At the Republican Party of Arizona, we kicked off this final fundraising campaign knowing that reaching this amount was absolutely essential for helping our conservative candidates win on Election Day.
But now there are just a few hours left for you to pitch in and lead our country towards a promising future with responsible, Republican leadership!

Last night was our final and most significant fundraising goal of the election season so far.
After months of competing with misinformation from the media, million-dollar donations from Woke Hollywood elites, and censorship from Big Tech oligarchs, we needed our grassroots team to come together for one last push in order to preserve our conservative values next week.
And although many patriots stepped up to answer the call, we came up just short.
This goal is simply too important to not reach, though. In the final weekend before Election Day, not having the resources to execute our final strategy to Keep Arizona Red is simply unacceptable.
That’s why we’ve extended this crucial deadline, and are giving our team one more shot to stand up for Arizona and America!
DEADLINE EXTENDED! RUSH IN YOUR SUPPORT!
DONATE HALF - $733.50
We have exactly $1,467 left to raise, and only 24 HOURS LEFT to make it up.
In the name of safety, security, and prosperity for future generations, we are asking you RIGHT NOW to show your patriotism and rush in any amount to the Republican Party of Arizona.
Our battleground state could decide this entire contest next week - and possibly by as little as a single percentage point. Every dollar is going to make all the difference. Will you be the patriot that saves our republic and stops the far-left agenda?

President Donald Trump is in a close re-election race this year, thanks to the efforts of left-wing billionaires like Mike Bloomberg and George Soros who are flooding the airwaves with propaganda.
Because of that, our president is going to need as many electoral votes as possible, especially with all of the shady tactics Democrats are trying to pull this election.
270 is the magic number of electoral votes Trump needs in order to reach a majority and get back to work keeping promises for the American people. Will you help him get to this amount by boosting our efforts here in Arizona?
DONATE $20.20 TO REACH THE MAJORITY
DONATE $270 TO REACH THE MAJORITY
DONATE ANY AMOUNT
Democrats know how important our state is going to be this election. That’s why they’re directing the contributions of their Silicon Valley donors right here to Arizona, with the hopes of giving our electoral votes to Beijing Biden and his far-left running mate.
But if we can get our grassroots donors to compete with them, we can be sure our votes go to President Trump instead as he looks to reach his 270 majority.
Thank you for helping our efforts with less than two weeks until Election Day!

"Did you know that there are only FOUR more Sundays left until November 3rd?
[[URL REDACTED]]
Friend
We hope that you’re enjoying your Sunday today and spending it in the company of your family and friends.
Did you know that there are only FOUR more Sundays left until November 3rd? As crazy as that sounds, there is still so much at stake for our country between now and then.
With how far the Democrat Party has steered to the Left, the safety of our neighborhoods and suburbs could be on the line if their lawless Defund the Police agenda comes to power. And with our state’s Senate race looking like it will be THE deciding vote for Amy Coney Barrett’s confirmation, the future of our country’s Supreme Court is also likely to be decided right here in Arizona.
HELP KEEP ARIZONA RED
At the Republican Party of Arizona, we’re working hard to compete with the Democrats to make sure we Keep Arizona Red for future generations. But in order to be successful in our mission, we need our grassroots team to step up one last time and support us in this final stretch before Election Day so that we can finish strong.
With only four more Sundays left before the future of our country is decided, can we count on you to pitch in just a few dollars to help boost our efforts?
Thank you in advance, and may God bless America!
4 MORE SUNDAYS UNTIL ELECTION DAY! DONATE $4
DONATE ANY AMOUNT
For Victory,
Arizona Republicans
P.S. In the neck-and-neck Presidential race, Arizona could be the battleground state that decides whether we get #FourMoreYears of President Trump’s strong leadership, or whether we call the lid on our future by electing Sleepy Joe Biden. Help us support our President’s re-election by pitching in what you can today!

"After weeks of slander and fear-mongering from the Democrats regarding President Trump’s SCOTUS nominee, Judge Amy Coney Barrett is finally close to being confirmed to the United States Supreme Court.
[[URL REDACTED]]
Friend
After weeks of slander and fear-mongering from the Democrats regarding President Trump’s SCOTUS nominee, Judge Amy Coney Barrett is finally close to being confirmed to the United States Supreme Court.
Barrett is a highly qualified legal mind who will dutifully uphold the Constitution and stand for our rights and liberties.
But Democrats in the Senate are trying to obstruct her confirmation in its final moments! Tell these Senators to stop blocking the political process and do their jobs by confirming ACB to the Supreme Court!
These liberal hypocrites are trying to claim that President Trump is in the wrong for following through on his Constitutional responsibilities. Meanwhile, the same Democrats plot behind the scenes to “pack” the court and completely reshape our country for generations to come!
If you want to tell these far-left Senators to stop their political games and confirm an excellent nominee to the Supreme Court, make your voice heard by adding your name below!
ADD YOUR NAME NOW!
Thank you for signing our petition and standing with Amy Coney Barrett!
For Arizona and America,
Dr. Kelli Ward
Chairwoman
Republican Party of Arizona
PS - If you want to help us send Do-Nothing Democrats home on Election Day, and stand with elected officials who will actually do their jobs, support our efforts to do so by pitching in to AZGOP today!

"12 DAYS TO GO
Friend,
With 12 days left until Election Day, President Trump and Sleepy Joe Biden are scheduled to square off one last time TONIGHT in a head-to-head debate at Belmont University in Nashville!
Which watch party will you be joining?
Tonight promises to be a doozy. Not only has the biased Commission on Presidential Debates found a third DNC-loving moderator, but they'll also be muting microphones — something that has never been done before and is sure to unduly influence the debate.
The future of America is on the line between today and Election Day and we need your help now more than ever!
Lastly, don't forget to visit [[URL REDACTED]] for more information on how you can cast your ballot early, mobilize others to join the Army for Trump, and help Republicans across the country Make America Great Again, Again!
Onward to Victory,
Arizona Republicans
P.S. In the hours before the debate, we're reading reports that President Trump has invited Hunter Biden's former business associate, Tony Bobulinski, to be his special guest tonight. Tony's been in the news lately for confirming several allegations from the bombshell NY Post story that called into question Biden's fitness for the presidency.
Long lines are expected on Election Day.
Don't take chances with your vote and lose your voice.
Submit your absentee ballot early!

[[URL REDACTED]]
Friend
This is a reminder to all of you who haven’t made your voices heard yet in the 2020 Election to Vote Republican up and down the ballot this election!
Liberal elected officials have been undermining the work of brave law enforcement members in other Democrat-run areas, and we can’t sit by and let them bring their Defund the Police agenda to our state.
By slashing police budgets and letting officers become villainized, mayors and city councilmembers in places like Portland have become de facto mob enablers. We can’t let any far-left politician with this type of ideology get elected here in the Grand Canyon State. Vote Republican in 2020 and stand on the side of Law and Order!
We know that many of you have already cast your votes for Republicans this year and have shown your support for our police and law and order in America. But for anyone who hasn’t yet made their voice heard, be sure to VOTE REPUBLICAN up and down the ballot in this election so that our great police can continue faithfully protecting and serving our communities. Please have your friends and family do the same!
Thank you for helping us finish out this campaign with a big conservative victory!
For Arizona,
Zach Henry
Communications Director
Republican Party of Arizona
P.S. It looks like our Democrat counterparts and their Hollywood donors are trying to make one last push to turn Arizona into a socialist nightmare. We can’t let their efforts be successful -- pitch in any amount right now to help us compete with them before it’s too late!

"Trump visited Arizona in an effort to prop up his own failing campaign as well as to boost the campaigns of his Republican cronies in Congress.
AZ Dems Friend,
Yesterday, Trump brought his traveling circus to Arizona.
Rather than focusing on the public health crisis ravaging Arizona, Trump visited Yuma to check on his border wall and later held a youth rally in Phoenix.
During his visit, Trump also praised some of his most loyal cronies, including unelected Sen. Martha McSally, Rep. Debbie Lesko, and Rep. David Schweikert.
Now Republican dollars are pouring in for Trump and his posse of rubber stamps. We’re setting up a response fund with a goal of $10,000 to help us fight the influx of GOP funding, so we can defeat Trump and his allies in Congress.

"Our friends and neighbors on the Navajo Nation urgently need our support. If your situation allows, will you consider donating to the Official Navajo Nation COVID-19 Relief Fund?
AZ Dems
Friend,
Our state and country are living through one of the most challenging times in recent history. And although the health crisis has upended the lives of every one of us, certain communities are being disproportionately affected by the pandemic, with devasting and long-lasting consequences.
The Navajo Nation is one such community that has been especially hard hit by the coronavirus. In fact, during certain stretches in April, the number of COVID-19 cases per capita grew as fast in the Navajo Nation as in New York City, the epicenter of the outbreak in America. What’s more, health officials predict that the worst is yet to come for the Navajo Nation, with a peak expected in mid-May.
Our friends and neighbors in the Navajo Nation urgently need our support. If your situation allows, will you consider donating to the Official Navajo Nation COVID-19 Relief Fund? Any amount you can give will help the Navajo Nation address immediate medical and community needs.
Official Navajo Nation COVID-19 Relief Fund
In times of crisis, the strength of our community shines through. Let’s come together to help the Navajo Nation respond to and recover from this devastating pandemic.
Thank you so much for your generosity.

Trump and Mitch McConnell want to take this country backward and destroy decades of Democratic progress.
If Mitch McConnell and his Republican cronies confirm Trump’s nominee, our impeached President will have appointed a THIRD of the Supreme Court.
We have to defend our Democratic progress.

"We've been saying it for months, and Joe Biden's campaign agrees: Arizona is the path to victory for Democrats in November.
AZ Dems
""In 2020, we believe that there will be battleground states that have never been battleground states before, Arizona top of the list.""
–Biden campaign manager, Jen O'Malley Dillon
Friend,
We’ve been saying it for months, and Joe Biden’s campaign agrees: Arizona is the path to victory for Democrats in November.
With Arizona at the center of the battle for the White House, Democrats – and Republicans – are focusing their time, attention, and money on Arizona.
Here, at the Arizona Democratic Party, we’re doing our part by organizing a massive (digital!) program to register and mobilize voters across the state.
Will you donate $15 or whatever you can to help us sustain our efforts in the coming months, so we can elect Joe Biden and flip the U.S. Senate in the process?
Donate Now
Our momentum is terrifying to Republicans – that’s why they’re spending millions of dollars in Arizona. But with your continued support, we will win.
Thank you!

AZ Dems
This week, while holding a rally in Arizona, Trump:
* Lied about Democrat Joe Biden’s tax plan
* Downplayed the COVID-19 pandemic
* Described blatant extortion in a hypothetical call with the CEO of Exxon
The Trump Presidency has been a disaster. Our country is weaker, poorer, and sicker because of the actions of Donald Trump.

If we flip Arizona, we can defeat Donald Trump and take the Senate. But a recent poll listed on FiveThirtyEight showed Democrat Joe Biden only up 2 points in Arizona against Donald Trump.
The Trump campaign has gone all-out on trying to win Arizona. In recent weeks they have sent Ivanka Trump, Mike Pence, and Donald Trump here to try to rescue their struggling Arizona campaign effort. They are spending millions on negative attack ads in Arizona.

Friend,
A new report from AZ Central reveals Arizona Trump Victory has “contacted 3 million voters in Arizona asking for their votes to reelect President Donald Trump and other Arizona Republicans.”
What’s more, GOP volunteers have hosted over 950 “MAGA meet-ups,” 2,000 events and led 1,500 trainings in Arizona. Now, with Republicans going full throttle in our state, Democrats need to step up and fight back.
Will you rush a donation of $15 or whatever you can to help us train more volunteers, register more voters, and expand our digital advertising program?

Trump and national Republicans are investing time, money, and resources into Arizona like never before, because they know that Arizona is THE top battleground state in the country this year.
Arizona Democrats have the power to help defeat Trump and take back the U.S. Senate majority – but Republicans are putting up a strong fight, and it will take everyone on this team doing what they can to help us bring a blue wave to Arizona.

AZ Dems
Friend,
Arizona is primed to turn blue in November. Here are the signs:
* Democratic voters turned out in near-record numbers for Arizona’s primary last week, outpacing GOP voters for the first time in at least two decades.
* Poll after poll on Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight shows that Democrats have the lead in the race for Arizona’s 11 electoral votes and U.S. Senate seat.
* Arizona’s Democratic base consisting of Latinx, Black, and Native voters is growing and mobilizing like never before.
* Arizona is consistently listed as a top 2020 battleground state by political pundits and publications, with Democrats (and Republicans) investing heavily in Arizona.
While the momentum is exciting, we cannot rest on our laurels now. Republicans are spending millions of dollars in Arizona and running robust organizing programs to turn out the GOP vote.
We need 500 grassroots donors to step up today to help us expand our voter outreach efforts. Can we count on you to be one of the 500 people who makes the difference?

"Agriculture in AZ is an economic powerhouse, but dwindling water resources threaten the future of farming in our state.
AZ Dems
Friend,
It’s no secret that climate change is hurting our planet. From the devastating wildfires in Australia to the rapidly diminishing water reservoirs across Arizona, we’re seeing the effects of the climate crisis all around us.
The good news is that we have innovative solutions and strategies to combat climate change – what we don’t have is the right legislators who are willing to push them forward, including our current administration who refuses to take the climate crisis seriously.
That’s why we urgently need to elect leaders up and down the ballot who understand the facts, acknowledge science, and will prioritize climate action. Will you donate $15 or whatever you can to help us elect leaders who will act now on climate change?
Contribute
Here in Arizona, the Colorado River – which supplies over a third of Arizona’s water – has been experiencing a drought for nearly 20 years. Dwindling water resources is bad news for Arizona as agriculture accounts for hundreds of thousands of jobs and contributes billions of dollars to our state’s economy.
We cannot delay any longer. We cannot allow rising temperatures, growing wildfires, and historic droughts to become our new normal. We must act now. Donate today to help us elect climate warriors up and down the ballot.

Tomorrow is a big day. Yes, it’s New Year’s Eve, but on top of that, it’s our biggest fundraising deadline of the year AND the last day to triple match your donation.
Our team is working around the clock to make sure we meet our end-of-year fundraising goals so we can elect leaders that will fight for Arizona values. But if we fail to hit this goal, we’ll have to scale back critical operations that could jeopardize our progress toward turning Arizona blue.
We’re still $13,254 away from where we need to be -- Can we count on you to step up and help us hit this final goal of 2019?

"Despite a crazy week, Arizona Democrats have remained focused on what's still to come, including arguably the biggest presidential primary of our lifetimes on March 17.
AZ Dems
Team,
It’s been quite a week – from the Iowa Caucuses to the State of the Union to Trump’s acquittal. But through it all, Arizona Democrats have remained focused on what’s still to come, including arguably the biggest presidential primary of our lifetimes on March 17.
On March 17, Arizona, Florida, Ohio, and Illinois head to the polls to cast their votes for the eventual Democratic nominee. But even before the primary, the Arizona Democratic Party is already hard at work on a plan to turn Arizona blue in November.
We’re building a robust team and solid infrastructure to support the eventual Democratic nominee to victory in Arizona. Our Organizing Corp 2020 program is hitting the ground canvassing neighborhoods throughout the state. We’re registering new Democratic voters every day. And we’re getting our message out to families online and in-person.
With so much work ahead and so much at stake in the election, we need grassroots support to help us execute this multi-faceted strategy, so we can turn Arizona blue. Will you chip in right now to support this important work and help us move Arizona and the country forward?
Donate
We’re fighting for affordable health care, clean air, LGBTQ rights, women, DREAMers, students, and teachers. We’re fighting to ensure our families have a safe place to live, a thriving job market, and a government that is accountable to the people.
We cannot slow down. We cannot be discouraged. And we cannot get complacent.
Please donate whatever you can to keep us moving toward victory.

Democrats Decry 'Sham' Interviews for Seat on Board Key to Arizona Redistricting
Friend,
An article from the Phoenix New Times explores allegations of a “sham” interview process for a seat on the Commission on Appellate Court Appointments, a board with strong influence over congressional and legislative redistricting in Arizona.
The Senate Judiciary Committee reconfirmed Republican Jonathan Paton, whom Governor Doug Ducey had previously appointed to the seat. However, some applicants revealed their interviews were held  after the seat had been appointed, raising concerns that “Ducey is flouting the Constitution with his appointments and trying to stack the commission in Republicans' favor.”
Will you sign our petition condemning this shell game, and demand a fair and transparent interview process for the Appellate Court Commission?
Sign the petition
The commission is meant to reflect the diversity of Arizona’s population, but in reality, partisan politics are driving appointments. In fact, “public members of the appellate court commission include one person of color, not one Democrat, and not a single person from a tribe.”
Together, we need to make our voices heard and demand that these commissioners be as open and transparent as possible.

"2020 will be a fresh start and an opportunity to drive Arizona and our government in a new direction.
AZ Dems
Friend,
2019 has been quite a year.
Trump-crony Martha McSally was sworn in to the U.S. Senate, the president was impeached, and McConnell’s GOP-controlled Senate has been stuck in a self-imposed gridlock.
2020 is our chance to make things right. Next year, we can once again defeat unelected Sen. McSally, elect a Democratic president, and flip the Senate. But it won’t be easy. And right now, we need all hands on deck to help us meet our final fundraising deadline of 2019, so we can fight for these goals and make our government work for us.
Will you chip in $15 or whatever you can to help us meet our critical end-of-year grassroots fundraising deadline? This is the biggest deadline yet, and our numbers directly impact the work we’re able to carry out during election year.
Contribute
We have a massive opportunity in 2020. But with that opportunity comes a massive challenge – we’re up against corporate special interest backers and a multimillion-dollar GOP war chest. It will take a true grassroots army to fight back, hit our deadline, and win up and down the ballot come Election Day.
Will you help us take on this challenge by making a donation toward our $50,000 end-of-year goal? Every dollar helps us fight for a better Arizona for our communities and families.

Kelli Ward Tweet: EVEN IF these 'spontaneously' appearing ppl at protests against govt overreach \(sporting the same outfits, postures, & facial expressions\) ARE involved in healthcare - when they appeared at rallies, they were actors playing parts. #Propaganda #FakeOutrage
Ward’s remark is not only nonsensical but offensive to the health care workers across Arizona who have been working tirelessly to take care of our most vulnerable and individuals afflicted with COVID-19. The people on the frontlines are heroes who deserve our total and complete gratitude. At the Arizona Democratic Party, we stand by our health care workers and all frontline workers today and every day.

Now Donald Trump and the RNC have their sights set on a new location for the convention: Arizona.
The news comes as Arizona’s largest health system reaches capacity on ECMO lung machines while COVID-19 cases continue to climb throughout the state.
Trump’s obsession with packed, adoring crowds could put thousands of people at risk and decimate Arizona’s health care system.
It’s time to elect a leader who will put the health and safety of Arizonans above their own reckless pride. Will you donate $15 or whatever you can to help us register more Democratic voters, so we can vote Trump out in November?

Thanks for your support.

"Down in the polls, Donald Trump is resorting to dirty tricks to try and steal this election.
AZ Dems
Down in the polls, Donald Trump is resorting to dirty tricks to try and steal this election. His reelection strategy is: lie, cheat, steal.
Knowing his campaign is in real trouble, he is now going after the Post Office to make it harder for people to vote-by-mail.
Trump’s attempts to dismantle the Postal Service are a direct and immediate threat to people’s right to vote.
Friend, as Democrats, we must fight against any act of voter suppression. Add your name and demand Congress save the Postal Service >>
ADD YOUR NAME
Americans rely on the Postal Service to send birthday cards, receive life-saving medication, and soon millions of Americans will use it to cast their ballots. USPS isn’t some optional government program, it’s a constitutionally mandated public good.
This month the Trump administration removed crucial sorting machines from Post Offices across the country. Without a well functioning Postal Service, millions of Americans could be disenfranchised.
Friend, we can’t allow Donald Trump to steal this election -- Sign now and help save our country’s post offices?

This month, Donald Trump Jr., Mike Pence, and Donald Trump have all visited Arizona, demonstrating their desperation to hold onto Arizona.

It’s not just the Presidency or the Senate on the line. Donald Trump announced his SCOTUS nominee last weekend, and we know Mitch McConnell will rush the vote in an attempt to pack the court. If the GOP gets away with this, Trump will have appointed a THIRD of the Supreme Court - shaping our national values, ideals, and definition of justice for generations to come.
We have to do everything in our power to save our democracy. That's why we’re asking you to dig deep and chip in $3 NOW >>

Friend, we can’t believe it.
We just ran the numbers, and we didn’t just meet our August fundraising [[URL REDACTED]] smashed it!
This is a huge win in the battle to turn Arizona Blue.
Hitting our goal means:
* We can hire more organizers who will work day in and day out, contacting voters across the state.
* Scale-up our voter registration program to make sure everyone has a voice in November.
* Expand our digital ad’s reach to reach crucial swing voters.
We did this all with an average online contribution of just $35!
We are facing the most important election of our lifetime, and Arizona will likely play a crucial role in deciding the White House and the Senate. We are so grateful that so many of you decided to step up and help turn Arizona BLUE!
So from all of us at Arizona Democrats, Thank You!

"We want to know where you stand. Do you approve of Governor Ducey's handling of the health crisis?

Friend,
A new report shows Gov. Ducey ranked dead last among governors nationwide for his COVID-19 response. What’s more, he’s the ONLY governor with a COVID-19 approval rating below President Trump.
From the start, Gov. Ducey failed to recognize the severity of the virus. He was slow to respond to the pandemic and quick to reopen the state. Now, as cases skyrocket in Arizona, confidence in Ducey and his ability to lead Arizona out of the pandemic is at an all-time low.
We want to know where you stand. Do you approve of Governor Ducey’s handling of the health crisis?
Yes

Friend,
Democrats need just FOUR seats to take back the U.S. Senate from Mitch McConnell and Republicans.
And Arizona holds one of those seats.
The good news is Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight shows that our U.S. Senate seat CAN turn blue in November.
The bad news is Republicans are spending millions of dollars in a desperate attempt to hold on to power in Arizona and keep the U.S. Senate majority.
There’s no question that Arizona’s seat is KEY to flipping the U.S. Senate for Democrats. But we’re up against a massive GOP war chest, and we need every grassroots donor on this team to step up today.

"FiveThirtyEight broke down how Arizona became a swing state.
AZ Dems Friend,
Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight recently analyzed Arizona’s shift from safe Republican to the top swing state in the country.
Here’s what they had to say about how Arizona is changing:
* Arizona has shifted in the last two major election cycles in part because of the nation's “extremely pro-Democratic national environment.”
* The Latino, Black, and Native American populations that constitute the Democratic base in Arizona are growing.
* Suburban voters, specifically in Maricopa County, have been trending Democrat since the 2016 election.
Democratic momentum is so strong in Arizona that FiveThirtyEight’s polling shows that Arizonans CAN block Trump from winning their 11 electoral votes and flip our U.S. Senate seat blue.
But to be successful in November, we need everyone on this team to step up. Will you donate $15 or whatever you can right now to help us reach and register every Democratic voter in the state?
If you've saved payment info with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:

After a near-historic Democratic turnout in Arizona’s primary, Republicans are working overtime to register GOP voters ahead of November.

But with Republicans fighting back, we urgently need to ramp up our own voter registration program before Arizona’s October 5 deadline – and we need your help to do that.

"Navajo Nation and Hopi Reservation are extreme food deserts with only 10 grocery stores on Navajo Nation to serve some 180,000 people and only one grocery store on Hopi Reservation to serve some 3,000
Arizona Democrats
Friend,
Navigating the changing dynamics of day-to-day life during a pandemic is a challenge for all of us. But one group that is particularly at risk during this time is Arizona’s tribal communities.
Navajo Nation and Hopi Reservation are extreme food deserts with only 10 grocery stores on Navajo Nation to serve some 180,000 people and only one grocery store on Hopi Reservation to serve some 3,000 people. These communities also have high numbers of at-risk demographics, including elderly, diabetic, and cancer-afflicted individuals.
During these times of great need, several organizations are mobilizing to provide relief and resources for Native American communities and other affected groups. If you are able, please consider making a donation to the Navajo & Hopi Families COVID-19 Relief Fund or the United for Southern Arizona COVID-19 Fund.
In these difficult times, we believe the strength, kindness, and generosity of community can shine through. Thank you for considering the needs of our friends and neighbors on tribal lands and doing whatever you can to support them.
We're all in this together,

Friend, Martha McSally’s campaign is in real trouble in Arizona. Trying to avoid a repeat of her failed 2018 campaign, Martha McSally is turning to Trump to save her. GOP consultants and pundits are sounding the alarm -- McSally is going to lose.
Friend, we have the opportunity to defeat Martha McSally and end Mitch McConnell’s Senate Majority. Will you chip in $5 to replace McSally?

Now that she has to face the voters, she will do anything to get elected.
Mitch McConnell and his powerful allies are dumping millions into Arizona because they know she is in trouble.
They know that losing Arizona, could mean Democrats taking the Senate Majority.

"Tonight is the first debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden.
AZ Dems
Tonight is the first debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. We will be cheering on Joe Biden from Arizona.
This debate, no doubt, will have a major impact on the election. Joe Biden is in a great position to win, but we need to do everything we can to ensure a decisive win.
But remember, Arizona is still a toss-up. Without winning Arizona, Donald Trump has almost no path to the White House.
The Arizona Democratic Party needs to raise $20,184 before our major end-of-quarter fundraising deadline tomorrow to help Joe Biden secure a win in Arizona.
This is our final quarterly FEC fundraising deadline for this election. Will you RUSH $5 before the debate to help Joe Biden win Arizona?
Donate Now
Tonight will further show the American people who Trump truly is, a fraud and a crook.
Giving Trump another 4 years in the White House would be an unmitigated disaster for this country.
Joe Biden can win, but he needs to win Arizona to do it. We can’t let him down.
Have an impact on this year’s election. Can you RUSH $5 to help secure Democratic wins in Arizona?

"This is how we flip the Senate.
AZ Dems
Election forecasters across the country agree: if Democrats want to flip the Senate then we need to win in the “Core Four” key states -- North Carolina, Colorado, Maine, and Arizona.
That’s why all the “Core Four” State Democratic Parties have come together to make it easy for you to impact these important races, deliver the White House for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, and elect Democrats up and down the ticket!
Will you make a gift of $5 to help the Democratic Parties in Arizona, Colorado, Maine, and North Carolina build for victory and elect Democrats up and down the ticket?

After letting Trump off the impeachment hook, Susan Collins said she thought Trump “learned a pretty big lesson.” The only lesson Trump learned was that Mitch McConnell and his rubber stamps like Martha McSally, Cory Gardner, Thom Tillis, and Susan Collins will help him get away with anything!
There is simply no road to flipping the Senate that doesn’t include defeating these four Trump cronies. Your contribution is key to helping all four state Democratic Parties supply volunteers with the tools they need to talk with undecided voters, hire organizers, and build out the largest Get Out The Vote effort this country has ever seen.

"Visit our Black Lives Matter webpage for information on how you can get involved.
AZ Dems
Friend,
As our country continues to reel from the events of the past few weeks, the time for action has come. The time for talking and paying lip-service is over – the time has come to make real change happen.
The Democratic Party will not rest until we eradicate systemic racism from law enforcement and our communities. We will be unyielding in our demand for justice. Respecting law enforcement professionals while holding them accountable is the balance we must achieve. They are entrusted with our safety, but atrocities like the murder of George Floyd and Arizona’s Dion Johnson desecrate that ideal. The Arizona Democratic Party stands with our black brothers and sisters. We grieve with you, we hear you, and we fight for justice with you. Black Lives Matter.
In this fight for justice, the Arizona Democratic Party has published a new webpage with information and resources to help you get involved, get informed, and get active, including:
* Information on what police reforms must be implemented now
* Resources on what we can do right now to support the Black Lives Matter movement
* An extensive curriculum on the history of racism in the US
* A comprehensive list of African American Democratic Candidates in 2020
You can learn more by visiting: [[URL REDACTED]]
Together, we can create change, demand justice, and fight for an end to systemic racism in law enforcement and in our country.
In solidarity,
Felecia Rotellini

"Today marks the 155th anniversary of the day Union troops delivered federal orders freeing all previously enslaved people in Texas, the last Confederate state to have the Emancipation Proclamation ann
AZ Dems
Friend,
Today marks the 155th anniversary of the day Union troops delivered federal orders freeing all previously enslaved people in Texas, the last Confederate state to have the Emancipation Proclamation announced.
Juneteenth, as the holiday became known, is a time to honor and reflect on the history, independence, and resilience of the Black community in America.
Always an important holiday, this year, Juneteenth carries particular weight in light of national protests condemning police brutality and systemic racism. The murders of George Floyd, Dion Johnson, Breonna Taylor, and so many others are a stark reminder that the fight for Black lives, for justice, and for racial equality is far from over.
As we continue this centuries-long fight, we ask you to join us in supporting the NAACP, Black Lives Matter Action Fund, and the Southern Poverty Law Center. Your donation – whatever the amount – will help these vital organizations continue their work to end institutional oppression and achieve equality and justice for the Black community.
Click here to make a donation to support the NAACP, Black Lives Matter Action Fund, and the Southern Poverty Law Center. By default, your donation will be evenly split between the three groups, but you are welcome to change the allocation upon making a donation.

"Donald Trump has failed the American people in his response to COVID-19, but he refuses to take responsibility.
AZ Dems
Friend,
Donald Trump has failed the American people in his response to COVID-19, and he still refuses to take any responsibility whatsoever.
From the very beginning, he downplayed the severity of COVID-19 in an attempt to preserve his political standing and protect his reelection campaign. To put it bluntly, he put himself above the health and safety of the American people.
Now, we’re seeing how Trump’s lack of leadership, preparedness, and common sense caused a spiraling health crisis, an economic downturn, and skyrocketing unemployment. We cannot afford four more years of a president who governs with zero sensibility or accountability. It’s time for new leadership.
We’re working hard to block Trump from winning Arizona’s 11 electoral votes in November – we’ve expanded our digital program and are working on creative ways to reach, register, and turn out voters across the state.
But we cannot fund these efforts without your support. Will you donate whatever you can to help us continue this important work, so we can defeat Trump in November?

Friend, with the COVID-19 crisis looming over the country, it’s been tough to focus on fundraising.
But our job at the Arizona Democratic Party is to build a safer, fairer, more prosperous Arizona that works for everyone. And that work cannot slow down in times of crisis. In fact, it must ramp up, so that we can prioritize the issues facing hardworking families, like unemployment, lack of paid sick leave, and affordable healthcare.
We rely on our grassroots team to help us continue this important work today, tomorrow, and every day into the future. If you’re able, will you donate to our end-of-quarter goal, so we don’t miss a beat working to elect Democrats up and down the ballot who will fight for our families?

With your support, we can elect strong Democrats who will work to address the economic and social challenges facing Arizonans across the state. With your help, we can move Arizona forward and move past this crisis stronger and more unified than ever.

"Navajo Nation voters have the power to stop Trump from getting re-elected in November.
AZ Dems
Urgent: The National Journal just broke the story that Navajo Nation voters have the power to stop Trump from getting re-elected in November.
Rush a contribution here >>
Friend,
The National Journal just broke a story about Arizona Democrats working with Navajo Tribal members on a massive statewide field operation to turn out the voters we need to defeat Trump and flip the U.S. Senate.
The key point of the story?
If we are able to fire up our field operation and win in Arizona, Trump has no path to victory in the Electoral College.
We’re betting the sirens are going off at Trump HQ right about now. This is terrible for them, and they know they’ll have to dump even more money into Arizona to save Trump.
We’ve set a 24-hour rapid response goal to raise $5,000 to respond to the money they’re about to pour into Arizona. We can win here and block Trump from any of Arizona’s 11 electoral votes -- but only if you help us right now.
Contribute
The story The National Journal broke confirms what we’ve been saying the last several months: the road to the White House runs through Arizona. We’re a top battleground state, and Trump knows our 11 electoral votes are crucial to winning the presidential election.
This is our moment, friend.
This story is making the rounds and the momentum is ours to seize. Contribute right now to help us double down on the work we’re doing alongside Navajo Tribal members to turn out the vote in Arizona, so we can beat Trump and flip the Senate.
Thank you for whatever you can give!

No one should have to choose between risking their health and their right to vote. But Republicans are refusing to expand vote-by-mail because they know cheating is the only way they can win.
We need to ensure everyone has a safe way to cast their ballot. We need universal vote-by-mail.
We’ve set a goal of getting 1,000 signatures by 11:59 P.M. to show broad support for universal vote-by-mail. Add your name to support vote-by-mail in all 50 states >>
ADD YOUR NAME
Voting by mail is easy, secure, and safe. But Donald Trump's powerful GOP officials are trying to suppress voters by refusing to expand vote-by-mail. We can’t allow Donald Trump to steal another election.
Let’s protect our Democracy and make sure every voice is heard this November.
Fight back against voter suppression -- sign our petition and demand vote-by-mail be expanded to every state >>

"Trump is trying to undermine democracy by dismantling the Postal Service.
AZ Dems
Friend, Donald Trump is trying to steal this election.
In a blatant attempt to try and undermine the election, Trump and his allies are attacking the Postal Service. Without a fully-functioning Postal Service, millions of Americans will be disenfranchised, having no way to safely cast their ballot.
Trump’s attempts to dismantle the Postal Service is a direct threat to people’s right to vote!
Our democracy depends on the Postal Service. Donate $5 to elect Democrats who will defend the Postal Service >>

Democrats grilled Trump’s Postmaster pawn Louis DeJoy, as he had no way to defend the removal of mailboxes and sorting machines. If it weren’t for great Democrats in Congress, there would have been no one to hold his feet to the fire.
It’s clear, Trump and his allies are trying to sabotage this election.
We can’t let them get away with this. Donate $5 to STOP Donald Trump and save the Postal Service >>

"""Navajo [[URL REDACTED]] a potential gold mine of Democratic votes.""
AZ Dems
Friend,
Last week, the National Journal broke the news that Navajo Nation voters have the power to block Trump from winning Arizona’s 11 electoral votes and stop him from getting re-elected in November.
As the National Journal explains: “The 170,000-person Navajo Nation, which stretches across the northeast corner of Arizona and into New Mexico and Utah, is a potential gold mine of Democratic votes. But in order to harness that political advantage, the Democratic Party is getting started earlier than ever to boost turnout.”
We’re starting early because we have a lot of ground to cover – the Navajo Nation covers 17.5 million acres, most of that in Arizona.
We need grassroots support to ensure we have the funds and resources needed to carry out this MASSIVE field program across Navajo Nation.
Will you donate right now to support Arizona Democrats as we work alongside the Navajo Nation to connect with and register voters?

Donate
Friend,
This week, the Trump administration released its 2021 budget plan, which includes drastic cuts to critical programs that millions of Arizonans rely on. The plan proposes cuts for the Children’s Health Insurance Program, superfund site cleanup, student loan forgiveness, and more.
Here’s a breakdown of his proposed budget:
* Cuts at least $700 billion from Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program. Arizona’s state Medicaid program, AHCCCS, covers 3 in 5 Arizona nursing home residents and 2 in 5 kids. Medicaid is also a “significant funding source for the Indian health system, covering more than one-in-four patients.”
* Cuts “$465 billion from Medicare providers.”
* Cuts $170 billion from student loan forgiveness programs, part of 8% being cut from the Department of Education.
* Cuts 9% from the Department of Health and Human Services, including from the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control.
* Cuts 13% from the Department of Interior’s budget. In Arizona, the Department of Interior “manage[s] and conserve[s] 12.2 million acres of public land and 17.5 million subsurface acres,” across the state.
* Cuts $113 million from the Superfund hazardous waste cleanup program, part of a $2.4 billion proposed cut from the Environmental Protection Agency. There are over a dozen Superfund sites in Arizona, including six sites that are at risk of being made worse by wildfires and flooding stemming from the climate crisis.
Trump’s disastrous budget plan is just the latest reminder that we need to elect bold Democrats up and down the ballot who will fight to protect the programs that benefit Arizonans and our land.
Will you chip in to help us elect Democrats who will advocate for our shared values and be a bold voice for Arizonans?

Trump’s proposed cuts would have disastrous effects on our families and our land. Arizonans deserve more -- that’s why we’re fighting to elect new representation in November. Thanks for donating whatever you can to support our efforts.

"On Sunday, we heard both Democratic candidates discuss their visions. It is clearer to me than ever before that Americans deserve a President they can trust; who understands the challenges facing work
AZ Dems
Friend,
On Sunday night, we heard both Democratic candidates discuss their visions. It is clearer to me than ever before that Americans deserve a President they can trust; who understands the challenges facing working families and who will address these problems and crises with responsibility, competence, and compassion.
Both candidates have a wealth of experience and understand that rhetoric and false promises of the current administration will not calm American’s fears nor fix the economic fallout that the coronavirus crisis has caused. While we watched robust debate and disagreements on how to turn this country around, we also saw Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders unified on the values important to all Arizonans and Americans.
Democrats won in 2018 and will win again in 2020 because Arizona voters are voting for leaders who will fight for our values, true American values – affordable, quality healthcare, public education, Social Security, the protection of our environment and smart immigration reform. Both of the candidates spoke to those values on Sunday.
The truth is, our rights and freedoms have never been more in jeopardy in the United States than they are today. We, in Arizona, have already lived through this threat in our most recent history. Just ten years ago, we were already experiencing the politics of Trump, the economic and emotional fallout of fear-mongering and hate speech. We emerged from those days with a resolve to reject the politics of divisiveness and to reclaim our western independence – where we elect leaders who will put people first and values like integrity and inclusion matter.
Our late senior Senator John McCain opposed this President on principle – that is the spirit of Arizonans – whether you are a Democrat, a disenchanted Republican, or an Independent, we will vote with the courage to preserve this country and the institutions that already make it great.
Based upon the performance of these leaders, I am certain that the road to the White House runs straight through our state, and Arizona’s electoral votes will ultimately go to the Democratic Nominee. The Arizona Democratic Party is dedicated, with relentless determination and resolve, to remove our greatest existential threat to our democracy and our constitution, Donald Trump, in November.
Together in the fight,

"Donald Trump is campaigning in Arizona today.
AZ Dems
We have bad news.
Donald Trump is making two campaign stops here in Arizona today. This is Trump’s 7th visit to the Copper State this year. The Trump campaign knows he can’t win the White House without winning Arizona.
Trump’s visit could boost Republican turnout in Arizona, so we have to fight back. We still need to raise $14,671 before midnight to hit our goal.
Don’t let Trump take Arizona. Can you donate $1 to help STOP Trump in Arizona?

Losing ground in the midwest, Donald Trump and the Republicans are desperate to win Arizona.
The race here is still extremely close. It will come down to turnout. If we turn out Democrats as we did in 2018, Trump is done for.
We can’t leave anything on the table.
We don’t have time to waste. The election is happening right now. Can you donate $1 to help us defeat Republicans in Arizona during this final stretch?

AZ Dems
Team,
One month ago, the Trump Administration promised there would be 27 million coronavirus tests available by the end of March. Arizonans are still waiting for those tests, and the number of confirmed COVID-19 deaths continues to rise.
President Trump: Where are the tests?
From the very beginning, Trump has failed the American people in his response to COVID-19. Now, despite having insufficient testing, Trump is growing increasingly eager to re-open the country – a move that could jeopardize the health of millions of Arizonans.
Arizonans cannot afford four more years of Trump’s leadership – or rather, lack of leadership. It’s time for Democrats to band together to stop Trump from winning Arizona’s 11 electoral votes in November.
Will you donate whatever you can to help us carry out the important work needed to defeat Trump and turn Arizona blue?
Donate Now
The fallout from the health crisis will last for months, potentially years. Let’s make sure we have a leader we trust guiding us through these challenging times.

Friend,
We want to send a big thank you to everyone who generously contributed to the Arizona Democratic Party last month.
Your gift does not go unnoticed. And your donation, when added to the donations received from thousands of others just like you, is working toward a monumental moment in November for both Arizona and for the country.
Thanks to your support, we’re on track to turn Arizona blue, flip one or both state legislative chambers, flip our U.S. Senate seat, and take back the U.S. Senate majority for Democrats.
This is a big year for Arizona, and there’s so much riding on our progress over the next few months. But together, we know we can be successful.
Thanks for being on this team.

Elections expert Nate Silver, just said Arizona could be the tipping-point state that determines the White House.
With the race tightening in states like Pennsylvania and Florida, it is CRITICAL that Biden wins here in Arizona.

Arizona could be the tipping-point state in this election. Can you chip in $5 to make sure our Democrat Joe Biden wins in Arizona?
Donate Now
The Affordable Care Act, Social Security, and the Post Office are all at risk in this election. And remember whoever wins the White House will appoint two to three new Supreme Court Justices.
All the progress we’ve made could be wiped out if Donald Trump appoints two new Justices to the Supreme Court.
We have to stop Trump from getting a second term.
Losing in Arizona could mean four more years of Donald Trump. We can’t allow that to happen. Will you chip in $5 to protect Democrat Joe Biden’s narrow lead in Arizona?

"They just announced that AZ-06 is one of their ""2020 offensive battlefield"" districts.
AZ Dems
Friend,
The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) just announced that AZ-06 is one of their “2020 offensive battlefield” districts.
This means defeating Rep. Dave Schweikert is a national priority and paramount to Democrats’ strategy to solidify and grow our House majority.
Will you chip in $15 right now to help us flip this seat, so we can expand our Democratic majority?
Donate
For more than a year, Schweikert has been busy battling an ethics investigation, which has put a national spotlight on his corruption and placed him in a vulnerable position. Now, Democrats have an opportunity to unseat the five-term incumbent and instead elect a representative that will fight to move Arizona and the country forward.
We need 500 grassroots supporters to chip in right now to help us build and execute a solid strategy to defeat Schweikert -- can we count on you?
Thank you,

Team,
Recently, I joined Dr. Jill Biden and Gabriella Cascone, Joe Biden’s national training director, for a virtual organizing event where we trained hundreds of grassroots activists on how to call and text their friends, neighbors and Arizonans across the state so we can get out the vote in November!

We’ve never seen this kind of excitement to flip the state for a presidential election, ever. Now, thanks to this high level of engagement, we’re on the right path to turn Arizona blue.
But in order to succeed and deliver Arizona’s 11 electoral votes to Joe Biden, our organizers need the technical resources to connect with voters in the coming months.
Can you, please, donate $10, $25, $50, or whatever you can afford, so we can expand our digital organizing program and take back the White House in November?
Donate Now
We understand that times are tough right now, but any amount you can give will help us end the Trump presidency for good. We can do this, together.
Thank you,

"Arizona is 1 of only 4 seats Democrats need to take back the U.S. Senate.
AZ Dems
Friend,
Democrats need just FOUR seats to take back the U.S. Senate from Mitch McConnell and Republicans.
And Arizona holds one of those seats.
The good news is Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight shows that our U.S. Senate seat CAN turn blue in November.
The bad news is Republicans are spending millions of dollars in a desperate attempt to hold on to power in Arizona and keep the U.S. Senate majority.
There’s no question that Arizona’s seat is KEY to flipping the U.S. Senate for Democrats. But we’re up against a massive GOP war chest, and we need every grassroots donor on this team to step up today.
Will you donate $5 or whatever you can to help Democrats take back the U.S. Senate, so they can pass legislation that advances health care, gun safety reform, criminal justice reform, climate action, and more?
Donate Now
A win in Arizona is a win for Americans across the country.

These ads will run in crucial battleground counties like Maricopa. If Democrats win Arizona, Donald Trump has less than a 2% chance of winning the election.

"Trump's economy only works for the wealthy and big corporations. Everyday people have been left out, including Arizonans Trump promised to help, but has since forgotten.
AZ Dems
Friend,
For the past three years, Trump has been molding an economy that works only for the extremely wealthy and big corporations.
Meanwhile, everyday people have been left out, including Arizonans who Trump promised to help, but has since forgotten. Just look at what’s happening in Arizona and across the country:
* Arizona is in the midst of an affordable housing crisis -- we’re ranked #3 in the country for the most severe affordable-housing shortage.
* The typical US worker can no longer afford to have a family on a year's salary -- they’re behind on “homeownership, lagging in retirement savings, and have debt to pay off.”
* Farm bankruptcies are up 20% last year to the most since 2011, driven by Trump’s failed trade policy.
It’s time to stand up and elect representatives who will fight for everyday Arizonans -- not just the wealthiest few and large corporations.
Will you support our work to elect Democrats up and down the ballot who will put everyday families first? We need 500 grassroots donors to make a contribution today to fuel our mission.

"Republican senators are trying to place limits on our Independent Redistricting Commission -- we can't let this continue.
AZ Dems
Friend,
Last week, Republican state senators voted to ""limit the leeway of the Independent Redistricting Commission to draw legislative boundaries despite claims it could illegally harm the ability of minorities to elect lawmakers of their choice.""
Essentially, Republican senators are working to undermine the very laws and committees put in place to avoid this type of voter suppression and partisan influence in redistricting.
For the measure to pass, Republicans would need a final Senate roll-call and approval from the House, a likely scenario given the State Legislature is Republican-controlled.
Situations like this are a reminder of why it’s so important to elect leaders at every level of government who will fight for the issues and values that are important to you. That’s why we’re working hard to flip the State Legislature in November.
Can you rush a $15 donation right now to help us elect Democrats to the State Legislature who will work to defend our democracy?

Friend,
Over the past few weeks, Arizona Democratic Party Chair Felecia Rotellini has been traveling across the state speaking with energized voters ahead of the 2020 election year.
She visited with voters and tribal leaders at the Navajo Nation and discussed Arizona Democrats’ commitment to the issues that impact the Navajo Nation. She later met with Democrats in Ajo, Arizona to talk about the importance of voter protection and defending health care coverage for Arizonans with pre-existing conditions. And, she spoke with voters in Pebble Creek about the path to victory for Democrats in 2020.
Felecia Rotellini meets with Democrats in Ajo, Arizona

Felecia’s state tour highlights the need to connect with voters in every corner of the state, as the path to victory runs through our small towns and most rural communities. It will take all of us working together to elect leaders that will fight for Arizonans and work to protect our state values.
Your support is what allows us to reach voters throughout the state. And today, we need 1,000 grassroots donors to make a donation to help us continue our work on the ground so we can elect Democrats up and down the ballot. Can we count on you?

As Felecia reflected on her travel throughout Arizona, she said: “I’m hearing from folks who are exhausted by the divisiveness coming out of Washington. We’re providing a strong alternative. Our party’s message is simple and it isn’t about partisanship: We want Washington and our state legislature to start working for the people. To make that happen, we’re going to elect leaders with integrity who will fight for every Arizonan.”
To elect leaders with integrity, we need to continue our work on the ground. And that work can’t happen without your support. So please click here to make a secure contribution to help us turn Arizona blue and elect leaders who will fight for every Arizonan.
Together we can win,

I know this is a strange time for all of us, and many people are worried about paying their next bill, juggling work and kids at home, and – of course – staying healthy. I want you to know that the Arizona Democratic Party is here for you, we are thinking of you, and we want to hear your struggles, concerns, and reactions to the pandemic.

As we continue to navigate this crisis, we must remember that we are not alone in our challenges – our state, our country, and much of the world is living through this unprecedented situation together.
This is a time, perhaps unlike any in recent history, where the words “we’re all in this together” ring remarkably true. So let’s remember to uplift each other during these difficult times, be kind to one another, and work together to move past this.
At the Arizona Democratic Party, we will continue to do our part by advocating for the hardworking families across the state who are fighting for a chance at healthy, happy, and fulfilling lives. Even if we have to do that work from home, through video calls and over the phone.

"When they go low, we go high.
AZ Dems
Friend,
I am a big fan of Game Of Thrones. The episode with Cersei’s walk of shame is an actual classic. Regardless of her ultimate demise (spoiler alert), I’m not quite sure the “shame” reference is the right graffiti choice for our office.
The day after the impeachment vote, ADP staff was greeted by the word “shame” poorly written on the front of our office space. Arizona Democratic staffers are not novices when it comes to being harassed and we will not be intimidated by a little graffiti— especially when the graffiti is commandeered from a beloved tv show.
Everyday, the dedicated staff here at the party show up and work hard to elect Democrats that will fight for affordable healthcare, good jobs, and equality for all. No staffer should have to show up to an office with graffiti tagged on their walls. Period.
When they go low, we go high. That’s why we at the party are staying focused on our objectives. We have washed the graffiti, continued to do our jobs, and will never stoop to these new lows that Republicans are currently willing to resort too.
Will you consider rushing a contribution to the party today to show your support for Democrats, the staff, and general civility?
I don’t know about you, but I’m not intimidated by a little graffiti— especially when it’s plagiarized. As always, we at the party appreciate your help and your unwavering support. Let’s show these lazy graffiti artists that we are better than this.

"McSally has repeatedly voted to increase health care costs and gut protections for Arizonans with pre-existing conditions.
AZ Dems
Friend,
A look at unelected Sen. Martha McSally’s health care positions and actions over the years reveals that McSally’s entire political career has been focused on increasing health care costs and gutting protections for Arizonans with pre-existing conditions.
**We urgently need your help to defeat McSally in November, so we can end her anti-health care crusade before she can cause further damage to Arizonans. Click here to donate.**
McSally on Health Care: A Timeline
2012 – During McSally’s first run for Congress, she emphatically ran on repealing the ACA, including its consumer protections.
2014 – McSally again ran against the ACA and its consumer protections during her House run, and she soon got to work voting to increase Arizonans’ premiums.
2015 – During her first year in Congress, McSally voted “Aye” on H.R. 596, a bill to fully gut protections for Arizonans with pre-existing conditions and tear down the ACA, without a replacement.
2016 – McSally twice voted in support of H.R. 3762, a measure that would have led to “higher average premiums,” left 22 million more Americans uninsured after 2017, and threatened coverage for more than 400,000 Arizonans covered under AHCCCS.
2017 – McSally infamously said, “Let’s get this f*cking thing done,” then voted “Aye” on H.R. 1628, the AHCA repeal plan which would have spiked premiums, gut protections for nearly 2.8 million Arizonans with pre-existing conditions, and imposed an “age tax.”
2018 – McSally complained she was “getting [her] ass kicked” over her votes to increase health care costs and gut coverage.
2019 – McSally voted to protect an expansion of “junk” insurance plans that the AARP opposed because they let insurance companies “deny coverage to people with preexisting conditions […] and impose an age tax” for older Americans.
McSally has sold out her constituents time and time again. She’s demonstrated that she’ll stick by her health insurance company and Big Pharma backers, no matter the cost to Arizonans. Enough is enough.
We need your help to defeat McSally this November – Will you donate $15 or whatever you can to our Defeat McSally Fund, so we can defeat McSally, flip the Senate, and elect health care activists to the U.S. Senate?
Defeat McSally Fund
Arizonans are fed up with McSally’s toxic anti-health care agenda. Let’s send her packing in November.

"Issues on the agenda include education, infrastructure, water supply, criminal justice reform, and more.
AZ Dems
Friend,
The 2020 Arizona Legislative Session kicked off on Monday and will run through April 25. Throughout the session, state legislators will discuss a variety of issues including education, infrastructure, water supply, criminal justice reform, and more. Proceedings may be watched via the live webcast at [[URL REDACTED]]
With so many critical issues up for discussion this session, we’re reminded of the importance of electing strong leaders at every level of government who will fight for what YOU value most.
Republicans currently control the state legislature, but in November, we have a chance to change that. Our friends at the Arizona Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee are working to elect Democrats to the State House and State Senate. ADLCC recruits and trains candidates for legislative office, and equips their campaigns with the infrastructure and resources needed to win.
The GOP is desperate to keep control of the legislature, and they’re fighting harder than ever, especially as they watch Democrats gain momentum in races across the state. Will you chip in to help us support the work of ADLCC and the Democratic party, as we work to flip the state legislature?
Contribute
With your help, we can flip the State House and elect Democrats who will fight for Arizona families, teachers, students, union workers, farmers, and the most marginalized among us.

Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight says Democrats CAN turn Arizona blue and defeat Trump.

"Vice President Biden's campaign announced a second round of staff hires in Arizona as Democrats ramp up efforts to flip Arizona blue in November.
AZ Dems
Friend,
Vice President Biden’s campaign announced a second round of staff hires in Arizona as Democrats ramp up efforts to flip Arizona blue in November.
The news comes as Republicans grow increasingly nervous about the possibility of Arizonans delivering their 11 electoral votes to the Democratic presidential candidate for the first time since 1996.
While Democratic momentum is at an all-time high, we still have a massive amount of work to do to turn Arizona blue. We have to register thousands of voters, expand our digital advertising, and train hundreds of volunteers.
Will you chip in $15 or whatever you can to help us bring the blue wave to Arizona?

Democrats are investing in Arizona like never before because 2020 IS the year Arizona turns blue.

The Hill: Biden leads Trump, Kelly tops McSally in Arizona: Poll
Friend,
A new poll shows that Joe Biden is leading Donald Trump in Arizona while Mark Kelly has the lead on unelected Sen. Martha McSally.
Arizona is the top swing state in the country, so this is HUGE news for Democrats working to defeat Trump and flip the U.S. Senate. But the national spotlight on Arizona means Republicans are focusing their time, attention, and money on our state.
We need your support to go toe-to-toe with the GOP’s massive war chest. Will you donate $15 right now to ensure we have the resources we need to defeat Republicans?
Donate Now
With just three months to go until the election, we can’t afford to slow down now.
Thank you for donating whatever you can to keep our voter registration efforts, field teams, and digital programs well-funded so we can turn Arizona blue.
Let’s do this,

"Republicans are spending millions in Arizona because they're terrified that Democrats will flip our U.S. Senate seat blue and break Mitch McConnell's iron grip on the U.S. Senate majority.

We’re still $3,485 away from our April fundraising goal – can you help?
Donate before midnight tonight and your gift will be matched!

April has been a difficult month for everyone, including our team at the Arizona Democratic Party. It’s been tough continuing to fundraise during this time, but we must press forward so that we are on the best footing headed into the November election. Good leadership is needed now more than ever, and it’s important to take the long view, in addition to focusing on the challenges we face today.
Our work is especially important given that Arizona is a TOP battleground state – Republicans are spending millions here because they’re terrified that Democrats will flip our U.S. Senate seat blue and break Mitch McConnell’s iron grip on the U.S. Senate majority. Republicans also know that Democrats have the ability to stop Trump from winning our 11 electoral votes – but only if we remain focused and have the resources to take on the GOP’s massive war chest.
With so much at stake, can you donate before midnight tonight to see your donation go twice as far in electing Democrats up and down the ballot?
Thank you,

"Andy Biggs' homophobic vote proves that he doesn't have the best interest of Arizona at heart.
AZ Dems
Team,
This week, Congress passed the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, an aid package designed to mitigate the social and economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic. The Act expands on Medicaid and unemployment benefits, orders free coronavirus testing, and mandates paid sick leave and childcare for certain employees.
Shockingly, Arizona Representative Andy Biggs voted AGAINST this legislation. Why? Because it includes provisions for same-sex couples.
As GLAAD Chief Communications Officer Rich Ferraro told Newsweek, ""Representative Biggs' constituents, his wife Cindy Biggs, and their family should be ashamed and angry that during a national crisis when Americans are coming together, Representative Biggs is busy continuing his long campaign to harm LGBTQ families and also using his unethical relationships with anti-LGBTQ hate groups like the Family Research Council to inaccurately claim this relief bill would 'redefine family.'""
We need to make our voices heard and tell Andy Biggs that Arizonans deserve leaders who will fight for the health, safety, and equality of ALL Arizonans. Will you stand with Arizona Democrats and the LGBTQ community in denouncing Biggs’ vote?
Sign the petition
Biggs’ homophobic stance does not align with Arizona’s values of equality and inclusion. Let’s make sure he knows it.
Together,
Arizona Democrats

Donald Trump is coming back to Arizona on Wednesday.
Desperate to win Arizona, this will be Trump’s 8th visit to Arizona this year. He knows he can’t win the White House without winning Arizona. That is why Mike Pence, Ivanka Trump, and Donald Trump himself have all visited Arizona in recent weeks.

Friend,
Today, the Republican Senate acquitted Donald Trump.
We’re disappointed – but not surprised – that all but one of the Senate Republicans failed in their responsibility to be impartial jurors, to uphold the Constitution, and to hold Trump accountable for his abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.
Now, the responsibility falls on the American people to hold Trump accountable at the ballot box in November. And here at the Arizona Democratic Party, we intend to do our part by ensuring Arizona’s 11 electoral votes go to our Democratic nominee for President.
We need to raise $10,000 by the end of the week to support increased fieldwork and advertising to help us elect Democrats across the state, flip the Senate, and turn Arizona blue. Will you chip in right now?

"While Arizona Democratic members of Congress continue to advocate for greater funding for tribal governments, Donald Trump and GOP leaders continue to fight against life-saving relief.
AZ Dems
Friend,
Over the last month, Navajo Nation has become the epicenter for coronavirus cases in the United States, with a higher infection rate than New York City.
While Arizona Democratic members of Congress continue to advocate for greater funding for tribal governments, Donald Trump and GOP leaders continue to fight against life-saving relief.
Recently, The Trump administration was sued by a tribal nation for giving funds to corporations that were originally intended for tribal governments. This funding is critical for saving lives in these communities that are affected the most by COVID-19.
While the Navajo Nation continues to see mortality rates increase in Arizona, Donald Trump continues to lack presidential leadership during the coronavirus crisis. Right now, the Arizona Democratic Party is organizing the largest Get Out The Vote operation in the state’s history so that Navajo Nation and all Arizona voters can make their voices heard, but we can’t do this without your grassroots support.
During these challenging times, we rely on your generous support to help us uplift and empower Native voices. Will you chip in $15 or whatever you can to ensure Arizona’s tribal nations are heard this November?
Donate Now
This election matters more than ever for Arizona tribal communities, and with your support we can flip Arizona blue and elect leaders who will do the right thing.

Friend,
There’s a lot at stake this November and Arizona is at the center of it all.
The country is counting on Arizona to block Trump from winning our 11 electoral votes, so we can elect Joe Biden. And they’re counting on Arizona to flip our U.S. Senate seat blue, so we take back Senate control for Democrats.
The reality is, Arizona Democrats can’t afford to slow down now. We need  every member of this team to step up and help us bring the blue wave to Arizona.
Will you chip in $15 or whatever you can to help us register voters and build the infrastructure we need to turn Arizona blue?

"We're working hard to make sure this is the last State of the Union address from Donald Trump.
AZ Dems
Friend,
To anyone watching, it’s clear that Washington is deeply broken — and Arizonans are tired of it. Drug companies continue to increase prices without consequences, erratic trade policies are hurting our farmers, hardworking families are struggling to get ahead, and our planet is in the midst of a climate crisis. And in Washington, Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress like Martha McSally are working overtime for their corporate interest backers, while hardworking Arizonans are left behind.
Republicans have spent the past three years driving up health care costs and gifting tax cuts to big corporations and billionaires. Now they’re pushing AHCCCS caps and floating deep cuts to Social Security and Medicare.
Enough with the broken promises: In 2020, we will elect leaders who will put Arizonans first by fighting for our values, expanding health care access, taking on prescription drug companies, investing in our public schools, and strengthening hard-earned benefits like Social Security and Medicare. We will ensure that the major issues facing our state are addressed by leaders with integrity and common-sense solutions.
The path to victory runs through Arizona in 2020, and we are working hard to make sure this is the last State of the Union address from Donald Trump.
You can support our work and help us defeat Donald Trump by making a donation here.
Together in the fight,

"Donald Trump is campaigning in Arizona today.
AZ Dems
This election is close.
With the Trump campaign struggling in the midwest, they have gone all-in trying to win crucial battleground states like Arizona and Colorado. Without winning Arizona and Colorado, Trump has virtually no path to reelection, and the most recent polling from A+ polling company Monmouth has Biden up only 2 points in Arizona.
That is why today, we are teaming up with the Colorado Democratic Party to help win in the West this November. Winning the White House and the Senate runs through the west, and winning both in Colorado and Arizona will have so many positive impacts on the things we care about. We share a border and a common purpose to protect our public lands and tackle climate change.
Our goal is to raise $5,000 by tomorrow to help defeat Trump in crucial battleground states. Will you split a donation between the Colorado Democratic Party and the Arizona Democratic Party?
Donate Now
Trump and Republican super PACs are shelling out millions trying to rescue his failing campaign. Trump is desperate to win both Colorado and Arizona and is flooding the airwaves with negative ads.
We have to do everything we can to stop Trump in these battleground states. Together, we can defeat Trump and end this nightmare of a Presidency.
People have already started voting in Arizona and Colorado. We don’t have any time to waste. So please will you split a $25 donation between the Colorado Democratic Party and the Arizona Democratic Party to help us reach our goal?

Friend,
Happy Pride Month!
‪In celebration of Pride Month, the Arizona Democratic Party continues to recognize the progress, invaluable contributions, and rich history of the LGBTQ+ community – including the people of color who have been at the forefront of this movement.
While we continue the fight towards equality, we must demand action and change from those who are standing in the way of progress.
Last year, the House passed the Equality Act, which would end discrimination based on sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity. However, as with many essential and widely supported bills, Mitch McConnell tossed the Equality Act into his Senate Graveyard, refusing to bring it to a vote in the Senate.
In honor of Pride Month and in support of the LGBTQ+ community, we’re calling on Mitch McConnell to (finally) bring the Equality Act to a vote. Add your name now and help us reach our goal of 5,000 signatures.
Add my name »
Thank you for taking a stand.

Trump Awakening The 'Sleeping Giant' Of Latino Voter Engagement In Arizona
Friend,
Trump has promised to win Arizona in a “landslide,” but this is just another promise he likely can’t keep.
According to the HuffPost, Democrats and other Trump critics say the midterm election “energy has not subsided, and this November will see them deliver Arizona and its 11 electoral votes to the Democratic nominee for the first time since 1996.”
Fueling that energy is Arizona’s Latinx population, a group that “historically has not registered or turned out in numbers proportionate to its population.” But since Trump began seeking the White House, “Latinos have become more active voters, while the suburbs of major cities have started to swing more Democratic.”
We’re working hard to ensure every voice is heard at the polls, including Latinx, Native American, and youth populations. Because only by working together can we elect leaders who will fight for all of us.
Will you donate $15 to help us organize and register Democrats throughout the state, so we can turn Arizona blue, flip the Senate, and get to work making Arizona a better place to live?

Friend,
Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight shows that Arizona Democrats CAN flip our U.S. Senate seat blue and stop Trump from winning Arizona’s 11 electoral votes.
This is huge news for Democrats – but now Republicans are feeling threatened, and they’re pouring MILLIONS of dollars into Arizona. Trump, McConnell, and their GOP cronies are desperate to keep their hold on the U.S. Senate and presidency, and they’ll do whatever it takes to stop Democrats’ momentum.
We can’t afford to let up now, not when so much is riding on Arizona this election. We need 500 donors to step up before midnight tonight to help us turn Arizona blue, flip the U.S. Senate, and defeat Trump. Can we count on you?

The GOP war chest is growing larger each day, and we have to keep up if we want to be successful in November.

Hi Friend,
Earlier this week, Trump ended his isolation with a trip to Arizona because Trump can’t win without Arizona.
We’re doubling down on our strategy to flip our state blue because a strong Democratic turnout in Arizona will be a victory for the entire country in November.
That’s why we need to build a massive grassroots movement to register thousands of voters and spread our message across the state.
With your help we can turn Arizona blue, defeat Donald Trump and flip the U.S. Senate. Can we count on you to make a grassroots donation of whatever you can afford today?

It’s going to take every single one of us, standing up for what we believe and doing what we can, to win the single most important election of our lifetimes.
Think about what’s at stake; our climate, our jobs, our lives. We can’t afford to sit this one out.
We know times are tough, but if you’re able, will you consider making a donation of $15 or whatever you can?

* Standing up for Medicare and Social Security
* Fighting for a great public education system, so every kid has a fair shake at the American dream
* Working towards Smart Immigration Reform and giving DACA recipients a pathway to citizenship
* Protecting our environment

Team,
Martha McSally isn’t the only one sabotaging the health of Arizonans.

AZ Dems
Team,
The Republican National Committee announced they raised a record-breaking $86 million in February for Trump’s reelection campaign.
This massive war chest will be used to advance an extremist, far-right agenda that has been deadset on chipping away at our ability to achieve the American Dream. For Arizona’s working families, the possibility of having a good job, good schools, and good health care is becoming increasingly more difficult.
With Arizona being one of the top battleground states in the country, we know that Republicans will focus a large chunk of that money on our state. So we need to show the GOP money machine that their big donor support has nothing on our grassroots power.

Our mission is to make sure all hard-working Arizonans have a real chance at building a better life for their families. And that starts with blocking Trump from winning Arizona’s 11 electoral votes.

REMEMBER THIS?

Most of us remember looking at FiveThirtyEight’s 2016 election map and feeling pretty confident Trump would be defeated.
This is why we can’t take anything for granted. Even when polls and FiveThirtyEight show Joe Biden winning.
Trump can’t win the White House without winning Arizona. We need to raise $10,000 by tomorrow to help defeat Trump in AZ. Can we count on you to donate $5 immediately to help beat Trump?

People are already voting in Arizona. If we let up now, Trump could pull into the lead here.
We have to leave it all on the field. America can't afford a repeat of 2016.
Democrats have a narrow lead here, but Mike Pence was just here trying to give the Trump campaign a boost. Republicans are putting everything they have into winning Arizona.
We have to finish strong these last few weeks. Will you donate $5 to help Democrats win Arizona?

"This is not the first time Democrats have been targeted for standing up for our values.
AZ Dems
Friend,
Yesterday morning, my colleagues and I arrived to work to find that the Arizona Democratic Party headquarters had been vandalized overnight – “SHAME!” was scrawled in bright red letters on the wall next to our entrance.
Picture of graffiti outside ADP HQ
We do not yet know who did this. What we do know is that this is not the first time Democrats have been targeted for our values.
But despite instances such as yesterday’s, we remain proud of our party’s commitment to upholding the Constitution, and we’re not ashamed to be fighting for better wages, lower prescription drug costs, and affordable health care for every Arizonan.
We will not allow cowardly attacks to hinder our mission. We will continue to fight each day for the hardworking families in our great state, and we will continue to advocate for the issues that will help move Arizona forward.
You can stand with us by making a contribution to support the Arizona Democratic Party today. Your contribution – whatever the amount – will send a message to detractors that we will not falter in the face of intimidation.

Friend,
Political experts agree: Flipping Arizona blue is the KEY to gaining a Democratic majority in the U.S. Senate and defeating Donald Trump.
But to be successful, Arizona Democrats need to stay on track with every single fundraising deadline leading up to the election in November.
Our next deadline hits Wednesday at midnight, and the truth is, we’re not where we need to be. Luckily, we have a chance to catch up thanks to a special donor match opportunity.
Chip in right now and your donation will be MATCHED to help us close the gap on our critical fundraising goal.

"She also has a ""Not Qualified"" rating from the American Bar Association.
AZ Dems
Friend,
Last week, McSally voted to give a lifetime judicial appointment to Missouri attorney Sarah Pitlyk despite bipartisan opposition to Pitlyk’s nomination on the basis of her anti-health care record and her “Not Qualified” rating from the American Bar Association.
Here’s a quick summary of Pitlyk’s anti-health care record:
* Supports striking down health care coverage protections for pre-existing conditions
* Supports rigid restrictions on women’s health care access
* Opposes fertility treatments and surrogacy
McSally’s vote is just the latest proof point that she’ll always choose her party and special interest backers instead of Arizonans.
We can put an end to McSally’s destructive voting record by defeating her once and for all. Donate right now to help us say NO to McSally in 2020.

Friend, did you watch the opening night of the convention last night?
The Democratic National Convention kicked off with many of our top progressive leaders talking about their vision for getting our country back on track after November. We’re feeling more fired up than ever about taking back the White House and the Senate -- and what we can do once we make those progressive gains.
We know how important it is to beat Donald Trump, but if we don’t take back the Senate, Mitch McConnell will continue to derail and obstruct Democratic progress for years to come.
If you’re fired up too, will you donate $15 to help us elect Joe Biden in Arizona?
We are one of the biggest battleground states in the entire country, and we have one of the top senate pickup opportunities.
With National Republicans spending millions to keep Arizona red, the road to November won’t be easy. But momentum is on our side right now, and we’ve got a real shot.

Hi Friend,
With everything going on today, it’s easy to ignore politics while we deal with the many challenges impacting our day-to-day lives.
But the issues that have come to the surface amid the pandemic – from healthcare to unemployment to voter suppression – are exactly why we have to stay focused on the upcoming election.
New leadership is well overdue. And in November, we have a real chance to flip the state legislature, flip our U.S. Senate seat, and block Trump from winning our 11 electoral votes.
But we can only be successful if we stay on track with our fundraising goals. Right now, we have our mid-month goal coming up and we’re still $5,281 away from where we need to be. Will you chip in $15 or whatever you can to help us close the gap?

AZ Dems
Hi Friend,
After months of failing to lead on COVID-19, Trump is planning to return to Arizona following a week of condemnation for ordering the tear-gassing of peaceful protesters so he could have a photo-op.
The reason for his upcoming visit? To check on his border wall near Yuma, Arizona.
That’s right. In the midst of a global pandemic, record unemployment, and mass outrage over systemic racism in law enforcement and in our country, Trump’s priority is the construction of his border wall.
Trump’s visit – which comes as COVID-19 cases are rising in Yuma – is the latest stark reminder that he has repeatedly failed Arizonans and our country, creating more crises and solving none of the problems he promised to fix.
This November, Arizonans have the power to stop Trump from winning a second term, but only if we have the resources we need to reach, register, and turn out every Democratic voter in the state.
Will you donate $15 or whatever you can to support our organizing efforts, so we can turn Arizona blue and block Trump from winning Arizona’s 11 electoral votes? We need 100 people to step up by midnight tonight.

Another quarter is in the books, and thanks to the support of this incredible grassroots team, we hit our quarterly fundraising goal.
This achievement is particularly notable considering the unprecedented challenges our state and country have faced over these past few months. Clearly, Arizonans are ready for change – and we stand ready to help bring about that change.
Thank you for all of your help up to this point, and for all of your dedication and passion moving forward. Your commitment to building a better future for all Arizonans is appreciated – and needed – more than ever before.
Stay safe,
Arizona Democrats

Earlier today, we asked our grassroots supporters to help fund our Get Out The Vote radio ads.
But unfortunately, we are still $26,823 from hitting our goal.
These ads will be in English, Spanish, and Navajo. So please, can you donate $5 to help get our ads on the air?

Polls that survey likely voters have Biden up by ONE or TWO points in Arizona. But when polls survey registered voters, that lead grows. That means, if we can increase turnout, Joe Biden will CRUSH Donald Trump in Arizona.
But the other side is working hard to stop Democrats from winning Arizona. Trump was just in Prescott and Tucson trying to rally Republican support.
We can’t let Republicans pull ahead in the final weeks of the election.
These Get Out The Vote ads are the most effective we can do at this point in the election. So we are asking, can you donate $5 to fund our radio ads?

AZ Dems
Yesterday, while holding a rally in Arizona, Trump:
* Lied about Democrat Joe Biden’s tax plan
* Downplayed the COVID-19 pandemic
* Described blatant extortion in a hypothetical call with the CEO of Exxon
The Trump Presidency has been a disaster. Our country is weaker, poorer, and sicker because of the actions of Donald Trump.

If we flip Arizona, we can defeat Donald Trump and take the Senate. But a recent poll listed on FiveThirtyEight showed Democrat Joe Biden only up 2 points in Arizona against Donald Trump.
The Trump campaign has gone all-out on trying to win Arizona. In recent weeks they have sent Ivanka Trump, Mike Pence, and Donald Trump here to try to rescue their struggling Arizona campaign effort. They are spending millions on negative attack ads in Arizona.

"Arizona Democrats across the state are rising to this moment and helping others when they can.
AZ Dems
Friend,
We know that these are tough times for all Arizonans. But today, we want to share some positive stories and examples of how Arizona Democrats are rallying to support their communities during these challenging times.
Here are some examples of Arizona Democrats across the state who are rising to this moment and helping others when they can.
* Legislative District 24 Democrats are stepping up to help the seniors in their community by delivering groceries to those who need assistance. They’ve made over 30,000 calls so far to seniors and they’re organizing community teams to check on vulnerable neighbors.
* Nick Tellez, Chair of Graham and School Board incumbent, repositioned his restaurant in Salome to buy bulk items for his customers to ensure they could get the food they need. Additionally, his restaurant now does takeout and delivery to feed the community and help keep his staff employed.
* Arizona State Representative and practicing ER Doctor Amish Shah has been taking 24-hour shifts in the Emergency Room to help with the influx of patients with coronavirus symptoms. To ensure the health and safety of his colleagues, he will not be present at Legislative Sessions while he is treating coronavirus patients.
* John Lutes is running for Yavapai County Board and had to close his art store for the first time in 39 years. Nevertheless, he’s remained focused on his community and is using his social media platforms to encourage people to be kind to each other and look out for one another during these challenging times.
We will get through this pandemic together, and we will emerge stronger and more unified than ever. Here at Arizona Democrats, we are so proud of everyone doing what they can to help their communities and we hope that you and your families are safe.
Together,
Arizona Democrats

"It's been some time since I provided an update, so I wanted to share the status of our Native organizing program.
AZ Dems
Friend,
I wanted to give you an update on our organizing progress on Arizona’s tribal lands.
As you know, Arizona – and the Navajo Nation specifically – have been hit hard by the pandemic. For that reason, it’s been a challenge to mobilize safely and efficiently, but we’ve adapted as needed and we continue to move forward with our mission to protect and empower Native voices.
We now have seven Native organizers on the Navajo Nation and Hopi Reservation. In addition to helping with COVID-19 relief efforts, our dedicated organizers distribute, collect, and assist with voter registration and early voting forms. We continue to encourage the community to vote by mail so they can make their voice heard while staying safe and healthy.
Organizing during a devastating pandemic is no easy task, and we’re sure to have a challenging – and expensive – few months ahead of us. But with so much at stake in November, we must continue to fight for Arizona’s tribal lands. Their voters deserve to have their say in defeating Trump and flipping the U.S. Senate.
To prepare for the coming months, we need your help to hire more Native organizers, purchase PPE for the team, register Native voters, buy radio ads, and print resources and flyers. Will you donate $15 or whatever you can to help us empower Native voices and turn Arizona blue?
Donate Now
We’re so grateful to this grassroots team for all of your support, and we hope you can continue to stand with Arizona’s tribal lands.
Thank you,

"She's now selling ""liberal hack"" t-shirts and running social media ads glorifying her outburst.
AZ Dems
Friend,
Last week, Martha McSally refused to answer a basic question and then brazenly called a CNN reporter a “liberal hack” in an outburst that prompted backlash across the country.
McSally quickly seized the national media attention and spun it as an opportunity to fundraise for her election campaign. She’s now selling “liberal hack” t-shirts and is running Facebook ads that glorify her outburst.
McSally fundraising spree
McSally knows she’s in a vulnerable position, so she’s taking advantage of any momentum she can get to desperately raise money from big-money Trump supporters and National Republicans.
We can’t let McSally’s fundraising spree go unanswered – not when there’s so much at stake in the November election. Will you make a contribution so we can counter McSally’s ads and ensure we don't fall behind?

"I'm Rachel Hood, the new Native American Outreach Manager with the Arizona Democratic Party joining the fight to take back the White House and turn Arizona blue!
AZ Dems
Hi friend,
I’m Rachel Hood, the new Native American Outreach Manager with the Arizona Democratic Party joining the fight to take back the White House and turn Arizona blue! The partnerships that we build with Arizona’s 22 tribal nations will be vital to our pathway to victory in 2020 and for years to come.
Since earning my Bachelor’s degree, I have worked with Indigenous initiatives within my community. From 2015 until 2018, I was elected to Tribal Council and held a seat on the Business Board of Directors for the Yavapai-Apache Nation. Using my business training, I successfully oversaw three businesses in the Verde Valley.
It is my strong belief that tribal nations must exercise self-governance and self-determination to strengthen Indigenous sovereign powers. And as Native American Outreach Manager, I am committed to empowering tribal communities to engage, register, and turn out Navajo Nation and other tribal communities in Arizona to take back power.
But unless we have the resources to engage with tribal communities, our work will not be sufficient. That’s why I’m asking you to donate $15, or whatever you can so that we can do the meaningful organizing work that must be done to empower Indigenous peoples.
DONATE NOW
To successfully engage and work with Arizona’s indigenous communities, especially now, we’re going to have to use innovative ways to communicate and engage.
I know I’m up to the task, and I know that with grassroots supporters like you, we can mobilize voters and flip Arizona blue.
Can we count on you to support our efforts to engage and empower Arizona’s tribal nations?
Every dollar we can donate to our program will get us one step closer to winning in 2020.
In solidarity,
Rachel Hood

For decades, Native Americans have struggled against targeted voter suppression and discrimination. We’re working closely with Arizona’s tribal communities to ensure that any Native citizen who wants to vote is able to do so safely and without issue.

Friend,
This headline from Sierra Magazine says it all:
Native Americans Helped Invent American Democracy But Are Often Prevented From Practicing It
From Utah and Arizona to the Dakotas, Indigenous communities struggle against efforts to suppress their ability to vote
As the article explains, Indigenous peoples have struggled for decades against voter suppression and unequal political representation. Strict voter ID laws, gerrymandering, ill-paved roads and poor infrastructure, limited polling locations and scarce postal service on tribal lands all contribute to the low voter turnout of Native Americans.
Despite these challenges, Indigenous peoples are a “crucial voting block that can swing the course of an election.” And that’s precisely why Republicans and other groups have worked so hard to keep their voices silenced.
In 2016, Arizona passed legislation that made it illegal for Native American activists to go door to door collecting signed and sealed ballots and dropping them off at polling stations or at the post office. The law's sponsor, a Republican from Scottsdale, said “it was designed to prevent ‘ballot abuse.’ Critics said that the real intention of the law was to suppress voting by people of color, including Native Americans.”
Last year, a federal appeals court struck down the law, recognizing that ""for over a century, Arizona has repeatedly targeted its American Indian, Hispanic, and African American citizens, limiting or eliminating their ability to vote and to participate in the political process."" The ruling was just one victory in a long and continued battle for fair voting rights and representation.
Today, Navajo Nation and Arizona’s other tribal nations are facing unprecedented challenges in the wake of the health crisis, and it’s more important than ever that their voices are heard at the polls. Therefore, as we work to prioritize the health and safety of our friends and neighbors on tribal lands, we remain focused on ensuring every Native citizen who wants to vote has the ability to do so.
During these challenging times, we rely on your generous support to help us uplift and empower Native voices. Will you chip in $15 or whatever you can to ensure Arizona’s tribal nations are heard this November?

There’s so much at stake in this election that directly impacts Indigenous peoples -- and they deserve to have their voices heard.

2019 FEC Fundraising Deadline
Countdown to 2020
Friend,
The countdown to 2020 -- and to our final FEC fundraising deadline of the year -- is on.
This is our last fundraising push before we head into the election year. And it’s absolutely critical that we hit our $50,000 goal, so we have the resources we need to canvass neighborhoods, register thousands of voters across the state, run a robust digital program, and support incredible Arizona Democrats running up and down the ballot.
Your support helps us do all of this, so we can achieve our end goal of electing Democrats that will fight for hardworking Arizonans and the values that matter most to them, including quality and affordable health care, equal rights for all, a clean planet for future generations, and common-sense gun laws.
There’s so much at stake in 2020, and we can’t afford to fall behind on our goals. Will you take advantage of the TRIPLE MATCH currently in effect, and make a donation to help us close the gap on our fundraising?

"Billionaire Sheldon Adelson has pledged to spend $20 to $50 million to help Trump get reelected.
AZ Dems
Friend, we have some bad news.
Casino billionaire Sheldon Adelson has promised to spend $20 to $50 million to help reelect Donald Trump. This money will be flowing to battleground states like Florida, Pennsylvania, and Arizona.
Democrats have a small lead in Arizona, but millions of dollars from GOP mega-donor Sheldon Adelson could change that.
We need to raise $20,000 by midnight tomorrow to help fight back!
Friend, Democrats have a real shot at winning Arizona. Can you donate $3 to help fight back against Adelson’s millions?

"BREAKING: DNC labels AZ top battleground state
AZ Dems
Friend,
The Democratic National Committee has announced that Arizona is one of just six battleground states included in their historic ""Battleground Build Up 2020"" initiative.
As part of this initiative, the DNC will invest millions of dollars into the six battleground states ahead of a fiercely competitive election, allowing the party “to double the number of field [staff], open additional field offices and fund on-the-ground data operations that will eventually be turned over to the party's eventual nominee.”
Despite this early investment, Democrats have significant ground to make up. With no competitive primary to focus on, the Republican National Committee and Trump’s reelection campaign have already poured millions into Arizona and have “long been on TV across the country.”
Right now, we need 500 grassroots donors to contribute to our battleground state initiatives, so we can build the infrastructure needed to win in November. Your donation will help us carry out important fieldwork, register voters, and support the eventual Democratic nominee.

For the first time since she joined the ticket, Kamala Harris and Joe Biden are campaigning together here in Arizona. People have already started voting in Arizona, and their visit could really help boost turnout.
Democrats have a razor-thin lead in Arizona, and we’re going to have to work overtime to protect it.
Help Joe Biden and Kamala Harris keep the lead in Arizona. Can you rush a $5 donation right now to help turn Arizona blue?

Mike Pence is also campaigning in Arizona today, and Mitch McConnell’s super PAC is still dumping millions of dollars into the state. They know just as well as we do that Arizona could be the tipping point in this election.
We can’t afford to take any chances right now. Winning in Arizona could send Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to the White House and flip control of the Senate in November.
If Trump and Pence lose Arizona, they lose the White House.

Arizona is the most competitive battleground state in the country this year, and voter registration and turnout can make or break the election at the state, local, and national level. That’s why it’s so important that we register every qualified Democratic voter ahead of Election Day.
Thank you for helping us with our voter registration initiative so we can win in November.

"The strength of this grassroots team and the blue tide we're building is garnering widespread media attention.
AZ Dems
Friend,
The strength of this grassroots team and the blue tide we’re building is garnering widespread media attention.
Check out this Washington Post article that talks about Chair Felecia Rotellini and the changing politics in Arizona. And, read The Guardian article that quotes Felecia speaking truth to power:
“The Covid-19 crisis and the complete lack of empathy and competence that the president has shown in his handling of this has created even a greater sinking ship that is now called his re-election campaign.”
The country and the media are paying attention to Arizona, to our party, and to our grassroots team. Because together, we’re standing up against leadership that isn’t working for Arizona families. And we’re building the foundation needed to turn Arizona blue in November.
We’re grateful to have you on this team with us, and we know that with your continued support, we can elect Democrats up and down the ballot who will fight for every Arizonan.
Thanks for everything you do.

Friend,
We’re almost one full week into December, which means we’re just a few weeks away from the end of this year – of this decade, actually (whoa).
And while most people are counting down to the new year, we’re counting our fundraising numbers leading up to our last fundraising quarter of 2019.
You see, our work doesn’t stop during the holidays. We still have fundraising goals we have to hit, so we can stay on track to WIN in 2020. In fact, the end-of-year contributions from supporters like you are critical for us.
That’s why I’m reaching out today. I need your help hitting our Q4 grassroots fundraising goal, so we can head into the election year stronger than ever. Your donation will help us elect superstar Democrats up and down the ballot.
Contribute
The holidays are a time to reflect on the things we’re grateful for -- like democracy. And with your help, we can use our democratic voice to elect leaders that will protect Arizona values, safeguard healthcare, and fight for equal rights for all.
So, thank you for making a donation today toward our Q4 fundraising goal, so we can turn Arizona blue and elect Democrats up and down the ballot in 2020.

"This common-sense bill will help make potentially life-saving prescription drugs more affordable for millions of Americans.
AZ Dems
Team,
Today, the House voted to pass the Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act of 2019.
This common-sense bill will help make potentially life-saving prescription drugs more affordable for millions of Americans -- something Republicans have neglected to do for years.
U.S. Reps. Ruben Gallego, Raúl Grijalva, Ann Kirkpatrick, Tom O'Halleran, and Greg Stanton each voted to support the bill to lower prescription drug costs.
By contrast, GOP Reps. Debbie Lesko, Andy Biggs, and David Schweikert sided with their Big Pharma and corporate health care industry backers, each voting ""no"" on the Medicare price negotiation bill.
Health care should be accessible to everyone -- not just the wealthiest Americans. Chip in now to help us support Democrats who will stand by this notion and fight to protect and improve our health care.
Contribute
SOLD TO BIG PHARMA
Contribute
Republicans and their crusades against quality, affordable health care are hurting families across the state. With your help, we can elect more Democrats to office who will put Arizonans first.

"The Arizona Democratic Party mourns the loss of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
AZ Dems
Today, the Arizona Democratic Party mourns the loss of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
From our Chair, Felecia Rotellini:
> “We honor her legacy as a champion for equal rights and as a respected jurist who was progressive and independent in her approach. Case by case, her legal authorship enshrined equality into our laws. She taught us to never give up and to always stand for what is right regardless of the odds. With grace and resilience, she broke many barriers for women in America. Her life and passing, on the eve of Rosh Hashanah, is both symbolic and full of hope. We will be forever grateful to Justice Ginsburg and send our heartfelt condolences to her family and friends.”
Her memory will be a constant inspiration as we carry on the fight for equal rights. The entire Arizona Democratic Party is so deeply grateful for each and every one of you that has been with us as we fight for a more equitable America.
Together, let us continue to fight for and honor Justice Ginsburg’s legacy.

Let us know now: Will you commit to vote on March 17?

"Gaining control of the State Legislature is critical to creating the change Arizonans need.
AZ Dems
Friend,
Creating change in Arizona starts with turning our State Legislature blue – and the Arizona Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee (ADLCC) is committed to making that happen.
Here’s what you need to know about the ADLCC and our path to a blue majority –
FIRST: Democrats picked up four seats in the State House in 2018 and sent the largest caucus of Democrats to the legislature since 1966.
THEN: The ADLCC recruited and trained strong, diverse candidates across the state with the goal of flipping both chambers of the State Legislature in 2020.
NOW: After posting strong numbers in Tuesday's primary election, our candidates have a clear path forward to flip two seats in the House and three seats in the Senate. But to be successful, the ADLCC urgently needs to hire more staff and expand their voter outreach program.
Will you split a donation between the ADLCC and Arizona Democrats to help us flip the five seats we need to take control of the State Legislature?
Donate Now
Together, we can make 2020 the year we break a Republican trifecta on our state government.
Thank you,

AZ Dems
Team,
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and his Republican cronies are desperate to keep their hold on the U.S. Senate. That’s why corporate interest-funded groups linked to McConnell are planning to spend at least $16 million in Arizona to prop up vulnerable Republicans.
The GOP is tapping into their massive war chest because they know that Arizona is a top battleground state with a strong chance of turning blue. Now, we need to respond with our own fundraising surge, so we can elevate the campaigns of Arizona Democrats who will go to work for all Arizonans instead of billionaires and Big Pharma.

Here is why Arizona will go BLUE this year:
* GOP extremism has alienated most Arizona voters.
* In 2018 we sent a Democrat to the Senate for the first time in 30 years.
* Joe Biden is currently polling just ahead of Donald Trump in AZ!
Arizona is the TOP Battleground state in the country. Donald Trump is counting on Arizona for his re-election. If we win here, we beat Donald Trump and can take the Senate.
But Donald Trump and Republican Super PACs have millions to spend on TV ads to try and keep Arizona red.

The race in Arizona is extremely close. We can’t afford to get outspent by Republicans.
Arizona could very well decide this election. Republicans are focusing heavily on winning Arizona. That’s why Donald Trump and Mike Pence came here to campaign this month. We can’t let them win here.
This is our most important fundraising deadline of this election, and we are still $34,543 short of our goal.
We only have until Wednesday at midnight. So can we count on you to donate $5 right now to help FLIP Arizona?

"Did you know that your Arizona State tax form offers you an opportunity to donate to the Arizona Democratic Party?
AZ Dems
Team,
Did you know that your Arizona State tax form offers you an opportunity to donate to the Arizona Democratic Party?
It’s easy! On your AZ Form 140, simply enter any amount into the box on Line 68 and mark “Democratic” on Line 75. The State will then send us a check for that amount.
Tax form
If you're using the short form, Form 140A, you can enter in any donation amount you prefer on line 36 and then mark 'Democratic' on line 43. (Unfortunately, this option is not currently available if you file using the 1040EZ form.)
This is a GREAT way to donate to Arizona Democrats. It eliminates most of our processing and bookkeeping costs, saves you a stamp, and can make tax season a little less painful because you know you will be helping Arizona Democrats fight to improve our state.
Please take this easy step while you're filling out your taxes to support the Arizona Democratic Party.
Thank you for all you do.
Sincerely,

"We are doing a final voter registration push, but we don’t have much time.

Did you see the message from our team?
Just the other day, a judge struck down the voter registration extension, which means TODAY is the last day to register to vote in Arizona. Our team is doing a last-second push to register more voters before the deadline.
But we are still $4,296 short of being able to fund this final voter registration push.
We have to make the most of this final day. Will you donate $5 to help register voters before the midnight deadline?

"That's the question FiveThirtyEight asked. Here's what they said.
AZ Dems
Friend,
Last week, FiveThirtyEight’s weekly politics chat asked the question: “Are Arizona, Georgia and Texas really in play?”
In regard to Arizona, the answer was a resounding “YES.” Here are some of the main takeaways from the discussion:
* “Of the three states we’re looking at, I think it’s pretty clear that Arizona is the most in play.”
* “Unlike in Georgia and Texas, Democrats actually won major statewide contests in Arizona in 2018 — including the state’s marquee Senate race — and election turnout was nearly as high as the 2016 presidential contest, meaning that performance may reflect a broader shift toward the Democrats rather than just a side effect of the midterms’ blue wave.”
* “Arizona gives [Biden] another possible path to 270 in the Electoral College. Arizona’s worth 11 electoral votes, so it could sub in for, say, Wisconsin (10 electoral votes) if Trump were to narrowly carry the Badger State.”
It’s clear Arizona is one of the political epicenters in this year’s election. With so much riding on our state, we’re working overtime to reach and register voters in every corner of the state.
Building a massive organizing program isn’t easy – or cheap – and we need the full support of this grassroots team to power our work. Will you chip in $15 or whatever you can to help us get out the vote in Arizona?
Donate Now
With your help, we can deliver Arizona’s 11 electoral votes to Joe Biden, flip our U.S. Senate seat blue, and take back the U.S. Senate majority for Democrats.
Thanks for your support.

"Over a million Arizonans have voted, have you?
AZ Dems
Have you voted in this election?
With only 8 days until Election Day, it is vital that you cast your ballot and share your voice. Arizona has become one of the most crucial states in one of the most important elections in American history.
The amount of turnout Arizona receives may be the difference between an electoral victory for Joe Biden and the decision being handed down to the Supreme Court, which Republicans have been packing with ultra-conservative Justices so that they will make conservative-leaning decisions in the event of any electoral ambiguity.
And we cannot forget what happened in 2016 when some voters stayed home and Trump outperformed the projections for the year. Another four years of Trump would only further backslide American Democracy.
We want to make sure everyone gets out and votes, so we are trying to get 2,000 responses by 11:59 p.m.
The GOP has been working tirelessly to suppress the turnout in Arizona. We must come together to ensure Democrats win in Arizona. So have you voted yet?
Yes, I voted!
No, but I will!
Thank you for voting,

Friend,
I have good news, and I have bad news.
The bad news is we’re still $16,929 away from our last, and most important, fundraising goal of the year. And missing this fundraising goal would be a very bad way to start off the election year.
The good news is we have a few more days to close the gap. And (more good news), our triple match is still in effect until midnight on December 31.
Will you chip in to our end-of-year fundraising goal, so we don’t miss a beat heading into the election year?
Grassroots donors are truly the backbone of the Arizona Democratic Party – each individual donation, whatever the amount, helps fuel our work so we can canvass voters across the state, advocate for all Arizonans, and support Democrats running up and down the ballot.
You can use this secure link to make a donation right now, and help us continue our fight for affordable health care, equal rights, quality education, and a clean planet.

"Amidst all of the struggles over the past month, we witnessed a strength and resolve from Arizonans like never before.
AZ Dems
Team,
March was a tough month.
With a pandemic sweeping the country, families and small businesses are struggling, people are worried for their health and wellbeing, and the financial futures of many are uncertain.
But amidst all of these struggles, we witnessed a strength and resolve from Arizonans like never before. We saw record-breaking voter turnout in the primary election on March 17 -- proof that Arizonans are fired up and ready to elect new leaders who will get our country back on track and fight against the incompetence that has brought us to where we are today. We’ve seen Arizonans band together by staying apart to prevent the spread of the virus and protect our most vulnerable populations. And, we’ve seen neighbor look out for neighbor, because at the end of the day, we are all in this together.
Here at the Arizona Democratic Party, we are inspired by you. And we are deeply grateful for all of your support during these challenging times. Thanks to your generosity, our mission continues.
We are honored to fight for you, your families, and for our state. And we’re hopeful that we can build a brighter, healthier future and viable solutions to the issues facing so many hardworking people across Arizona.
Together, we will persevere.

"A recent poll shows that Trump and Biden are in a statistical tie in Arizona.

Friend, did you see the news?
A recent poll came out showing that Joe Biden and Donald Trump are statically tied in Arizona. The race is a dead heat!
Arizona is one of the most competitive battleground states in the entire country. That is why both Republicans and Democrats are investing heavily in Arizona.
We need to raise $5,000 today to make sure Joe Biden takes the lead and wins Arizona.
Who wins Arizona may determine who wins the White House. Can you chip in $5 right now to make sure Donald Trump is defeated in Arizona?

"In fact, he's so nervous about an impending blue wave that his team just dropped $95 MILLION on ads to run in six key swing states, including Arizona.
AZ Dems
Friend,
Donald Trump is getting nervous.
In fact, he’s so nervous about an impending blue wave that his team just dropped $95 MILLION on ads to run in six key swing states, including Arizona.
Arizona is the most important battleground state for both Democrats and Republicans this year. That’s why Trump is playing strong defense, and that’s why Democrats have to be prepared to fight back against Trump’s expansive media presence in Arizona.
Soon, Arizonans will be blanketed with Trump ads, and we need to make sure they hear from Democrats too. Will you donate $15 or whatever you can to help us expand our digital advertising program, so we can get our message out to voters?
Donate Now
While Democratic support is surging, we can’t count Trump out now – he did the impossible in 2016 and he could do it again if we get complacent. He’s fighting harder than ever, and we must do the same every single day between now and Election Day.
Click here to make a secure donation to help us defeat Trump.

The news follows the announcement that Biden’s campaign will spend $280 million on a TV ad blitz across a few key states, including Arizona.
With historic investment in our state, Arizona is proving to be ground zero in the race for the White House. But while Democratic momentum is higher than ever, Republicans are investing just as heavily in Arizona.

AZ Dems
Team,
President Trump announced that he will visit Arizona next week, a trip that highlights his administration's ongoing failures, including its recent move to block Arizonans from accessing a special health care marketplace enrollment period.
Earlier this week, reports emerged that Trump was privately and repeatedly warned about the threat of COVID-19, even as he publicly downplayed the virus -- costing Arizonans and Americans vital time to prepare.
Trump's growing list of failures will only be made worse by Republican plans to let health insurance companies price gouge older Americans and people with pre-existing conditions.
It’s time for change in 2020. Will you donate to help us elect leaders who will put our state first in Washington?

"AZ Dems
I will be brief. People have already started voting in Arizona, and our team is working hard to turn out every Democratic vote. The race here is a dead-heat, and Mike Pence was just in Arizona last week trying to rally Republican support.
But we are $8,000 short of our goal. Missing this goal during early voting could really cost us.
People are voting right now, and we only have until 11:59 p.m. to hit our goal. Please, will you chip in $5 to help us increase Democratic turnout?
Donate Now
This is the most important election of our lifetimes. There is so much at stake.
If Republicans win, they will:
* Strip healthcare from millions
* Attack LGBTQ+ rights
* Overturn Roe v. Wade
The way we stop them is by winning the White House and the Senate! And the path to winning the White House and the Senate goes through Arizona.
Missing our goal during the early voting period will put us behind. Can you chip in $5 to help us turn Arizona blue?

Ted Cruz and Tom Cotton.
That is who Donald Trump would appoint to the Supreme Court if he is given a second term!

Friend, Arizona is the tipping-point state that could determine this election. Can you donate $5 to STOP Trump from appointing Ted Cruz and Tom Cotton?

Ted Cruz and Tom Cotton are far-right extremists who would:

The Supreme Court is one of the last checks on democracy. We can’t allow Donald Trump to pack the court with his radical far-right cronies.

AZ Dems
Friend,
With COVID-19 top of mind for many, we wanted to share some of the measures our team is taking to help minimize and contain the spread of the virus. We hope you can implement these recommendations in your own lives to help protect yourselves, your families, and your communities.
General Guidance - Stay healthy:
* Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
* Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.
* Stay home when you are sick.
* Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.
* Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe.
* And as always get enough sleep, stay hydrated, eat healthy, and manage stress.
The CDC recommends the highest priority actions to take:
* Make sure you and your family members have supplies on hand, including required medications for chronic conditions (one month or more).
* Stock up on groceries to be able to stay home for long periods (two weeks or more).
* Avoid crowds.
* Avoid physical contact at meetings.
* Maintain personal hygiene.
* All at-risk individuals should avoid nonessential travel and cruise ships.
* Stay up to date on the situation in your communities.
* Stay home when you are sick.
We understand that many Americans are feeling uneasy and uncertain about the future. But if you stay informed and take the appropriate steps now, you can do your part to protect all of us from COVID-19.
As for our representatives in Washington, we must urge them to put partisan politics aside and work together to pass a comprehensive relief package to assist impacted communities across the country.
This is a time for unity, communication, and action.
Together,

"Trump is set to visit Yuma and Phoenix today.
AZ Dems
Friend,
At Trump’s rally in Tulsa over the weekend, Trump informed his (underwhelming) crowd that he asked his administration to slow down coronavirus testing in an apparent attempt to manipulate and limit the number of positive results.
Now, Trump is headed to Arizona – where COVID-19 cases continue to surge – for his next campaign rally. What’s more, he plans to make a stop in Yuma, AZ so he can check on his border wall.
As Trump continues to put his personal and political agenda ahead of the health of Arizonans, it’s time to show Trump that Arizonans are fed up.
Will you stand with Arizona Democrats by donating $15 or whatever you can to help us block Trump from winning our 11 electoral votes?
Donate to defeat Trump
With your help, we can send a message to Trump that he has no chance in Arizona.
Thank you,

"With the majority, Democrats can work to expand renewable energy and protect consumers from unfair utility rate hikes.
AZ Dems
Friend,
Exciting news! This year, Democrats have the best chance they’ve ever had at taking the majority of seats on the Arizona Corporation Commission (ACC).
This is an important opportunity because, with the majority, Democrats can work to expand renewable energy and protect consumers from unfair utility rate hikes.
Here’s the deal: There are three seats open, and there are three Democratic candidates running this year - Bill Mundell, Anna Tovar, and Shea Stanfield. Each Democratic candidate needs to collect 1,500 individual donations of $5 in order to receive their Clean Elections funding. Our Democrats are running as Clean Election candidates because the ACC is a regulatory entity, so candidates shouldn’t take money from special interests.
Here’s how you can help: You can make a $5 donation to one (or all!) of the Democratic candidates - Bill Mundell, Anna Tovar, and Shea Stanfield \- to help them meet their funding requirements by visiting this link: [[URL REDACTED]]
Making a donation takes just a few minutes, but it goes a long way in helping our Democratic candidates take the majority in the ACC.
Thank you so much for your support!

Friend, did you know that 3 of the 5 seats on the Arizona Corporation Commission will be decided in this year's November election?

Democrats have a historic opportunity to provide support to Commissioner Kennedy's efforts by electing three Democratic candidates on November 3rd.

"The decision was made despite significant opposition.
AZ Dems
Team,
Washington Republicans are working to eliminate food assistance for at least 6,700 Arizonans and possibly thousands more, according to an analysis by the non-partisan Urban Institute.
The Trump Administration’s decision to move forward with this senseless and blatantly cruel policy is a slap in the face to every Arizonan who is fighting to get ahead. Especially since Washington Republicans happily passed a trillion-dollar tax giveaway for billionaires and corporations.
Team, it’s clear that the GOP isn’t looking out for the American people. That’s why we need to vote them out in 2020 and elect leaders that will fight for everyday Americans. But to do that, we need your help.
Will you chip in right now so we can show Washington Republicans that we won’t stand for their heartless policies?
Contribute
The 2017 GOP tax overhaul sent 83% of its benefits to the richest 1% of Americans and large corporations like Chevron and the drug company Eli Lilly. It’s time to elect leaders that will fight for everyday Americans and stop giving handouts to billionaires and corporations.

"Did you know your Arizona State tax form offers you an opportunity to donate to the Arizona Democratic Party?
AZ Dems
Friend,
Did you know: Your Arizona State tax form offers you an opportunity to donate to the Arizona Democratic Party. Whether you file the standard form (AZ Form 140) or the short tax form, please think about making a donation to the Democratic Party. (This option is not available if you file the 140EZ form.)
Last year, we soared beyond our budget estimate and would like to see another record-setting year for donations through the state tax forms.
Here's how to find the donation lines on your 2019 tax form:
AZ Form 140 - Resident Personal Income Tax Form: See lines 68 – where you put in the amount of your donation – and line 75, where you check the box marked Democratic.
Resident Personal Income Tax (Short) Form: See lines 36 – to write in the amount of your donation – and 43 where you check Democratic.
As treasurer of the ADP, I can assure you that this is a GREAT way to donate to the party because it eliminates processing and bookkeeping costs! Plus, it saves you a stamp – and can make Tax Day a little less painful because you will know that you’re helping all Arizona Democrats. (While you can delay paying your taxes for 90 days, the tax forms are still due on April 15th.)

"These are big goals, but we have the momentum and support needed to succeed.
AZ Dems
Friend,
At the Arizona Democratic Party, our mission is to build a safer, fairer, more prosperous Arizona that works for everyone. To do that, we’re focused on a few main objectives:
* Flip our U.S. Senate seat – a necessary step to take back the U.S. Senate majority for Democrats
* Turn Arizona blue and block Trump from winning our 11 electoral votes
* Break Republican control of Arizona’s state government by flipping both chambers for the first time in 50 years
We know these are big goals, but momentum is on our side – A report from the Arizona Secretary of State shows that the number of registered Democrats is on the rise.
But in order to win up and down the ballot in November, we have to register even more Democratic voters. Will you donate $15 or whatever you can to help us expand our voter registration program?
Donate Now
With your support, progress is possible.
Thank you for stepping up and helping us elect the change we want to see.

"We're barely into 2020 and Big Pharma has already jacked prices on hundreds of drugs.
AZ Dems
Friend, so far in 2020, Big Pharma has increased the price of 400+ prescription drugs.
Meanwhile, unelected Sen. Martha McSally continues to stand with her corporate backers and oppose letting Medicare negotiate for lower prices.
Rising Rx Drug Costs
Support the fight for affordable health care >>
The U.S. House of Representatives paved the way for progress in December when they passed a Medicare drug price negotiation bill that is estimated to help lower pricing for certain treatments “by thousands per month.”
But McConnell hasn’t brought the bill up for a vote. And McSally is opposing the measure, standing with the pharma-linked corporate interest groups backing her campaign.
Arizonans have had enough of the corporate greed and personal politics at play in government. It’s time to elect legislators that will actually prioritize the health and best interests of real people.
We need 500 grassroots donors to make a contribution today to help us fight for affordable health care. Can we count on you?

"Today, the Arizona Democratic Party is celebrating Native American communities and culture.
AZ Dems
Today, the Arizona Democratic Party wants to take time to honor Indigenous Peoples and their culture and history. Arizona’s history and culture are inseparable from the history and culture of Natives.
We must also recognize the tremendous hardships Native communities continue to face. The pandemic has only highlighted the gross inequities Native communities experience when it comes to health care and public health resources.
As a state, we must do more to recognize past sins and ensure that Native communities always have a seat at the table.
Although in-person events may be canceled this year, we can still honor and celebrate Native culture by continuing to learn about Native history and by committing to lifting Native voices and addressing the inequities Native communities face.
From all of us at the Arizona Democratic Party, Happy Indigenous Peoples’ Day!

"And we'll say it again: All eyes are on Arizona this election year.
AZ Dems
Friend,
We’ve said it before, and we’ll say it again: All eyes are on Arizona this election year.
First, the DNC identified Arizona as one of six battleground states to target in their historic “Battleground Build Up 2020” initiative.
Then, the DCCC labeled AZ-06 as one of their “2020 offensive battlefield” districts.
Now, EMILY’S List has announced that Arizona’s House and Senate is one of 11 state legislative chambers that the group is targeting to flip from red to blue.
AND, the Democratic National Committee announced it will host a presidential primary debate in Phoenix on March 15.
The heightened attention surrounding Arizona is proof of our pivotal role in this election year. Democrats cannot defeat Trump without winning our 11 electoral votes. We cannot flip the U.S. Senate without flipping our Senate seat. And we cannot make progress at the state level without turning the chambers from red to blue.
The country is watching what happens in Arizona. And we’re working hard to deliver the next blue wave and elect bold Democrats up and down the ballot. But we cannot do that without your support.
Will you chip in $15 or whatever you can right now to support our team as we work to register millions of voters, knock on thousands of doors, and build the infrastructure needed to win big in November?

"The article also suggests she's taking her legislative cues from Big Pharma.
AZ Dems
Friend,
Yet another news report suggests Martha McSally is taking her legislative cues from Big Pharma, rather than fighting for Arizonans.
The Washington Post recently identified McSally as one of several “vulnerable” Republicans who are declining to support bipartisan drug pricing reform legislation. In highlighting McSally’s opposition, the Post also explains that the pharmaceutical industry is nearly unanimously opposed to the bill.
McSally’s stance on drug pricing reform is no surprise: She’s received at least $198,700 from pharmaceutical and health care companies. Evidently, Big Pharma bought her loyalty, and she’s sticking by their side, regardless of the cost to her constituents.
Arizonans deserve better. Will you chip in right now to help us defeat McSally and her toxic allies?

This year we have the chance to take back the White House, flip the United States Senate, and take control of the Arizona Legislature -- but we can’t do any of it without your help.
If we’re going to accomplish any of the things I just listed, we need to run a more robust field program than Arizona Democrats have ever run before.

This year, Arizona Democrats are investing in our field program earlier than ever before, which will mean a huge difference at the polls this November!
But running the type of field program we need to win is going to take all of us doing our part and chipping in however we can.
Can I count on you to join this effort to unite our party and support Democrats up and down the ballot this November?
Chip in now to help Democrats win this November. Your support will allow us to run the most robust field operation Arizona has ever seen.

"The President is coming to Phoenix tonight because Republicans recognize they are in danger of losing Arizona. They know Arizonans do not trust this President and are ready for change.
AZ Dems
Friend,
The President is coming to Phoenix tonight because Republicans recognize they are in danger of losing Arizona. They know Arizonans do not trust this President and are ready for change.
In 2018, Arizona Democrats made huge gains because Arizonans were tired of being put last in Washington and recognized Trump's broken promises to our state. Arizona Democrats are fighting for affordable, accessible health care that protects coverage for pre-existing conditions. We are pushing for better funding for our schools because we recognize our children are our future. And we will not rest until we have an economy that works for everyone.
This President has threatened to cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. He is supporting a lawsuit that, if successful, would end health care coverage protections for 2.8 million Arizonans who have a pre-existing condition. On his watch job, growth has slowed and farmers have been steamrolled due to incoherent trade policies. At the border, families have been torn apart, children are kept in cages, and tribal burial sites are being destroyed to clear a path for Trump's border wall.
The President does not represent our values, he does not represent working families in this state, and he does not represent the majority of Americans.
The President knows he is in trouble in Arizona, and so do we.
Between now and election day, Arizona Democrats will continue to fight for the people of Arizona because we are the party for the people. We will deliver our 11 electoral votes to the Democratic nominee for President in November.
Mr. President, wrap up your remarks quickly tonight. Arizonans have had enough of you.
Together in the fight,

Big news: The application for the next Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission is now open.
Arizonans have until 5:00 p.m. on Thursday, August 20 to apply to become one of five commissioners who will map Arizona's future, drawing our next sets of congressional and legislative districts.
The IRC will shape the next TEN YEARS of Arizona elections, and right now, very little is being done by the state to promote the commissioner application. If we don't pick up the slack, too many Arizonans won't know until it's too late.
Step 1: Get the facts! Go to  [[URL REDACTED]] for resources and info on the IRC, the application, and eligibility.
Step 2: Get the word out! Forward this email, share on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram!

Friends,
The 2020 election will be the most consequential election of our lifetimes. The future of our country and our democracy are at stake.
Donald Trump and the GOP have systematically attacked voting rights, yanked us backward in the fight to end the climate crisis, and completely failed to protect people’s lives and livelihoods during the COVID-19 pandemic.
We need to fight back -- and fast.
That’s why I am personally reaching out to you today to ask if you can support Democrats in four key battleground states -- Nevada, Pennsylvania, Arizona, and Florida. If you’re in a place to donate, will you split a contribution in support of their Democratic state parties today?

Here’s why this is so important:
National Republicans have been preparing for this election for years -- filling their deep pockets with special interest and dark money, and breaking fundraising records across the board.
Now they’re ready to spend big -- and they have their sights set on these four critical states.
They know Democrats in Nevada, Pennsylvania, Arizona, and Florida stand between them and another four years of Donald Trump.
Let’s prove them right.
Friend, if you can, make a donation today and help make sure these state parties have the resources to deliver big wins up and down the ballot on Election Day — and finally get this country working for working people.
I know these are difficult times for our nation, but we will get through them as we always do: by coming together, as Americans, to fight for a better future.
Thanks for being a part of this,
Elizabeth

As of yesterday, over 639,000 Arizonans have already voted. The numbers show Democrats have a small edge over Republicans. But Donald Trump was just here yesterday trying to boost Republican turnout in Arizona.
In order to win, Democrats are going to have to make sure every Democratic vote turns out. That is why today we are launching our “Get Out The Vote Fund.” We need to raise $50,000 by Thursday to pay for our “Get Out The Vote” radio ad buys.
These ads can really boost Democratic turnout. Can you donate $5 to help pay for our voter turnout ads?

Our radio ads will be in English, Spanish, and Navajo.
In a close election like this one, it will be voter turnout that determines the outcome. Republicans are doing everything they can to try and hold on to Arizona. We can’t let them pull ahead in the final weeks.
If we turn out Democrats, we win Arizona. If we win Arizona, Donald Trump loses. It's that simple.
These radio ads can make the difference. Can you donate $5 to fund our voter turnout effort?

"We cannot afford to sit back while our most fundamental right is threatened.
AZ Dems
Friend,
The fundamental agreement in a functioning democracy is that voters have the power to choose their politicians – not the other way around.
Yet for decades, politicians have manipulated district lines to benefit themselves and their political party while stifling the voice of their constituents.
NPR recently reported on Thomas Hofeller – a prominent Republican redistricting strategist – and the damning evidence of calculated GOP gerrymandering that has come to light since his passing. His own daughter acknowledges that her father’s goal was to ""create a system wherein the Republican nominee would win.""
The NPR article also reveals that Hofeller worked on political maps in states across the country – including in Arizona.
We cannot afford to sit back while our most basic right is threatened. Will you join us in taking a stand against gerrymandering by signing our petition?
Sign the petition
It’s time to end gerrymandering and set up independent, nonpartisan committees to draw legislative districts. Only then can we ensure that every voice holds the same weight in our elections.

It's official. All the delegate votes have been cast and Joe Biden is officially our 2020 Democratic nominee!
Friend, the stakes couldn't be higher in this election. The difference between Trump and Biden is stark.
This November, America will choose between a President who is hateful, divisive, and childish or a President who is kind, empathic, and has a steady hand.
Arizona hasn't voted for a Democratic Presidential candidate since 1996 -- we are ending that streak in 2020.

Friend,
Donald Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has rolled back some critical environmental protection laws in the wake of the health crisis.
Trump’s lackluster response to the coronavirus pandemic has already put Americans at risk. Now, he’s endangering public health in a new way by indefinitely suspending protections of our air and water. This is especially dangerous given that we’re in the middle of a respiratory illness outbreak.
Americans need clean air and water today and every day. Will you add your name to our petition condemning the EPA’s rollback of these vital environmental protections?

AZ Dems
Team,
URGENT ALERT: A national monument in Arizona, home to Native American burial sites, is being blown up as part of the construction of Donald Trump’s border wall.
Demolition inside Arizona’s Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument began this week without approval from or consultation with the Tohono O’odham Nation, whose burial sites are being destroyed by the construction.
Despite the fact that Native American sites have special protections under federal law, the Trump administration exploited a loophole to override tribal sovereignty, allowing them to skirt several laws and carry on with the construction.
We need to send a message to the Trump Administration that we won’t stand for their destruction and disrespect of sacred Native American burial sites. Will you sign our petition condemning the Trump Administration’s actions?

"Friend, we are really close but I am worried we may not hit our goal.
AZ Dems
Friend, this month couldn’t be more important.
The end of this month is the last time we will report our fundraising numbers before people start voting.
We really need to have strong numbers to show. But right now we are still $3,914 away from hitting our mid-month fundraising goal and I’m worried we may not make it.
Friend, we really need grassroots supporters like you to step up. We only have a few hours left -- can you rush $5 to help flip the TOP battleground state in the entire country?
Donate Now
Goal: 20k Deadline: midnight
The polls show that this race is close and Democrats can win. But Donald Trump was just here in Arizona yesterday firing up his base and raising money for his campaign
There’s no doubt Arizona will play a major role in this election. If we win in Arizona it will make it near impossible for Trump to be reelected.
Friend, Democrats have a narrow lead in Arizona, we must hold onto it. Can you rush $5 to help defeat Trump before our midnight deadline?

"Together we are building a party that is going to defeat Donald Trump.
AZ Dems
I just wanted to take a second to personally thank you.
Because of grassroots donors like you, not only did we meet our end-of-quarter goal, we smashed it.
Last month, over 10,000 grassroots donors stepped up and helped build a party that is going to defeat Donald Trump in Arizona and take back the Senate.
It’s $5, $10, and $25 donations that allowed us to expand our voter registration program and our vote-by-mail program. You all have made all the difference.
We are facing the most important election of our lifetimes. Arizona will no doubt play a major role in determining the White House, the Senate, and the future of the Supreme Court.
So we are not going to leave anything on the table. Thank you for being with us.
So grateful,
\-- Herschel Fink
Executive Director

The race in Arizona has gotten even closer!
Biden Trump Poll
Arizona is the TOP battleground state in the entire country, and a recent poll shows Trump with a 1-point lead.
Remember, Nate Silver said Arizona could be the “tipping point” state that decides this election.
The race is close, but Democrats can still win in Arizona. Arizona Democrats need to raise $40,000 before our major END-OF-QUARTER fundraising deadline on Wednesday to help Joe Biden secure a win in Arizona.
This is our most important fundraising deadline this year. So please, can you RUSH $5 to STOP Trump from winning Arizona?

Trump and Mitch McConnell are putting everything behind winning Arizona. Mitch McConnell has spent over $10 million in Arizona trying to defeat Democrats, and both Donald Trump and Mike Pence visited to try and rally support.
But if we turn out Democrats as we did in 2018, we will win Arizona, the White House, and the Senate.
Let’s turn Arizona BLUE!
Don’t let Donald Trump pull ahead in this election. Please can you RUSH $5 to help Democrats win in Arizona?

"With the largest organizing operation in Arizona's history, we can flip Arizona blue and take back the Senate for Democrats, but we can't do that without your help.
AZ Dems
Hi Friend,
This year's election will be different than any year we've ever faced before. With the number of coronavirus cases continuing to rise in Arizona, and with the slim likelihood of a vaccine before the fall, the Arizona Democratic Party is prepared to change how elections are won.
The health and safety of all Arizonans is our main priority. That’s why our team is organizing a massive vote-by-mail initiative.
Arizonans already favor mail voting – in fact, in 2018, 78% of voters in Arizona voted by mail. But with Arizona being the top battleground state this year, we need to turn out every eligible Democratic voter if we’re going to win up and down the ballot.
With the largest organizing operation in Arizona's history, we can flip Arizona blue and take back the Senate for Democrats, but we can’t do that without your help.
Will you donate $15 or whatever you can to help us reach voters online and set them up to vote by mail?
If you've saved payment info with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Donate $15 to reach 500 people online »
Donate $30 to reach 1,000 people online »
Donate $90 to reach 3,000 people online »

Thanks for donating whatever you can to ensure our vote-by-mail program is well-funded. With people power on our side, we can make history.

"Joe Biden has selected Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate.
AZ Dems
Friend,
Exciting news: Joe Biden has selected Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate.
As the Senator of America's largest state, Sen. Harris is ready to lead on Day One. She shares Joe Biden's bedrock beliefs of standing up for all Americans and especially working families, and she is a proven fighter for the middle class.
As the former Attorney General of California, a lifelong civil rights leader, a Senator, and strong Presidential candidate, she is ready to be the Vice President of the United States.
But in order to elect the Biden-Harris ticket in November, Democrats MUST win in Arizona. And to win, we need to expand our digital organizing program, train more volunteers, and register more voters.
Will you rush $15 right now to help us deliver Arizona’s 11 electoral votes to Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in November?
Donate Now
Together, we can make history and elect the first woman – and the first woman of color – to the White House.
Thank you,

Friend, just wanted to give you an update on what we are working on at the Arizona Democratic Party. There has been a lot of big news in Arizona, but right now, we are focused on making it easier for Arizonans to vote.
Our team is working hard to help voters register for the Permanent Early Voting List or PEVL. This will ensure these voters get a vote-by-mail ballot in this election and in elections to come.
But with the deadline to sign up being exactly a month away, we need to double our efforts. So we are trying to raise $20,000 by Friday to expand our vote-by-mail program.
Friend, this can have a huge impact on the election. So please, can you donate $5 to help us expand our vote-by-mail program?

Trump is using Sen. Martha McSally’s outburst at a CNN reporter to raise big money for McSally’s campaign. His team sent a tweet to their nearly  half a million followers calling for donations to support McSally. Now, Trump’s donors are flooding Arizona and bolstering McSally’s campaign.

Team,
We cannot allow a racist, convicted criminal or his sidekick who has been found in contempt of court to become Maricopa County Sheriff.
But if we don’t buckle down and put in the work, that could become our reality.
Jerry & Joe / Found in contempt / Found guilty
Former colleagues and partners-in-crime, Joe Arpaio and Jerry Sheridan, are each running for Maricopa County Sheriff, a bewildering contradiction for two law-breakers. And they’re dumping gobs of money into this race.

Will you chip in right now to help us build the infrastructure needed to defeat Joe and Jerry?
Defeat Joe & Jerry
We can’t give power to someone who believes he’s above the law. But Joe has held the Sheriff’s office before, and it could happen again. Let’s work together to defeat Joe and Jerry before it’s too late.

Our strategy to win is simple: share Joe and Kamala’s positive vision for the country with voters across our state, and make sure those voters have the information, support, and resources they need to cast their ballots.
Trump, on the other hand? His strategy to win is by counting you OUT.
Trump and the GOP are hedging their bets to win by making sure as many Americans as possible CAN’T vote.
In the final hours of the most important election of our lifetime, we have to fight back and we need your support to do it. What do you say?

This is our opportunity to hit the ground running and showcase our digital organizing strength — and as you know, this year's campaigning is a little different than what we're used to.

Just because we've shifted gears and gone 100% virtual doesn't mean we're not still hard at work — in fact, as we round the corner to the final 100 days of the election, we're going full throttle against Trump's misinformation campaign in our battleground state.

"FIRST it was reported that Russia paid bounties to the Taliban to kill American troops.
THEN Trump feigned ignorance about this massive scandal.
NOW it’s clear that Trump received intel about this threat and did NOTHING.
AND TO DATE Trump has not held Russia accountable for killing US soldiers.
Do you agree that Trump’s unwillingness to take this threat seriously and hold Russia accountable makes him unfit to lead? YES NO
* * *
It's hard to imagine a more unconscionable act for a Commander in Chief than to blatantly ignore intelligence that could save the lives of American soldiers.
Hard to imagine for people like [[URL REDACTED]] entirely believable when the so-called Commander in Chief is Donald Trump.
Trump either brushed aside or flat out ignored information about a foreign country paying bounties to the Taliban to kill US troops. This begs the question: is Trump a hazard to our safety?
YES NO
Apart from being a gross failure of leadership, this recent example of Trump’s incompetence proves he is simply not suitable for the office of President.
But we want to know what you think. Take our poll here and let us know where you stand on Trump’s handling of a foreign country paying bounties to kill American troops.

"Team,
I’m going to be direct with you: we have to protect our Democratic majority in the House from Republicans determined to roll back the progress we’ve made since 2018.
Republicans like my opponent, Dan Rodimer, who’s been endorsed by none other than President Trump. Rodimer is a staunch conservative who wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act and cause hundreds of thousands of Nevadans (including those with pre-existing conditions) to fend for themselves amid a global health crisis.
We simply cannot allow that to happen. Can you contribute $15 right away and help fund our efforts to defeat dangerous candidates like Dan and elect Democrats up and down the ballot in our battleground state?

The GOP knows how critical my seat is, which is why they’re concentrating their resources on flipping it. Rodimer and Trump make for a dangerous duo, and the thought of them governing together — as allies in Trump’s backwards vision for the country — is beyond terrifying.
We can still put a wedge in their dangerous and distorted vision for Nevada, but we have to act fast. What do you say?
Democrats like myself, Joe, and Kamala are prepared to fight for proactive change — but our opponents are relentless in their attacks.
With just a few weeks left until the election, Nevada Democrats up and down the ballot need your help to fight back, set the record straight, and make sure the GOP doesn’t carry out Trump’s dark plan for the country.

Thanks to the ongoing commitment from folks like you, we turned Nevada blue in 2018 and elected the most diverse legislature in the country. We made historic progress for working families in our state – we raised the minimum wage, protected Nevadans with pre-existing medical conditions, and preserved our public lands for future generations. There’s more work to do.
But the GOP is already committing MILLIONS of dollars and unprecedented resources to flip key battleground states like Nevada red and to reelect Trump in November.

The results of grassroots investment in Nevada is already showing in our elections so far:
* Democrats now have a 6% advantage among registered voters in Nevada over the GOP.
* During the primary election, Democrats led in overall turnout by more than 16,000 votes.
* 66,000+ more Democrats participated in the election compared to the 2018 election — and over 110,000 more Democrats compared to 2016.
NV Dems are in the strongest position we’ve ever been heading into a general election and it’s entirely thanks to strong grassroots investment in our mission.

Team,
Last week at the virtual Democratic National Convention, we were buzzing with electricity after our party’s leaders, voters, and activists came together to make the case for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.
This week will paint a different picture.
Republicans are gathering for a convention of their own — but instead of calling on Americans to give their diverse perspectives on the biggest issues of the current moment, the GOP convention is about one thing and one thing only: giving Trump whatever he wants.

Trump and the GOP will be scouring these FEC reports as soon as they're available. They're looking for any signs of weakness in Democrats' grassroots support.  They've never found any before.
Let's make sure they don't find any this time, either.

Normally we’d counter that by getting out to knock on doors and talk with Nevadans in person, ensuring every Democrat is registered and fired up to send Joe Biden to the White House. This year, we’re relying entirely on virtual voter contact before Election Day.
Donald Trump admitted he’s on “Joe Biden’s field” here in Nevada – we can win this thing, but only if we out-work and out-organize the GOP in the final 100 days of the election.

"Trump: So I said to my people “slow the testing down, please”
Trump’s response to COVID-19 has been one failure after another.
First, he said it wasn’t a big deal and would be over by Easter. Then he failed to get medical professionals the equipment they needed. Now he’s talking about slowing down testing to make it seem like we have fewer cases.
Fight back: Denounce Trump’s latest comment and pledge to vote him out this fall.
SIGN ON
Donald Trump started up his MAGA rallies this weekend and right out the gate he’s showing his true colors.
On Saturday in Tulsa, Trump mocked COVID-19 and said testing is a “double-edged sword” because the more people you test, the more cases you find.
This is disgusting, team. He’s trying to downplay the worst public health crisis we’ve faced in generations in an attempt to rally his base ahead of the election.
Join NV Dems in CONDEMNING Trump’s attempts to trick voters into forgetting about COVID-19. Click here and add your name NOW:

This isn’t a coincidence: Trump wants to slow down testing as we head into the general election to deceive voters into believing COVID-19 is a thing of the past.
And with recent polling showing Trump’s re-election is not in the bag, he especially doesn’t want any more cases identified in key 2020 battleground states like Nevada!

"Folks,
When I spoke at the Democratic Convention four years ago, I said, “When Trump decided to run for president, he probably said to himself: ‘I’m an egomaniac. I don’t believe in science. I think women are inferior. Where would I feel at home?’ ”
Since that day, Trump has proved me right time and again. He has tried to reshape America in his own image – and he has made it clear he will stop at nothing to hold on to power.
The upcoming election is the most important in our lifetime and we must come together to elect Joe Biden and usher in big wins for Democrats up and down the ballot. Click here to join me in supporting NV Dems to make 2020 a change election.

From his failure to respond to COVID-19 to his attacks on healthcare and women’s rights to his systematic dismantling of voting rights – Donald Trump has proven he is unfit to lead this nation for another four years.
As the former Senate Majority Leader, I know firsthand the crucial role Nevada plays in the presidential election – and I am not alone. Even the Nevada GOP has admitted when campaigning in Nevada, Donald Trump is “playing on Biden’s field.”

Last month, NV Dems joined the Democratic National Committee, Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and Priorities USA in filing a suit to expand voting access in Nevada.
We're committed to making voting safe and accessible to every voter in our state — but unsurprisingly, Trump views any effort to elevate the voice of the voter as a direct threat to his chances of winning in November.
That's why he's attacking Nevada directly, threatening to withhold federal funding during a global health crisis as punishment.

The 2020 election will be the most consequential election of our lifetimes. The future of our country and our democracy are at stake.

National Republicans have been preparing for this election for years – filling their deep pockets with special interest and dark money, and breaking fundraising records across the board.
Now they’re ready to spend big – and they have their sights set on these four critical states.
They know Democrats in Nevada, Pennsylvania, Arizona, and Florida stand between them and another four years of Donald Trump.
Let’s prove them right.
If you can, make a donation today and help make sure these state parties have the resources to deliver big wins up and down the ballot on Election Day – and finally get this country working for working people.
I know these are difficult times for our nation, but we will get through them as we always do: by coming together, as Americans, to fight for a better future.

He even took a page out of Trump’s playbook and was in Nevada TODAY to hold a MAGA bus tour stop –– spreading more hate and lies, and creating a COVID breeding ground.
As head of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, Pence has played a central role in enabling this administration to ignore science and medicine and put the American people at risk.
And now he’s bringing that harm right here to Nevada.

"Friends,
The election is just weeks away, and it’s clear: Republicans up and down the ballot do not represent the transformational change the country desperately needs right now.
My opponent, Mark Amodei, is just another rubber stamp for Donald Trump’s distorted presidency — which is why I’m running to flip the last red Nevada Congressional district BLUE.
Can you chip in $15 and be a part of the historic movement to FLIP this district blue and elect Democrats up and down the ballot in our battleground state?

The Presidential and Vice Presidential debates reminded me what bold ideas and strong leadership look like (and what they don’t look like). I am so proud of where Democrats stand on critical issues like health care, reproductive rights, and climate change — we are pursuing progress and hope at every opportunity.
Donald Trump and Mike Pence, on the other hand, painted a darker and more sinister picture for our future. The country needs leaders who will champion progress — not incite fear and anger. Can I count on you to support my campaign and join me in the fight for progress?
Thank you for standing with us,

Friends,
We know the road to the White House runs right through Nevada and that means the GOP is prepared to spend big to create an innovative field program of their own.
The RNC just hired hundreds of additional field staffers to deploy to key battleground states like Nevada.
As Field Director for NV Dems, I know how important it is to have a strong team of grassroots activists supporting us as we work to out-organize the GOP — will you click here to join that team with a contribution of $10 or any amount?

As the Rapid Response Director here at NV Dems, I know it’s critical we build up our war chest NOW so that we have the resources to respond to anything Trump and the GOP throw at us.
Here’s what we need to do in the final 99 days before Election Day:
* Train volunteers to run digital voter outreach programs instead of traditional canvassing
* Reach voters across the state by phone, text, email, and through digital events
* Ensure voters know where, when, and how to vote by the time Early Voting begins
* Fight back against the FLOODS of GOP money that will threaten to drown us out
We cannot do that without scaling up our digital reach in a major way. These matched donations could be make-or-break for Democrats up and down the ballot in our battleground state.
There’s no easier way to instantly double your impact. Help us raise another $10,000 today by clicking here to contribute $10 or more before midnight.

Our state was instrumental in generating the blue wave in 2018 — Democrats across Nevada helped flip one of only two Senate seats to go from red to blue and cast hundreds of thousands of votes to protect house seats from Republican control.

The next 100 days are crucial for Democrats. We know the GOP is fundraising hand over fist and they’re already pouring money into our state.
Normally we’d counter that by getting out to knock on doors and talk with Nevadans in person, ensuring every Democrat is registered and fired up to send Joe Biden to the White House. This year, we’re relying entirely on virtual voter contact before Election Day.
Donald Trump admitted he’s on “Joe Biden’s field” here in Nevada – we can win this thing, but only if we out-work and out-organize the GOP in the final 100 days of the election.
If you’ve been waiting for an opportunity to make the most out of your support – this is it.

"Now that in-person voting is just days away in our battleground state, Trump and his Republican allies are pulling out all the stops to prevent us from turning out a historic number of voters.
They know this much to be true: the larger the turnout, the more likely Democrats beat them up and down the ballot.
That’s why we need you to help fund our Election Protection efforts.
Trump and his GOP cronies have proven they are willing to do and say whatever to defeat us — especially when they’re down in the polls. Help us counter their efforts and mobilize voters across the state to vote for Joe and Kamala by rushing a contribution of $15 today.

In just a few days, voting begins and we finally get a chance to end this horrific chapter in American history once and for all.
But Trump knows how critical our battleground state is to winning the election — and he’s already started attacking Governor Sisolak for expanding voting access.
We can’t let him sabotage our efforts to turnout the vote and win this thing for Joe and Kamala!
We are so, so close. Help us ensure that we have the resources to combat Trump’s dishonest efforts before in-person voting begins this weekend →

"Friend,
Donald Trump just can't seem to stay away from Nevada — and that is cause for concern.
Not only is Trump endangering the lives of thousands of his supporters by holding his in-person MAGA rallies — but he continues to downplay the threat of COVID-19, claiming we're ""rounding the turn"" despite rising numbers across the nation.
There's no way to sugarcoat it: Trump is trying to swindle voters in our battleground state because he knows all roads to victory run through Nevada. But we can stop him.

There's no excuse for Trump's inept presidency, authoritarian ""leadership,"" and downright dangerous beliefs. He is playing politics with American lives.
In normal times, that would be non-negotiable — in Trump times, it's just another Sunday. But it doesn't have to be.
We need leaders in the White House who believe in science and listen to experts. Leaders like Joe and Kamala.

The last six months of Trump's presidency have been a fitting end to the perfect storm — a storm we are almost done weathering, folks.
But with polls in Nevada showing Trump and Biden in a dead heat, we must come together and ensure big wins for Democrats. Everything is on the line — and we mean everything.

Trump: So I said to my people “slow the testing down, please”
Trump’s response to COVID-19 has been one failure after another.
First, he said it wasn’t a big deal and would be over by Easter. Then he failed to get medical professionals the equipment they needed. Now he’s talking about slowing down testing to make it seem like we have fewer cases.
Fight back: Denounce Trump’s latest comment and pledge to vote him out this fall.

Donald Trump started up his MAGA rallies this weekend and right out the gate he’s showing his true colors.
On Saturday in Tulsa, Trump mocked COVID-19 and said testing is a “double-edged sword” because the more people you test, the more cases you find.
This is disgusting, team. He’s trying to downplay the worst public health crisis we’ve faced in generations in an attempt to rally his base ahead of the election.

This isn’t a coincidence: Trump wants to slow down testing as we head into the general election to deceive voters into believing COVID-19 is a thing of the past.

After Nevada’s female-majority State Legislature passed legislation ending antiquated laws and protecting the right to choose, our hard work in 2018 fighting to elect Democrats up and down the ballot paid off big time.
Then, when the Supreme Court struck down Louisiana’s anti-choice legislation and upheld Roe v. Wade, we saw another national victory for families everywhere.
But now, Mississippi passed ANOTHER restrictive reproductive health care bill that could put Roe back in jeopardy if it comes to Trump’s conservative Supreme Court.
Congress can end this constant cycle that puts millions of patients at risk. We need 15,000 pro-choice activists to DEMAND national legislation to protect the right to choose — CLICK HERE to add your name →

While Republican-controlled states across the country try to roll back reproductive rights in every way imaginable, Nevada bucked the national trend and repealed restrictive reproductive health requirements that limited the right to choose.
Our state is leading the charge in the fight for reproductive rights in America — but if Brett Kavanaugh and his conservative colleagues on the Supreme Court see the right opportunity to overturn Roe v. Wade, they might take it.

The results of our primary election this month speak for themselves.
* Democrats now have a 6% advantage among registered voters in Nevada over the GOP.
* Statewide, Democrats led in overall turnout by more than 16,000 votes.
* 66,000+ more Democrats participated in the 2020 primary election compared to the 2018 election — and over 110,000 more Democrats compared to 2016.

"A CRITICAL UPDATE FOR OUR TOP SUPPORTERS: FiveThirtyEight’s Nate Silver just said Nevada is the most likely state to flip from blue to red this year.
This is a wake-up call, team, and we need to take immediate action — CLICK HERE TO GIVE $10 NOW!

Last week on the FiveThirtyEight Politics Podcast, top elections analyst Nate Silver was asked “Which state is most likely to flip from Democrats to Republicans?”
His answer? Nevada.
This development has put us on red-alert here at NV Dems.
We’re already working around the clock to reach voters with the information and resources they need to elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris — but now we need to double-down and make sure Nate Silver’s prediction doesn’t come true.

In 2016, FiveThirtyEight was one of the only modelers that gave Trump a decent shot at winning — and they were absolutely right.
So we’re taking this seriously, because like Joe Biden always tells us, we can’t afford 4 more years of Trump — which means we can’t underestimate the GOP again:

The team here at NV Dems is fighting tooth and nail to expand access to the ballot box and to break Democratic turnout records across the state. We’re pushing back against Trump and the GOP’s voter suppression operations in battleground states like ours — and we’re winning.
But the National Republican Committee Chair herself said Nevada is absolutely “in play” for Trump — and the GOP is putting its money where its mouth is by investing big in advertising and flooding states like Nevada with staffers.
I know our Democratic grassroots strength can overpower their big spending, but the GOP will jump on any sign of weakness on our upcoming FEC report.
Don’t let that happen — rush a donation of $10 or more immediately!

What we saw this week, both here in Nevada and in Georgia, should be a giant red flag for all Americans.
Voters heading to the polls on Tuesday were met with hours-long wait times, understaffed polling places and, in some locations in Georgia, no staff at all.

Tuesday's primary election chaos is exactly what we were trying to avoid when we sued the state to improve voting by mail, allow for voter assistance, and expand the number of in-person polling locations.

"Last week, Trump threatened to withhold federal grants from Nevada because we're expanding vote-by-mail and making it safer for voters to participate in our democracy.
Do you agree Trump's attacks directly threaten the integrity of our elections? YES NO
In case you missed it, Trump took to Twitter last week to threaten outrageous (and undemocratic) consequences for Nevada — all because we're on the frontlines of the fight to expand access to the ballot box and make voting as safe as possible in our upcoming elections.
Trump believes that making voting safer and easier is the same as trying to ""cheat in elections"" and he wants to punish Nevadans.
The entire NV Dems team was outraged by Trump's blatant attempt at voter suppression and we need to hear from you about it:
Do you agree that Trump's threat to withhold federal grant funding over Nevada's vote-by-mail program is a direct threat to our voting rights? YES NO
Last month, NV Dems joined the Democratic National Committee, Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and Priorities USA in filing a suit to expand voting access in Nevada.
We're committed to making voting safe and accessible to every voter in our state.
Trump, on the other hand, views any effort to elevate the voice of the voter as a direct threat to his chances of winning in November.

"Donald Trump is coming to Nevada, again.
The last time he was here, he held a MAGA rally, indoors, with barely any masks in sight.
Not only that, he lied about it on national television –– once again downplaying the severity of the coronavirus pandemic.
It’s all about money and ratings for him, never about public safety.
But still, polls show Trump and Biden neck-and-neck in our state and with Trump in Nevada to rally his troops once again, we must prove this is Biden country. Click here to rush a $15 donation RIGHT NOW →

He has downplayed this virus and failed to lead to combat this pandemic since day one.
Since his last visit to Nevada, Trump and at least 22 of his top advisors and inner circle have tested positive for COVID-19 after he held a superspreader event at the White House.
Instead of pulling a campaign stunt by holding another MAGA rally in our state, Trump should focus on getting relief to Nevada families who are suffering because of his failure to lead.

Nevadans are fed up with Trump’s skewed priorities and we will vote him out come November.

"Donald Trump is holding a rally in my district this weekend.
He announced, canceled, and un-canceled the rally trying to find a venue that will accommodate a dangerous crowd in the middle of a pandemic – and now he's settled on holding the event in my hometown.
Trump will try to rally for my opponent: Nevada’s last Republican in the House, Rep. Mark Amodei. Trump calls Amodei a “warrior” for his agenda.

It's true: even contributing just $5 will help with our capacity to reach more than 10 voters.
Our state is a battleground and everyone knows it, including Trump.
On Tuesday the Trump campaign even admitted when campaigning in Nevada, they'll be ""playing on Joe Biden's field"".
That's why his team is pouring all their resources into spreading falsehoods and lies about Joe Biden and the Democratic party.
They will do whatever it takes to paint our state red — and usually, we would have our field staff ready to combat their misinformation campaigns by knocking on doors and talking to voters face to face.
But campaigning today is different from in the past, and we need your help to adjust to the new normal. Are you in?

"You may have seen RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel amplified Trump’s dangerous claims that Democrats are trying to “steal” the election by expanding access to the ballot box.
After, our very own NV State Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro had the perfect response – and made a strong argument for why we need your help to respond to these attacks and protect the voice of the voter in our battleground state:
@Nicole4Nevada: I'll be damned if I'm going to let a partisan hack like you use this pandemic to suppress Nevadans' right to vote. Nevada will have a free, fair and secure election this November.
The GOP’s strategy is clear: distract voters from Trump’s catastrophic pandemic response and plummeting poll numbers by spreading lies about our election integrity.
But Nicole’s right, team – we CANNOT let them use the pandemic to further suppress the voice of the voter and jeopardize our election integrity.

One thing is clear: Donald Trump’s re-election campaign just isn’t going well, even in battleground states.
The repeated failures of his administration, the hateful rhetoric of his presidency, and the dangerous decisions he’s made since entering office are all finally catching up with him.
But Trump’s getting desperate and he’s going to use the only tool he has left: massive spending.
National Republicans are still raking in cash across the board and now we’re seeing how they intend on spending that money → in battlegrounds like Nevada.
Showing up for our movement has never been so important. This is the most consequential election of our lifetime and Trump is doing everything in his power to drown out our message. We have to fight back.

The results of our primary election this month speak for themselves.
* Democrats now have a 6% advantage among registered voters in Nevada over the GOP.
* Statewide, Democrats led in overall turnout by more than 16,000 votes.
* 66,000+ more Democrats participated in the 2020 primary election compared to the 2018 election — and over 110,000 more Democrats compared to 2016.
Bottom line? NV Dems are in the strongest position we've ever been heading into a general election — but all that work will be for nothing if GOP mega-donors and dark money groups find weaknesses in our grassroots network.

"Folks,
When I spoke at the Democratic Convention four years ago, I said, “When Trump decided to run for president, he probably said to himself: ‘I’m an egomaniac. I don’t believe in science. I think women are inferior. Where would I feel at home?’ ”
Since that day, Trump has proved me right time and again. He has tried to reshape America in his own image – and he has made it clear he will stop at nothing to hold on to power.
The upcoming election is the most important in our lifetime and we must come together to elect Joe Biden and usher in big wins for Democrats up and down the ballot. Click here to join me in supporting NV Dems to make 2020 a change election.

From his failure to respond to COVID-19 to his attacks on healthcare and women’s rights to his systematic dismantling of voting rights – Donald Trump has proven he is unfit to lead this nation for another four years.
As the former Senate Majority Leader, I know firsthand the crucial role Nevada plays in the presidential election – and I am not alone. Even the Nevada GOP has admitted when campaigning in Nevada, Donald Trump is “playing on Biden’s field.”

Trump lied when he downplayed the risk of the virus in February – and he’s lying now. His only goal is to win by any means necessary, even when it means putting American lives at risk.
Just weeks ago, Trump was here in Nevada for an INDOOR rally of his supporters, where there was very little social distancing and even less mask-wearing, despite state regulations.

"LAST CHANCE: Chip in $10 before Trump takes the stage tonight to fund our Voter Education Program and counteract the lies told at the GOP convention!
Quick update:
Tonight is the final night of the Trump Show (aka the GOP convention), and Trump is about to take the stage, giving an explicitly political speech directly from the White House.
Night after night this week, we’ve watched Trump and his allies spread lies about Democrats. Instead of discussing their vision for the country, they’ve taken aim at leaders and activists who are challenging Trump on the most important issues currently facing our country.
We have just a few hours left before our deadline to fund our Voter Education Program and we need our supporters to come together and show Republicans Nevada will not be fooled into believing their lies. Can you chip in $10 right away and help raise the final $6,312 we need for our Voter Education Program to set the record straight after the RNC’s onslaught of misinformation?
Democrats have the upper hand: we have the vision, we have the platform, and we have Joe and Kamala at the helm.
But we need your support to counter all the lies and misinformation that have come out of the last few days. If you saved your information, clicking any button below will cause your donation to process instantly:

Tonight, as the GOP’s top lie-maker takes the stage, it’s important to remember not just what Democrats are fighting against, but what we’re fighting for: access to health care, a coordinated and thoughtful response to the global pandemic, economic security, and a leader we can all respect.
That leader is not Trump.

Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, Democratic National Convention
SUPPORT NV DEMS
On Monday, Senator Catherine Cortez Masto made it clear at the Democratic National Convention: our party — and our state — are ready, willing, and able to take on Trump and the GOP in November.
It's true — all roads to victory move through our battleground state. This isn't insider gossip — it’s conventional wisdom: Nevada is an essential part of the electoral map.
That’s why the Team Trump bus tour made a pit stop in our state, and why Trump attacked Governor Sisolak for securing universal mail-in-voting.
They’re desparately trying to make a play for Nevada.
We can’t let them win. We need 5,000 of our top supporters to chip in RIGHT NOW and help us BREAK fundraising records before the convention ends on Thursday.

Trump can’t stand all the attention Democrats are receiving this week.
That’s why he’s hosting a series of in-person events all across Wisconsin — putting lives at risk during COVID-19 just to win the news cycle.
He only cares about one thing: winning and holding on to power.
And he’s not above putting your life at risk to do it. We have to show him just how wrong he is. Click here to chip in a donation of $10 or more RIGHT AWAY and prove Nevada Democrats are ready for the battle of a lifetime this November.

"TRUMP KNEW how dangerous COVID-19 was MONTHS ago, downplaying the risk and jeopardizing millions of Americans’ health in the process.
HE KNEW  how reckless it was to hold the final night of the Republican National Convention in-person on the White House lawn, without mandating social distancing or masks.

It’s no surprise that the same president who knowingly downplayed the risks of a global pandemic for his own political purposes continues to hold dangerous in-person events that endanger our communities.

After four long years, Democrats finally have the opportunity to end the Trump Administration and start solving the many crises it created. As our party gathers virtually for the convention, we know there’s no shortage of issues that need to be covered.
With Joe, Kamala, and Democrats from all across the country getting ready to take the stage (virtually, of course), we want to know what issues are top-of-mind for you. Will you take our 2020 Convention Survey and share your insights as we’re gearing up for the next few days?

But with Trump botching every issue his administration has ever touched, we want to hear about what’s top-of-mind for you and your family right now.
TAKE THE SURVEY
There’s no doubt about it: Trump and his administration will leave a legacy of mismanagement and corruption – and it’s up to Democrats to correct their many wrongdoings and missteps.
All eyes are on our battleground state as we kick off the convention – which is why your insight is so valuable. Joe and Kamala are depending on us to work together and share our ideas for the country – what do you say?

Donald Trump announced he is withdrawing the United States from the World Health Organization (WHO), the specialized agency under the United Nations responsible for international public health.
The United States contributes about $400 million annually and is the World Health Organization's largest contributor.
Withdrawing that funding now, in the middle of a pandemic, puts hundreds of millions of people across the world in jeopardy and will only contribute to our current global humanitarian crisis.

Not only would withdrawing the United States from the WHO have severe repercussions on our fight against COVID-19, but it would also drastically impact resources for countries battling other deadly viruses like Ebola, Polio, and HIV.

After Trump took to Twitter to lash out about NV Dems’ fight to expand access to the ballot box here in Nevada, we knew we had to fight back.
Trump and his GOP allies know Nevada is a key battleground in their effort to cling to power and they’re already deploying hundreds of staffers and MILLIONS of dollars to flip states like ours red.

"I just finished watching our next president, Joe Biden, in his first debate as our presidential nominee.
And let me tell you –– I could not be more motivated to elect the historic Biden/Harris ticket and make Trump a one-term president.
I bet you feel the same way which is why I’m sharing Shelby’s email from this weekend in case you didn’t see it.
We still need to raise $12,938 ahead of tomorrow’s FEC deadline. Click here to make a 100% matched donation of $10 or more to help us send Joe and Kamala to the White House!

I know we've been asking a lot of you — but it's important.
With only three days to go until the final major FEC deadline of the election, we need all of our supporters to come together and show us (and our opponents) just what they're made of.
DONATE
We are on the precipice of real, actionable change. If we play our cards right, and don't leave anything to chance in our key battleground state, then there's no doubt in my mind that Donald Trump's days in the White House are numbered.
But that leaves absolutely NO room for error.
If you've been waiting to give, now is your time. All donations are instantly DOUBLED. That's right — your contribution will have double the impact and go twice as far.  If you saved your information, clicking any button below will cause your donation to process instantly:

Trump and the GOP will be scouring these FEC reports as soon as they're available. They're looking for any signs of weakness in Democrats' grassroots support.  They've never found any before.
Let's make sure they don't find any this time, either.
Contribute $10 right away and help us make our goal of $49,219 — we're slowly getting closer, but we need your help to ensure that we make it →
Thanks!

"Team,
THE FEC DEADLINE IS JUST A FEW HOURS AWAY!
We’re closing the books tonight at midnight and getting ready to file our public report for everyone to see — including Trump and his cronies.
Before he takes a look at our grassroots power, it’s important that we make our goal. We want to make sure that he doesn’t like what he sees.
We need your help in these final hours to raise just $2,091. Can you rush a donation of $10 right now (don’t forget — it’s matched!) and help us finish off one of the most important fundraising deadlines before the election?

Trump knows he is on the cusp of losing our battleground state, which is why he’s devoting so much time and energy to suppressing the vote.
The FEC deadline is the perfect opportunity, just as voters begin casting their ballots, to send a resounding message to Trump that he cannot and will not — no matter how much money he spends or what dirty tactics he employs — win the support of Nevadans.
Will you be a voice in sending that resounding message?
Let’s show them what we’re made of:

"FIRST: Trump traveled to Nevada for a COVID-unsafe, indoor rally of his supporters, putting our communities at risk.
THEN: Trump doubled-down on his stance that COVID-19 isn’t a serious threat, even after he and several other GOP leaders tested positive.

Team,
From downplaying the risks of COVID-19 to score political points, to threatening access to health care during a pandemic, to instructing the American people not to be afraid of a virus that has life-threatening consequences…it’s clear: Trump cares more about his odds of winning than our odds of survival.

For months now, Republicans have gone on Fox News and feigned outrage over Democrats' serious response to the COVID-19 pandemic – which has taken hundreds of thousands of American lives already.
And for months now, they’ve been supported and encouraged by their reckless leader in the White House, who proudly ignored health guidelines for months and ultimately tested positive for COVID-19, along with dozens of administration officials and other GOP leaders.
Trump’s actions are dangerous, irresponsible, and a stain on the fabric of this country. Can you help us mobilize Democrats with just DAYS left in the election?
Just imagine: wouldn’t it be nice to elect leaders who got it right the first time around?

"Hi there,
I don’t usually do this, but I got a finance update from Tyler this morning and I wanted to loop you in.
The FEC deadline is tonight at midnight and we’re still nearly $10,000 away from our goal — can you chip in a matched contribution of $10 or more immediately to help close the gap?

Thanks so much for helping out on this crucial deadline as we enter the final weeks of our fight to defeat Trump!

Hey Emma,
I know it’s early, but I just ran the numbers and we’re still behind on our FEC goal by $9,964. Since this is the last public filing most voters will see before casting their ballots, it’s urgent we close the gap. Can you reach out to a few of our top supporters and see if they can chip in?
Thanks!
