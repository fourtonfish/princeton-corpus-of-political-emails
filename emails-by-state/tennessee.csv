I know that, like me, you believe in a strong, prosperous America.
That is why it is so important to include you to help keep our Senate Majority! With control of the White House on the line, these radical groups are greatly ratcheting up their need to take control of our government.
As a matter of fact, AOC said this yesterday. “We all need to be more courageous and we all must act in unprecedented ways to make sure that our rights are stabilized,"" she added. ""And to Mitch McConnell, we need to tell him that he is playing with fire.
And they will continue to take their lies and brainwashing to the extreme to undermine the core unity of the American people.
Now, I ask that you stand with me, your fellow Tennesseans to battle to KEEP Republicans Elected by chipping in here.

Chairman Scott Golden,info@tngop.org,Presidential Debate,"Tennessee Republican Party
Friend,
Statement from the Tennessee Republican Party Chair, Scott Golden, on former Vice President Joe Biden's selection of Senator Kamala Harris as his running mate for the 2020 campaign.
""It goes without saying that the selection of Senator Kamala Harris as Biden's running mate is an important decision. The Biden campaign's persistence to have the former Vice President remain in his basement for the better part of 2020 adds to the pressure of making the right choice,"" said Scott Golden.
""Unfortunately, a Senator Kamala Harris pick proves that the Biden campaign is completely controlled by the radical left of the Democratic party. The days of good, old ""UNCLE"" Joe are long gone and have been replaced by a mob bent on raising taxes, radical theories, ransacking America,"" continued Golden.
""I have faith that when the voters examine both candidates and campaigns they will come to the conclusion that only one person can make and keep America great... President Donald Trump,"" concluded Golden.
But here's a hard truth: the Democrats probably had their biggest fundraising day of the year yesterday.
Now it's up to us to choose how we'll respond.
KEEP TN RED *DONATE*
This is our chance to show the radical Democrats, how STRONG our political operation is. Can I count on you?

In August, Democrats pulled out all the stops – including Hollywood celebrities and gimmicks - to boost Joe Biden’s campaign.
The race has tightened and with 54 days to go, the enthusiasm remains on the side of President Trump.
From the very first day of this Administration, President Trump has fought to lower taxes, secure our borders, protect the unborn, and defend our great law enforcement. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are promising to do the EXACT opposite.
Friend, we need your support if we’re going to stay on track this month and have the resources to continue outpacing these HOLLYWOOD MEGA DONORS.

Friend --
America’s rule of law is under attack by radical Democrats who are siding with the mob and seek to defund our police.
The far left is working hard to handicap our nation’s police forces, all at the behest of violent anarchists who tear down our statues, take over entire city blocks, and assail courthouses and police departments.
Now more than ever, we need to support Republican leaders who will fight back against the far left to defend our police officers, the rule of law, and our way of life.
DONATE to the Tennessee Republican Party today to DEFEND THE RULE OF LAW.
Please chip in whatever you can afford to support our general election campaign to Keep the VICTORY in Tennessee.

* Small businesses and workers were provided much needed relief through the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) and coronavirus relief payments.

* Joe Biden opposed the China travel ban and called it “xenophobic” during a campaign event in Iowa.
* Dr. Fauci has dismissed the ridiculous claims in Bob Woodward’s book.

* March 22: Dr. Anthony Fauci: the Trump administration’s coordinated response has been “impressive…all hands on deck” 24/7.
* March 24: Dr. Anthony Fauci sets the record straight: “there are not differences, the president has listened to what I have said.”
* April 2: Dr. Anthony Fauci: President Trump “always understood the seriousness” of the coronavirus “from the beginning.”
* April 13: Dr. Anthony Fauci corrects media spin: President Trump followed health recommendations every time they were made.

We sent our elected officials to D.C. to represent us in Congress and work tirelessly to solve important issues.
Now, Nancy Pelosi is breaking our constitution by allowing Members of Congress to ""vote by proxy"" in which case they can have a colleague of theirs cast their vote for them.
This is unconstitutional and sets a terrible precedent for the future of policy-making.
As Steve Scalise said, ""This isn't Ferris Bueller's Day Off. It's the United States Congress.""
Members of Congress are essential workers. We must defend our constitution by keeping Republicans in office that will NOT tolerate such nonsense.

Have you seen Nancy Pelosi's 3 trillion $ liberal wishlist that passed the U.S. House last week? She is trying to sneak her liberal agenda into the next stimulus package for COVID-19 recovery. In case you missed it, heres a rundown:
-Provides PLANNED PARENTHOOD with stimulus $ to fund abortions
-Allows ILLEGAL immigrants to receive stimulus checks
-Extends unemployment bonuses until Jan. 2021
-Motivates Americans to stay at home and live off federal government
Overall, the HEROES Act would give democrats a ""Christmas in May' and would be wreck-less for the American people.
Can we count on you to support conservative values and donate to the Tennessee Republican Party TODAY?

Mary Mancini,hello@tndp.org,"Remembering 9/11, Spotlight on candidate Heidi Campbell, & TNDP Veterans Speak Out","19 Years Later, Never Forget; Veterans Statement on Trump's Comments; Candidate Spotlight: Heidi Campbell; Gov. Bill Lee's secret no-bid contracts
Dear Tennessee Democrat,
Tennessee Republicans aren’t interested in doing the hard work of governance. They abuse the tools of democracy not to Perfect our Union but to benefit themselves. It’s why they called a special legislative session to attack the 1st Amendment. It’s why these use government contracts to send kickbacks to their companies.
There's only one solution: we have to send the GOP packing. And we have the right candidates do it. Meet Heidi Campbell, Mayor of Oak Hill and your next senator for State Senate District 20.
With an MBA from Vanderbilt's Owen School of Business, Heidi has the experience to be fiscally responsible and guide our state through this economic downturn. She's a savvy businesswoman who ascended to become an executive in the music industry. As Mayor of Oak Hill, she balanced every single budget - even adding $1.6 million to city reserves.
Money is tight for everyone. We need to do more with less. As a State Senator, Heidi Campbell will make the tough decisions necessary to keep our state running efficiently and effectively.
We get why the GOP is panicking right now. We would be, too, if we had to campaign against candidates like Heidi. She, along with our slate of strong women candidates \- led by Marquita Bradshaw at the top of the ticket \- are going to give Tennessee Republicans a run for their money.
Election day is November 3rd and early voting starts October 14th. It's up to you to help change things so remember to mask up and make a plan to VOTE EARLY DURING EARLY VOTING.
See you at the polls,
Mary Mancini
Chair, Tennessee Democratic Party
PS - Heidi is asking you to join her in this campaign. Whether it's your time, energy, or resources, all are essential to make sure she wins in District 18. Join her campaign now.

# 19 YEARS LATER, NEVER FORGET
""19 years later, the agonizing pain of that fateful day still reverberates. We refuse to forget the collective pain we all felt and we know the world joins us in honoring the thousands who lost their lives, the brave first responders who ran headfirst into unimaginable danger, and the families and communities who sacrificed so much.
Nearly two decades later, we can also see that out of the ashes left behind on that awful day, we did what America does when we are at our best - we stood united in the face of a common enemy. We comforted those in need and then made sure that love and resilience drowned out hatred and fear. The ultimate message we sent out into the world during the last 19 years - the best of times and the worst of times \- is that no enemy from within or without who can destroy the promise and ideals on which this country was built. We will never forget."" - Mary Mancini, Chair, Tennessee Democratic Party

# GOVERNOR LEE'S SECRET
# NO BID CONTRACTS
The Tennessee Emergency Management Agency has gone on an $80 million spending spree on no-bid contracts. Crucial health product contracts for masks have been doled out to companies with political connections.
During this public health crisis, securing personal protective equipment (PPE) at low prices through competitive bidding is crucial- it saves us money when the budget is tight. Unfortunately, Governor Bill Lee and Tenenssee Republicans used a secretive no-bid contracting process to purchase this much needed equipment.
How bad is it? The furniture company owned by Republican state Rep. Jerry Sexton was awarded a no-bid contract to make hospital gowns for the state for $165,000. According to investigative reporter Phil Williams, ""Sexton's price per gown -- $5.50 -- was almost double the price charged by other vendors.""
This complete lack or transparency is not new for Gov. Lee. Remember the time in February when he awarded ""a no-bid, over-the-budget contract to an outside vendor for the implementation of school vouchers?""
More to come...

Brandon Thomas,hello@tndp.org,A July 4th Message From Brandon Thomas: Fulfilling The Promise of Freedom,"""As a Black man, I still celebrate the 4th as a commemoration of the possibility of America, a possibility I still believe in."" - Brandon Thomas, Candidate, TN State House District 49
#
# AN INDEPENDENCE DAY MESSAGE FROM BRANDON THOMAS,
DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE FOR STATE HOUSE DISTRICT 49
Dear Tennessee Democrat,
This weekend Tennesseans across the state will celebrate the 4th of July. It’s a day to celebrate freedom, but it also brings up some complicated feelings for people of color, especially Black folks, who know that freedom did not come for us all on July 4th, 1776.
As a Black man, I still celebrate the 4th as a commemoration of the possibility of America, a possibility I still believe in. Today, I see so many people in this state fighting hard to realize Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s “Beloved Community,” and I think the 4th of July is the perfect day to celebrate this work.
My feelings toward the 4th mirror Dr. King’s reflections on the holiday:
""When the architects of our great republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. [...]
It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note insofar as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given its colored people a bad check, a check that has come back marked 'insufficient funds.'
But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. So we have come to cash this check, a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and security of justice.""
We know that our country and our state can be so much more than it is now, and it’s through continuing to fight to ensure that we elect leaders who will cash that check and pressure the defiant to cash that check that we fulfill the promise of America.
Happy 4th of July! May we all continue fighting to cash that check.
Fighting for freedom with you,
Brandon Thomas

Dear Tennessee Democrat,
Cory, Cory, Cory! He's a leader in the Black community, a fierce advocate for criminal justice reform, a former presidential candidate, and he will be the keynote speaker for Tennessee Democratic Party's Three Star Celebration.
Our largest annual fundraiser, Three Star is a tradition for Tennessee Democrats and every year we set a theme for each of the three stars on the Tennessee Star Flag. This year, the first star represents the 100th anniversary of the ratification of the 19th amendment (Tennessee was the 36th state to vote yes and has been known since then as ""The Perfect 36"") The second star represents the 60th anniversary of the Nashville sit-ins and desegregation of downtown lunch counters. The third star celebrates our future and will feature the Democratic candidates and local elected officials who represent the future of our great state.
This year, Three Star will be virtual, with a great lineup of elected Democrats, candidates, and musical performances who will join Senator Booker. All proceeds raised will go directly to supporting candidates in the 2020 election cycle.
You won't want to miss this: PURCHASE YOUR TICKETS OR SPONSOR THREE STAR NOW!
THANK YOU!

# MEET YOUR U.S. SENATE CANDIDATE,
# MARQUITA BRADSHAW!
Kansas City or Memphis Barbeque? Colts or Titans? Marquita Bradshaw or Bill Hagerty?
Often in life, choices are difficult. But this one's easy: Memphis Barbeque, Titans football, and Marquita Bradshaw.
Marquita Bradshaw isn't a career politician. She's an outsider. She grew up dealing with the issues she's running on, not commenting upon them from an Ivory Tower.
Her parents raised her in a family-focused neighborhood on the South Side of Memphis. They lived paycheck-to-paycheck, swimming upstream in more ways than one.
She grew up a stone's throw away from a toxic waste dump, putting her family and her community at great risk of life-threatening illness, like the cancer that killed her great grandmother. As her family and neighbors suffered because of their proximity to industrial poisons, they were also strained economically by a broken healthcare system that monetized disease and suffering instead of wellness and prevention, declining wages, waning economic mobility, and a War on Drugs riddled with racism.
Marquita expereinced these injustices and decided to do something. She became a grassroots activist, seeking to give voice to the voiceless across a number of issue areas—organizing for labor and environmental justice.
Marquita is bringing that same energy to her bid for U.S. Senate by campaigning on the most pressing problems Tennesseans face today: a sky-high uninsured rate, a warming planet, and an unfair criminal justice system. As Tennessee's first Black woman Senator (and the nation's third), she'll bring the people's voice to the Senate floor and represent communities that for too long have been denied a seat at the table.
Election day is November 3rd and early voting starts October 14th. Marquita is asking you to join her in this campaign. Whether it's your time, energy, or money, all are essential to make sure she wins. Join her campaign now and let's send Marquita to the Senate.
See you at the polls,
Mary Mancini
Chair, Tennessee Democratic Party

Mary Mancini,hello@tndp.org,"Candidate Couch, Happy #901 Day, Joe in Keno(sha),  & Vote Early During Early Voting","39 days until Early Voting. 59 days until Election Day. It's never too early to make your plan to #MaskUp, #StaySafe, and vote early during early voting.
Dear Tennessee Democrat,
For almost a decade, Tennessee Republicans have wielded unchecked power in Tennessee. But this year, Tennessee Democrats are terrifying the opposition with a slate of amazing candidates who are running to take power back and bring some much-needed balance to our government.
Why are Republicans so nervous and scrambling to protect their stranglehold on the State? Because we have formidable candidates like Virginia Couch—our Democratic candidate for HD18—and all they have are political flip-floppers and far right extremists.
In the next session of the state legislature, we need leaders who have firsthand experience navigating an economy devastated by COVID-19. Virginia is a scrappy small business owner who invested in a company during the depths of the Great Recession and transformed it into a thriving business. And now she's guiding her company through these difficult economic times.
Virginia will use her private sector experience to get Knox County growing again. She will promote small business initiatives, including increasing access to affordable financing for women and minority-owned businesses. She'll attract high-value industries such as advanced manufacturing to the state. And, because she recognizes that improving the financial lives of working men and women increases their ability to have a better life for themselves and their families, she'll work to establish a state minimum wage.
We get why the GOP is panicking right now. We would be, too, if we had to campaign against candidates like Virginia. She, along with our slate of strong women candidates \- led by Marquita Bradshaw at the top of the ticket \- are going to give Tennessee Republicans a run for their money.
Election day is November 3rd and early voting starts October 14th. It's up to you to help change things so remember to mask up and make a plan to VOTE EARLY DURING EARLY VOTING.
See you at the polls,
Mary Mancini
Chair, Tennessee Democratic Party
PS - Virginia is asking you to join her in this campaign. Whether it's your time, energy, or resources, all are essential to make sure she wins in District 18. Join her campaign now.

# JOE BIDEN GOES TO KENOSHA
Joe Biden went to Kenosha to comfort the family of Jacob Blake, yet another Black American victim of excessive force by a police officer. He grieved with them and listened to their concerns. Joe Biden understands grief, understands pain. And when he sees it, he seeks to heal it. He drew on his faith in delivering a moving speech at the Grace Lutheran Church in Kenosha.
In a statement, Ben Crump, the attorney representing Jacob Blake, said ""the family was grateful for the meeting and was very impressed that the Bidens were so engaged and willing to really listen.""
Trump’s visit to Kenosha was a political stunt that was all about him. He didn’t meet with protestors, civil rights activists, or the Blake family - or even mention Jacob Blake’s name - and refused to acknowledge the issues of systemic racism and police violence.
Unlike Trump, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will not only listen but will deliver for the Blake family and so many others affected by systemic racism by working to heal this divided nation, and confront the systemic racism that is at the root of police brutality and too many fatal shootings.

# TNDP THREE STAR CELEBRATION
# COMING SOON
Later this month, the Tennessee Democratic Party will hold our largest fundraiser of the year - virtually, of course - to help us continue our work to elect more Democrats in the state. The name of the event, the Three Star Celebration, is based on Tennessee’s Tri-Star flag, and every year a theme is assigned to each of three stars. In 2020:
* The first star represents the 100th anniversary of the ratification of the 19th amendment (Tennessee was the 36th state to vote yes and has been known since then as ‘The Perfect 36’.)
* The second star represents the 60th anniversary of the Nashville sit-ins and desegregation of downtown lunch counters.
* The third star celebrates our future and we will feature the Democratic candidates and local elected officials who represent the diversity of Tennessee and the future of our great state.
Tickets on sale soon!

# CHIP IN TO TURN OUT THE VOTE
In 2018 Tennessee Democratic voter turnout increased in all 95 counties - in some places as much as 25%. With the right investment and messaging strategy we know we can flip seats in November. Targeted media will help mobilize Democrats to vote, vote early, and vote safely - but we need help covering costs.
We’ve already assembled an amazing team to help us Get Out The Vote and support our diverse and talented roster of candidates. Now we need to focus on voter turnout. Targeted messaging and media are more critical than ever because of COVID-19. The GOP thinks that they have Tennessee on lock but we’re going to prove them wrong.
Will you make a donation right now, and help us pay for the media strategy needed to flip these crucial seats?

Emily Cupples,emily@tndp.org,things are different,"Friend,
We need your help right now. With all that has been going on, our fundraising numbers aren’t where they need to be. We have to raise $6,734 to meet our March goal and we only have until midnight tonight.
Social distancing is changing the way we have to do things. Fundraising events for now aren’t possible, which means we really have to rely on online donations like never before. We’re doing absolutely everything we can to support and elect Democrats, but we need your help. Will you make a donation right now if you can, and help us reach our goal?
I've attached Mary's note from yesterday just in case you missed it. She discusses in greater detail how we are making changes to stay ahead of the curve throughout this crisis. Everyone stay safe and wash your hands!

How are you holding up? We hope you and your loved ones are taking care of each other during these extraordinary times and getting the support you need.
At the Tennessee Democratic Party, we are working from home, adjusting to this new normal, and staying ahead of the curve. There’s so much work to be done and we are lucky to have such a dedicated team. We’re also lucky and grateful to have such strong support from Tennessee Democrats like you.
As we shift our organizing efforts to digital over the next few weeks and months, we have already started to invest in infrastructure to meet growing needs.
For example:
* Our Political Director, Evan Latt, is sharing digital campaign training resources with our candidates.
* Maria Brewer, our Party Affairs Director, came up with a process for holding virtual delegate selection conventions that is a model for other state Democratic Parties facing the same task.
* In the field, we are training our county parties in online meetings and organizing, and offering our candidates online campaign trainings.
* Every Thursday, through Facebook Live, I'll be sitting down with candidates on the 2020 ballot to discuss campaign priorities and also give viewers a chance to ask candidates questions about their platform.
The 2020 election cycle is going to be different. We’ve accepted that. Digital organizing is going to be more crucial than ever during this crisis. That’s why we are getting ahead by ramping up our digital efforts now – connecting with our candidates, volunteers, and voters.
A crucial part of that effort is fundraising. Tomorrow is the end of the quarter and we are behind. We need to raise $8,670 to meet our goal and we need your help. Will you make a contribution right now, if you can, and help us cross the finish line?
Thank you,

Y’all, we are SO close. With your generosity we’re now only $2,080 away from this month’s goal. We’ve got until midnight tomorrow. Can you help us get there?
Last week Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee introduced a ‘Tennessee Fetal Heartbeat Bill’ that would ban all abortions after 6 weeks (at which point a lot of women don’t even know they’re pregnant yet) including ones based on a Down syndrome diagnosis or a diagnosis of a fetal abnormality. No politician, should insert themselves in the middle of the decision to end a pregnancy, choose adoption, or raise a child. Those decisions belong to a woman, her family and her faith, in consultation with her doctor or health care provider.
We need to elect Democrats so this sort of invasive legislation doesn’t get passed. That’s why the TNDP is putting so much effort towards finding and supporting candidates that share our vision of a better future for Tennessee. That’s why we need your support right now – so we can meet our goal this month and continue our mission. Can you help us right now, with whatever you can afford?
Thank you,

Subject: an explanation
Friend,
I’d like to ask for your help – we are $5,080 away from July’s fundraising goal and the clock runs out at midnight tomorrow. We’ve pushed our fundraising goals more than ever before this year and I think you know why.
Donald Trump and the Republican party have done more damage to this country in the past 4 years than we ever thought possible. From an absolute failure in handling the Covid-19 crisis, to voter suppression, to racist and violent extremism – things have gotten worse and it’s time for a change. And right now, that means electing Democrats.
From our digital program (DIGTHORP2020) to our voter protection program, the TNDP staff have been on the front lines like never before. They are working hard, doing everything they can to support Tennessee Democrats and Democratic candidates. Can you help support them by making a donation right now? Your support means everything.
Thank you,

For the TNDP it’s not just March, it’s every month! We are constantly putting all of our effort towards supporting and electing Democrats. We are constantly working towards a Tennessee for all of us. That’s why we’ve picked this month to do a push to increase our recurring donations, in honor of Every Month Madness. We set a goal of 800 new Grassroots Leaders this cycle and we’re 687 short.
Each donation is important, but a recurring donation means that we don’t have to wait and see. It means we can plan ahead and make sure we are being as efficient and smart as possible. It means we can do our jobs better.
Will you commit to a monthly recurring donation right now, and help us close the gap? It doesn’t have to be much. Every dollar counts.

We are scrambling to raise $10k this month to help cover our 2020 Voter Protection Program (VoPro2020). With the added uncertainty surrounding COVID-19, voter protection is more critical than ever. All Tennesseans should have the opportunity to vote their conscience, and do it safely.
Can you help us?
VoPro2020 breaks down into six key areas of focus.
·Universal Absentee Voting (Advocacy)
·Voter Roll Integrity
·Election Commission Monitoring
·Voter Education
·Early Voting Locations and Times
·Election Day Poll Watchers and Legal Boiler Room
Investing in this program today will ensure that we have the resources we need when we need them. In total this program is going to cost close to $60k between now and November - which is why we need to start now. We can’t afford to wait until the last minute.
Will you donate today, and help us make sure that every Democrat has a voice in Tennessee?
Thank you,

Mary Mancini,mary@tndp.org,TNDP Weekly Recap: History Made In t-Minus 4 Days,"Dear Friend,
You have the opportunity to cast your vote for our next President on Tuesday, March 3. Early voting for Democrats is up 32% compared to 2016, and we need to continue this momentum into Super Tuesday. Make a plan and go vote - our future depends upon it.
Elections have consequences. And while Tennessee families deserve elected officials who will pass legislation and fight for policies that foster a better quality of life for all, Republicans chose to focus on harming communities and families rather than addressing any immediate and impending danger.
America is on the brink of a serious virus outbreak. But on Thursday, Governor Bill Lee addressed the state for the third time this year, not about the coronavirus, but about his plan to put guns in the hands of the untrained and unlicensed, a sure way of perpetuating situations which have already caused so much carnage and slaughter of innocents in schools, churches, communities, and homes. Governor Lee’s plan for permitless gun carry means anyone can carry a concealed weapon without a background check. Anyone will be able to carry a gun into a school, hospital, church, or grocery store.
93% of Tennesseans, including Republicans and gun-owning households, support requiring a permit. Law enforcement and the military are against permitless carry. So why is Governor Lee pushing it? Why does he insist on putting Tennessee families at risk against the wishes of a vast majority of Tennesseans and law enforcement?
The coronavirus is a real threat to our families and country, yet the state’s leader and other Republicans in Nashville and DC choose their misplaced priorities over what’s best for us. We cannot afford to elect more politicians who gamble with lives.
You have the opportunity to cast your vote for our next President on Tuesday. Make a plan and go vote, our lives depend upon it.
See You At The Ballot Box,

# REPUBLICAN SENATOR BILL POWERS
# ENDANGERS HIS CONSTITUENTS
# Last year, Senator Bill Powers (R-Clarksville) campaigned for his special election seat saying a vote for him would be a vote against vouchers. Three hours after he was sworn in, he voted for vouchers.
#
Last week, just moments before Governor Bill Lee's permit-less carry announcement, Senator Powers was posing for pictures with an NRA lobbyist. His district is home to a military base, and we know that the military is not in favor of permitless gun carry as it endangers the lives of their personnel. It will be very interesting to see how Sen. Powers chooses to vote - with his constituents or with the NRA. .

TAKE ACTION
The most impactful thing you can do to make the change you want to see in Tennessee, is to vote. But we also have to have strong candidates running good campaigns if we want to win and that's where your investment in our work is crucial. It’s expensive to maintain and expand TNDP operations in an election year. Paying for things like election protection training, candidate recruitment efforts, and campaign support are expensive – that’s why every dollar you contribute helps us win elections and fight back.
Thank you!

Mary Mancini,mary@tndp.org,Thank You for Your Commitment to Safety and Democracy,"Friend,
This week we're dedicating our newsletter to you.
First, we know that for many, financial circumstances are very difficult right now. Which is why we are so thankful to all of you who contributed and helped us reach our $10,000 goal for state-of-the-art data visualization tools. Because of you, our candidates will have just one more tool to help them win in November. THANK YOU!
We've also seen a new level of creativity and ingenuity from our candidates and campaigns as we all find new ways to talk with voters in the midst of this pandemic. Campaigns are finding constituents, supporters are hosting virtual house parties, and candidates are flooding social media with their values, policy ideas, and brilliant thoughts on how to defeat the Republican supermajority in Tennessee and get Donald Trump out of the White House. Again, thank you.
Lastly, we've seen Democrats across the state prioritize Tennessee lives and push for safety first. We cannot thank you enough.
Again, we understand you may not be able to donate right now, but that doesn't mean you have to sit on the sidelines. There are so many opportunities to take meaningful action during this time by helping a candidate of your choice with peer-to-peer fundraising, hosting a virtual volunteer event, or making calls. Here are a few resources to help guide you through all the different ways you can help turn Tennessee blue:
* Visit our online website training hub to build your skills or get some ideas
* Volunteer remotely with a campaign near you
* Get to know your candidates every Thursday through Facebook Live for Cocktails and Questions
We applaud and thank every single one of you for your commitment to Tennessee lives and democracy during this time.
Thanks again,

Mary Mancini,mary@tndp.org,digital organizing ,"Friend,
How are you holding up? We hope you and your loved ones are taking care of each other during these extraordinary times and getting the support you need.
At the Tennessee Democratic Party, we are working from home, adjusting to this new normal, and staying ahead of the curve. There’s so much work to be done and we are lucky to have such a dedicated team. We’re also lucky and grateful to have such strong support from Tennessee Democrats like you.
As we shift our organizing efforts to digital over the next few weeks and months, we have already started to invest in infrastructure to meet growing needs.
For example:
* Our Political Director, Evan Latt, is sharing digital campaign training resources with our candidates.
* Maria Brewer, our Party Affairs Director, came up with a process for holding virtual delegate selection conventions that is a model for other state Democratic Parties facing the same task.
* In the field, we are training our county parties in online meetings and organizing, and offering our candidates online campaign trainings.
* Every Thursday, through Facebook Live, I'll be sitting down with candidates on the 2020 ballot to discuss campaign priorities and also give viewers a chance to ask candidates questions about their platform.
The 2020 election cycle is going to be different. We’ve accepted that. Digital organizing is going to be more crucial than ever during this crisis. That’s why we are getting ahead by ramping up our digital efforts now – connecting with our candidates, volunteers, and voters.
A crucial part of that effort is fundraising. Tomorrow is the end of the quarter and we are behind. We need to raise $8,670 to meet our goal and we need your help. Will you make a contribution right now, if you can, and help us cross the finish line?
Thank you,

# DECEMBER 19: A SPECIAL ELECTION FOR
# STATE HOUSE 77 & YOU CAN HELP
Next Thursday, December 19, voters in Tennessee State House District 77 (Dyer, Lake, and part of Obion County) will go to the polls in a special election to fill a vacant seat.
Democratic candidate Mike Smith is ready to fight for the voters of District 77 because he believes the rural way of life is worth fighting for. He believes that the people of West Tennessee have a right to their roots, a quality public education, and affordable healthcare.
Mike Smith knows that it's time beyond time for a state rep in West Tennessee who will listen more than he talks and will work across the aisle to solve problems instead of always blaming others. Mike will never engage in bullying or name calling, but instead will spend his time addressing the challenges that face West Tennessee.
This special election is all about turnout and it will take many conversations with voters to let voters know when and where they can vote. You can help! The TNDP has set up a virtual phone bank so that you can help to GET OUT THE VOTE from anywhere in the state (or the country!).
It's so easy. Virtual Phone Bank instructions can be found here. Access the virtual phone bank here.
If you are interested in canvassing and phone banking in the district or would like to make a donation, contact campaign manager: Deane Arganbright at [[URL REDACTED]] or 731-588-0681.

# UPDATE FROM THE DNC
A couple of weeks ago we told you about the DNC Unity Program, a new initiative to ensure Democrats enter the general election unified behind our eventual nominee and ready to defeat Trump in 2020. This week we received another memo highlighting additional work that the DNC are working on now to help state parties like the TNDP lay the groundwork for 2020 elections:
Data and Technology. The DNC has rebuilt their data infrastructure with a state-of-the-art, cloud-based data warehouse. They also continue to invest in the data itself to make sure our view of every voter and possible voter is accurate as possible with correct information like addresses and phone numbers, as well as integrating advanced data sets like demographic and behavioral modeling. They've modernized cybersecurity infrastructure to improve their own security posture, while helping state parties and campaigns do the same.
War Room. The DNC’s War Room is a rapid response operation with significant communications, research and digital components, staffed by dozens of operatives -- the majority of whom are veterans of the 2016 campaign who have been tracking Trump for years -- who work with hundreds of media outlets, surrogates, and online influencers to shape the narrative of the Trump presidency using reporter outreach, research, extremely localized content and disruptive online content, along with placing major stories about his record.
Research. The DNC is home to the largest and most experienced research team in Democratic politics who have been tracking Trump since 2015. They’ve built the world’s most comprehensive research file on Donald Trump - including “more than 7,000 lawsuits, volumes of Freedom of Information Act requests and thousands of hours of video footage.” This work began in 2015 and has continued without pause since the 2016 election.
Voter Protection. The DNC is building a voter protection infrastructure to protect Americans’ right to participate in a fair election-- including funding voter protection positions in battleground states, a national voter resource hub, and voter assistance hotline, as well as education, advocacy and organizing resources.
The bottom line: Democrats are preparing now to win in 2020.

# TENNESSEE: YOU ARE NOT FREE
IF YOU'RE NOT HEALTHY
“That all power is inherent in the people, and all free governments are founded on their authority, and instituted for their peace, safety, and happiness..."" The Constitution of the State of Tennessee
Even though the public comments were overwhelming against medicaid block grants and studies show that they will not expand health care coverage and will, in fact, lead to deep cuts to children’s coverage and access, Republican Governor Bill Lee is moving forward with his plan anyway.
The expansion of Medicaid in other states comparable to Tennessee has proven that with it more people received coverage and rural hospitals are six times less likely too close.
Yet, in a recent interview with Tennessee Holler, Governor Lee was asked how is rejecting $1 billion per year in Medicaid Expansion funds helping Tennessee's rural communities and the uninsured. His answer is basically, because I said so. WATCH HERE.
Pardon us for allowing our skepticism to show when the leader of the political party that hates government and who defended the decision ""to stockpile $732 million in federal anti-poverty funds reserved for families with children, saying the money would be put to use 'when the needs are there'"" says ""trust me.""

WASHINGTON: DEMOCRATS ARE BUSY
In America, nobody is above the law - not even the president. Congress must be able to engage in investigations of serious abuses of the public trust.
Trump abused the power of the presidency. He used the official powers of his office to pressure a foreign country to interfere in our election on his behalf, risking our national security in the process. That is a violation of his constitutional oath and an impeachable offense.
Trump obstructed justice. He violated his constitutional oath by impeding a congressional investigation and keeping the American people in the dark. Trump directed a concerted and unprecedented defiance of lawful subpoenas, at which point impeachment is the only remedy.
Congress had a constitutional duty to act.
And because Democrats can multi-task, while Trump is tweeting, Democrats in the House have passed nearly 400 bills, including bills to lower health care costs and prescription drug prices, raise wages, improve gun safety, clean up corruption, safeguard our elections, and more.
Meanwhile, Republicans in the Senate have refused to take up most of these bills, and Trump doesn’t have a plan to address these issues.
Trump has broken his promises on everything from infrastructure to gun safety to drug prices and more.

# ELECTION NEWS: 326 DAYS TO GO
The Cure for Democrats’ 2020 Terror: Voters who fear a Trump re-election can start rebuilding the blue wall now
""As much as people are obsessing over the primary, the work of donating and volunteering and showing up and getting involved - especially in state parties... is essential now,” said Wikler. “People often make panic donations in the last couple of weeks of a campaign. Certainly those donations are welcome, but at the end of a campaign all you can do is buy some more ads. If you make the panic donation a year out, it means that state parties and outside groups can hire more field organizers to train more volunteers to be able to reach out to more neighbors who might never get onto the get-out-the-vote lists unless the conversation starts months and months in advance.”
Marsha Blackburn Is Blocking Election-Security Bills & She's Proud of It
""Sens. Mark Warner (D-Va.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) asked for unanimous consent to pass three election-related bills. But they were blocked by Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), who noted that the unsuccessful attempt was the latest by Democrats to pass election security bills in the Senate ahead of 2020.""
Nearly 3,000 inactive voters purged from registration rolls in Williamson County
""Under state law, if a voter doesn't respond to a confirmation notice and then doesn't vote in the next two November elections, they'll be purged....'We purged a good many this year,' Gray said.""

Our Voter Protection program implements meticulously thought out strategy aligned with state of the art data integration to ensure the voices of ALL Tennesseans are heard.

Tennessee has more registered voters than ever before - over 4.4 million for this election! Now it's our job to make sure they show up to the polls and cast their ballots. We want to see record numbers, and for that we need your help.
Early voting is underway and there are less than 3 weeks until Election Day. Tonight at midnight is our last mid-month fundraising deadline, and we need to raise another $8,240. Every penny will go towards voter turnout, and making sure Democrats win every seat possible. The TNDP team across the state has done an incredible job of urging voters to make a plan to vote - now we need the resources to get them to the polls.
In an election as important as this, every vote matters. We could have more Tennesseans voting for Democrats in this election than in any election on record – but only with your support. Will you please donate, if you can afford to, and help us reach our goal to cover costs for voter turnout?

Mary Mancini,mary@tndp.org,"TNDP Weekly Recap: Even When Social Distancing, Democrats Work For The People","Dear Friend,
Shelter in place, social distancing, and Zoom meetings - these are extraordinary times that demand extraordinary actions. Democratic candidates, voters and elected officials are getting creative to meet every challenge that comes our way. We will not allow this pandemic to create any insurmountable road blocks during this historic election year.
It’s more important than ever that we continue our work of electing Democrats up and down the ballot and the TNDP will continue to share with you the valuable resources that will enable us to do so.
Great example: the Democratic National Committee’s digital organizing team shared with us this list of ways you can keep organizing in your community online by engaging your community, building relationships online, and holding virtual events. You can also email [[URL REDACTED]] and be sure to text ORGANIZE to 43367 to receive some more tips and to keep in touch.
At the TNDP, on short notice due to the onset of the Coronavirus Pandemic, the Tennessee Democratic Party had to pivot from in person congressional districts conventions to remote meetings and quickly organized 24 separate conference calls all on one day for selectors to choose DNC Delegates. Over 1500 Democrats across the state participated by phone in Tennessee Democratic Party Congressional District Conventions this past Saturday.
In Nashville, State Representatives and Senators were organizing to demand Governor Bill Lee be transparent and present a clear and effective plan of action in response to the COVID-19 crisis. In a letter to the Governor, Democratic legislators asked for the following:
* Shelter in place.
* Ensure Continuous Supplies of Personal Protective Equipment.
* Safeguard sufficient ventilators for critically ill patients.
* Provide sufficient testing.
* Provide safe temporary quarters for those who are infected.
* Expand the ranks of medical providers.
* Support those forced to stay at home.
* Establish clear guidance and a statewide plan.
Tennessee Republicans continue to refuse to take this matter seriously and are putting all of our lives at risk every single day. We're said it before and we'll say it again: A smart, effective government that keeps its people safe should be the goal of every elected representative we send to Washington and Nashville. If they can’t do the work necessary to protect us through these difficult times, they need to get out of the way and let someone else lead.
Leading with you,

# CELEBRATING ACA
# 10 YEAR ANNIVERSARY
This week marked the 10th Anniversary of Barack Obama signing the Affordable Care Act into law. Even though he has tried and failed to repeal it, Donald J. Trump relies heavily on ACA especially during this pandemic. Here's a quick list of some of the ways ACA is saving lives and protecting Americans:
* Essential Health Benefits: prescription drugs and hospitalization. Coronavirus testing and treatment are essential health benefits and must be covered by all ACA-compliant plans.
* Preexisting Conditions: anyone who contracts COVID-19 won't be subject to future discrimination.
* Expansion: more than 20 million Americans gained health coverage. People with insurance are much more likely to see a doctor when they are sick and to get the treatment they need.
* Created CDC Prevention and Public Health Fund: helps states prepare for disease outbreaks.
* Key Support for Rural Hospitals: between 2013 and 2015, hospitals’ uncompensated care costs decreased by $12 billion, or roughly 30 percent. As hospitals prepare for an influx in coronavirus patients, it is critical that they are paid for the treatment they provide.
The ACA’s impact is prevalent now more than ever. We applaud you for your work in saving American lives not just during your term, but, for decades to come after. Thank you Mr. President, Barack Obama

# HISTORIC REMOTE CONGRESSIONAL
# CONVENTIONS
In an historic election year, over 1500 Democrats across the state participated by phone in Tennessee Democratic Party Congressional District Conventions. On short notice due to the Coronavirus Pandemic, and in partnership with the DNC, the Tennessee Democratic Party quickly organized 24 seperate calls all on one day with over 1500 people participating.
Each Congressional District Conventions was attended by county selectors who joined together to elect their Congressional District Delegates to the DNC Convention in Milwaukee this summer. In total, 42 of the state’s 73 delegates were elected this past Saturday.
“Tennessee Democrats rallied in great numbers to participate in this important process. We saw the hunger for change on Super Tuesday, during the County Conventions held two weeks ago, and now we’ve seen it during Congressional District Conventions. People are turning out in historic numbers to participate in our democracy and vote Trump out of office in November.” - Mary Mancini, TNDP Chair

Dear Tennessee Democrat,
Over the past few weeks we've seen protest in support of racial equity, dismantling white supremacy, and ending police brutality in every part of the nation - and in every part of this great state.
Hundreds of people have turned out to march and peacefully protest in every corner of Tennessee, from our largest cities to our smallest towns.
Democrats across the state are joining Tennesseeans of all different backgroungs and demographics as they stand together to demand change.
Below are pictures shared with us from our county parties that make up just a small sample of what's happening across the state. THIS IS TENNESSEE - WE ARE TENNESSEE - and we're proud to be a part of this powerful and hopeful movement for change.

# THOUSANDS DEMAND REMOVAL OF
# NATHAN BEDFORD FORREST BUST
# GOVERNOR LEE AND GOP REFUSE
Tennessee House and Senate Democrats pushed bills to remove the Nathan Bedford Forrest Bust. Protestors, praised by President Obama, rallied outside demanding it be removed. Thousands took to social media, including Reese Witherspoon, asking Governor Bill Lee to remove the Bust. Governor Lee and Republican lawmakers removed all pleas and decided to continue to honor the white supremacist founder of the KKK.
“The Tennessee Democratic Party joins the call to remove the Nathan Bedford Forrest bust. Every day black legislators walk by and are reminded of the atrocities committed during the slave trade and feel the inherent threat behind its creation and placement. The bust was put in its current place of honor to intimidate black Tennesseans. It threatens, “stay in your place.” It warns, “you are not welcome here.” It loudly pronounces, “you are not equal.” The bust has no home in Tennessee, let alone in a place of honor right outside the state house and senate chambers. Tennessee Democrats will continue to join our allies with the work of dismantling both overt and hidden systemic racism, including the removal of these monuments to white supremacy.” – Mary Mancini, TNDP Chair

# JUDGE THREATENS GOV. BILL LEE
# AND SECRETARY OF STATE WITH
# CONTEMPT OF COURT
Last week, a Judge overruled Governor Bill Lee and Tennessee Republican Legislators to mandate a no excuse absentee ballot measure. This week, the Secretary of State, the Governor, and the Attorney General appealed the judge's decision. In a win for democracy, the Judge threatened to hold the State in contempt of court after they denied the law and refused to expand absentee ballots.
""Shame on you for not following that procedure and just taking matters into your own hands,"" the judge told lawyers from the Tennessee Attorney General's office. ""I'm calling the state out on that for not adhering to the standards of a legal process and not adhering to the order.""
When we organize and stand for what are our rights, we can win. When we partner with the other side and stop with harmful party politics, we can exponentially improve lives in Tennessee. TNDP thanks for all the hard work each and every Tennesseean did to make this happen.

Mary Mancini,mary@tndp.org,CORRECTED PETITION LINK: TNDP Weekly Recap & Protect Voters and Poll Workers,"No person should ever have to choose between the safety of their family and casting their vote.
Dear Tennessee Democrat,
Friday, May 8, was the first day in Tennessee to request an absentee ballot for the August primary election.
Heavy laden with restrictions, Tennessee’s absentee voting law prevents most voters from requesting an absentee ballot. For weeks, Tennesseans have asked Secretary of State Tre Hargett to publicly address the possibility of easing these restrictions. The requests for comment came from the press, voters, and the Tennessee State Senate Democratic Caucus members, who co-signed a letter to both Governor Bill Lee and Secretary of State Hargett demanding the safety of voters' and poll workers be protected during the COVID-19 crisis. (Read the Letter). For weeks, Secretary of State Hargett and Gov. Lee have been conspicuously silent.
Today, Hargett announced on social media that any “Tennessean 60 or older can submit a request to vote absentee by-mail in the August 6th State and Federal Primary and County General Election.”
That’s it. That’s all he said.
To promote absentee voting without addressing the elephant in the room (PANDEMIC!) shows 1) lack of leadership and 2) a deep understanding of how to suppress the vote.
Republicans, like Hargett, are unleashing one of the greatest voter suppression tactics this country has ever seen by refusing to prioritize voter safety. Trump himself told us why they’re so committed to making it harder to access the ballot box: Republicans are afraid they’ll “never” win another election if they let more people vote.
Expanding absentee voting to make it universal - anyone can request an absentee ballot - is a no brainer during a deadly health crisis. In fact, almost every other state with the same laws have already eased restrictions. Not Tennessee.
So, thank you Charlane Oliver and the Equity Alliance of Nashville, Kendra Lee and the A. Philip Randolph Institute of Memphis, and Gloria Sweet-Love of the State Chapter of the NAACP for leading the coalition of Tennessee nonprofits who sued the state to expand access to absentee voting and mail-in ballots during the COVID-19.
“Tennessee voters should not be forced to choose between their own personal safety and participating in our democratic process,"" Ms. Oliver said in a statement. ""We are in unprecedented circumstances that call for state officials to implement safer and secure approaches to ensure democracy is preserved in the Volunteer State.” \- via a story in the Tennessean
Governor Lee and Secretary of State Hargett can make this lawsuit go away if they would simply put partisanship aside and work with Democrats to thoughtfully and effectively expand absentee voting, increase early polling time and locations, and create a system for health certifications of each polling site. If they don’t, we can only draw one conclusion - they want to suppress the vote and rig the election.
No person should ever have to choose between their safety and the wellbeing of their family or casting their vote. Please join the fight against this voter suppression by signing our petition for safe voting.
We’re in this fight for democracy together,

Midnight tonight marks the end of this fundraising quarter and we’re still $11,045 away from reaching our goal. With the election only four months away, we cannot afford to be this behind. Tennessee Republicans are counting on the fact that they will outraise us and outspend us in every district and every race this November. We need to prove them wrong.
Every volunteer we train, every phone call we make, every voter we contact – this is how we beat Republicans. The more money we raise, the more we can do. It’s simple but it’s true. In politics money matters. As Vice President Biden has said, ‘We are in a battle for the soul of America.’
Please join us in our efforts by making a donation right now. We have until midnight and the clock is ticking.

As promised, I sang Taylor Swift karaoke and there's a video. I look ridiculous. We'll be posting to our facebook page soon. [[[URL REDACTED]] - Ed.]
Speaking of Taylor Swift, she recently referred to Marsha Blackburn as 'Trump in a wig.' And we couldn't agree more. Blackburn's repeated disrespect towards Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman is just like Trump - beyond inappropriate and shouldn't be tolerated.
That's why we've decided to do a fundraising push to honor the Tennessee Democratic Party's Veterans and Military Families Caucus. The caucus raised a thousand dollars for an initial printing of this yard sign, and they've already run out and need more. We want to help them.
We've set a goal of $3,000 for this month, so we can send a message to Marsha. Will you make a donation right now, whatever you can so we can show that Tennessee Democrats respect American war veterans, service members, and their families?

July and August are traditionally the hardest months to raise money in politics. With everything a stake in this election we have to not only meet but exceed expectations. And that’s why we’ve created the Amplify Democrats program. It’s a program designed to uplift and support the voices of Democrats and Democratic candidates in our communities, and promote local platforms and policies that will make positive change for Tennesseans.
Whether it’s expanding health coverage or defending women’s rights, Tennessee Democrats are out there fighting for a better future for ALL of us. Covering costs for voter outreach and candidate recruitment and training is critical to amplify these issues. We are trying to raise $25,000 in the next two months. Will you help us?

Mary Mancini,mary@tndp.org,TNDP Weekly Recap: Republicans Cannot Be Trusted ,"Numbers don't lie. Actions don't lie. Republicans are the ones lying about their commitment to Tennessee's safety.
Dear Tennessee Democrat,
Democrats desperately want to work with Republicans to protect your health, to fix our economy, to keep you safe when you cast your vote. But the Republican Party's values have changed radically. The Republican Party cannot be trusted to do what's best for Tennesseans anymore. The Republican Party Republicans cannot be trusted to do their job anymore.
Last week, we discussed Republicans' total disregard for Tennessean's lives by not expanding absentee ballot access. This week, the Associated Press released Secretary of State Tre Hargett's Covid-19 Election Contigency Plan and it absolutely proves that Republicans can't be trusted to do what's best for voters anymore:
""The plan doesn’t contemplate a shift to allow all voters to cast ballots by mail due to fears of contracting or unknowingly spreading COVID-19 at the polls."" - Secretary Hargett directly stated his lack of care or concern. (Read the full article and statements.)
Where is Governor Bill Lee and what is his opinion on protecting Tennesseans during the August and November elections? Nobody knows. In fact, 265 deaths and 16,111 COVID-19 cases, and he has cut down public briefings to ONLY ONE PER WEEK. Oh, but he did find the time to announce no repercussions or re-enforcements for businesses who do not follow safe re-opening guidelines and create an online portal for employers to report employees so that they can be criminally charged if they do not return to work immediately for fear of catching or spreading the virus. He finally had a moment on Friday to say, ""I agree with Hargett.""He agrees one of the deadliest pandemics in history is not reason enough to expand absentee ballot access.
Bottom line - your role as a voter is more important now than ever. Republicans know this, which is why they're refusing to expand absentee ballot access.
The decision to refuse to take action to keep you as a voter safe during this serious health crisis shows Republican Party values have changed radically. Republicans cannot be trusted anymore. Tennesseans are asking, ""What happened to the Republican Party?"" Our answer is that we have to take matters into our own hand to protect you during upcoming election. Here are two quick ways you can join our fight to protect voters:
* Sign the petition demanding the expansion of absentee ballots
* Donate to our voter protection program
We may not be able to trust Republicans to work with us anymore, but we trust you. Thank you for joining us in this work.

""Action to safeguard our electoral system cannot wait. In a matter of weeks, millions of Americans across several states will be asked to vote in municipal and primary elections, and they deserve better than the impossible choice between preserving their well-being and casting their ballots."" -TNDP chair, Mary Mancini
The above is from a letter from DNC state party chairs urging election commissions and governments to adopt legislation to expand voter health and safety. Read the full letter.
No Tennessean should ever have to choose between protecting their family or casting their vote. The Tennessee General Assembly had six different opportunities to pass legislation to protect voters before they recessed last month. The Republican supermajority voted everything down. The Center for Disease Control (CDC) has emphatically stressed social distancing and staying away from crowds of ten or more. Polling places are in direct conflict with CDC recommendations and force voters to choose between staying safe or casting their vote.

Mary Mancini,mary@tndp.org,TNDP Weekly Recap: March on Washington,"This weekend, on the 57th Anniversary of the March on Washington, Civil Rights activists and organizers will continue the Good Trouble made by those who came before them. And even though 57 years have gone by, the mission of today's March is the same: Black voices struggling to make our Union more perfect through an un-yielding commitment to equity, justice, and fairness.
Dear Tennessee Democrat,
Fifty-seven years ago, protestors struggling for equality and justice made their mark on American history, forever bending the arc of our moral universe more toward justice. In August 1963, Martin Luther King Jr., John Lewis, Diane Nash, and a quarter million patriots descended upon the Lincoln Memorial for the March on Washington, a pilgrimage made for justice, equality under the law, and the fulfillment of America's promise that all men and women are created equal. On that day in our nation's capitol, these organizers, activists, and icons called on the American people to join them in their struggle.
March on Washington
This weekend, to celebrate the 57th anniversary of the March on Washington, a new generation of organizers and activists have once again gathered on the National Mall. Supported by the NAACP, National Urban League, Lawyer's Committee for Civil Rights Under the Law, and so many others, the people-powered events this weekend will urge all Americans to not only join the struggle, but redouble our efforts to ensure dignified and equitable treatment in the public structures and systems that make up our civil society - law enforcement, housing, public education, the justice system, and so many more.
The reasons why another March is crucial after so much time can't be missed, but here are two of the most recent:
* In Kenosha, Wisconsin: Peaceful black protesters are attacked, corralled, gassed and shot at with rubber bullets while a white kid openly carrying a weapon of war is rewarded with encouraging words and a bottle of water.
* In Nashville, Tennessee: Black protestors who protest by sleeping on state house grounds are now felons while a white man carrying a weapon of war in the streets of Nashville is cited for a misdemeanor.
We offer solidarity with the protesters in Washington and across the country and we pledge to stand with them and continue the fight towards a more perfect union that was started 57 years ago this weekend. Fifty-seven years after the March on Washington, the message is the same, we need to restore the Soul of America - and we need to vote this November to do so.
In Good Trouble,
Mary Mancini

# CHIP IN TO TURN OUT THE VOTE
In 2018 Tennessee Democratic voter turnout increased in all 95 counties - in some places as much as 25%. With the right investment and messaging strategy we know we can flip seats in November. Targeted media will help mobilize Democrats to vote, vote early, and vote safely - but we need help covering costs.
We’ve already assembled an amazing team to help us Get Out The Vote and support our diverse and talented roster of candidates. Now we need to focus on voter turnout. Targeted messaging and media are more critical than ever because of COVID-19. The GOP thinks that they have Tennessee on lock but we’re going to prove them wrong.
Will you make a donation right now, and help us pay for the media strategy needed to flip these crucial seats?

Mary Mancini,mary@tndp.org,TNDP Weekly Recap: Democrats Take Action,"Dear Friend,
Republicans spent the week abusing their power nationally and locally, while Democrats took action and pushed for real policies that affect real people.
Advocating on behalf of Tennessee families, Democrats in the State House and Senate worked to improve lives for everyone living and working in our state:
* Senator Sara Kyle advocated for a tampon free tax weekend holiday.
* Representative London Lamar worked to pass legislation to end sex trafficking.
* Representative John Ray Clemmons pushed to expand and protect voting rights.
Republicans, on the other hand, are not only wasting time but are actively working in ways that harm Tennessee workers, families, and children. Under the Republican majority, over a dozen rural Tennessee hospitals have closed, 177,000 children have lost healthcare, and Tennessee farm bankruptcies are up 29%.
Ignoring all the damage they’ve done, this week Tennessee’s Republican Representatives and Senators spent your time and their energy on the following:
* Representative Micah Van Huss spent his time trolling Tennesseans and pushing for harmful censorship to deem CNN and Washington Post as ""Fake News.""
* Representative Joey Hensley advocated against a bill to reduce taxes on tampons, violating the Hippocratic oath he took when he became a doctor.
* Governor Bill Lee backpedalled on his promise to provide 12 weeks of paid family leave to 38,000 state employees.
Democratic lawmakers are pushing back and taking action, but they can’t do it alone. We need every Democrat in Tennessee to take action alongside them. Below are just some of the ways you can help make a positive difference in our state. So, let’s get to it!
All systems go,

Col. Vindman’s job. The letter denounces Senator Blackburn’s actions and asks her to apologize for treating a member of the military in such a disrespectful way.

TAKE ACTION
The most impactful thing you can do to make the change you want to see in Tennessee, is to vote. But we also have to have strong candidates running good campaigns if we want to win and that's where your investment in our work is crucial. It’s expensive to maintain and expand TNDP operations in an election year. Paying for things like election protection training, candidate recruitment efforts, and campaign support are expensive – that’s why every dollar you contribute helps us win elections and fight back.

We have a real shot at fully funding our 2020 Voter Protection program this month – but only if we keep up the momentum. Thanks to an incredibly generous donation of $10k we are now much closer to the finish line.
Will you make a donation right now and help us cross it?
The egregious abortion ban bill passed in the middle of the night by Tennessee Republicans last week was a stark reminder of why local elections matter. Democrats have to be able to vote and have their votes count, otherwise there is no hope for change – and we need change.
We have five days to raise the remaining $31,710 of the $59,800 needed to cover our ENTIRE 2020 Voter Protection program. I am asking you personally to dig deep and donate whatever you can afford. There is too much at stake with this election. Will you help us?

Mary Mancini,mary@tndp.org,Trump needs to be stopped,"Friend,
Last night was horrifying. The President of the United States was asked point blank to denounce white supremacists and his response was to tell the hate group Proud Boys to ‘stand back and stand by.’ Our president publicly refused to denounce white supremacy and now white supremacist groups are celebrating Trump's answers and using them for recruitment.
Midnight tonight is the last meaningful fundraising deadline to raise money to elect Joe Biden and every other Democrat we can. We have a month to get every Tennessean who opposes our Corrupter-in-Cheat, red or blue, ready to vote so we can take back this country. Right now, I’m asking you to dig deep and donate whatever you can. This is beyond Democrats vs Republicans. We are fighting for humanity and truth – decency and reason. Trump needs to be stopped before he destroys this nation beyond repair.
The TNDP has to raise another $7,340 to cover costs for GOTV efforts through the election. Will you please make a donation right now if you can? The country needs your help!

Mary & the TNDP team,mary@tndp.org,TNDP Veterans and Military Families Caucus speaks out,"Friend,
Last week, Donald Trump showed us his true colors. He has no respect for the men and women who serve our country. In response to President Trump’s comments about military service, the Tennessee Democratic Party Veterans and Military Families Caucus chairs issued the following powerful statement that we just had to share:
“President Trump’s reported remarks reflect a deep disdain for those who serve and are prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice. And for us, in states like Tennessee, with large rural populations providing the single largest group in the military, it is first and foremost not about dollars, but about our most precious resource, the blood of our sons and daughters.
Leading our military is more than hugging flags and taking photo-ops far from the front lines, it is valuing and respecting the sacrifices our military makes to protect our country – the time away from families, the risk of death, and the memories of those lost in battles fought long ago and only yesterday.
This lack of respect shown for the men and women who serve our country is deeply troubling. Sadly, for veterans, the families of retired and active service members, and the families of the fallen, these insults and mockery hurt deeply and reflect a total disregard for the value of military service. Tennessee’s active military members and veterans deserve better.”

Mary Mancini,mary@tndp.org,TNDP Weekly Recap: Protect Voters and Poll Workers,"No person should ever have to choose between the safety of their family and casting their vote.
Dear Tennessee Democrat,
Today is the first day in Tennessee to request an absentee ballot for the August primary election.
Heavy laden with restrictions, Tennessee’s absentee voting law prevents most voters from requesting an absentee ballot. For weeks, Tennesseans have asked Secretary of State Tre Hargett to publicly address the possibility of easing these restrictions. The requests for comment came from the press, voters, and the Tennessee State Senate Democratic Caucus members, who co-signed a letter to both Governor Bill Lee and Secretary of State Hargett demanding the safety of voters' and poll workers be protected during the COVID-19 crisis. (Read the Letter). For weeks, Secretary of State Hargett and Gov. Lee have been conspicuously silent.
Today, Hargett announced on social media that any “Tennessean 60 or older can submit a request to vote absentee by-mail in the August 6th State and Federal Primary and County General Election.”
That’s it. That’s all he said.
To promote absentee voting without addressing the elephant in the room (PANDEMIC!) shows 1) lack of leadership and 2) a deep understanding of how to suppress the vote.
Republicans, like Hargett, are unleashing one of the greatest voter suppression tactics this country has ever seen by refusing to prioritize voter safety. Trump himself told us why they’re so committed to making it harder to access the ballot box: Republicans are afraid they’ll “never” win another election if they let more people vote.
Expanding absentee voting to make it universal - anyone can request an absentee ballot - is a no brainer during a deadly health crisis. In fact, almost every other state with the same laws have already eased restrictions. Not Tennessee.
So, thank you Charlane Oliver and the Equity Alliance of Nashville, Kendra Lee and the A. Philip Randolph Institute of Memphis, and Gloria Sweet-Love of the State Chapter of the NAACP for leading the coalition of Tennessee nonprofits who sued the state to expand access to absentee voting and mail-in ballots during the COVID-19.
“Tennessee voters should not be forced to choose between their own personal safety and participating in our democratic process,"" Ms. Oliver said in a statement. ""We are in unprecedented circumstances that call for state officials to implement safer and secure approaches to ensure democracy is preserved in the Volunteer State.” \- via a story in the Tennessean
Governor Lee and Secretary of State Hargett can make this lawsuit go away if they would simply put partisanship aside and work with Democrats to thoughtfully and effectively expand absentee voting, increase early polling time and locations, and create a system for health certifications of each polling site. If they don’t, we can only draw one conclusion - they want to suppress the vote and rig the election.
No person should ever have to choose between their safety and the wellbeing of their family or casting their vote. Please join the fight against this voter suppression by signing our petition for safe voting.
We’re in this fight for democracy together,
Mary Mancini

# UNIVERSAL ABSENTEE VOTING
""Action to safeguard our electoral system cannot wait. In a matter of weeks, millions of Americans across several states will be asked to vote in municipal and primary elections, and they deserve better than the impossible choice between preserving their well-being and casting their ballots."" -TNDP chair, Mary Mancini
The above is from a letter from DNC state party chairs urging election commissions and governments to adopt legislation to expand voter health and safety. Read the full letter.
No Tennessean should ever have to choose between protecting their family or casting their vote. The Tennessee General Assembly had six different opportunities to pass legislation to protect voters before they recessed last month. The Republican supermajority voted everything down. The Center for Disease Control (CDC) has emphatically stressed social distancing and staying away from crowds of ten or more. Polling places are in direct conflict with CDC recommendations and force voters to choose between staying safe or casting their vote. Tennessee Secretary of State Tre Hargett, Governor Bill Lee, and President Donald Trump must create universal absentee voting. Sign the petition now!

In the midst of this unprecedented health crisis, DNC has moved the 2020 Democratic National Convention back one month, to the week of August 17.
* This change will provide planners with the time to identify the most appropriate structure for this historic event that poses no unnecessary risk to public health.
* As part of their contingency planning efforts, the Democratic National Convention Committee has confirmed that Fiserv Forum, the Wisconsin Center District and hotel accommodations in the surrounding area are available in August.
* The convention planning team will now use the coming weeks to further explore all options to ensure nominating the next president of the United States is done without unnecessary risk to public health. These options include everything from adjusting the convention’s format to crowd size and schedule.

# NO TIME LIKE THE PRESENT:
# FILL OUT THE US CENSUS
It's a census year, and with more time at home there is ZERO EXCUSE for you to not fill it out. A few quick facts on the importance of the census:
* Congresses uses the data to determine how many Representatives a state gets.
* The federal government uses census numbers to allocate more than $675 billion in federal funds annually for community programs and services, such as education programs, housing and community development, health care services for the elderly and job training.
* State, local and tribal governments use census information for planning and allocating funds for new school construction, libraries, highway safety and public transportation systems, new roads and bridges, location of police and fire departments and many other projects.
* Many 911 emergency systems are based on maps developed for the last census.

Mary Mancini,mary@tndp.org,we need help paying the bills,"Friend,
We have 3 days left to meet our end of the month fundraising deadline. Right now we’re $7,890 short and need your help.
Donald Trump is doing everything in his power to prevent no-excuse absentee voting across this country – and Tennessee’s GOP leadership is doing everything they can to help him. Despite several lawsuits filed citing concerns over Covid-19 and the safety of Tennessee voters, Gov. Lee and his minions are stopping at nothing.
That’s why we’re fighting so hard. That’s why the TNDP is using every resource including our Voter Protection program to hit back. This shouldn’t be about partisanship, it should be about ensuring that all votes are counted safely and fairly.
From legal fees to advocacy and outreach, the bills are racking up. Will you donate right now and help us? Our country cannot afford 4 more years of this.
Thank you,

Mary Mancini,mary@tndp.org,working together,"Friend,
We need to raise another $9,320 by midnight tomorrow to meet our August fundraising goal. Please consider making a donation and helping us get there. As we get closer to the election - early voting starts in 45 days! - giving to a state party is so important. Here's why:
Creating a cooperative coordinated campaign that works for all our candidates is by far the most efficient way to work together and get the most out of Tennessee Democrats’ resources. From the top of the ticket to the bottom - having shared media spends and Get Out the Vote outreach infrastructure cuts costs for everyone and helps Democratic Candidates get ahead. And so, from now until Election Day, the TNDP is focusing our resources on GOTV and building a robust cooperative campaign. This election is not the time for Democrats to sit on the sidelines. Winning is too important.
Will you help us reach our August goal by donating right now? It really makes a difference, and we are so grateful for your continued support. We couldn’t do any of this without you.
Thank you,

If not, it’s time to join the movement.

# PROTECT THE VOTE
#
One of the most impactful ways to volunteer on November 3rd is to train to become a poll watcher. Since the gutting of the Voting Rights Act there have been countless measures aimed at suppressing the vote in traditionally vulnerable communities. Republicans have teamed with election commissions to deploy modern day voter suppression tactics. Poll watchers will be the person on the ground at each polling site ensuring every individual has the right to exercise their right to vote. As a poll watcher you will:
* Resolve voting issues with election officials inside the polling place
* Resolve voting issues with voters outside the polling place (i.e., outside the 100-foot boundary)
* Collect all relevant information and quickly report it “up the chain”
TNDP is currently recruiting poll watcher volunteers. Email [[URL REDACTED]] to volunteer.

# IT'S CRUNCH TIME. WE NEED YOUR HELP
July and August are traditionally the hardest months to raise money in politics. With everything a stake in this election we have to not only meet but exceed expectations. And that’s why we’ve created the Amplify Democrats program. It’s a program designed to promote and support the voices of Democrats and Democratic candidates in our communities, and promote local platforms and policies that will make positive change for Tennesseans.
Whether it’s expanding health coverage or defending women’s rights, Tennessee Democrats are out there fighting for a better future for ALL of us. Please help reach our goal of $25,000 to cover the costs for voter outreach and candidate/campaign support. We're 100 days out and it's crunch time. Will you help us?

After overwhelming data of voucher programs not working and a high rate of fraud associated with vouchers, Republicans spent hours passing a rule to speed up the implementation of vouchers in Tennessee. Rather than spending the millions of Tennessee taxpayer dollars it will take to implement, Republicans should be focused on meeting the required funding for our public schools. Tennessee ranks 45th in the entire nation for funding public education, yet, Governor Bill Lee likes to brag about the billions of dollars in Tennessee's surplus. In a press conference on Tuesday, Democrats from the State House and State Senate announced a plan to fix BEP funding and increase student funding by $1.5 Billion to address three main issues:
* Boosting teacher pay
* Increasing the number of nurses and social workers in schools
* Updating student-to-staff ratios

Millions of phone calls were made and thousands of letters were sent.

His reasoning? He already knew Donald Trump was guilty. Read more....

# INVEST IN DEMOCRACY
Enraged by Lamar Alexander's decision? Heartbroken by Tennessee General Assembly's Republicans focus on a slate of hate instead of legislation to help families? The most impactful thing you can do to change that is vote. But, we’ve got to have strong candidates running good campaigns if we want to win, and that's where your investment in the party is crucial. It’s expensive to maintain and expand TNDP operations in an election year. Paying for things like poll watcher trainings, candidate recruitment efforts and campaign support are expensive – that’s why every dollar you contribute helps us win elections and fight back.

There are 42 days left before Americans get to decide this country’s future. Today I’m asking you to donate $42, and help raise the $9,435 we need to meet our September GOTV goal. From paid media to digital organizing, we need to make sure we do absolutely everything we can to encourage Democrats to show up and vote like their lives depend on it.
Last Friday, the passing of Supreme Court Justice Ginsburg reminded us of just how much is at stake this November. As a nation and a people, we are better because of RBG. Her legacy lives, and we intend to honor that legacy on Election Day. That being said, despite her dying wish to not be replaced until after American’s get to have their say, Tennessee Republican Senators Marsha Blackburn and Lamar Alexander have made their motives clear.
They intend to do everything they can to confirm whichever far right zealot Trump decides to nominate. They will pay no deference to the precedent set by their own party in 2016. This is corruption on full display and they don’t care. This is why we need to elect Tennessee Democrats.
Will you make a contribution right now, and help us Get Out The Vote?

September end of month 2020 will go down as the most important fundraising deadline we’ve ever had. We now have the month of October left to Get Out The Vote, and then it’s November 3rd. This isn’t just about electing Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. We need to be electing every possible Democrat, up and down the ticket. And to do that we need to show up in record numbers.
That’s why I’m asking you, from the bottom of my heart, to donate today. If ever there was a time to give resources to the TNDP, now is it. We are doing everything we can to mobilize Democrats – but we need to do more and we need your help to do it.
From healthcare to the Supreme Court. From LGBTQ+ rights to Black Lives Matter. From respecting our military to saving our economy. From job security to collective bargaining rights. There is just too much on the ballot not to do everything we possibly can to win.
We have until midnight tomorrow to raise the $11,840 left to meet our goal – and this goal is the minimum needed to execute our GOTV plan. So please, make a donation right now, and help us save our country.

Mary Mancini,mary@tndp.org,"TNDP Weekly Recap: Like the bust of Nathan Bedford Forrest, Mike Sparks Must Go","Nathan Bedford Forrest isn't the only racist that must leave the state capitol this year.
Dear Tennessee Democrat,
In a 9-2 vote yesterday, the Capitol Commission did the right thing and voted in favor of removing the Nathan Bedford Forrest bust from the halls of the Tennessee Capitol Building. The two no votes? Republicans.
For almost a decade now, protestors, Black community leaders, legislators, activists, and the general public have pushed for the removal of the bust which memorializes a racist, traitor, and murderer. To you and me the decision to remove it from a place of honor in the state capitol is a no-brainer, but Republicans are still fighting hard for it to stay. Several Democrats introduced legislation during session to remove but time after time, Republicans killed the bills. Yesterday, Republican Mike Sparks (R-Smyrna) attended the meeting to deliver an in-person hurtful tirade to defend the man who murdered and terrorized Black Americans.
Mike Sparks offensive and inaccurate account of history does not represent this great state and his inability to lead or represent the people of his district is hurting all of us. To be clear, Sparks and his Republican colleagues declare, loudly, their support of Nathan Bedford Forrest, but vote against expanding health care access to more than 300k, paying teachers what they deserve, or saving lives during a pandemic.
Mike Sparks has got to go.
Donate, volunteer and vote for Brandon Thomas, the Democrat running against Sparks this election cycle. It's up to us to make sure Nathan Bedford Forrest isn't the only bigot to leave the state capitol in 2020.
We've got a phenomenal list of Democratic candidates on the ballot this August and November. Check out the list and support who you can, how you can.
Thank you!

# WE NEED YOUR HELP
WE NEED YOUR HELP. Here's the reality: Because of the COVID-19 emergency, the Tennessee Democratic Party's resources are stretched thin. Given how this crisis will impact our economy, we are expecting a significant loss of revenue in the coming months which will impact our ability to win elections up and down the ballot this fall. Our staff, our offices, our voter protection program, our get out the vote program, our outreach programs, and our organizing capabilities all depend on the resources we can raise right now.
We need you in this fight alongside us. THANK YOU!

Mary Mancini,mary@tndp.org,TNDP Weekly Recap: Our Hearts Are With Middle Tennessee,"Dear Friend,
We expected Super Tuesday to be chaotic, but we did not expect the devastation that was inflicted on Middle Tennessee. In the middle of the night, a tornado touched down and caused immense damage to much of Middle Tennessee. Residents in Davidson, Wilson, and Putnam County are dealing with injuries, missing persons and lost loved ones.
Normally, the top portion of this email serves as a letter and an opportunity for us to discuss key political issues or opponent's actions. This week, our letter is dedicated to our Middle Tennessee communities.
We stand with Middle Tennessee during this tragic, heart-wrenching time. No amount of words can lessen the pain and Tennessee's heart will always beat different from this disaster.
We will be with your families and neighbors every step of the way as you heal.

# SLATE OF HATE HOURS AFTER
#  TORNADO DEVASTATES
# MIDDLE TENNESSEE
Dozens were dead, hundreds were missing, including many children. The legislators' offices were out of power and Middle Tennessee Counties had just filed formal states of emergency. As Tennesseans rallied around our neighbors, Bill Lee and the Republican supermajority decided to resume committee meetings Tuesday and push through permit-less gun carry and their attack on women’s ability to make their own health care decisions.
Lawmakers should have stood with Tennessee communities and families in their time of need; instead, Republican legislators spent their time passing laws to further harm and hurt Tennesseans.

YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS IN ACTION
In the wake of the Middle Tennessee Tornado Tragedy, 21 polls across the state were closed. In Davidson County, many polling locations opened late. Thousands of people were unable to cast their ballot as planned, and yet the Secretary of State and Davidson County Election Commission would not expand poll times. This was not okay and would cause irreparable damage to democracy. TNDP filed a lawsuit for injunction to have poll times extended to make up for these delays. We won the lawsuit and kept polls open as late as 10PM. This is the exact work your contributions fund. Your contributions protect Tennessee's right to cast their ballots for Democrats and provide the staff and resources needed to do the work. Will you consider donating today?

Mary Mancini,mary@tndp.org,TNDP Weekly Recap: TN Legislative Session Resumes with Slate of Hate,"After a fumbled response to COVID-19, Republicans continue to fail to lead.
Dear Tennessee Democrat,
Democrats want to work with Republicans to do the right thing - to save Tennessee lives and ensure the health and safety of everyone who lives and works in this beautiful state. And as the state legislature heads back into session next week, it's clear that all Republicans want to do is ram through their extremist agenda.
Republicans can't be trusted to do their job anymore. As unemployment in the state surpasses 500,000, deaths from COVID 19 are on the rise, and the safety-net crumbles into a mess of hours spent waiting on the phone and missing checks, their plan when the state legislature goes back into session next week will be to continue their march to reduce pour liberties, dismantle public education, and increasing access to permit-less guns.
It's also clear Republicans can't be trusted to do what's right anymore. Expanding access to absentee voting is a bi-partisan no brainer. The Secretary of State in Michigan as well as Republican Secretaries of State in Iowa, Georgia, Nebraska and West Virginia are sending all registered voters applications for absentee ballots. They know that in this public health crisis they must do everything they can to protect the health and safety of voters and poll workers.
But rather than working with Democrats to change the law and expand access to absentee voting, Tennessee Republicans have to be sued to do the right thing.
Next week, Democrats will once again try to do the job they were sent to Nashville to do:
* Ensure medical treatment for people who don’t have health insurance
* Protect lives in the wake of the COVID 19 Pandemic
* Provide necessary relief for the over 500,000 unemployed
* Expand access to absentee ballots to keep you safe when you vote
A smart, effective government that keeps its people safe should be the goal of every elected representative. If Republicans can't do the work necessary to protect us through these difficult times, they need to get out of the way and let Democrats lead.
Proud to be a Democrat with you,
Mary Mancini

# UNIVERSAL ABSENTEE VOTING
""Action to safeguard our electoral system cannot wait. In a matter of weeks, millions of Americans across several states will be asked to vote in municipal and primary elections, and they deserve better than the impossible choice between preserving their well-being and casting their ballots."" -TNDP chair, Mary Mancini
The above is from a letter from DNC state party chairs urging election commissions and governments to adopt legislation to expand voter health and safety. Read the full letter.
No Tennessean should ever have to choose between protecting their family or casting their vote. The Tennessee General Assembly had six different opportunities to pass legislation to protect voters before they recessed last month. The Republican supermajority voted everything down. The Center for Disease Control (CDC) has emphatically stressed social distancing and staying away from crowds of ten or more. Polling places are in direct conflict with CDC recommendations and force voters to choose between staying safe or casting their vote. Tennessee Secretary of State Tre Hargett, Governor Bill Lee, and President Donald Trump must create universal absentee voting. Sign the petition now!

We are in the final stretch. It’s hard to believe it but we only have two weeks until Election Day.
We’re trying to raise money ASAP to make sure we can place all of the digital ads we need to help candidates and get out the vote (GOTV) before Facebook’s cutoff for new political ads. Facebook changed their policy and will not be allowing any new ads to go up starting a week before Election Day. Those placed prior, however, will be allowed to stay live through the election.
Reaching the record number of newly registered Tennessee voters is critical, and we believe this is the most efficient way to do just that. Can you donate today, and help us reach as many voters as we can before the Facebook deadline?
Thank you,

Wow, January went by fast! November will be here before we know it, and while getting Democrats elected is our primary focus – we also have to make sure we are raising enough money to fund those efforts. We rely on grassroots donors like you to hit our fundraising goals and right now we’re $5,600 away from hitting January’s – and the clock runs out Friday at midnight. Can you help us reach our goal before it’s too late?
Every election is important, but 2020 has incredibly high stakes. November will give Americans the opportunity to choose whether or not we are ok with Trump’s behavior. Whether or not we are ok with a President who withholds military aide for personal gain. Whether or not we are ok with a Senate that ignores constitutional duties when they get in the way of partisan agendas. Whether or not we are ok with a GOP that is fueled by hate speech, racism and sexism.
The TNDP is using all of our resources to support and elevate candidates that share our vision of a Tennessee and America that work for all of us. In order to do that we need every ounce of support you can give us. Please consider making a donation right now and help us fight for a better future.

Mary Mancini,mary@tndp.org,good leadership matters,"Friend,
I’ve said it before, but leadership matters – and right now that has never been more true. All across the world we are watching the successes and failures of different countries’ approaches in dealing with this pandemic. There are leaders that listened to science and made tough choices – and there are leaders that didn’t. It’s the same in the United States, and it’s the same in Tennessee.
In spite of data driven models and medical professionals’ warnings, Bill Lee has decided it’s time to go back to normal! He knows this will mean more cases, overcrowded medical facilities, and deaths. He knows how many Tennesseans live without adequate health insurance. He knows how many Tennesseans don’t have easy access to healthcare thanks to rural hospital closures. But he doesn’t care.
The latest research from Vanderbilt University says if we keep up current social distancing measures for a while longer, Tennessee can be a success story. If we don’t, we won’t. It’s not complicated.
We not only have an opportunity this November, we have a duty. We need to take back the power from the reckless GOP fools in charge and elect leadership that will put people before politics.
The TNDP staff has done an incredible job in shifting our efforts to navigate these uncertain times. We’ve been able to stay ahead of the curve, but only because of the unprecedented support from Tennessee Democrats. I’m asking you to continue giving us the resources we need to support democratic candidates across the state, and provide them with the tools they need to win.
We haven’t met our April fundraising goal and we need your help. To be blunt, we have three days to raise $7,890. Continuing to offer critical tools and resources to democratic candidates is how we will win this November.
Will you make a donation right now and help us reach our goal?
Thank you,

Mary Mancini,mary@tndp.org,TNDP Weekly Recap: Stand with Vindman & Republicans Broken Promises,"Dear Friend,
Hours before Governor Lee’s State of the State address, TNHoller produced a video outlining the reality of the state of Tennessee, including some heart wrenching statistics. Watch it now to learn the truth about our state.
Tennessee is:
* 39th in Median Household Income
* 47th in Small Business Ownership
* 41st in Poverty
* 37th for Children Living in Poverty
* 1st in Minimum Wage Jobs
But you wouldn’t know it listening to Governor Bill Lee.
The speech was insulting to struggling Tennesseans and was filled with big promises - slight increases in funding for education, teacher pay, and mental health services - that have already been broken.
EDUCATION: Less than 12 hours after the speech, Governor Lee’s staff backtracked and said they couldn’t promise the $117 Million would translate to larger teacher paychecks. And even if teachers did see an increase in pay, it would be less than what was promised (approximately $28 more per paycheck) and hardly enough to cover what they are already paying out-of-pocket for state mandated supplies and materials.
MENTAL HEALTH: Lee also promised to invest $250 Million in mental health, yet his staff clarified that the money will actually go to a Wall Street fund and will reach patients ONLY IF the investment turns a profit in coming years. Families struggling with mental health issues need direct investment in mental health services today, not if and when a gamble with our tax dollars pays off.
CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM: Governor Lee also announced a “criminal justice reform plan” that focused on increasing punishments, but does nothing to address inequity in the system or invest in successful community prevention and re-entry programs.
Republican at the state legislature copied Lee’s theme of broken promises and harmful policy decisions throughout the rest of the week by defending the treasonous actions of a confederate racist, refusing to invest in the care of hungry school children, and pushing for more guns on public university and college campuses. And then we had to listen to it all again from Washington the next night!
TRUMP’S IMPACT ON TENNESSEE: Donald Trump delivered a heavily partisan speech during the State of the Union on Tuesday night and, like Governor Lee the night before, did so while ignoring the harm and destruction of his policies on Tennesseans. Here are a few:
* Trump trade policies have all but wiped out Tennessee soybean farmers, who were sending 60% of their crops to China
* Tennessee Farmer bankruptcies are up 29%
* Medically uninsured children jumped up 18%
* Job growth has slowed dramatically, and 2019 was the slowest year for job growth since 2011
* The national deficit for FY 2019 reached nearly $1 trillion, almost double what it was when President Obama left office
* For the first time in decades, corporations paid a lower tax rate in 2018 than most Tennessee families
We’ve said it once and we’ll say it again - we’re on the ground every day to help elect leaders who will support our children, our students, and our families with smart and effective policies that will improve lives. Join us by joining your Democratic County Party, a TNDP Caucus, or a Democratic candidate's campaign of your choice.
Together we can make Tennessee a better place for all who live and work here.

The Tennessee Democratic Party Veterans and Military Families Caucus released an open letter to address Republican Senator Marsha Blackburn’s attack on Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman. Instead of defending the decorated veteran and his sacrifices for our country, Senator Blackburn contributed to the witness backlash by sending a series of tweets questioning his patriotism and ultimately resulting in the loss of Lt. Col. Vindman’s job. The letter denounces Senator Blackburn and asks her to apologize for treating a member of the military in such a disrespectful way simply because she disagreed with him. All Tennesseeans are invited to stand with Veterans and Military Families by signing the letter denouncing Senator Blackburn's behavior. Sign the letter now!

# REPUBLICANS DEFEND CONFEDERATE
# GENERAL AND VOTE TO KEEP
# NATHAN BEDFORD FORREST BUST
# AT CAPITOL
First things first, when someone pulls out the ""politically correct"" card it means they're trying to control the debate to ultimately stop social change and progress.
Representative Rick Staples brought legislation again this week to remove the Nathan Bedford Forrest bust from a place of honor in the State Capitol. Republicans continued to argue against the removal. Republican Representative Sexton went as far to say, ""There wasn't enough data to know if Nathan Bedford Forrest was a bad person. He made mistakes, and all humans make [[URL REDACTED]]'s a lot of pressure for people to be politically correct and I don't want to go down that road."" Republicans then voted against the legislation and in favor of keeping the bust.
In the words of Democratic Representative Bo Mitchell, “This is not political correctness, this is historical correctness.... We know what this is about and you're either for or against the man who took up arms against the United States.”

INVEST IN DEMOCRACY
Disgusted by Marsha Blackburn's behavior? Discouraged by Governor Lee and the Republican legislator's broken promises?
The most impactful thing you can do to make the change you want to see in Tennessee, is to vote. But we also have to have strong candidates running good campaigns if we want to win and that's where your investment in the our work is crucial. It’s expensive to maintain and expand TNDP operations in an election year. Paying for things like poll watcher trainings, candidate recruitment efforts and campaign support are expensive – that’s why every dollar you contribute helps us win elections and fight back.

Mary Mancini,mary@tndp.org,this can't wait,"Friend,
I’m going to be as simple and direct as possible. In 2018, the TNDP built the most comprehensive voter protection program Tennessee had ever seen. Now, we need your help funding our 2020 Voter Protection program. Here’s a breakdown of where we stand right now:
Total Cost: $59,800
Raised so far: $14,741
We need to raise another $45,059
From reactivating and growing our volunteer network, to monitoring state and county election commissions, to recruiting poll watchers and staffing boiler room operations – this program covers ALL of the line items we need. This is how we ensure that every Democrat gets to vote, do it safely, and have their voice heard. This is how we beat the GOP.
We can’t wait until November to fund voter protection. Costs are already piling up and now is the time to lean in. Will you help us?
Thank you,

Mary Mancini,mary@tndp.org,01/11-01/17 TNDP Weekly Recap: Republicans on the Run,"Dear Friend,
Tennessee Democrats have Republicans on the run. When a reporter asked Tennessee Republican Party Chair Scott Golden what opportunities they have in 2020, he said, ""We’re certainly looking for places to be offensive, but quite frankly most of our efforts for the last three, four election cycles have been mainly defensive.""
It’s not surprising, considering Republican priorities.
Tennessee ranks 43rd in public health, 35th in education, and 41st in economic opportunity. Yet this week, the first week of the state legislative session, Republicans wasted no time pushing unnecessary and cruel legislation ny passing a bill to keep loving same sex couples from adopting a child with no family or home. Not only does this bill harm orphaned children and our LGTBQ+ neighbors, it also damages Tennessee’s economy by painting the state as discriminatory and making our state less attractive to potential employers.
And Tennessee has the highest number of minimum wage jobs, yet Republican Senator Brian Kelsey and gang are set to introduce an amendment to enshrine “right to work” into our constitution.
“Right to work” is legislation designed to strip rights away from working people by making it harder for them to form unions and collectively bargain for better wages, benefits, and conditions. It also gives businesses the upper hand and few consequences for unjustly firing workers. Tennessee has been a “right to work” state for more than 70 years. Now, instead of focusing on improving the lives of working families, Republicans are pushing to make this regressive “right to work” policy part of the Tennessee's constitution.
Rather than hurting our children, our families and our workers, all to push a divisive partisan agenda, Republicans should have begun this legislative session with an eye towards helping Tennesseeans. Instead of Republican politicians, the people of Tennessee need elected leaders that will pass laws to improve their lives.
Standing with Tennessee families,
Mary Mancini

TRUMP'S BROKEN PROMISES
AND LIES ABOUT THE ECONOMY
### As they do in Tennessee, Trump and his Washington Republicans are passing laws that hurt the working class.
* Nearly two-thirds of Americans say they aren’t any better off financially than they were at the start of Trump’s presidency, and more Americans say Trump’s economy is hurting them and their families than say it’s helping.
* 58% of Americans say the current economy is hurting the middle class, while only 32% say it’s helping, according to Pew Research.
* Job growth has slowed dramatically, and 2019 was the slowest year for job growth since 2011.
* For the first time in decades, America’s billionaires paid a lower tax rate in 2018 than the working class

Friend,
It’s Halloween - 3 days before Election Day - and Tennessee Democratic candidates are running hard across the state and raising quite a bit of hell. They have mobilized Tennesseans like never before, upset the status quo, and have their opponents running scared.
That’s why we’re having a day-long Halloween Hellraiser! We have until midnight tonight to reach our October end-of-month goal and - BOO! - we’re $5,460 short. The election may be 3 days away, but the TNDP is here to stay and we need to have the resources to keep supporting our candidates and raising hell.

Mary Mancini,mary@tndp.org,"TNDP Weekly Recap: Love is in the air, but Republicans continue to push hate","Dear Friend,
Presidential Primary early voting has begun and we're less than 3 weeks out from Election Day - Super Tuesday, March 3rd! [Early voting locations and times vary from county to county so contact your local county election commission for more info].
With Donald Trump's time left as president coming to an end, Republicans are rushing to push their extremist agenda through in Nashville and Washington.
Example 1: After giving a State of the Union Address in which he “shredded the truth,”, it didn't take Donald Trump long to break his promises, introducing a budget that will hurt working families and devastate the security of retirees. Trump’s budget proposed the following cuts:
* Medicare: $850 Billion CUT
* Medicaid: $920 Billion CUT
* Social Security: $30 Billion CUT
* Environmental Protection Agency: 26% CUT
Example 2: As if Trump and pals Moscow Mitch and Marsha Blackburn weren’t doing enough damage, Republicans right here in our own state legislature continued the destruction. Just this week they:
* Blocked a bipartisan effort to expand Medicare/Medicaid even as 177,000 additional children lose state coverage this year.
* Opposed Representative John Ray Clemmons' bill to feed hungry students at school.
* Made cruel jokes about women's health and refused to eliminate a tax on vital women's healthcare products.
As Republicans rush to get every piece of their “slate of hate” legislation passed before their time is up, Democrats are working hard every single day to improve life for all Tennesseans. But we cannot do it without you. We can’t win if we don’t show up and make our voices heard. We need every Democrat to vote in every election this year! Make a plan to vote in the Presidential Primary now, and mark your calendar for every upcoming election this year!
See you at the polls.

Mary Mancini,mary@tndp.org,SPECIAL IMPEACHMENT EDITION: It is a big deal,"Dear Friend,
In America, nobody is above the law - not even the president of the United States. Our elected members of Congress must be able to investigate serious abuses of our trust by other elected officials. Today's historic vote on the two articles of impeachment was more than warranted, it was Congress protecting our freedom.
What Trump did is a big deal:
* Trump abused the power of the presidency. Trump used the official powers of his office for his own personal gain. Trump pressured a foreign country to interfere in our elections to ensure his victory, risking our national security in the process. That is a violation of his constitutional oath, the public trust, and an impeachable offense. Period.
* Trump obstructed congress. He tried to cover up his abuse of power by directing an unprecedented effort to keep people close to him from testifying despite lawfully issued subpoenas. He violated his constitutional oath by impeding a congressional investigation and keeping the American people in the dark. Congress had a constitutional duty to act.
Trump's misconduct - his abuse of power and his obstruction of congress \- warrant the charges filed against him and follow a pattern of personal and political behavior that is corrupt, deceitful, and self-serving.
1. Self-serving: Because Trump's day-to-day behavior is so absurdly always about Trump, it's easy for folks to just shrug their shoulders and say, that's just Trump being Trump or even excuse it as normal. It is not normal for there to be flagrant political, personal influence in foreign policy. Multiple long-serving American public servants have testified that such a request was unheard of, “unusual and inappropriate.""
2. Corrupt: Many of President Trump's closest friends, advisors, and lawyers have been charged, convicted or are in jail, six from Mueller-related investigations alone. The latest ruling against Trump is that he must pay restitution for stealing from his own charity and has to pay $25 million to former students of Trump University for swindling them out of their hard-earned dollars.
3. Deceitful: Congress and their committees act on our behalf - that's why we elected them. They have the power to issue subpoenas for testimony and even presidents must comply. Trump directed a concerted and unprecedented defiance of lawful congressional-issued subpoenas.
Despite what the Republicans on the committee, Mitch McConnell and Senate Republicans will say, what Trump did is a big deal. It's not ""business as usual.""
These articles of impeachment are not only justified but what our country needs to keep our freedom.

Mary & the TNDP Team,mary@tndp.org,Celebrate the Best of Us: Celebrate Labor Day,"Today we celebrate the working families of Tennessee and the labor unions who ensure that every worker has unmatched economic opportunity and a reason to feel good about the future.
Dear Tennessee Democrat,
Happy Labor Day! Today, the Tennessee Democratic Party asks you to join us as we celebrate the working families of Tennessee and the labor unions who have been the collective voice that ensures American prosperity extends to the working families who make prosperity possible.
Today we celebrate the working families of Tennessee who sacrifice so much to teach our children, keep our bridges and roads safe, respond to 911 calls, serve our food and bus our dishes, steer our public transportation, keep the economy humming by rail, air, and road, build our houses and highrises, and so much more.
Today we also celebrate the labor unions who created the middle class by steadfastly proclaiming that the economy works best when there is a positive, partner relationship between labor and management. A partnership to ensure workers have a seat at the table to speak on their own behalf and management can be held accountability for unjust, unsafe, and inequitable workplaces and practices.
Today we celebrate labor unions who ensure that every worker - no matter who you are, what you look like, where you live, how you pray, or who you love - has unmatched economic opportunity and a reason to feel good about the future.
Unions are why working people earn a good living and have a better life. Unions make it easier to get the training needed to get good work. Unions make sure that those who already have good work are paid for their work. Unions help to create a growing economy that creates more good jobs. Unions won working families weekends off, vacations, sick leave, social security, minimum wage, anti-discrimination laws, the eight-hour work day and 40-hour work week, overtime pay, child protection labor laws, pensions for a secure and dignified retirement, collective bargaining rights, whistleblower protections, privacy rights, age discrimination laws, and parental leave.
The Tennessee Democratic Party is proud to uplift working families and our labor union brothers and sisters. This November, you can support them, too, by electing more leaders who will govern for the well-being of working families instead of treating the best among us as expendable. Check out our slate of Democratic candidates running up and down the ballot.

With exactly one week left before election day, the TNDP is hoping to get a few more donations to cover costs associated with our final GOTV and voter protection pushes.
Little things like paying for transportation for poll watchers, and doing our last minute GOTV phone banking can add up and we want to make sure we’re prepared. It may seem insignificant, but we want to leave absolutely no stone unturned. This election is the most important one of our lives. America is choosing between good and evil. Trump has to be stopped and his GOP cohorts are just as bad.

Thank you,

Mary Mancini,mary@tndp.org,Senator Warren has made some huge endorsements in TN,"Friend,
Senator Elizabeth Warren has endorsed a few key Tennessee candidates, and we couldn’t be more thrilled. Gabby Salinas (HD-97), Brandon Thomas (HD-49), and Gloria Johnson (HD-13) are all critical wins this November and we are so grateful to have Senator Warren’s commitment of support. That being said, we need to increase fundraising numbers if we are going to give these candidates the support they need. We’re 50 days away from the election – this can’t wait.
That’s why I’m asking you to make a donation today – we need to raise another $6,705 by tomorrow at midnight to meet our midmonth goal. Our Get Out The Vote push depends on your support, and in November we’re going to need every single vote we can get. Will you back up Senator Warren’s endorsement and donate right now?
Here’s what Senator Warren had to say about these incredible candidates:
* “I’m excited to support Gabby Salinas – a cancer survivor, scientist, and healthcare advocate – who is dedicated to bold, inclusive reform. Her story of survival and resilience speaks to who we are as Americans. She is running to take care of the community that took care of her and gave her a chance at life. Gabby is the real deal and has a proven ability to build a grassroots movement in support of progressive values. She will fight for the policies all Tennesseans deserve and I’m proud to endorse her for TN House District 97.”
* “I’m proud to endorse Brandon Thomas for Tennessee State House District 49. As a consensus builder and community advocate, Brandon has proven that he will fight hard for affordable health care, criminal justice reform, and to create an economy that works for everyone. Brandon will bring historic representation to the Tennessee General Assembly, and I’m excited to stand shoulder to shoulder with him in this fight, and the many fights to come.”
* “A special education teacher with 27 years of classroom experience, Gloria Johnson knows firsthand the challenges that families face. Whether she’s fighting to ensure every child has access to a meaningful, high-quality public education, making sure no family goes broke paying for a medical bill, or standing up to corrupt corporate special interests, Gloria is a champion for working families in HD-13. That is why I’m proud to support her bid for re-election.”
Tennessee has an amazing slate of diverse and qualified candidates, but they need your support if they are going to win this November. So please, consider making a donation right now, together we’ve got this!
Thank you,

Mary Mancini,mary@tndp.org,TNDP Weekly Recap: Extreme Republicans From Nashville To DC,"Dear Friend,
It's only been two weeks since lawmakers made their way back to the Tennessee state Capitol and Republicans have already set forth an aggressively corrosive agenda targeting Tennessee's values and families. As mentioned last week, Tennessee Democrats have Republicans on the run. And now, rather than prioritizing the needs of children and families, Republicans are using their borrowed time to push unhelpful and damaging policies while they still can.
This week during the Senate Health and Wellness Committee, it was revealed $214 Million in federal funds earmarked to help low income families with childcare costs had been lost. Tennessee was only 1 of 2 states in the entire country which did not spend the ""use it or lose it"" funds. These dollars are our tax dollars that would come back to Tennessee and they were rejected by Republicans, just like the billions of dollars that would have kept 13 rural hospitals from closing and insured 300,000 hardworking Tennesseans.
Rather than addressing this issue, practicing oversight, and fulfilling the responsibility of the government, Republicans ignored what’s needed and instead pushed unnecessary legislation to further harm children.
How? Republican Senator Brian Kelsey of Shelby introduced a ""right to work for less"" amendment to the constitution. Tennessee’s “Right to Work” law has been on the books for over 70 years and is already damaging enough to working families. The Bureau of Labor Statistics' research shows workers in “right to work for less” states make $7,443 less per year than workers in states that allow the protection of workers and their [[URL REDACTED]] is unnecessary and meaningless to add it to the state constitution but Republicans won’t stop until “right to work for less” is part of our constitution, even if it means deploying draconian tactics.
To further Republican extremism , Governor Bill Lee decided to host his first press conference of 2020 to unveil an attack on women, their reproductive rights, and their ability to make important and difficult decisions for themselves and their families. No politician, should insert themselves in the middle of the decision to end a pregnancy, choose adoption, or raise a child. Those decisions must be left to a woman, her family and her faith, in consultation with her doctor or health care provider. Republicans were acting in the best interests of Tennessee women, workers, children and families, they’d work with Democrats to put forth real solutions to reduce the number of unintended pregnancies (like age-appropriate reproductive health education (including teaching abstinence) & access to affordable contraceptives & reproductive health) and figure out how we lost $214 Million Dollars that would have served Tennessee children and their families.
Standing with Tennessee families,

# MARSHA BLACKBURN SHOULD
# BE CANCELED
During the Donald J. Trump impeachment hearings, when the elite group of elected U.S. Senators are to decide whether the values our country was founded on were compromised, Blackburn thought it was the proper time to catch up on her summer reading list. The impeachment of a president has only happened 2 other times during our country’s history. It’s a serious decision that must be made by the ""world's greatest deliberative body"" of which she is a part. A serious elected representative understands the gravity of her job and that accountability and personal responsibility are essential elements of character for a U.S. Senator. Sen. Blackburn’s behavior during the trial and her automatic response to being held accountable for it -she spent the afternoon harassing and attacking Purple Heart decorated Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman\- shows personal responsibility isn’t really part of her brand.""

TENNESSEE FARM BANKRUPTCIES
AT ALL TIME HIGH UNDER TRUMP
Due to broken promises, lies, and bad trade deals, Tennessee farms have suffered a great deal from Donald Trump. With bankruptcies being up 24% nationwide and 31% in Tennessee, farm families are bearing the pain for Trump's broken promises.
To further the damage done, Trump is trying to claim credit for a “phase one” China trade agreement. Trump’s trade deal accomplishes next to none of his original objectives and does not alleviate the billions of dollars in costs to American businesses and consumers that his policies with China have already [[URL REDACTED]]’s “phase one” China trade deal falls far short of the promises he made to farmers, and it won’t make up for billions of dollars in lost exports, bankrupt farms, and disrupted supply chains.

Mary & the TNDP Team,mary@tndp.org,"TODAY Is The Last Day to Early Vote: Together, We Can Redeem the Soul of Our Nation","""The vote is the most powerful nonviolent change agent you have in a democratic society."" - Congressman John Lewis
Dear Tennessee Democrat,
""Ordinary people with extraordinary vision can redeem the soul of America by getting in what I call good trouble, necessary trouble. Voting and participating in the democratic process are key. The vote is the most powerful nonviolent change agent you have in a democratic society. You must use it because it is not guaranteed. You can lose it.""
Congressman John Lewis
These words were part of a final message from Congressman John Lewis that he requested be published on the day of his funeral.
Congressman Lewis dedicated his final days to doing what he did so relentelssly and graciously all his life - call us to action for the good of the country. So today, on the last day to vote early for the August 6th primary election, it's up to all of us to heed his words and make a plan to make GOOD TROUBLE - and vote.
Why do we need to vote and make Tennessee a hotbed of GOOD TROUBLE? Because this week, at the exact moment the country was mourning the loss of a civil rights giant, Secretary of State Tre Hargett's attorney was arguing to the Tennessee Supreme Court against allowing increased access to absentee voting during a global pandemic. Said one Supreme Court Justice to the state's lawyer, ""You talk about absentee voting like it's a privilege, not a right...""
Whether you're voting early or on election day, 2020 is the year we make so much GOOD TROUBLE that we take back the White House and elect more Democrats up and down the ballot in Tennessee. Here's a list to help you plan for voting during COVID-19:
* MAKE A PLAN TO VOTE: Will you vote early or on election day? In the morning, lunchtime, or at night? Will you take the kids?
* TODAY, AUGUST 1, IS THE LAST DAY TO EARLY VOTE: Early voting locations and times vary from county to county so contact your local county election commission to find:
* Locations, days and times
* Sample ballots
* WEAR A MASK & SOCIALLY DISTANCE WHILE WAITING IN LINE
* BRING A PHOTO ID
* ELECTION DAY IS AUGUST 6 AND NOVEMBER 3: You will have to vote at your assigned precinct, which you can search for here.
* ABSENTEE VOTING: If you are a registered voter and do not wish to vote in-person due to the COVID-19 situation, you are eligible to request an absentee ballot by mail. More info on absentee voting can be found here.
* DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES: Visit [[URL REDACTED]] for a list of all Democrats on the ballot
* PROBLEMS? Call the TNDP voter protection team at 615-327-9779, fill out this incidident report form, reach out to the TNDP voter protectection Director, Kendra Lee, at [[URL REDACTED]] with any other questions or problems you have about voting.
John Lewis recognized that the elections of 2020 are the most important elections of our lifetime. There's no time to lose. Make GOOD TROUBLE. VOTE.

# PROTECT THE VOTE
#
One of the most impactful ways to volunteer for the November 3rd election is to train to become a poll watcher. Since the gutting of the Voting Rights Act there have been countless measures aimed at suppressing the vote in traditionally vulnerable communities. Republicans have teamed with election commissions to deploy modern day voter suppression tactics. Poll watchers will be the person on the ground at each polling site ensuring every individual has the right to exercise their right to vote. As a poll watcher you will:
* Resolve voting issues with election officials inside the polling place
* Resolve voting issues with voters outside the polling place (i.e., outside the 100-foot boundary)
* Collect all relevant information and quickly report it “up the chain”
TNDP is currently recruiting volunteers to be poll watchers. Email [[URL REDACTED]] to volunteer.
Attend our protect the vote information session!

# IT'S CRUNCH TIME. WE NEED YOUR HELP
Here's the reality: July and August are traditionally the hardest months to raise money in politics. And because of COVID-19, the Tennessee Democratic Party's resources are stretched thin. Given how this crisis will impact our economy, we are expecting a significant loss of revenue in the coming months which will impact our ability to win elections up and down the ballot this fall. Our staff, our offices, our voter protection program, our get out the vote program, our outreach programs, and our organizing capabilities all depend on the resources we can raise right now.
We need you in this fight alongside us. THANK YOU!

Mary Mancini,mary@tndp.org,GOP leadership,"Friend,
We’re still $9,045 away from February’s fundraising goal. We’ve got until Saturday to meet it, will you help us?
Bill Lee decided not to offer paid family leave to 38,000 state employees and signed an adoption bill allowing discrimination against LGBQT+ families. Marsha Blackburn accused a purple heart recipient of being unpatriotic and tweeted her way through the impeachment hearings. Joey Hensley pushed against a bill that reduces taxes on tampons and Micah Van Huss wanted to deem CNN and the Washington Post as ‘fake news.’
GOP leadership is failing us so badly right now it’s hard to watch. That’s why it’s so important that we elevate and elect Democrats in Tennessee. That’s why I’m asking you to donate to the TNDP right now.
Will you join us in our fight for a Tennessee that works for all of us?

We have just $2,240 left to raise in order to reach our August goal. We’re close but not there yet. Please consider making a donation right now and nudging us over the finish line. In a race this important, every penny matters. And we only have until midnight.
A year ago today I don’t think any of us could have imagined being in the place we’re in right now as a nation. A global pandemic has taken over 182,000 American lives, and left millions more in economic peril, and President Trump's only answer is ‘it could be much worse.’ And as peaceful protestors fight for justice and stand up to systemic racism, President Trump calls them domestic terrorists and uses our military against them.
This is where we are right now, but it's not too late to take back the soul of America. Electing steady and effective leaders is the way out, and we get that opportunity this November. That’s why we need to make sure Democrats show up like never before in this election. That’s why we need to win.
So again, please consider making a donation right now. This is the time for Democrats to stand up. We’re all in this together.
Thank you,

I’d like to ask for your help – we are $5,080 away from July’s fundraising goal and the clock runs out at midnight tomorrow. We’ve pushed our fundraising goals more than ever before this year and I think you know why.
Donald Trump and the Republican party have done more damage to this country in the past 4 years than we ever thought possible.

And right now, that means electing Democrats.

Friend,
I’d like to tell you what we are focusing on this month, and ask for your help.
We are trying to raise $10,000 to help fund a new digital program for our candidates. The program will cost in excess of $100k, but an extremely generous donor has agreed to cover the rest if we can raise the first $10k. This program gives our candidates cutting edge data visualization tools, and allows us to provide important insights at the district and precinct levels. With social distancing being the new normal, we are staying ahead of the curve by continuing to offer state of the art digital services to all of our candidates.
We understand why some people prefer to give to individual campaigns – but this is an example of how we can come together as a state party to be more efficient and smarter. This is how we can beat Republicans in 2020.
Will you help us by making a donation right now - and help us fund this exciting program?
November is coming quickly, and it is more important than ever to come together and mobilize as Democrats. We’re all in this together!
Thank you,

Mary Mancini,mary@tndp.org,TNDP Weekly Recap: With Gratitude for Democrats Running for Office in this Uncertain Time,"Yesterday was the filing deadline for candidates to appear on the November ballot and Democrats stepped up to answer the people’s calls for change in priorities, policy, and leadership.
Dear Friend,
A dangerous and turbulent time — like the one our country is experiencing right now — is a stark reminder of why we need steady leadership at all levels of government. Leadership that listens to experts, follows the recommendation of scientists, and always prioritizes protecting families and keeping communities safe.
Yesterday was the filing deadline for candidates to appear on the November ballot and Democrats stepped up to answer the people’s calls for change in priorities, policy, and leadership. Our 2020 candidates represent the strength of the diversity of our great state and embody our Tennessee Democratic Party values - that every Tennessean, no matter who you are, what you look like, where you live, how you pray, or who you love, should have the opportunity for a better life for you and your family.
This week I'm dedicating my letter to every Democratic candidate that filed a petition and every single signee who found a creative and COVID-19 safe way to put their signature on a petition. We are at a crossroads in this state and in the country, and the 2020 election will be one of the most important in our history. This is a difficult time and every day we head into unfamiliar territory. Please join me in applauding every person who, with courage and conviction, stepped up to run for office to work for and protect Tennessee families. Thank you for your leadership.
With Gratitude,
Mary Mancini

Mary & the TNDP Team,mary@tndp.org,Moving Forward for the Soul of our Nation,"During convention week, we heard from an array of strong women. Together, we honored Tennessee's suffragette history, elevated female voices, and nominated Kamala Harris and Joe Biden.
Dear Tennessee Democrat,
Last week was incredible for Democrats in the state and around the country: we held the first-ever virtual convention, we nominated a historic ticket, and here in Tennesee we honored the role of women in our progressive history featuring Tennessee Democratic women leaders during a live roll call appearance from Nashville.
# Tennessee Shines during the DNC Roll Call
Replete with yellow roses and other symbols of the suffragette movement, these accomplished and extraordinary women cast Tennessee's delegation votes for the Biden/Harris ticket. Alexandra Petri of Washington Post lauded Tennessee's roll call vote, saying that the delegation used its brief time for a successful homage to the women who fought for the vote.  Watch the video.
Tuesday night, the TNDP hosted RATIFIED!, a 100th anniversary celebration of the 36 states responsible for ratifying the 19th amendment. This powerful roll call of states commemorated the day 100 years ago when Tennessee became the 36th state to vote YES to expand women's rights.
Tennessee State Senator, Raumesh Akbari took the mainstage to deliver a keynote address. She discussed Joe Biden's advocacy for women's rights and where he'll lead the country the next four years.
At the TNDP Delegate breakfasts during the week, we heard from Marquita Bradshaw, our nominee for U.S. Senate. Marquita is a community organizer, a warrior for progressive causes, and the only black woman running for the U.S. Senate this year. We also heard from former U.S. Senator Heidi Heitkamp, who raved about and endorsed TNDP rural caucus vice chair and candidate for state senate, Chase Clemoons. We heard from Gabby Salinas, our candiate state House District 97, who is campaigning to expand Medicaid in Tennessee. We heard from Mariah Phillips, a mother and teacher, who is seeking to ensure a safe and rewarding educational experience for all of Tennessee's children.
Women remain deeply underrepresented at every level of government. We need to use this historic election to continue to empower women by electing them up and down the ballot.
It's this energy - this mission to change the face of government as we know it - that's the key to success this election. Working together we must take this inspirational message of change, opportunity, and compassion to everyone in the Volunteer State. We must work to turn out every voter—from the party faithful to Republicans disgruntled with a reckless GOP to non-voters who feel let down by the status quo.
We got our marching orders from nearly every speaker we heard from. For the next ten weeks, we will draw on the strength of the women who came before us - from Ida B. Wells to Shirley Chisholm to Lois DeBerry - to put Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in the White House and flip as many seats from red to blue as we can. Let's get to work.

Mary Mancini,mary@tndp.org,about last month...,"Friend,
Last Sunday I would have normally asked for help reaching our end of month fundraising goal. I’d have mentioned our progress, how much we needed to close the gap, then asked for a contribution.
None of that was necessary because of the generosity of one man, Bill Freeman. You know Bill because of his unyielding commitment to electing Democrats and his many contributions to Democratic candidates and progressive organizations throughout the years. Last month, he generously contributed our ENTIRE goal in response to a fundraising email. We are so grateful for his contribution, giving us the resources we need to keep fighting to elect more Democrats at every level of government. Thank you so very much, Bill!
As excited as we are, fundraising remains critical in order to take on the GOP. With your help, we can keep up the momentum that Bill so generously jump-started. With all the injustice and lack of leadership we’re seeing from Republicans, supporting Democrats has never been more important.
Thank you,

Mary Mancini,mary@tndp.org,TNDP Weekly Recap: We Must Pass Vote By Mail,"No person should ever have to choose between the safety of their family and casting their vote. Tennessee Secretary of State Tre Hargett, Governor Bill Lee, and President Donald Trump must create a no-excuse vote by mail system.
Dear Friend,
It’s been two weeks since you heard from us (hope you and yours had a joyous holiday season) and in these two weeks, as much as things have changed, some things have stayed exactly the same.
Democratic lawmakers in Tennessee, who believe in an efficient, smart, and effective government, are fighting for policies to protect lives and serve working families. Republicans, who for 40 years picked up and ran with Reagan's ""small government conservative"" message have given us a hot mess. With them in charge, the government is not only NOT small, it's ineffective and corrupt, too.
More succinctly, Democrats believe in a government whose role it is to protect our freedoms and keep us safe.
Republicans? They created what they asked for all those years ago: ""Government is not a solution to our problem; government is the problem.""
This week we also found out definitively that people in Tennessee are testing positive, even though they are asymptomatic, when the Tennessee Department of Corrections tested some employees and found thirteen who tested positive for COVID19. All had no symptoms.
This is why everyone must be tested. It's why we can't go back to normal day-to-day unless everyone is tested.
Yet, in several press conferences this week, Governor Bill Lee announced his plan to ignore this and all advice from health and science professionals with a plan to reopen the state to normal activity economy May 1. Does he have a plan for how to re-open in 14 days? No. Is there a single health professional on his advisory board? No. Is Governor Lee being transparent about transmission rates? No.
We've said it before, and we'll say it again: A dangerous and turbulent time — like the one our country is experiencing right now — is a stark reminder of why we need steady leadership at all levels of government to keep us safe. Leadership that listens to experts, follows the recommendation of scientists, and always prioritizes protecting families and keeping communities safe.
Stay safe & stay home,
Mary Mancini

We are trying to raise $10,000 to help fund a new digital program for our candidates. The program will cost in excess of $100k, but an extremely generous donor has agreed to cover the rest if we can raise the first $10k. This program gives our candidates cutting edge data visualization tools, and allows us to provide important insights at the district and precinct levels. With social distancing being the new normal, we are staying ahead of the curve by continuing to offer state of the art digital services to all of our candidates.
We understand why some people prefer to give to individual campaigns – but this is an example of how we can come together as a state party to be more efficient and smarter. This is how we can beat Republicans in 2020.
Will you help us by making a donation right now - and help us fund this exciting program?
November is coming quickly, and it is more important than ever to come together and mobilize as Democrats. We’re all in this together!

Last night several things were made clear:
* Pence has no remorse, or even ownership, for this administration’s catastrophic mishandling of the pandemic, despite his role as chair of the White House Coronavirus Task Force.
* Pence has no problem consistently interrupting and speaking down to women.
* Pence laughs of the idea that there is systemic racism in America
* Pence believes that women should not have the right to choose what happens to their body, and if re-elected overturning Roe v. Wade would be a priority.
* Pence thinks Trump is doing a good job.
* Flies find him inviting.
Kamala Harris on the other hand, gave responses to questions with poise and grace. She had substance behind her answers, and undeniably demonstrated that she could handle the pressures and responsibilities of the oval office.
We were also reminded, that there is more than the very top of the ticket on the ballot. In Tennessee we have so many amazing Democratic candidates. There are just 26 days left before our country’s fate is sealed. Please, make a donation right now, and help us defeat the corrupt GOP and elect Democrats. Help us get out the vote. Help us WIN!

Mary Mancini,mary@tndp.org,TNDP Weekly Recap: The One About the End of Legislative Session ,"The Tennessee General Assembly went back in session and Tennessee Democrats did what we do best - we listened to all the economic, health, and justice-related hardships and fought for laws to fix them.
Dear Tennessee Democrat,
We are a nation and state in crisis and when the Tennessee General Assembly went back in session after a COVID-19 recess, Tennessee Democrats did what we do best - we listened to the problems - economic, health, and justice-related - and fought for these laws that would fix them:
* Healthcare expansion during the global pandemic
* Economic relief for small businesses during the economic recession
* Healthcare coverage for new mothers and adults with disabilities
* The removal of the bust of a racist confederate leader & KKK founder from a place of honor in the State Capitol
* Funding for public schools and increase in pay for teachers
* Racial justice and equity
* Use of force reform
* Expansion of access to absentee voting
Republicans ignored all the suffering to prove, once again, that they cannot be trusted to do their job or what's best for Tennesseans anymore. While Democrats brought legislation to help, Republicans played election year party politics and killed any and every bill we brought to the table. Not only that, but they actively worked to cause harm. Here's just a sample of what the Republican supermajority pushed:
* Stripping county health departments of their mandated power during a pandemic
* Blocking healthcare coverage to 300,000 hard working Tennesseans
* Blocking rights for working Tennesseans through a harmful ""right to work for less"" bill
* Memorialized a man who was a slave owner, confederate leader, and the founder of the KKK
* Slandering and defaming a murdered 17-year-old girl
* Creating additional tax breaks for the wealthiest Tennesseans
* Slashing pandemic related financial support to cities
* Defunding public schools to fund Governor Lee's failed voucher bill
Perhaps their most egregious act came well-past midnight on the last night of seesion. With the doors to the Tennessee Capitol locked and rules in the Senate suspended, Republican leaders and legislators passed a radical and unconstitutional ban on abortion that strips 51% of Tennesseans of their civil liberties and removes any and all protections for victims of rape and incest. This - introducing and ramming through a bill they promised they would not take up and told no one they’d be discussing - was a purely political and punitive act and illustrates perfectly the reason why no politician should usurp the authority of women when it comes to decisions about their reproductive health.
We demand better of our legislators. If Republicans don't want to do their job and work with Democrats to do what's best for the people they serve, they must be replaced in November.
We've got a phenomenal list of Democratic candidates on the ballot this August and November. Check out the list and support who you can, how you can.
Fighting with you,

Dear Tennessee Democrat,
Black Lives Matter. It is with hearts heavy with sadness that we send our love to George Floyd's family, friends, and community. The senseless killing of black men and women, and the racism behind these acts, is a plague on this country.
Black Lives Matter. But repeating these words it is not enough. And, after the horrific events in Minneapolis and the senseless killing of yet another black man, many of you are saying, ""what can we DO?""
Black Lives Matter. First, the Tennessee Democratic Party will continue to work to elect candidates who will fight for freedom, equality, and justice, for all - no matter who you are, what you look like, where you live, how you pray, or who you love. What you can do is find the candidate near you who shares these values and help to elect them. Elections and voting matters because it matters who leads in times of crisis and fundamental change.
Black Lives Matter. What you can also do, especially if you are a white ally, is to step back, stop, and listen. Find the black (or other minority-led) organization(s) in your community who are on the ground organizing and taking action on issues of racism, inquality, and injustice. Find the leaders of these organizations and then allow them to tell you what they need you to do to help. Then listen.

# THEME OF THE WEEK: FACTS
The theme of this week is facts: Twitter began fact checking President Donald Trump, Republicans in Nashville ignored facts about gun violence, and Democrats advocated on behalf of facts about the economy and healthcare in Tennessee.
The Tennessee General Assembly came back this week after a recess during COVID19, and rather than address the pandemic and the jaw dropping statistics of the harm it placed on Tennesseeans, here is a list of what the Republican Supermajority decided to focus on:
* Removed gun permitting laws even after the pleas of law enforcement
* Pushed open gun carry on college campuses
* Limited women's reproductive rights
* Attacked teenage students
* Routed money away from Tennessee public schools
Over half a million unemployed Tennesseans, hundreds dead, and thousands sick, yet Republicans are pushing their slate of hate rather than addressing the crisis at hand. If Republicans truly cared about serving Tennesseans they would work to save lives and restore the econonmy.
Republicans must work with Democrats to:
* Ensure medical treatment for people who don’t have health insurance
* Protect lives in the wake of the COVID 19 Pandemic
* Provide necessary relief for the over 500,000 unemployed
* Expand access to absentee ballots to keep you safe when you vote
Republicans can continue to ignore facts or they can work with Democrats to serve the people of Tennessee. We hope and pray its the latter and if it's not, November is coming.
Fact checking with you,

""Action to safeguard our electoral system cannot wait. In a matter of weeks, millions of Americans across several states will be asked to vote in municipal and primary elections, and they deserve better than the impossible choice between preserving their well-being and casting their ballots."" -TNDP chair, Mary Mancini
No Tennessean should ever have to choose between protecting their family or casting their vote. The Tennessee General Assembly had six different opportunities to pass legislation to protect voters before they recessed last month. The Republican supermajority voted everything down.
Now, they are back in session and every indication is that they will continue to vote down all efforts to relax restrictions on absentee ballots.
Sign the petition now!
The COVID-19 pandemic poses a new threat to elections across Tennessee. But Tennessee has the ability to ensure Tennesseans don’t have to choose between exercising their right to vote or working at the polls and protecting their health. We need your help.
Here are some other actions you can take:
* Find your legislator.
* Call your legislator.
* Write a letter to your legislator using TNDP's letter sample.
* Write a letter to your newspaper's local editor. Use this sample.

This election is about more than Trump. It’s about choosing decision makers, and putting them in a place of power. From Sheriff to Schoolboard, from City Council to State Legislature – these are the people that will decide Tennessee’s future, and the TNDP wants to make sure the right people get the jobs.

From passing illegal anti-choice legislation in the middle of the night behind locked doors, to coronavirus policies that have put our citizens at risk – the GOP needs to go. Will you please make a donation, right now if you can, to the TNDP and help our efforts to get out the vote?
Thank you,

Mary Mancini,mary@tndp.org,flipping seats,"Friend,
The election is 67 days away and here’s the deal.
In 2018 Tennessee Democratic voter turnout increased in all 95 counties - in some places as much as 25%. With the right investment and messaging strategy we know we can flip seats in November. Targeted media will help mobilize Democrats to vote, vote early, and vote safely - but we need help covering costs.
We’ve already started assembling an amazing team to help us Get Out The Vote and support our diverse and talented roster of candidates. Now we need to focus on voter turnout. Targeted messaging and media are more critical than ever because of COVID-19. The GOP thinks that they have Tennessee on lock but we’re going to prove them wrong.
Will you make a donation right now, and help us pay for the media strategy needed to flip these crucial seats?
Thank you,

Mary Mancini,mary@tndp.org,We sued and we won,"Friend,
This past week was a lot – from the tragic tornadoes that ravaged middle Tennessee to Super Tuesday to the first confirmed case of the coronavirus in the state.
When it mattered most though, and because of your support, the Tennessee Democratic Party had the resources we needed to respond effectively: we filed a winning lawsuit on Super Tuesday to extend polling hours and ensure that those affected by the tornado could vote. And we helped increase Democratic primary voter turnout by 40% from 2016.
To make sure we can continue our work of supporting and turning out voters, for the month of March we are firing up our GRASSROOTS LEADERS PROGRAM.
A GRASSROOTS LEADER invests in the TNDP by setting up a recurring monthly donation of $5, $10, $20 or more from now until November 2020.
We’ve set a goal of 800 new GRASSROOTS LEADERS for this election cycle, and we need your help.
Will you commit to a recurring donation today, and give us the resources needed to help Tennessee Democrats?
To put it simply – we were prepared because of the support of Tennessee Democrats like you. That’s why our GRASSROOTS LEADERS program is so important - so we know we’ll have what we need when we need it. Please consider committing to a monthly donation today, and help us reach our goal of 800 new GRASSROOTS LEADERS – it would mean the world to us.

Mary Mancini,mary@tndp.org,TNDP Weekly Recap: Democrats Fight COVID-19,"Dear Friend,
In the face of the Coronavirus pandemic, Democrats from Washington to Nashville are not hiding, they’re not blaming, they’re not making excuses - they are stepping up to get work done on behalf of the people of the state and country.
In Nashville, Democrats in the TN General Assembly are working across the aisle to try to pass mandatory legislation to keep the government up and running. While Republicans took it as an opportunity to pass a $40 million voucher program, here are some of the things Democrats fought for while the budget discussion carried on until Midnight Thursday:
* Ensure medical treatment for people who don’t have health insurance
* Build up healthcare facilities, equipment and supplies
* Provide needed relief for people who are out of work and businesses that are struggling
* 100% No Excuse Needed Vote By Mail
It was a heated night, and even after Republicans made it impossible to pass legislation to protect Tennesseans, Democrats never gave up. Here are a few Democratic hot takes and quotes from the night:
""We’re spending $1 Million to test deer, but a human of Tennessee has to reach a certain threshold to be tested. This is a matter of values. Who do we value most: our people or deer? Do we want to be testing deer carcus or human carcus? Do we want to test Bambi or should we start testing Randy, Andy, and Sandy? - Representative Antonio Parkinson""
""We're supposed to be here passing a budget to address an emergency situation to the people of TN, but, ya'll are up here money grubbing. - Representative Bo Mitchell ""
""Middle Tennessee was hit by a tornado and now the whole state by this pandemic........ We are flush with cash in this state. Are we spending it wisely to help Tennessee? - Representative John Ray Clemons""
""I don’t like the idea of having to vote for a budget that contains vouchers (which is the most misguided legislation I’ve ever seen.) But, my biggest concern with this budget is we’re not doing enough to address this virus and crisis. - Representative Bo Mitchell ""
""The way we have managed this state has left too many people vulnerable in the face of this crisis. Everyone in this room knows we would be in better shape if we hadn’t closed 13 hospitals across this state. Everyone in this room knows we would be in better shape if we didn’t have hundreds of thousands of uninsured.- Senator Jeff Yarbro""
We applaud every single Democrat fighting for the health and safety of people of Tennessee. A smart, effective government that keeps its people safe should be the goal of every elected representative we send to Washington and Nashville. If they can't do the work necessary to protect us through these difficult times, they need to get out of the way and let Democrats lead - it is evident now more than ever Democrats are the most equipped.
As we navigate these weird and uncertain times, we hope you'll remember your Democratic values and continue to care for yourself, your state, and your neighbor.
Standing with you from a responsible social distance,
\- Mary Mancini

# All across the state and up and down the ballot, Democrats are stepping up to lead! Just this week, 9 Democrats pulled petitions in Williamson County alone. Read more!

# REPUBLICANS USED A NATIONAL
# PANDEMIC TO SUPPRESS VOTERS
The Tennessee General Assembly had half a dozen different opportunities to pass Vote By Mail legislation while passing mandatory laws to recess session during the Coronavirus pandemic. The Republican supermajority voted it down each time, and instead voted to create voting super-sites. This is in direct conflict with CDC recommendations and force voters to choose between staying safe or casting their vote.Tennesseans should not have to choose between keeping their families safe and casting a vote.

# 5 TN REPUBLICANS VOTE AGAINST
# BIPARTISAN CORONAVIRUS AID BILL
# Tennesseans are losing their jobs at an alarming rate, parents are trying to figure out how they will continue to feed their children, and the uninsured are endangering themselves and others for fear of Coronavirus testing costs; yet five Tennessee Republicans voted NO for the necessary steps that will keep Tennesseans safe, secure, and free.
They voted NO on a bipartisan Coronavirus relief package that passed the House 363-40 and the Senate 90 - 8. They voted NO on an aid package that enhances unemployment insurance, guarantees free testing, & provides up to 10 days of paid sick leave. They voted NO as Tennesseans face one of the largest crises we have ever faced.

We were so excited to see the diversity and talent of Thursday’s primary winners. Now that we have our candidates, it’s time to go all in! That is why I’m asking for a contribution today. From Digital to Field to Volunteer recruitment and training – we need to raise a minimum of $40,000 a month from now until election day.
Some fun facts about our incredible 2020 slate:
·47% of State House candidates are women
·24% of State House candidates are people of color
·Two State House candidates are LGTBQ+
·62% of State Senate candidates are women
·38% of State Senate candidates are Black
·Marquita Bradshaw is the first black woman in Tennessee history to win the nomination to the US Senate and the only black woman running for Senate in the entire country
The bottom line is that we have candidates that people are excited to vote for. We need to do everything we can to protect that vote and keep voters informed. We have an uphill battle ahead of us, and we can’t win it alone. Will you help us by donating to the TNDP right now? It’s time for Tennessee to shed some red!
Thank you,

I’d like to tell you what we are focusing on this month, and ask for your help.
We are trying to raise $10,000 to help fund a new digital program for our candidates. The program will cost in excess of $100k, but an extremely generous donor has agreed to cover the rest if we can raise the first $10k. This program gives our candidates cutting edge data visualization tools, and allows us to provide important insights at the district and precinct levels. With social distancing being the new normal, we are staying ahead of the curve by continuing to offer state of the art digital services to all of our candidates.
We understand why some people prefer to give to individual campaigns – but this is an example of how we can come together as a state party to be more efficient and smarter. This is how we can beat Republicans in 2020.
Will you help us by making a donation right now - and help us fund this exciting program?
November is coming quickly, and it is more important than ever to come together and mobilize as Democrats. We’re all in this together!

Mary Mancini,mary@tndp.org,TNDP Weekly Recap: Wash Your Hands,"Dear Friend,
The COVID-19 virus has made its way to Tennessee and rather than making us feel safe and secure, the Republicans in Washington and Tennessee have caused more hysteria.
First, President Trump gave a speech that triggered the worst Market plunge since the crash of 1987and panicked overseas travelers.
Then, in the wake of his terrifying performance, we find that while he was weaponizing the virus to be used against his opponent in November - “Democratic Party Hoax,” anyone? - he knew weeks ago it would be a “Major Threat” and did nothing. (Also read: “America’s shamefully slow coronavirus testing threatens all of us.”
Here at home, Governor Bill Lee and his administration refused to release the names of counties with confirmed cases. Then, they released county names, but revealed that none of our county health departments had tests. Sure hope they have a plan in place for testing in the thirteen rural areas across the state that are without hospitals.
In the moments after a state of emergency was declared in Tennessee, as teachers wondered if students would go hungry with schools closed and working men and women wondered how they would feed their families, Republican Speaker of the House Cameron Sexton thought it was the appropriate time to push a bill to make the Bible the State Book of Tennessee. Regardless of this crisis, they simply can’t stop running for re-election.
It is more evident than ever, the Republican rejection of all-things government - their failure to understand the importance of, and see the need for, a smart, effective, and well-functioning body to keep its people safe and secure - has caused this terrifying problem.
In November, we'll have the opportunity to change the trajectory of this state. We’ll have the opportunity to elect legislators who believe in government, public service, and the job they were elected to do. Most important, we’ll have the opportunity to elect leaders who embrace the need for a government who will keep its people safe.
In the meantime, there’s a lot we can do to help keep each other safe and we encourage you to take the following precautions to help protect yourself and others from respiratory viruses:
* Stay home when feeling sick.
* Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. An alcohol-based hand sanitizer can be used if soap and water are not available.
* Cough or sneeze into your arm, not into your hands or the air.
* Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
* Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth.
* Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.
* Get the flu vaccine if you haven’t already. While the flu vaccine does not protect against coronavirus infection, it can help keep you healthy during the flu season.
We also encourage you to choose a day to have your staff and teams practice teleworking and ensure your systems and technology are properly functioning to support this. We also encourage you to move meetings or larger gatherings to remote options like Google Hangouts or Zoom.
In addition, we have found the following resources useful:
* CDC Fact Sheet
* World Health Organization Coronavirus Video
* CDC Guidance on Handwashing
* CDC Travel Guidance
* The National Governors Association’s Coronavirus – What You Need to Know page includes links to specific official state actions and activities.

# REPRESENTATIVE HODGES
# PASSES INSULIN CAP BILL
With bipartisan support, Democratic Representative Jason Hodges successfully passed an insulin price cap bill.

In the wake of the Middle Tennessee Tornado Tragedy, 21 polls across the state were closed. In Davidson County, many polling locations opened late. Thousands of people were unable to cast their ballot as planned, and yet the Secretary of State and Davidson County Election Commission would not expand poll times. This was not okay and would cause irreparable damage to democracy. TNDP filed a lawsuit for injunction to have poll times extended to make up for these delays. We won the lawsuit and kept polls open as late as 10PM. This is the exact work your contributions fund. Your contributions protect Tennessee's right to cast their ballots for Democrats and provide the staff and resources needed to do the work. Will you consider donating today?

Mary Mancini,mary@tndp.org,"TNDP Weekly Recap: When we organize, we win","The Tennessee Democratic Party stands with all people and organizations who seek to dismantle the racist systems that destroy too many lives.
Dear Tennessee Democrat,
‘I will never understand’ is not enough.
We must gain understanding of systemic racism and the power structures that exist in this country - the same systemic racism and power structures that continue to destroy and take the lives of unarmed innocent Black people. By learning more, we gain the understanding necessary to fight these injustices.
‘I see you” is not enough.
Passive bystanderism is costly and deadly to those who need active help. Rather than just seeing need, we must step in and meet it head on. We can do this by protesting, actively engaging, marching, and speaking up, calling out racism whenever we see it. Standing with the Black community does more than just seeing it.
‘All Lives Matter’ is not enough.
It is impossible for all lives to matter until Black Lives Matter. These are the lives that are lost daily in a manner no others are. This is the moment we are facing. We must confront this truth if we are ever to save those Black lives.
Promoting patience is not enough.
Justice delayed is justice denied. The Black community has waited far too long for justice, and we must meet that demand now. This is a time for action, not patience.
Saying their names is not enough.
We cannot just say the names of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and Daniel Hambirck and the countless others and call it activism. We must condemn their deaths, honor their memory, and uphold their fight by making sure no more names are added to the list of Black people murdered by police violence.
Boycotting businesses that stay quiet is not enough.
Shop, dine, and support Black business and restaurants. Many Black owned businesses suffer from gentrification and large corporations driving them out or taking their business. Find them in your city, take your friends, be a regular.
Social Media activism is not enough.
To cause change, we must empower our citizens with their fundamental rights. We must make sure that their vote is protected and that they are protected when they vote with access to absentee voting, abolishing all Voter ID laws, identifying and ending modern day voter suppression, and ensuring all Tennesseans have access to their polling locations during early vote and on Election Day, despite job schedules.
Anti-Trump sentiment is not enough.
Leadership matters. Governing matters. Donate, organize, volunteer, and elect candidates who are committed to fighting injustices with meaningful legislation and undoing harmful legislation. Run for office when no candidate is promising these changes. Uplift and encourage Black and other candidates of color to represent districts that have no representation of minority populations. Call your local officials and demand change in your cities, counties, and state.
Enough is enough.
The Tennessee Democratic Party stands with all organizations and people who seek to dismantle the racist systems that destroy too many lives. If any Tennessean wants to stand with us but does not know where to begin, find the black (or other minority-led) organization(s) in your community who are on the ground organizing and taking action on issues of racism, inequality, and injustice. Find the leaders of these organizations and then allow them to tell you what they need you to do to help. Then listen.

# JUDGE OVERRULES GOV. BILL LEE
# AND REPUBLICANS IN VICTORY
# FOR DEMOCRACY
Thousands signed our petition for no excuse absentee ballots. Hundreds of Tennesseans called their legislator. Dozens of bills proposed by Tennessee Senate Democratic Caucus and Tennessee House Democratic Caucus. Bill Lee and Tennessee Republican Party ignored all pleas by Tennesseans and all recommendations by the CDC. The following Democrats from Memphis Hunter Demster, Earle J. Fisher, UP THE VOTE 901, and Allison Donald filed a bi-partisan suit with Republicans demanding Tennessee offer health protection during the 2020 election. On Thursday afternoon, a Judge overruled Governor Bill Lee and Tennessee Republican Legislators to mandate a no excuse absentee ballot measure.
When we organize and stand for what are our rights, we can win. When we partner with the other side and stop with harmful party politics, we can exponentially improve lives in Tennessee. TNDP thanks for all the hard work each and every Tennesseean did to make this happen.

# DONALD TRUMP WREAKS
# HAVOC ON AMERICA
You saw them video this week. You know, the video of the President of the United States unleashing the military on his own people all for an awkared publicity stunt. What President Trump did is what dictators do. It made us sick to our stomach, but, we won't let it distract us from his total lack of leadership through COVID-19.
This week's jobs report released unemployment at 13.3% - this is the highest it has ever been since the Great Depression. Both African American unemployment is 16.8% and Hispanic unemployment is 17.6% — near record highs and still far higher than the 12.4% rate for white Americans. Our economy was so vulnerable because of three years of Trump's failed economic leadership.
* Trump promised that China would make more than $200 billion in additional purchases of U.S. goods, but that’s nowhere close to happening. In fact, U.S. exports are still far lower than before Trump’s trade war.
* In 2019, manufacturing was in a recession, farmers were struggling under Trump’s reckless trade policies, and the retail industry cut 75,000 jobs.
* Trump’s tax bill allowed the 400 wealthiest Americans to pay a lower tax rate than all other Americans for the first time ever.
* Trump promised corporations would raise workers’ wages, but instead they spent money from his tax cuts on stock buybacks for their wealthy shareholders.

# THANK YOU...
Last Sunday, our chairwoman, Mary Mancini would have normally asked for help reaching our end of month fundraising goal. She would have mentioned our progress, how much we needed to close the gap, then asked for a contribution.
None of that was necessary because of the generosity of one man, Bill Freeman. You know Bill because of his unyielding commitment to electing Democrats and his many contributions to Democratic candidates and progressive organizations throughout the years. Last month, he generously contributed our ENTIRE goal in response to a fundraising email. We are so grateful for his contribution, giving us the resources we need to keep fighting to elect more Democrats at every level of government. Thank you so very much, Bill!
As excited as we are, fundraising remains critical in order to take on the GOP. With your help, we can keep up the momentum that Bill so generously jump-started. With all the injustice and lack of leadership we’re seeing from Republicans, supporting Democrats has never been more important.
Will you consider investing in the TNDP today?

Mary Mancini,mary@tndp.org,thank you thank you thank you,"Friend,
You. Guys. Rock.
Seriously. We can’t believe that you’ve already donated $4,235 towards our DIG2020 program – not to mention the generous donor who has agreed to match funds up to $6,000 this month and fully fund all data acquisitions for 2020. To show our gratitude, and put a little skin in the game, I’ve decided to up the ante.
If we reach $6,000 by midnight tonight I will commit to singing a song of your choice at our next karaoke event on January 29 in Nashville, and have a staff member take a video that we will send out to everyone on our email list. I hate singing in public. That’s how important this is.
Will you make a donation before midnight tonight, and help us close the $1,765 gap to fully fund all data needs for this year (and make me make a fool out of myself)?
Thank you,
\--

Mary Mancini,mary@tndp.org,no goal in mind,"Friend,
Locally targeted digital ads are going to make the difference for Tennessee Democratic candidates these next 11 days. As we mentioned, Facebook changed their policy so that all new political ads have to be posted by this Tuesday in order to run through the election.
I’m asking you today to donate, but with no specific goal. Literally every dollar we raise for digital ads will allow us to reach more Tennessee voters – so we are trying to raise as much as humanly possible.
This race isn’t just about Donald Trump. So many important decisions that affect each and every Tennessean are made at the local level. If it upset you when Bill Lee and his GOP minions met in a locked capital building at midnight to pass a bill banning all abortions with no exceptions for rape or incest; if it upset you that throughout the state mask mandates were not enforced or taken seriously; if you’re struggling because of the economic impact of the pandemic – remember that all of these things and more are on the ballot.
Tennessee needs leadership at every level of government that will strive to protect and support ALL Tennesseans. If you can, please make a donation right now.
Thank you,
\--

Emily Cupples,emily@tndp.org,Day 2 Convention | 100th Anniversary of the 19th Amendment,"This morning on the 100th anniversary of the 19th amendment, we heard from rural leaders, working-class advocates, and rising Black voices in the Democratic Party. Tonight, we will hold a special event to celebrate the centennial for women's suffrage—you'll hear from women leaders like Atlanta mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms . Join us for breakfast tomorrow and Thursday, where you'll hear from national leaders like Eric Holder and Andrew Yang.
Dear Tennessee Democrat,
IT'S THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE 19TH AMENDMENT!
Tennessee cast the final and deciding vote to ratify the 19th amendment and in celebration The Tennessee Democratic Party will host delegations and attendees from more than 30 states for RATIFIED! A 19TH AMENDMENT CELEBRATION. During this unprecendented convention year, you can join these exclusive events. You'll hear from women leaders like Atlanta mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, activist Lily Ledbetter, TN State Senator Raumesh Akbari, and performers Jason Isbell. Details are below and we hope you will join us for this historic event.  All proceeds go towards efforts to elect more women and progressives this election cycle.
Today, during our delegation breakfast, we heard from Democratic leaders local and national speaking in one voice. They included working-class advocates like Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown, champions for rural America like North Dakota Senator Heidi Heitkamp, and trailblazers like Carol Moseley Braun—the first Black female Senator in U.S. history. Like Shirley Chisholm before her, Carol Moseley Braun beat a path for our first Black woman Vice President: Kamala Harris.
Building on the success of today's event, Democrats from across the state and country will join the Tennessee delegation at virtual events throughout the week. Join us for breakfast every day, celebrate the 19th amendment with us tonight, and hear from national leaders like AG Eric Holder and Andrew Yang.

# A JUNETEENTH MESSAGE FROM ANDREA BOND JOHNSON,
DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE FOR STATE HOUSE DISTRICT 82
Dear friend,
As a little girl, I remember my mother getting dressed up every year and going to a Juneteenth celebration. She talked about it with excitement and told me it was a special holiday for black people. She would come back and tell me about the fun they had, the good food, the music, the fellowship, the speeches and the poetry. I didn’t really understand back then the true meaning, but I knew from her excitement that it was a special and significant event.
As I grew older, I began to understand the true significance of Juneteenth, and I would ask questions like, “why did the people hear about Freedom so late?”, and “did they get mad because they found out so late?” My parents would do their best to answer my questions. They always said “Thank God for Juneteenth”.
As an adult, I have attended countless Juneteenth celebrations with friends and family. Those celebrations still include fun, food, music, fellowship and speeches. Steeped in African-American culture, Juneteenth is probably the oldest holiday much like Independence Day. History tells us that the Emancipation Proclamation under President Abraham Lincoln was declared on January 1, 1863. On June 19,1865 the Union soldiers came to Galveston, Texas to let African-Americans know that the war was over and they were free from slavery. It took 2 ½ years before they got the word of their freedom. I can only imagine what that day must have felt like…full of joy and jubilation!
Over the years, the popularity of Juneteenth has increased and many organizations and businesses are acknowledging this special day in American history. It makes me happy to think about the excitement it has generated in my family down through the years. And I hope we can continue the traditional gathering even if it is virtually, to reflect, renew and re-ignite towards action.
We can all learn from the past and aspire to do better in the future, honoring the message of the Emancipation Proclamation and the spirit of Juneteenth.
Aspiring for a better future with you,
Andrea Bond Johnson
Democratic Candidate Tennessee House District 82

Bob Tuke,bob@tndp.org,purple heart recipients deserve better,"Friend,
As a retired Marine and Vietnam combat veteran, I am personally offended by Marsha Blackburn’s behavior. She is nothing but a Trump lap dog, and I will not stand for people like her attacking a combat veteran with a purple heart.
Lt. Col. Vindman had a duty and he exercised his own best judgement. Implying that someone awarded a purple heart after being wounded in a war fighting for America is anything less than patriotic is completely inappropriate. Her lack of respect for the American people was on full display as she tweeted mindlessly during the impeachment hearings. She is an embarrassment to Tennessee.
We as Democrats need to band together and show that we respect members of the armed forces and their families. That’s why the Tennessee Democratic Party is raising money to honor their Veterans and Military Families Caucus and pay for more yard signs. And that’s why I’m asking you to help. They’ve already raised $2,380 of their $3,000 goal and I’d like to see them meet it tonight. Please consider making a donation right now – this is important.
Semper Fidelis,
Bob Tuke

Team Tennessee,teamtn@tndp.org,deadline approaching,"### Friend,
Did you get a chance to look at Mary’s email about supporting the TNDP? We have just a few hours left to meet our quarterly fundraising goal and need your help.
We think we can still raise the $473 we need before midnight, but only with your support. Can we count on you to make a donation before time runs out?
Thank you so much!

Evan Latt,evan@tndp.org,tomorrow night,"Friend,
We’re so thankful for all the online donations we've received this month! We only have to raise another $2,890 to meet April’s fundraising goal but the clock runs out tomorrow night at midnight.
Can you help us make it to the finish line today?
Our monthly fundraising goals are in place to make sure that we have the resources we need to support Tennessee Democrats. Whether paying for printer ink and stamps, or volunteer training and organizing, these funds are being put to use where it counts the most.
Please consider making a donation right now and help us finish April with a bang!
Thank you,
