Chairman's Update
June 11, 2020
This is a new weekly update from Pennsylvania Republican Party Chairman Lawrence Tabas filling you in on what our statewide party leaders are up to, along with relevant news pertaining to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
Good morning, Pennsylvania.
With everything happening around our country, it is more important than ever that we unite and uplift one another across this great Commonwealth. Unfortunately, Governor Tom Wolf has done the opposite and has defied his own ‚Äústay at home‚Äù order to stand shoulder to shoulder with people holding ‚ÄúBLUE LIVES MURDER‚Äù signs.
This is a level of hypocrisy I cannot wrap my head around.
As Gov. Wolf contradicts his own policies, our Republican leaders continue to let their actions speak for themselves. This is why we developed a weekly update. To show that while our statewide Democratic leadership continues to fail us, our Republican leaders are standing up for Pennsylvanians of all walks of life. Contribute now to help us gear up and get more Republicans elected this fall.
Sincerely,
Lawrence J. Tabas
Chairman, Pennsylvania Republican Party

#### Thank you, Speaker Turzai!
ICYMI, Speaker Mike Turzai announced he will retire from the PA House of Representatives after nearly 20 years of public service. We are saddened to see him go and grateful for his years of leadership within the Pennsylvania Legislature.
At the PAGOP, we released a statement Wednesday thanking Speaker Turzai for his service. Here is a brief overview:
‚ÄúI would like to thank my friend Speaker Turzai for his many years of dutiful service to the 28th House District and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,‚Äù said Lawrence Tabas, Chairman of the Republican Party of Pennsylvania.
""His five plus years as Speaker have been some of the most productive the Pennsylvania Legislature has seen.
""The entire Commonwealth owes him a debt of gratitude for his tireless work to reopen Pennsylvania. But what I will remember most about his work, is his dedication to his colleagues.
""Speaker Turzai's impact on the Republican Party and the PA House of Representatives will be felt for years to come in young members he has mentored and helped win elections.‚Äù

# Attorney General Shapiro refuses to take a stand
Our Republican-endorsed candidate for attorney general, Heather Heidelbaugh, called on sitting Attorney General Josh Shapiro to take an affirmative stand on law enforcement. Heidelbaugh cited Shapiro‚Äôs concerning silence as his Democratic Party moves closer and closer to the mainstream idea of abolishing police forces. It is Shapiro‚Äôs duty to work hand in hand with the law and support our police officers. Will he side with his Democratic Party or will step up and take his job seriously?
‚ÄúI believe an effective and fair police force is crucial for our safety and liberty. As Attorney General, I would oppose these radical, left-wing efforts and work with all communities to ensure that our streets are safe,‚Äù said Heidelbaugh.
All lives matter; regardless of race, ethnicity, income OR occupation.

#### U.S. Senator Toomey takes on Chinese Communist Party
Senator Toomey visited Erie and Washington County Friday with Rep. Guy Reschenthaler and Rep. Mike Kelly, along with State Senator Dan Laughlin, to talk with local business owners about how they were affected by the statewide shutdown.
U.S. Senator Toomey has been a staunch defender of Hong Kong‚Äôs freedom, by recently co-sponsoring the bipartisan Hong Kong Autonomy Act. This act pushes against Communist China‚Äôs aggression
On the 31st anniversary of the Tiananmen Square protests, Sen. Toomey called on Congress to hold Communist China accountable for its interference with Hong Kong‚Äôs independence. This comes after Sen. Toomey introduced the Hong Kong Autonomy Act, which is bipartisan legislation designed to push back on Communist China‚Äôs aggression.

Senate President Pro Tempore Joe Scarnati issued a joint statement with Speaker of the House Mike Turzai, Senate Majority Leader Jake Corman and House Majority Leader Bryan Cutler regarding Governor Wolf‚Äôs decision to extend ballot deadlines.
‚ÄúFree and fair elections mean that one person cannot change the rules at the 11th hour. Pure and simple.
‚ÄúThe General Assembly was not consulted or advised of this order. ‚ÄòWorking together‚Äô has to be more than a talking point.
‚ÄúThe founding fathers established a system with checks and balances. Even in an emergency, the General Assembly has an obligation to protect our citizens while defending our democracy.
‚ÄúWe are working with our counsel to determine what steps are available to ensure the people‚Äôs trust in the election process is solidified.‚Äù

Chairman's Update
October 23, 2020
This is a weekly update from Pennsylvania Republican Party Chairman Lawrence Tabas filling you in on what our statewide party leaders are up to, along with relevant news pertaining to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
Good afternoon, Pennsylvania.
The Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that ballots can be accepted up to three days after Election Day. The Republican Party opposed this at every turn but lost in a 4-4 ruling. This only highlights the importance of having a full Supreme Court this November. Democrats understand the importance of Pennsylvania in this race, so they are championing the new election rules. The Pennsylvania Republican Party will not give up on ensuring our elections are fair and trusted.
Republican state leaders summarized this moment: ‚ÄúThe new rules imposed by the decision of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania (a body elected in partisan elections) could destroy the American public‚Äôs confidence in the electoral system as a whole.‚Äù PA voters need to come out and vote to assure fraud does not win, but your choice does.

#### Governor Wolf is killing the restaurant industry üëé
Governor Wolf‚Äôs restrictions are killing the restaurant and bar industry. Restaurant owners urged the PA Legislature to override Gov. Wolf‚Äôs veto of House Bill 2513. This bill would have set the minimum restaurant capacity to 50%. It would also allow people to sit at bars and eliminate the requirement to purchase a meal to have an alcoholic beverage. Unfortunately, they did have enough votes to override Gov. Wolf. This is why PA voters must vote red up and down the ballot, so we can stop Gov. Wolf from destroying our economy.
Hospitality is the state‚Äôs second-largest industry and Gov. Wolf is choosing to play politics with peoples‚Äô livelihoods. Restaurant business owner Matt Flinchbaugh pleaded, ‚ÄúOur businesses, the lifeblood of our local communities, struggle to make it after the governor imposed new restrictions on our operations.‚Äù Ironically enough, Gov. Wolf visited Pittsburgh Thursday as a supposed effort to ‚Äúsupport the restaurant and bar industry.‚Äù Give me a break. It is clear he does not support the restaurant and bar industry, or else he would have supported House Bill 2513.

#### Senator Toomey praises the EPA üôå
Senator Toomey wrote an op-ed on the great balance of the Environmental Protection Agency's actions. The EPA has worked toward a cleaner environment without hurting American and Pennsylvanian jobs. He gives the example of the EPA‚Äôs Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI). In 2013, Erie's Presque Isle Bay was wrongly removed from the ‚ÄúAreas of Concern‚Äù list. Under the Trump Administration, it has gained the attention necessary to combat the Bay's contamination growth.
Meanwhile, the radical left promotes the Green New Deal and other crushing regulations on American workers. Most importantly, a Biden-Harris administration could lead to a ban on fracking, which would crush PA‚Äôs economy. Our country needs four more years of commonsense policies to keep our environment clean and our jobs secure.

#### GOP candidates sue for fair elections üëä
Congressional GOP candidates Sean Parnell (PA-17) and Luke Negron (PA-18) filed a lawsuit seeking to allow poll watchers at the satellite election offices in Allegheny County. Just as on Election Day, these candidates believe that poll watchers should be at the satellite election offices. Their attorneys cited that Allegheny County had to reissue corrected ballots to voters after nearly 30,000 received incorrect ballots. Parnell noted, ‚ÄúAt its core, our lawsuit is about ensuring that the rights of ALL voters are protected heading into this crucially important election.‚Äù
We need accountability to make sure ballots are not stuffed or other illegal activities at these satellite sites for both parties. This is where people vote, thus poll watchers should be present. This should not be a partisan issue, yet the Democrats are against poll watchers being at these sites.
Our elections must be fair and these candidates will try to ensure that every vote counts.

Chairman's Update
September 4, 2020
This is a weekly update from Pennsylvania Republican Party Chairman Lawrence Tabas filling you in on what our statewide party leaders are up to, along with relevant news pertaining to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
Good afternoon, Pennsylvania.
It‚Äôs been a busy week here in Pennsylvania with visits from President Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. Friends, it‚Äôs pretty clear the great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is key to this 2020 election and we are ready for four more years of President Trump!
President Trump and Vice President Pence called upon each one of us to help win the fight against the radical socialist agenda of a Biden-Harris administration. PA stands with our men and women in blue and we stand for the American flag. These are not radical ideas, they are American ideas. Join us in this critical fight friends, the country needs Pennsylvania to go red this November.

#### Gov. Wolf won‚Äôt let go of the power üëä
Governor Wolf extended Pennsylvania‚Äôs Disaster Emergency Declaration that was set to expire September 1st. Gov. Wolf has another 90 days to enjoy the extra executive powers. House Republicans already attempted to end this power grab, but lost in the courts. Unfortunately, this can mean more restrictions on businesses and schools.
House GOP spokesman Jason Gottesman sharply criticized the governor, ‚ÄúGovernor Wolf has ignored the law and acted by fiat for the last six months. It is curious now that he is searching for the limits of his authority as an excuse to pass the buck to the General Assembly over the crisis he created for both property owners and renters.‚Äù
Gov. Wolf refuses to release crippling restrictions harming thousands of Pennsylvanians. Instead of staying in his executive lane, he wants to be the legislator too. Republicans will continue to fight against Gov. Wolf‚Äôs power grabs.
‚Üí Read more: Gov. Wolf the new legislator? (PennLive)
#### PA State Republicans fight against Democratic schemes
The Legislature is back in session and the Pennsylvania Republican officials have their hands full fighting Democrats‚Äô schemes. Republicans attempted to override Governor Wolf‚Äôs veto on ending his disaster emergency declaration, but it wasn‚Äôt enough. PA House Majority Leader Kerry Benninghoff did not mince his words, ‚Äú[Gov. Wolf is] behaving like he‚Äôs been given a blank check of authority, the governor and his administration have continued to act alone, issuing confusing and inconsistent orders, guidance, recommendations and/or mandates, depending on what term you want to use that day.‚Äù The GOP is not done with exposing Wolf and his cohorts‚Äô schemes that continue to hurt Pennsylvanians through excessive restrictions.
Rep. Benninghoff finds himself in yet another battle over PA‚Äôs election process for the 2020 elections. Republicans passed a bill Wednesday despite Democrat opposition, however, Gov. Wolf said he will not sign it. In sum, it outlaws the use of ballot drop boxes and it moves the deadline to apply for a mail-in-ballot to 15 days before the election. Rep. Benninghoff assures Pennsylvanians, ‚ÄúWhat this bill does is it provides access while ensuring the integrity and privacy of the voting process.‚Äù The bill is off to the state senate and will surely face more scrutiny from Democrats and the governor.

#### VP Pence ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Trump Country Now‚Äù
Joe Biden also made an appearance attempting to change his party‚Äôs narrative on fracking and claim to be a moderate. Joe thinks he can lie to Pennsylvanians but we know the radical left pulls his strings. Biden did a great job reminding Pennsylvanians of the failed leadership from Democratic mayors and governors during Covid-19 and the destructive riots.
President Trump fires up the Latrobe crowd, reiterating just how important this 2020 election is for our state and country. He vowed his administration will bring back the economy hit by Covid-19. For Pennsylvania, President Trump reminded us, ‚ÄúJoe Biden spent the last 47 years shipping Pennsylvania jobs to China and foreign nations, and I‚Äôve spent the last four years bringing them back home. I ended the last administration‚Äôs eight year pure war on Pennsylvania oil and coal and fracking.‚Äù Joe Biden is a disaster for Pennsylvania.
VP Pence spoke at the ‚ÄúWorkers for Trump‚Äù with an upbeat and positive attitude about Pennsylvania jobs, unlike Joe. VP Pence teased, ‚ÄúI know we're not too far from our opponent's boyhood home but it's Trump country now,"" Pence said. ""I'm here for one reason and one reason only, because Pennsylvania and America need four more years of President Donald Trump."" Let‚Äôs show him PA is truly Trump country this November!

In little time, the RNC worked to modify the convention in accordance with Covid-19 health and safety standards. The hard work and determination behind this year‚Äôs convention exemplifies the energy the Republican Party is bringing into November. I am beyond proud to be a part of this organization.

#### Someone Tell Mayor Peduto That the Left Can Never be Pleased üôÑ
We love when left-wing radical intolerance comes full circle. Pittsburgh‚Äôs ultra-liberal mayor, Bill Peduto, is finally getting a taste of his own medicine.
Mayor Peduto has always been incessantly anti-police. From calling on major budget cuts to the Pittsburgh police -- to having zero support for our Pennsylvania State Troopers -- our men and women in blue know they can‚Äôt trust Mayor Peduto to support them.
Now, Bill Peduto‚Äôs trusted left-wing base is attacking him for not completely defunding the police after a protester's arrest was made in Oakland last Saturday. Radical leftists showed up to Mayor Peduto‚Äôs house calling for his resignation. Guess who Bill Peduto called to disperse these ‚Äúpeaceful‚Äù protesters from his house? That‚Äôs right, the police. Mayor Peduto, we have a message for you: The intolerant left can NEVER be pleased!

‚ÄúI'm honored to receive the HSUS Pennsylvania Legislator of the Year award,‚Äù said Sen. Toomey. ‚ÄúThe Humane Society of the United States is a great partner and played an integral role in the multi-year fight to get the landmark PACT Act across the goal line.‚Äù

#### Gov. Wolf‚Äôs ‚ÄúStrong Recommendation‚Äù Doesn‚Äôt Cut It with PA Republicans ‚ùå
Governor Wolf ‚Äústrongly recommended‚Äù that the PIAA cancel school sports this fall. This recommendation was supposedly based off the idea of social distancing, even though Gov. Wolf failed to provide any data to back up this recommendation. The PIAA decided as of Friday to continue on with fall sports, despite Gov. Wolf‚Äôs recommendation -- as they should.
The PIAA was unsure if they would face any legal ramifications if they ignored Gov. Wolf‚Äôs cavalier ‚Äúrecommendation,‚Äù so Pennsylvania House Republicans decided to look into it.
Rep. Seth Grove (R-Dover) filed a Right to Know Law request with the Pennsylvania Department of Health (DOH) to see what legal bearing Gov. Wolf‚Äôs ‚Äústrong recommendation‚Äù actually has. The DOH responded to this request confirming just what PA House Republicans suspected -- Gov. Wolf has no supporting data to justify his recommendation.

Friend,
Did you see the footage that came out of Nancy Pelosi leaving a salon after getting her hair done, despite the salon being shut down due to city orders?
And she isn‚Äôt even wearing a mask!
The salon owner criticized Pelosi -- and rightfully so. She described Pelosi‚Äôs privilege as a ‚Äòslap in the face,‚Äô as the owner has been out of work for months while still trying to support her two young children without pay.
The owner told Fox News that government regulations have had her salon forced closed for months and she has been doing everything she can just to stay afloat.
This is a new low for the hypocrisy of Democrats. Of course, we should come to expect this by now. But Nancy Pelosi has been in office for decades and when questioned about this obviously hypocritical instance, she claimed she didn‚Äôt know she did anything wrong.
STOP PELOSI‚ÄôS PRIVILEGE
This is how Nancy Pelosi and her puppets in Congress work. Rules don‚Äôt apply to them. They preach for a socialist nation. They only want this because they know they can rise above it. As George Orwell wrote in Animal Farm, all animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.
We, the people of Pennsylvania, must hold Nancy Pelosi accountable by diminishing her squad. We need true conservative candidates like Sean Parnell, Lisa Scheller and Luke Negron in office.
STOP THE HYPOCRISY OF THE LEFT
We cannot let this hypocrisy continue.
It starts with sending Nancy Pelosi a message from the great state of Pennsylvania. Are you with me?
YES! Hold Pelosi and her puppets accountable.
Sincerely,
Vonne Andring

Friend,
I am saddened to even have to report this to you.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi went on MSNBC Monday stating that the Trump administration, and those who support it, are domestic enemies.
Trump supporters are domestic enemies, according to Nancy Pelosi.
Steve Scalise @SteveScalise üö® Disgusting: Nancy Pelosi just called Republicans ""domestic enemies.‚Äù I was shot because of this kind of unhinged rhetoric. Where‚Äôs the media outrage?
So you and I are domestic enemies, according to Nancy Pelosi. We are domestic enemies because we stick up for our individual liberties and constitutional rights.
This is the kind of intolerant behavior that breeds the cancel culture ruining our society and destroying our way of life.
We must stand up to the left before they gain any more power or control. The alternative is frightening.
Please help us today to support difference of opinion, open conversation and a free society.
Right, Left, Red, Blue. We all have the right to voice our opinions and live by the morals we see as right and true.
Join us today to stand up to this gross intolerance.
Pro-life, pro-Trump and pro-democracy are not criminal opinions and this is not a censored socialist country -- yet.
Donate today to ensure it stays that way.

Dear Friend,
Big Tech is at it again.
This time, they weren‚Äôt so sneaky about their blinding bias toward censoring conservative voices online.
Twitter and Facebook censor New York Post: Smoking-gun email reveals how Hunter Biden introduced Ukrainian businessman to VP dad
DONATE NOW TO STOP CENSORSHIP OF CONSERVATIVES
In case you missed it, the New York Post released a story that broke down potentially incriminating emails between Hunter Biden and his corrupt Ukrainian conspirators.
I could go on about the deep-rooted issues with the story itself and the fact that Russian oligarchs certainly didn‚Äôt pay Hunter Biden for his ‚Äúconsulting services.‚Äù
Let‚Äôs make one thing clear: Corrupt Ukrainian ‚Äúbusinessmen‚Äù paid Hunter Biden millions of dollars because they wanted to pull his father, then-Vice President Joe Biden‚Äôs strings.
Also, let‚Äôs not forget when Joe Biden bragged about threatening to withhold U.S. aid from Ukraine if they didn‚Äôt fire the prosecutor who was investigating his son.
Friend, this is the exact definition of bribery -- not to mention the fact that it is on the dime of the U.S. taxpayer.
Yet, of course, you don‚Äôt see mainstream media covering this.
In fact, this development‚Äôs shock factor isn‚Äôt about Hunter Biden‚Äôs expos√© or that Joe Biden threatened Ukraine with U.S. taxpayer-funded dollars.
No, the real shock is the deliberate manipulation by Big Tech. Twitter and Facebook censored high-profile users who shared the breaking story released by the New York Post.
That‚Äôs right. Big Tech didn‚Äôt even bother to fact check the story before taking down posts related to the Hunter Biden scoop.
This blatant censorship and bias by social media companies like Facebook and Twitter must stop. I am sick of Big Tech constantly repressing conservative voices online.
If you are like me and cannot believe the blatant censorship of conservatives by Big Tech, please show your commitment to keeping Pennsylvania RED this November and chip in whatever you can right now.
Big Tech silencing our voices will only get worse.
Thank you for your constant support.
Best,
Vonne Andring

Chairman's Update
July 24, 2020
This is a new weekly update from Pennsylvania Republican Party Chairman Lawrence Tabas filling you in on what our statewide party leaders are up to, along with relevant news pertaining to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
Good morning, Pennsylvania.
I spoke with the Pennsylvania Senate Thursday about the ethical concerns of mail-in drop boxes. These boxes are not a valid means of submitting voter ballots. Mail-in drop boxes in fact threaten our constitutional rights and raise serious security concerns.
‚Üí Watch here: State Senate Governmental Committee discusses 2020 election issues (PAGOP)
Our current legislation simply does not permit drop boxes as a valid channel to submit a ballot. Rightfully so, since these drop boxes have no security to keep someone from tampering with ballots. 2020 is an essential election year. The voices of all Pennsylvanians must be heard. Join me in ensuring a credible election.

Sincerely,
Lawrence J. Tabas

#### Heidelbaugh puts the pressure on DA Krasner and AG Shapiro üî•
Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner has a history of being weak on crime and Attorney General Josh Shapiro lets him get away with it. Crime is up nearly 70% in Philadelphia. Why? Well it could be due to the fact that these criminals know they won‚Äôt be prosecuted, so why not continue to get away with more crimes? DA Krasner doesn‚Äôt prosecute illegal gun crimes.
Heather Heidelbaugh, Republican candidate for Pennsylvania attorney general, is calling on AG Shapiro to hold Larry Krasner accountable. It is a sad day when criminals who rob, harm or threaten others with illegally obtained weapons are able to walk off free of charge. Our Commonwealth deserves better.

#### Governor Wolf strikes out ‚ùå
Sen. Toomey has been vocal about working with the MLB and health officials to safely bring back baseball to Pittsburgh. There was support among all parties involved to bring the Toronto Blue Jays to play at PNC Park. The world was waiting on the green light from Governor Wolf.
Of course where there is common sense discussion between the public and private sector, Democrats are bound to come in and slow down progress. Gov. Wolf and Dr. Levine announced Wednesday the Blue Jays would not be permitted to play at PNC Park. Sen. Toomey ‚Äî who held a roundtable discussion with MLB and health officials earlier this week ‚Äî expressed disapproval of the decision made by Gov. Wolf. Sen. Toomey pointed out that Gov. Wolf deprived Pittsburgh of a great economic opportunity with his decision.
‚Üí Read more: Pa. won‚Äôt allow Blue Jays to play at Pittsburgh‚Äôs PNC Park (AP)
#### PA House power checks Gov. Wolf ‚öñÔ∏è
The Pennsylvania House voted July 14 to restore power to the people, rather than Gov. Wolf. Senate Bill 1166 prohibits Gov. Wolf‚Äôs emergency declaration from lasting longer than 21 days. Once the 21 days are up, the PA General Assembly can vote on whether the emergency declaration should continue or not.
Currently, Gov. Wolf‚Äôs emergency declarations can last up to 90 days. For three whole months, Gov. Wolf is able to have a hold over our Commonwealth.
‚ÄúWe believe the power of our Commonwealth truly rests with the people. Pennsylvania is not a dictatorship, and the voters should ultimately decide. We are a co-equal branch of government and have tried at every turn to work with the administration, including asking to join a multi-branch, bipartisan task force to manage this crisis. The governor turned us down, deciding instead to go it alone for months on end.‚Äù ‚Äî Speaker of the House Bryan Cutler

Friend,
This month we have seen violence attempt to cripple our nation.
Rioting and violence of ANTIFA radicals have left our nation divided. And unfortunately, our men and women in blue are bearing the attacks first hand.
STOP ANTIFA
Cities like Seattle and Portland are in flames and the rage against our law enforcement is getting worse.
We cannot let this violence come to Pennsylvania. We must protect the strong, hard working conservative principles that make our Commonwealth so great.
>> Protect our Commonwealth now.
Unfortunately, liberal politicians like Nancy Pelosi and AOC threaten our individual rights more and more every day.
We must support strong, conservative principles in Pennsylvania. Our Commonwealth depends on it.
We need your help. Donate just $50 to keep Pennsylvania great.

September 30, 2020

Friend,
‚ÄúI am the Democratic Party.‚Äù \- Joe Biden
Joe Biden said this to kick-off last night's debate.
So Joe Biden admitted he is the party of socialism, mob rule and excessive spending?
Joe Biden is a puppet for the radicals running the Democratic Party. When Biden says he won't enforce the Green New Deal, stripping people of their private insurances and defunding the police, make no mistake -- the Democratic Party won‚Äôt leave him a choice.
The radical left will leave Joe Biden behind without a second thought and have Kamala Harris run our nation if given the chance.
We cannot let this happen. We need your help to keep Biden-Harris far away from the White House.
Contribute just $50 right now to meet our end of the quarter fundraising goal of $50,000. We are only $9,150 away.
>> PLEDGE $50 >>
Joe Biden wants to win over the votes of hard-working blue-collar Americans who went RED in 2016 for President Trump. Biden wants to win these voters by promising them falsehoods, only to end up bending to the will of the radical left.
Below, I have written out 12 things Joe Biden did last night that do NOT align with the working class. I hope this will better equip you, friend, to share with anyone who may be considering a vote for the radical left.
‚ùå Refused to say whether he would pack our Supreme Court or not ‚ùå Admitted the Green New Deal ‚Äúis not his plan,‚Äù yet will most likely support it behind closed doors
‚ùå Did not call out a SINGLE Democratic leader to stop violence in their cities ‚ùå Claimed to support manufacturing jobs but wants to ban fracking
‚ùå Refused to support law and order ‚ùå Called Antifa an ‚Äúidea‚Äù and not an organization
‚ùå Called anyone who qualified for Medicaid poor ‚ùå Refused to answer why Ukraine paid his son Hunter millions of dollars
‚ùå Was unable to answer if he had support from law enforcement groups ‚ùå Claimed President Trump doesn‚Äôt understand the suburbs, despite Trump having great success there
‚ùå Refused to support law and order ‚ùå Incorrect coronavirus statistics
These are just 12 of the endless reasons we CANNOT let Pennsylvania vote blue this November.
Please help us reach our end of the quarter goal before our 11:59 p.m. deadline.
The fate of our future cannot wait.

#### Bye-bye, Governor Wolf üëã
It is no secret Governor Wolf is not the best at his job‚Ä¶to say the least.
Republican lawmakers are fed up with his lack of leadership and complete mishandling of the coronavirus pandemic. This is why they called for his impeachment.
House Resolution 915, introduced by Rep. Daryl Metcalfe, calls for Gov. Wolf to step down amid his disastrous mishandling and abuse of executive order surrounding the coronavirus.
In last week‚Äôs newsletter, we mentioned how the General Assembly and Republican leadership issued a joint statement raising concerns over Gov. Wolf‚Äôs executive order. Gov. Wolf refused to lift this emergency declaration, even while he stood shoulder to shoulder with protestors holding ‚ÄúBLUE LIVES MURDER‚Äù signs. At this point, ‚Äúnonessential businesses‚Äù were still forced closed under Gov. Wolf‚Äôs executive order.
Gov. Wolf‚Äôs team has stated this impeachment resolution is unwarranted and that the Governor‚Äôs handling of the coronavirus was successful. We clearly must have different definitions of success.

#### U.S. Senator Toomey stands up for our health care workers
On June 11th, Senator Toomey announced that eight Pennsylvania health care providers received a total of $1,275,738 from the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) COVID-19 Telehealth Program, which was established by the CARES Act.
The Provider Relief Fund was first authorized at $100 billion by the CARES Act to support COVID-19 expenses and lost revenue for hospitals and health care providers. In the recently passed ""phase 3.5"" coronavirus relief bill, Congress authorized an additional $75 billion, bringing the fund's total to $175 billion. To date, more than $39 billion has been disbursed from the Provider Relief Fund to providers and hospitals across the country. Thanks to Sen. Toomey, Pennsylvania hospitals and health care providers have received an additional $458,646,110 of the second $20 billion disbursement of the Provider Relief Fund.

#### Senate leaders battled with Governor Wolf against emergency declaration
Senate President Pro Tempore Joe Scarnati and Senate Majority Leader Jake Corman were applauded by the Commonwealth Court‚Äôs decision to expedite consideration of the emergency case filed to force Gov. Wolf to comply with House Resolution 836, which was passed by the General Assembly with bipartisan support. The court issued an order this morning mandating a response from the administration on this matter by June 18.
In the court filing from earlier this week, the leaders explained that despite a majority of the Senate and the House of Representatives adopting HR 836, Gov. Wolf has refused to perform the mandatory and ministerial duty of issuing an executive order or proclamation ending the state of disaster emergency originally declared March 6, 2020 and amended and renewed on June 3, 2020.
‚ÄúWe are pleased that the Court has recognized the urgency of this matter and will be expediting review of the case. Protecting civil liberties is a crucial issue that impacts the lives of every Pennsylvanian. Our Constitution established three equal branches of government to provide checks and balance.‚Äù

# Speaker Turzai isn't done yet
Speaker Mike Turzai‚Äôs reform bill that addresses criminal justice reform and policing within our communities was unanimously passed by the Judiciary Committee. House Bill 1841, House Bill 1910 and Senate Bill 637 are reforms to help our police better perform their very challenging and difficult responsibilities. We are working toward the passage of legislation that improves our law enforcement policing to instill an environment of healing, understanding and trust.
Speaker Turzai said that while his position has ended, there is still a job to do.
‚ÄúI believe this will strengthen our confidence that this body will continue its promise of a better Pennsylvania for all citizens. I am sure the House will continue efforts to promote education choice, economic opportunity for all, and additional criminal justice reforms.
‚ÄúThe lives of every citizen matter, including the lives of those citizens of color. These reforms are important to all citizens, but especially to our citizens of black or brown color who feel threatened by a system that can disregard their humanity.‚Äù

Chairman's Update
September 25, 2020
This is a weekly update from Pennsylvania Republican Party Chairman Lawrence Tabas filling you in on what our statewide party leaders are up to, along with relevant news pertaining to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
Good morning, Pennsylvania.
Pennsylvania had a busy week as Republican leaders, including President Trump, visited to get out the vote! I had the privilege to do my part by speaking at PACPAC over the weekend. Pennsylvania is the state that can win the presidency! It was awesome seeing a crowd that is excited to get to the polls and vote RED up and down the ballot. The enthusiasm is unprecedented for the Republican Party, which is mirrored in voter registration.
We worked strategically after 2016 to target voters to switch over to the Republican Party. There have been 52,440 more newly registered Republicans than Democrats this year! Regardless of what Democrats tell you, the Republican Party is appealing to Pennsylvanians across the Commonwealth!

#### Another veto by King Wolf üõë
It seems like Governor Wolf does not want anyone but himself to decide what is best for Pennsylvanians. Gov. Wolf vetoed a bipartisan bill that would have given local officials authority this year to decide whether to hold K-12 sports and activities or not, and set crowd limits at events. Apparently Gov. Wolf and his sidekicks are the experts, and the little guys must trust the so-called ""experts."" He notes the bill threatened his executive power, thus exposing the real reason for the veto.
GOP lawmakers will attempt to override Gov. Wolf‚Äôs veto. Rep. Mike Reese blasted Gov. Wolf by defending local officials saying they ‚Äúknow their facilities and have no less commitment to public safety than Governor Wolf.‚Äù Leader Kerry Benninghoff also called out Gov. Wolf, ‚ÄúIn vetoing this bill, Governor Wolf stands directly opposed to children and families looking for some semblance of normalcy and to receive the numerous invaluable benefits of fully participating in school sports‚Ä¶‚Äù The fight is not over as Republicans attempt to find Democratic allies to override Wolf‚Äôs veto.
We must remember the actions of this governor this November and vote red up and down the ticket!

#### PA Republican candidates against socialism ‚ùå
CPAC has hit the road making stops at key swing states, including Pennsylvania. PA conservative candidates and representatives spoke on a variety of topics. The theme of day was America against socialism and our Republican candidates vehemently spoke against socialism!
Republican candidate Heather Heidelbaugh reminded voters about the importance of her race against Gov. Wolf‚Äôs partner in crime, Attorney General Josh Shapiro. Shapiro has defended Wolf's closure of PA in the court since day one. Meanwhile, Democrat Congressman Conor Lamb continues to vote with Nancy Pelosi and her squad. Sean Parnell, Republican congressional candidate for PA-17, vows to keep his word and defend your constitutional rights.
Let‚Äôs defend American and Pennsylvania values by ensuring our great Commonwealth goes red!

#### Trump comes to Pittsburgh üö®
There weren‚Äôt many Terrible Towels flying around but there sure were a lot of MAGA hats! President Trump spoke to an energetic, large crowd on Tuesday night. He highlighted the exponential job creation under his administration, vowing to keep fracking and other energy jobs -- unlike Joe. President Trump said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll keep your jobs in Pennsylvania where they belong, and you‚Äôre going to be doing fracking for a long time.‚Äù He assured Pennsylvanians he will continue to bring back jobs from China. The crowd cheered, ‚ÄúWe love you!‚Äù Pittsburgh truly brought the love on Tuesday, and will continue all the way to Nov. 3!
Let me tell you another tidbit from Tuesday‚Äôs rally -- and this is the difference between the right and the left. Since Pittsburgh Police officers have received zero support from ultra-leftist Mayor Bill Peduto, a nonprofit organization composed of police officers from twenty-two surrounding municipalities stepped in to offer security at President Trump‚Äôs rally. These police officers were met with cheering and applause as they made their way to the tarmac to await President Trump. This is the thanks our men and women in blue deserve.

While Democrats in DC are busy with their sham impeachment, the Pennsylvania Republican party has just endorsed the most qualified statewide row office candidates in history. We‚Äôre energized and ready to go head to head against the liberal policies of the Democrats!
Meet our Team that will take back our row offices this November!
Attorney General - Heather Heidelbaugh: is an attorney with more than thirty five years experience in the courtroom. She‚Äôs tough, smart and she‚Äôll keep our families safe and protected. We need a full-time lawyer as attorney general, not a temp waiting for his turn to run for governor.
Auditor General - Tim DeFoor: has been nationally recognized for his efforts to save taxpayer dollars as Dauphin County Comptroller. Tim will work hard and keep an eye on Pennsylvania‚Äôs checkbook and work against the frivolous spending of the Wolf administration.
Stacy Garrity - Treasurer: served three combat tours in Iraq. She‚Äôs a retired Army Colonel who is accustomed to breaking glass ceilings. As Treasurer, Stacy will stop Governor Wolf‚Äôs blank check writing and return the staggering $3.5 billion dollars in unclaimed property taxes to the taxpayers.
Heather, Tim, and Stacy NEED your help TODAY! Can you support our 2020 Team with a donation of $20.20, double it for $40.40, $200.20 or even $2020.00?
Every dollar that is contributed will go directly into our grassroots efforts...hitting every door and every voter we can. Momentum is on our side, because of people like you. Click here to pitch in your support TODAY so we can get our great slate across the finish line.
With gratitude,
Chairman Lawrence Tabas
Republican Party of Pennsylvania

"Lawrence Tabas, PAGOP Chairman",info@pagop.org,Were You Inspired by President Trump Tonight?,"Dear Friend--
Were you inspired by President Trump? I know I was! It takes courage to stand in front of a room of people who hate you and have attempted to smear your legacy. That‚Äôs the kind of courage our President possesses.
In stark contrast to the Fake News and Democrat Presidential candidates, President Trump spoke about his accomplishments:
* 7 Million Americans are off of food stamps
* Unemployment rate set a record low under the Trump administration here in PA
* New Trade Deal with China and the USMCA
* 162,000 jobs have been created in PA
Not only has our President delivered on his promises, he has a REAL plan to Keep America Great.
The sham of an impeachment process can‚Äôt hide President Trump‚Äôs record.
Your gift of $25, $50, $100, or even $250 will help us ensure we have THREE MORE State of the Unions from President Trump!
Just as important, our Congressional Delegation needs your help! Please help me, along with the Dean of our Congressional Delegation, Congressman GT Thompson, make this the LAST State of the Union for impeachment supporters Conor Lamb, Susan Wild, and Matt Cartwright!
If you liked what you heard (and how could you not?) please consider supporting the PAGOP to keep Pennsylvania RED!
Thank you for tuning in tonight and for your support this year.

Dear Friend,
We need your help to make sure Joe Biden does not win Pennsylvania.
Pennsylvania is a ‚Äòflip‚Äô state and what happens here matters.
Biden‚Äôs climate plan would strip our state of hundreds of jobs and threaten our economy.
In these challenging times we cannot afford such policies.
Can you help us send Biden packing?
>> Donate $10
>> Donate $25
>> Donate $50
>> Rush another amount
America continues to reduce emissions while creating jobs. We do not need a leader that will reverse all that -- especially in a state that relies so heavily on our natural gas industry.
Thank you for your support.
\- Team PAGOP
P.S. Even a small donation can help small businesses and families in Pennsylvania stay afloat.

Chairman's Update
September 18, 2020
This is a weekly update from Pennsylvania Republican Party Chairman Lawrence Tabas filling you in on what our statewide party leaders are up to, along with relevant news pertaining to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
Good afternoon, Pennsylvania.
November 3rd is coming up quickly and I‚Äôm breaking down what you need to know about the election process in Pennsylvania. During my interview with Commonwealth Partners President and CEO Matt Brouillette, I talk about the good and bad of mail-in ballots. We discussed everything from mail-in ballots to Republican enthusiasm in Pennsylvania on the Commonwealth Partners Chamber of Entrepreneurs‚Äô ‚ÄúBrews & Views‚Äù podcast.
Mail-in ballots pose a lot of challenges to the election process. Democrats want more than 50 days to mail in ballots -- which makes it seem like they have a political agenda. I also discuss how clear it is that Democratic policies are failing working class communities, which is why they‚Äôre becoming Republicans! All across Pennsylvania we see huge support from the working class for President Trump. The Republican Party is the party for the working class!

#### Governor Wolf got served üë®‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è
U.S. District Judge William S. Stickman IV struck down Governor Wolf‚Äôs coronavirus restrictions citing violations of the First and Fourteenth Amendment. Judge Stickman stated, ‚ÄúThe solution to a national crisis can never be permitted to supersede the commitment to individual liberty that stands as the foundation of the American experiment.‚Äù
This ruling is a WIN for business owners who have been crushed by Gov. Wolf‚Äôs extreme restrictions. Plaintiffs included hairdressers, farmers, Republican officials, along with other small business owners. However, the fight is not over because Gov. Wolf's administration immediately announced he will appeal the federal judge‚Äôs ruling.

#### More riots = more silence ü§ê
Rioters take the streets in Lancaster causing violence and destruction to the community. After a police officer shot and killed a man charging at him while wielding a knife, Democrats condemned the officer. Senator Pat Toomey defends the police officer stating:
""A full-grown man, wielding a large carving knife over his head while charging an officer, obviously poses a mortal threat to that officer. In general, police officers in this type of situation are well within their rights to use deadly force to protect themselves and the public‚Ä¶‚Äù
We cannot let rioters destroy our communities any longer. We must stand with the law enforcement community and offer our full support. To condemn an officer who is defending their life, along with the wellbeing of the Commonwealth, is plain ignorant. I would bet the majority of these Democratic leaders have no idea what it is like to go into work every day and put your life on the line.
As the riots continue, failed Democratic leadership is exposed. Republican candidate for Attorney General tweeted:
It‚Äôs clear Pennsylvania needs leadership that helps our law enforcement promote law and order in our streets.

#### Will Levine finally be held accountable? ü§î
The Department of Justice sent letters to Pennsylvania and three other states seeking data on whether they violated federal law by ordering public nursing homes to accept recovering COVID-19 patients from hospitals. Near the end of March, the governor issued an executive order that required nursing and personal care homes to accept coronavirus patients.
Under Health Secretary Rachel Levine‚Äôs guidance, nursing homes were even advised that there was no particular benefit in separating or isolating coronavirus patients from others. It took an entire month before they rescinded this advice. Close to 67% of Pennsylvania‚Äôs coronavirus deaths occurred in nursing homes, which didn‚Äôt stop Gov. Wolf shutting down the entire state. Now, hopefully some justice and transparency will finally be brought about.

Chairman's Update

This is a weekly update from Pennsylvania Republican Party Chairman Lawrence Tabas filling you in on what our statewide party leaders are up to, along with relevant news pertaining to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
Good morning, Pennsylvania.
Today is the day. Get out and VOTE! Please vote for our Republican candidates up and down the ballot. The path to President Trump‚Äôs victory is through Pennsylvania. Our president and his team have been to Pennsylvania multiple times, rallying thousands of people. We must keep President Trump in the White House. Please spread the word to your friends and family.

#### Philadelphia in shambles, Gov. Wolf against the police üëé
Unrest, violence and looting have been unfolding in Philadelphia as leftist mobs take the streets in protest after the death of 27-year-old Walter Wallace. Wallace was holding a knife and would not listen to the officers‚Äô orders to drop the knife. Governor Wolf called in the National Guard after 30 officers -- which is now more than 50 -- were injured.
When asked about these injured officers, Gov. Wolf said nothing. Nothing. This is the Democratic Party. They can no longer even wish our officers well. One of the officers is in the hospital after being hit by a truck, but Gov. Wolf could not wish him well. Our officers need leaders who will defend and support them. The Democratic Party no longer stands with law and order, but instead with the rioters and looters. Republican candidates support our police. Stand with our law enforcement, keep our cities safe and vote straight red.

#### Pennsylvania is THE battleground state üëä
Democrats are worried they will lose Pennsylvania, so they have pulled everyone they can to stump for Joe Biden. They know PA is staying red for President Trump today. President Obama told Philadelphians to make a plan to vote for Joe Biden. Obama thinks Pennsylvania wants four more years of what we used to have under his presidency -- a failed economy and deadly foreign policy.
Meanwhile, the Trump family has had massive crowds across the Commonwealth. Ivanka Trump came to Pittsburgh and reminded PA voters of the jobs President Trump brought to our state. President Trump stopped in Lancaster on his campaign blitz and spoke to thousands of supporters. Trump reminded us that Biden would destroy the energy industry, crippling PA‚Äôs economy. He stated, ‚Äúhe [Biden] will eradicate your energy and send Pennsylvania into a crippling depression,‚Äù he [Biden] confirmed his plan to abolish the entire U.S. oil industry.‚Äù
We want four more years of winning with President Trump!

#### Last push to victory üá∫üá∏
Our Republican candidates are ready for their final push to victory. Heather Heidelbaugh is pushing to reach voters across the state to defeat current Attorney General Josh Shapiro. Sean Parnell is making sure our elections are fair and fraud-free for Allegheny County, as he takes on Congressman Conor Lamb in PA-17. Our statewide candidates have been making phone calls, knocking on doors, and talking to folks to get out and vote red.
We have seen the Democratic Party's devastation caused during the Covid-19 crisis and riots in our streets. Our PA Republican leaders did everything they could to stop Gov. Wolf and his pals, but they need more Republicans in the PA Legislature to stand a chance. Joe Biden will destroy our country and state as he leads us down a path of socialist policies, packs the court, and takes away our constitutional liberties.
PA will go red if you go and vote!

Chairman's Update
August 14, 2020
This is a weekly update from Pennsylvania Republican Party Chairman Lawrence Tabas filling you in on what our statewide party leaders are up to, along with relevant news pertaining to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
Good morning, Pennsylvania.
We now know Joe Biden‚Äôs VP pick; far-left, liberal Kamala Harris. A Biden-Harris ticket is bad for Pennsylvania. Harris was by far the most liberal contender for VP. She supports Medicare for All, disrespects our Second Amendment rights and has waged a war on religious freedom. In the presidential debates, Harris openly stated she would use taxpayer dollars to provide healthcare for illegal immigrants. We need all hands on deck if we want to stop this liberal duo.

Lawrence J. Tabas

#### ""There‚Äôs No Question, I‚Äôm in Favor of Banning Fracking.‚Äù
These were words uttered by the Democratic vice presidential nominee. Banning fracking in PA could lead to more than 600,000 job losses. Harris has a record of suing oil companies for environmental violations and backing the Green New Deal. Biden choosing Harris pushes his environmental policies even further to the left.
Kathleen Sgamma, head of the Western Energy Alliance stated, ‚ÄúWhile most of that work is rhetoric, her accusations against an industry that provides 70% of the energy Americans use every day belies the narrative that Biden/Harris would govern in a moderate way.‚Äù Fracking has rescued communities in our Commonwealth from devastation. Banning fracking in PA would be catastrophic for our communities -- to say the least.
‚Üí Read more: Kamala Harris environmental policies will hurt PA‚Äôs economy (NewsMax)
#### Governor Wolf‚Äôs War on Sport üö´
Governor Wolf released his guidelines for schools going back to school this fall. The punchline? Fall sports are canceled. PIAA is pushing back: Executive Director Bob Lombardi stated, ‚ÄúWe would like to have full support. However, it was a recommendation. It wasn‚Äôt a mandate and it wasn‚Äôt an order. If it was an order, we probably wouldn‚Äôt be having the discussion we‚Äôre having here.‚Äù
PA Republicans want to provide parents with an option to allow kids to repeat the school year, thus balancing the pressure of academic achievement with the outlet of physical activity.
Rep. Jesse Topper notes this bill gives parents the freedom to choose -- not the schools. There is no underestimating the importance of teenagers having an outlet, especially in these challenging times.

#### Sen. Toomey Must be Doing Something Right üá®üá≥
Senator Toomey and Chris Van Hollen‚Äôs bill, Hong Kong Autonomy Act, was signed into law that led to Communist China sanctioning certain senators. The bill targets China‚Äôs aggressive crack down on the people of Hong Kong‚Äôs freedoms. Sen. Toomey‚Äôs response to this sanction was simple: ‚ÄúI stand with the people of Hong Kong.‚Äù
Sen. Toomey defends the people of Hong Kong who represent democracy and freedom. He will continue holding China accountable for their human rights violations and is not scared to face the growing threat of the Chinese Communist Party fearlessly.
‚Üí Read more: Toomey‚Äôs response to the sanctions (Toomey)
#### Gov. Wolf Ignores PA Legislature, Again ü§¶
Senate Majority Leader Jake Corman called out Gov. Wolf‚Äôs war on sports. Sen. Corman said nearly all of his Republican peers in the Pennsylvania Senate support schools having fall sports. Sen. Corman pointed out two key problems with Gov. Wolf‚Äôs decision:
1. Gov. Wolf did not consult the Pennsylvania Legislature on this decision before going public.
2. Gov. Wolf did not declare an executive order, just a ‚Äòstrong recommendation.‚Äô
Now the PIAA is in a tough position. As Sen. Corman told Erie News Now, ""He (Gov. Wolf) put the PIAA in a really difficult position. He should have made it an order if he could, or he should have stayed out of it."" The consequences of violating Gov. Wolf‚Äôs recommendation is still unclear.
‚Üí Read more: Panel delays decision on Pennsylvania sports for two weeks (Erie News Now)
#### Heidelbaugh‚Äôs First Television Ad üëä
Heather Heidelbaugh‚Äôs new television ad shares her inspiring story of overcoming adversity and becoming a successful trial lawyer. Heidelbaugh notes she will do what Shapiro will not: keep our cities safe and focus on PA issues. Shapiro is rumored to have his sights on the governor's mansion in 2022 and Heidelbaugh promises to serve a full term as PA's attorney general.
Heidelbaugh notes, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair that, if you want another job, you run for attorney general. The people of Pennsylvania need an active attorney general.‚Äù The race is heating up -- keep an eye out for more ads from the Republican candidate for attorney general.

This is why we‚Äôre working with Senator Toomey to keep Pennsylvania red!

Chairman's Update
September 14, 2020
This is a weekly update from Pennsylvania Republican Party Chairman Lawrence Tabas filling you in on what our statewide party leaders are up to, along with relevant news pertaining to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
Good afternoon, Pennsylvania.
Pennsylvania is THE hotspot for the 2020 presidential election. Vice President Mike Pence made another stop in Western Pennsylvania last week. It was a thrilling night listening to President Trump speak in Latrobe on Sept. 3. Friends, I saw firsthand the crowds lined up to see our president speak in Pennsylvania. The enthusiasm for this election is off the charts and we must keep it up!
As Election Day draws closer, the Democrats continue to release more lies and slander against President Trump. Let‚Äôs continue to come out and support our president. We must support Republicans down ballot here in PA in order to keep the White House red AND flip the House red, too.

#### Gov. Wolf continues to hurt business owners ‚ùå
Just as business owners thought they were getting some relief, the governor and his liberal cohorts slapped another restriction on them. Businesses with a liquor license must stop serving alcohol at 10 p.m.!
Gov. Wolf‚Äôs egregious policies are hurting our bar and restaurant owners! John Longstreet, president and CEO of the Pennsylvania Restaurant and Lodging Association, stated, ‚ÄúThis is an undue burden on an industry struggling for survival.‚Äù These businesses are holding on by a thread and our governor is playing politics.
‚Üí Read more: Restaurant owners hit with another restriction (PennLive)
#### Heidelbaugh is no hack! üëä
Attorney General Josh Shapiro released an attack on Republican candidate Heather Heidelbaugh, claiming she is a ‚Äúhack lawyer.‚Äù Heidelbaugh is on the campaign trail throughout PA. In DuBois, Heather defended herself against this baseless attack by pointing to her 36 years of experience in the courtroom and Shapiro‚Äôs zero years in the courtroom. Heidelbaugh did not hold back, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think he would call a man who practiced law for 36 years a hack, I practice law for 54 of 67 counties. I‚Äôve tried cases. My opponent has never tried a case.‚Äù
Shapiro is running a campaign backed by liberal funders like Planned Parenthood as he seeks a second term. Heidelbaugh reminded voters she is running to be attorney general for a full term, while Shapiro has his sights set on the governor‚Äôs mansion. Heidelbaugh noted she will be tough on crime as Shapiro allows for the riots and looters to continue through Pennsylvania. Heidelbaugh will bring true justice to PA.

#### Discussion and reform over terror and violence
A video of angry rioters in Pittsburgh emerged going viral. Republican candidate for Congress, Sean Parnell, tweeted about the horrifying video. His opponent, Democrat incumbent Conor Lamb, is staying silent as usual. Parnell noted, ‚ÄúConor Lamb marched with this movement. A movement now terrorizing our communities.‚Äù Democrats refuse to call these protests what they are: violent rioting. Vice President Pence commented on the Pittsburgh riots stating, ‚ÄúThe American people want law and order. Whether it be the violent protests or the rioting we have seen in cities around the country‚Ä¶of the harassment that you saw at an outdoor restaurant and at a McDonald‚Äôs run by an African American manager ‚Äî all of this has just got to stop.‚Äù
Senator Toomey and Vice President Mike Pence attended a meeting in Pittsburgh to discuss the civil unrest in America. Pence assured the crowd that the Trump administration will not defund the police but instead give them the resources they need. He also condemned the riots and looting in our cities. Sen. Toomey and Pence discussed the proper response to racism and injustice in America. The answer is not rioting and violence, rather economic opportunities and real reform in education and criminal justice.

Friend,
Last night‚Äôs debate between Vice President Mike Pence and Biden‚Äôs running mate Kamala Harris made it clear that Election Day will come down to a simple choice: Capitalism or socialism.
A Biden-Harris administration would sky-rocket taxes and eliminate choice, sending America straight down the path of socialism.
People would be stripped of their opportunity to choose what health care they have. Education opportunities would be cut drastically.
CHOOSE CAPITALISM ‚úÖ OVER SOCIALISM ‚ùå
Vice President Mike Pence made it clear -- Americans deserve all the opportunity in the world, the only way for this to be possible is through capitalism.
We know by now people who are voting for Joe Biden on Nov. 3 are just offering Kamala Harris a free ticket to the White House.
Kamala Harris is not what Americans want. This was made evident when she was forced to drop out of the Democratic presidential primary back in February, due to a severe lack of support.
>> STOP BIDEN-HARRIS >>
Thank you as always for your support.
Best,
Vonne Andring

Friend,
Time is running out for us to reach our end of the month fundraising goal of $15,000.
We are $8,116 short of our monthly goal.
This month, the Democratic Party idolized a nation where socialism and violence rule. We cannot let this happen in Pennsylvania. We must elect candidates who support capitalism and condemn violent mobs.
I hate to ask during these uncertain times but November is right around the corner. Many of our Republican candidates are fighting tough races this November. Can you contribute just $25 to help us reach our goal?
Donate $10>> Donate $25>> Donate $50>> Donate $100>>
Electing our hardworking, conservative candidates to office this November starts with you, . I cannot thank you enough for your support.
Sincerely,
Lawrence Tabas

Dear Friend,
Wow. The energy felt across Pennsylvania yesterday was palpable.
What a smart move by President Trump to make three stops here in Pennsylvania. It is clear he understands that this election will come down to our great Commonwealth.
President Trump campaigned in Allentown, Lancaster AND Altoona in one day.
‚òëÔ∏è SLEEPY JOE IS UNFIT TO LEAD OUR NATION
Joe Biden has called an indefinite ‚Äúlid‚Äù with Election Day just one week away. A lid is when a candidate announces a cease in traveling and campaigning.
Why would he call a lid, you ask? Because Biden‚Äôs campaign is terrified of the next word that will come out of his mouth. He is a liability to his own campaign. Joe Biden is proving every day he is unfit to take on the role of commander in chief.
Joe Biden also confirmed that under his administration, he would get rid of fracking and energy jobs.
As President Trump said earlier, the choice is clear. Please consider donating just $50 or $25 today to ensure we keep Pennsylvania RED at a local, statewide and national level.
We simply cannot afford a Biden administration.
A vote for President Trump is a vote for energy jobs, law and order, and our Constitution.
Please encourage your friends to vote on Nov. 3.
Best,

"Lawrence Tabas, PAGOP Chairman",info@pagop.org,GOP Goes Three for Three in Special Elections,"Dear Friend--
Did you see the headlines?!! Republicans swept three special elections for the Pennsylvania House!
The March 17 Special Elections weren‚Äôt victories won by the luck of the Irish. They were won by great candidates with strong messages and great turnout. We had a lot working against us: Democrats out spending us, a last minute lawsuit to delay the election, and the COVID-19 virus.
Politics PA wrote:
‚ÄúAlthough each district was previously represented by a Republican prior to the vacancy, not all of the races were viewed as clear Republican holds.‚Äù
The Pennsylvania Capital-Star observed:
‚ÄúThe wins came across the commonwealth, from suburban Philadelphia to old milltowns south of Pittsburgh to a rural district in western Pennsylvania, and left the GOP confident for the rest of 2020 ‚Äî including up to November‚Äôs critical presidential [[URL REDACTED]] looked in play for Democrats, but the party did not draw out enough former Blue Dogs in southwestern Pennsylvania or Trump-skeptical suburbanites outside Philadelphia to flip a district.‚Äù
The Bucks County Courier-Times noted an important fact as well:
‚ÄúThe Republican Party noted the Democrats spent more than $900,000 but lost the three races in the special election.‚Äù
PA Post added:
‚ÄúTuesday‚Äôs turnout met or slightly exceeded election directors‚Äô expectations of between 10 and 15 percent (turnout is typically quite low for special elections).
Turnout in the 8th District was in that range in its Butler County section (11 percent) and higher in the Mercer County part (17 percent). In Westmoreland County, the 58th saw a 20 percent turnout, up from 17 percent for its last special four years ago for the adjacent state House district.
Turnout was 20 percent in 18th District, which lies entirely in Bensalem Township (Bucks County), versus 12 percent at the county‚Äôs last special in 2009, according to elections director Thomas Freitag.‚Äù
Even RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel celebrated our victories:
Our message is reaching across party lines and pulling in unlikely voters, but we‚Äôre not sitting back! The April 28th Primary Election will be here quick, and we want to encourage you, your friends and your neighbors to register Republican! Click here to learn more on how you can register online, and here to apply for a new Mail-in ballot.

Chairman's Update
June 25, 2020
This is a new weekly update from Pennsylvania Republican Party Chairman Lawrence Tabas filling you in on what our statewide party leaders are up to, along with relevant news pertaining to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
Good afternoon, Pennsylvania.
Today I wanted to take a moment to congratulate Representative Bryan Cutler to his new role as Speaker of the House. Rep. Cutler was unanimously elected into his position as Speaker by his peers in the Pennsylvania House. At the Pennsylvania Republican Party, we are excited to continue our relationship with Rep. Cutler and continue to see results brought to the Commonwealth.

#### The show must go on‚Ä¶ but only for Governor Wolf
Governor Wolf‚Äôs coronavirus hypocrisy is nationally known at this point, and it doesn‚Äôt seem to be getting any better.
State Health Secretary Rachel Levine sued Carlisle Events for having too many individuals registered to attend their annual car show. Sec. Levine cited the Carlisle show was violating the 250-person cap on gatherings within the state. Interesting, because I don‚Äôt recall Sec. Levine reminding Gov. Wolf of this ‚Äú250-person cap‚Äù when he decided to parade the streets of Harrisburg shoulder to shoulder with protestors.
Sec. Levine threatened if Carlisle Events didn‚Äôt comply, they would be met with ‚Äúcriminal and civil penalties.‚Äù Again, interesting how Sec. Levine is quick to call on the support of law enforcement, while the trusty Gov. Wolf was photographed two weeks earlier with signs that read ‚ÄúBLUE LIVES MURDER.‚Äù
So which is it? Will the left come crawling to law enforcement when it‚Äôs convenient to them? Or will they protest in the streets and call police officers murderers?

#### Toomey calls out Senate Democrats
Senate Democrats blocked Senator Tim Scott‚Äôs (R-SC) Justice Act Wednesday from even being considered in the Senate. U.S. Senator Pat Toomey called out Senate Democrats for choosing politics over progress, since they are not even letting a legislative discussion begin on the Justice Act.
Senate Democrats have spent the past couple weeks demanding policing reforms. Now that a bill was introduced, they chose to obstruct it rather than have actual bipartisan discussions to amend it. It is clear they only want to complain instead of work out actual results between both parties.

#### Welcome, Speaker Cutler!
Rep. Bryan Cutler (R-Peach Bottom) previously served as majority leader before being unanimously voted in to serve as Speaker of the House of Representatives. Speaker Cutler is the third person ever from Lancaster County to serve as Speaker of the House. He has served in the Pennsylvania Legislature for 13 years and his leadership has been instrumental in the successes of the 2020 Pennsylvania legislative session.
Speaker Cutler released the following statement regarding new leadership in the Pennsylvania Legislature:
‚ÄúThis group spanning varied backgrounds, experiences and regions of our Commonwealth reflect what Pennsylvanians have been asking for.
‚ÄúThe challenges and pathways to success are evolving, and our energized and effective leaders humbly accept the responsibilities entrusted to us by our districts and also now by our fellow caucus members.‚Äù

With Rep. Cutler being elected to serve as Speaker of the House, a vote was cast to promote Rep. Kerry Benninghoff (R-Centre/Mifflin) to majority floor leader. Rep. Benninghoff previously served as the majority whip and has held multiple leadership positions within the state House.
Rep. Benninghoff stated:
‚ÄúI am humbled and grateful for the opportunity to lead, but most importantly, the opportunity to serve.
‚ÄúPennsylvania, like much of the nation, is at a critical crossroads. The good news is, we can see the challenges we face as opportunities to catapult change. If we work together, I believe we can usher in a bright and exciting future for our Commonwealth.‚Äù

Friend,
I will keep this short since it is a Saturday night.
It is official: President Trump has nominated Judge Amy Coney Barrett for the Supreme Court vacancy.
Amy Coney Barrett is an experienced constitutional conservative and would be an undeniable asset to the Supreme Court bench.
Now, President Trump‚Äôs nomination is in the hands of the Senate. Please join me in telling the Senate: CONFIRM JUDGE CONEY BARRETT!
We are asking you to pledge $51 for 51 votes in the Senate.
$51 FOR 51 VOTES
The Democrats are using President Trump‚Äôs nomination as an excuse to expand the Supreme Court bench and even push it to function more as a legislative branch.
Newsflash: This doesn‚Äôt fly in America.
Amy Coney Barrett is a proven constitutionalist. We need her on the Supreme Court to not only preserve the Constitution, but also for the sake of our nation.
‚òëÔ∏è  CONFIRM JUDGE CONEY BARRETT ‚òëÔ∏è
We are nearing Nov. 3. Cases may arise that jeopardize the integrity of our election. If this was to ever happen, we cannot risk having a Court divided to 4-4. Riots and violence would only get worse.
We cannot afford any more turmoil and unrest in our nation.
This is why I am calling on you to join me and tell the Senate CONFIRM JUDGE CONEY BARRETT!
We need your support to elect like-minded conservatives to office. If more Democrats are elected in Pennsylvania, there is no telling what will be done to alter the Supreme Court.
Thank you for your support.

Friend,
We are doing a huge push to raise $25,000 in the final hours before tonight‚Äôs FINAL presidential debate. We need to show President Trump that Pennsylvania will stay RED on Nov. 3.
Tonight President Trump will face off against Joe Biden for the last time. We want to tell the Trump campaign we were able to raise $25,000 in support of President Trump and our Republican candidates on the ballot in PA.
Please consider chipping in $20.20 to give President Trump a last-minute boost going into tonight‚Äôs debate.
Let‚Äôs recap what has happened so far:
‚úÖ President Trump clearly outperformed Joe Biden during their first debate. Not only did he defeat Joe Biden, but also moderator Chris Wallace -- who felt the need to join in on the debate.
‚úÖ President Trump went on to defeat Savannah Guthrie, who also tried to debate him during what was supposed to be a town hall event.
‚úÖ President Trump has campaigned like NO OTHER. His grassroots volunteer movement is breaking records.
Here is what HASN‚ÄôT happened yet:
‚ùå Joe Biden has refused to comment on the recent developments of his relationship with the Ukrainian businessmen who paid his son millions.
‚ùå Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have yet to be challenged in any shape or form by mainstream media.
‚ùå Twitter has yet to remove the lock from the New York Post‚Äôs account. The blatant bias is absolutely ridiculous.
Here is the short of it. We need to make sure President Trump wins Pennsylvania again. He has a steady lead in our sister state of Ohio -- we need to replicate this lead in Pennsylvania.
I know the Silent Majority is well and strong. Please commit just $20.20 in these final hours before the debate to show President Trump he will WIN PA!
Thank you for your support.
Sincerely,
Lawrence Tabas

Dear Friend,
Newsmax: Kamala Harris Wants to Ban Fracking
Yes, you read that correctly.
Kamala Harris called to ban fracking. Harris said this as if tens of thousands of Pennsylvania jobs aren‚Äôt at stake if this were to happen.
Not to mention -- in addition to Harris‚Äô wish to ban fracking -- Joe Biden‚Äôs climate plan would cost us taxpayers $2 trillion just to end up putting thousands of jobs at risk.
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are directly attacking Pennsylvania jobs.
In our great Commonwealth, we are known for our hardworking energy workers and fracking industry.
PROTECT OUR JOBS
Biden‚Äôs plan would raise utility bills for shale workers and negatively impact the livelihoods of their families. According to the New York Times, there are about 32,000 Pennsylvanians who work in the energy field.
32,000 jobs are at stake if the Biden-Harris ticket makes its way to the White House.
‚úÖ YES! I want to keep 32,000 jobs in Pennsylvania!
It is clear Joe Biden and Kamala Harris do NOT care about our energy workers.
We need your help.
We need to elect candidates who care and value the livelihood of Pennsylvanians.
Please donate just $20.20 to ensure Pennsylvania STAYS RED this November.
$20.20
We cannot afford to have the Biden-Harris ticket anywhere near the Oval Office. Please donate now if you agree.

Chairman's Update
July 2, 2020
This is a new weekly update from Pennsylvania Republican Party Chairman Lawrence Tabas filling you in on what our statewide party leaders are up to, along with relevant news pertaining to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
Good afternoon, Pennsylvania.
It has been a busy week here in our great Commonwealth. The Trump campaign is suing Pennsylvania statewide election officials for the unconstitutional ballot boxes that were used during the PA Primary. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court nullified the Pennsylvania Legislature‚Äôs House Resolution 836, and by doing so sided with Governor Wolf and his abuse of power.
There is a bright side, however.
The Republican leadership in the PA Legislature is continuing to do great things and produce real, commonsense solutions. Their bipartisan efforts should serve as a model for Congress.
Lastly, I want to wish you a blessed and safe 4th of July weekend. We are truly blessed to live in this great nation. Happy 4th!

#### I had a (virtual) sitdown with Sean Spicer
The Trump campaign has called to ban all mail-in ballot boxes that aren‚Äôt located at official county board of election sites for the general election. It shouldn‚Äôt be so complicated to make sure ballots are counted at official county board of election (BOE) sites, and not just a strategically placed box by the partisan proxies of the BOE.
I spoke to former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer on this issue. Here‚Äôs the thing : These ballot drop boxes are unconstitutional, end of story.
It is not a lot to ask for the vote of every Pennsylvanian to be fairly counted. These ballot boxes have:
* No staff to make sure ballots aren‚Äôt tampered with.
* No cameras to monitor safety of each ballot.
* County BOE players that pick and choose ballot box locations.
These ballot boxes put the voice and vote of every Pennsylvanian at risk for the 2020 election.

#### Toomey takes on Chinese Communist Party‚Ä¶ Again
U.S. Senator Pat Toomey‚Äôs bipartisan Hong Kong Autonomy Act passed unanimously in the Senate last week. This is a great step toward holding China accountable, and we are grateful for Sen. Toomey‚Äôs work with Sen. Van Hollen to ensure the inclusion of this act as an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA).
The United States must stand for Hong Kong as it fights for freedom. Sen. Toomey and Sen. Van Hollen‚Äôs bill would impose sanctions on the Chinese Communist Party and support Hongkongers seeking to enter the United States.
This is a huge victory against China. ""Last week, the Senate stood up to the communist regime in Beijing and stood with the people of Hong Kong,"" said Senator Toomey.

#### Speaker Cutler on Face the State üëÄ
Speaker Cutler sat down with Ryan Eldredge on Rob Hanrahan‚Äôs ‚ÄúFace the State‚Äù to discuss his new role as House Speaker.
Speaker Cutler discussed that while the coronavirus pandemic has temporarily halted meetings with legislative members across the state, he looks forward to continuing this tradition when the time is right. Speaker Cutler regularly visited members of the state legislature as majority leader and House whip, and looks forward to doing the same in his new role.
Speaker Cutler also touched on the Pennsylvania Legislature‚Äôs current bipartisan efforts to have actual, effective conversations on police reform.
‚ÄúThe biggest part is we were able to sit down and talk through the bills and their different components,‚Äù Speaker Cutler said when asked how members are able to work together to find a solution.
It seems Congress could learn a thing or two from our statewide legislators here in Pennsylvania.

# PA Supreme Court sides with Gov. Wolf, Senate leaders show disapproval
Senate President Scarnati issued a joint statement along with Senate Majority Leader Corman on Wednesday strongly criticizing the Pennsylvania Supreme Court for nullifying PA Legislature‚Äôs call to end Gov. Wolf‚Äôs executive order.
Gov. Wolf refused to end this order, demonstrating a complete abuse of power. This explains why House Resolution 838 passed in the PA General Assembly with bipartisan support.
Sen. Scarnati said the following on the matter:
‚ÄúToday‚Äôs ruling by the Supreme Court fails to uphold the Constitutional balance of power between the three, co-equal branches of government.
‚ÄúWe understand the need for a temporary suspension of civil liberties under dire circumstances ‚Äì something we agreed needed to happen initially as we worked to flatten the curve. However, while we work to protect lives, we cannot continue to disregard the civil liberties of Pennsylvanians. Our government was established to be of the people, by the people and for the people. With this ruling the Court has elected not to uphold the foundation of our democracy.‚Äù

Friend,
The Democratic Party is trying to claim ownership of the Supreme Court and prevent President Trump from appointing a true conservative to the bench.
Governor Wolf ruled unconstitutional!
This is the difference between Democrats and Republicans. The Democratic Party always believes they are owed something.
This is not how the Supreme Court works. The Supreme Court doesn‚Äôt owe anyone anything. The Supreme Court is there to lawfully, and faithfully, uphold our Constitution.
PROTECT OUR CONSTITUTION üá∫üá∏
That is the beauty of the Supreme Court, it doesn‚Äôt belong to a political party.
I like to say nothing from the left surprises me anymore but this weekend hit a new low -- fundraising off of the passing of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
The Democrats have raised $71 million since the death of Justice Ginsburg. The left thinks they can buy this Court seat. I have a message for the left: The Supreme Court belongs to the people, NOT a political party.
It is well within President Donald Trump‚Äôs duty to nominate a new Supreme Court justice. This is where our democracy comes to life. It will then be up to the Senate on whether or not the nomination is approved. President Trump‚Äôs nomination will need 51 votes to pass through the Senate.
We cannot leave anything for chance this Election Day. Our American principles are under fire and the Constitution must prevail.
Our constitutional rights are at risk, will you pledge $51 for 51 votes in the Senate?
We need your help to ensure our democracy remains intact.
We need your help to protect our constitutional rights.
We need your help to stop the Democratic Party from expecting to be owed whatever they want.
Thank you for your support.
Sincerely,
Vonne Andring

`NY Attorney General lawsuit seeks to dissolve National Rifle Association (ABC News)`
,
I knew Democrats had gone far left, but even I was shocked that the Attorney General of New York held a press conference today announcing she was trying to eliminate the NRA.
The NRA has fought to project our 2nd Amendment rights, and it drives the liberal nuts.
Our own liberal Attorney General, Josh Shapiro, follows the lead of the other far-left AGs across the country. Make no mistake he will bring this same insanity to Pennsylvania.
That‚Äôs why we need your help. To be honest, the liberals are outraising us every day with millions from their Hollywood special interest friends. We need hardworking Pennsylvanians like you to step up.

Chairman's Update
August 28, 2020
This is a weekly update from Pennsylvania Republican Party Chairman Lawrence Tabas filling you in on what our statewide party leaders are up to, along with relevant news pertaining to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
Good morning, Pennsylvania.
What an honor it was to officially renominate Donald J. Trump for President of the United States of America. The Republican National Convention highlighted the importance of this election. With a myriad of wonderful and inspiring speakers, the RNC depicted how great America truly is.
The battle ahead of us will not be easy but the RNC showed our party‚Äôs strength and vigor to fight for American values and freedom. President Trump reminded us just last week that ‚ÄúJoe Biden is no friend of Pennsylvania.‚Äù We agree! PA is ready to once again go red for President Trump!

#### Gov. Wolf‚Äôs proposes pricey and unrealistic fall agenda üí∞üí∞
Governor Wolf unveiled his fall agenda this week. During a news conference, the governor took a jab at Republican lawmakers for checking his power during the pandemic. To clarify, Gov. Wolf was mad that our Republican leaders are actually doing their jobs and holding him accountable. Gov. Wolf‚Äôs proposals call for a hefty amount of money for various programs. This includes $250 million for childcare, $10 million for PPE, $100 million for low-income housing, and millions of dollars spent elsewhere. All of this sounds great but this is not a time for Pennsylvanians to pay even more in taxes to the government than we already do.
Gov. Wolf suggested lawmakers legalize the recreational use of marijuana to increase revenue. It is unlikely his pricey proposals will pass this fall as Republicans are focused on reopening Pennsylvania‚Äôs economy, not spending huge amounts of money.
Pennsylvania House Majority Leader Kerry Benninghoff responded to Gov. Wolf‚Äôs plans noting the unrealistic amount of spending. He said, ‚ÄúIt is disingenuous for this governor to put forward an unaffordable legislative agenda and require taxpayers to bail him out of his unilateral mandates that have devastated their lives and livelihoods.‚Äù
‚Üí Read more: Wolf expensive agenda (WGAL)
#### Sen. Toomey continues to fight the visible enemy, Covid-19 üëä
Senator Toomey spoke in York and Lebanon County with local employers about the impact of coronavirus on the economy. Sen. Toomey wants PA to reopen safely and he is there to help every step of the way. He assured the concerned employers Congress is working on another funding bill for relief. Toomey wants to protect employers against rash Covid-19 lawsuits. He is hopeful a bill will be passed by September.
Next stop, Sen. Toomey talks to employers in Lebanon, PA about their economic hardships during the pandemic. The senator noted the extensive locked place by Gov. Wolf as a reason for the slow economic recovery. Many restaurant and bar owners are still grappling with severe and unnecessary restrictions. The people in both counties expressed their frustrations about the slow opening of PA. Sen. Toomey and Representative Scott Perry shared those frustrations and assured them the federal government will continue to help.

#### Sean Parnell ‚ÄúAmerica needs all her patriots to rush to her defense.‚Äù
Republican congressional candidate for Pennsylvania‚Äôs 17th district, Sean Parnell, spoke Monday night at the RNC. His speech focused on freedom and unity. Parnell highlighted his exceptional military experience fighting in Afghanistan. He notes the diversity within his platoon and banding together as brothers in the face of battle and death. These American heroes were united, not divided. Parnell wants the same for all Americans today.
Parnell also discussed President Trump‚Äôs work in his last four years, calling on all people regardless of party affiliation to vote for Trump. Parnell criticized the Democratic Party, ‚ÄúI don't see a party that wants you to be free. I see a party that wants to chain you to conformity and will destroy anyone they deem a heretic.‚Äù Parnell is running against up-and-coming liberal star, Conor Lamb, who also spoke at his party‚Äôs convention. Parnell vowed to protect the Constitution and serve the people in the 17th district of Pennsylvania.

"Gerry Wosewick, PAGOP Executive Director",info@pagop.org,Wolf Admin Wasted $160K in YOUR MONEY,"Friend--
Just the other day Chairman Tabas told you about our statewide row office team. Today was a reminder of why we need them now more than ever.
SpotlightPA just reported the Office of the Inspector General WASTED $160,000 in your TAXDOLLARS purchasing guns and ammunition it can‚Äôt use!
Headline: The Pa. agency that looks for wasteful spending wasted $160,000 on guns and ammo it can‚Äôt use
[[URL REDACTED]]
The Office of Inspector General is Governor Wolf‚Äôs internal agency tasked with rooting out waste and fraud. Today they proved woefully inept in that duty. What else are they hiding? We‚Äôll never know with our Democrat Attorney General, Auditor General, and Treasurer there to cover for Wolf. It‚Äôs why we need change.
On Tuesday, Chairman Tabas asked for your financial help, today was just another example of why.
Your donation of $20.20, $40.40, $202.20 or even $2,020 will ensure we can spread this concerning news.
Thank you for your support of our Party as we work together to end the waste and corruption in Pennsylvania.

Subject: Have you seen our Team?
Dear Friend--
While Democrats in DC are busy with their sham impeachment, the Pennsylvania Republican party has just endorsed the most qualified statewide row office candidates in history. We‚Äôre energized and ready to go head to head against the liberal policies of the Democrats!
Meet our Team that will take back our row offices this November!
Attorney General - Heather Heidelbaugh: is an attorney with more than thirty five years experience in the courtroom. She‚Äôs tough, smart and she‚Äôll keep our families safe and protected. We need a full-time lawyer as attorney general, not a temp waiting for his turn to run for governor.
Auditor General - Tim DeFoor: has been nationally recognized for his efforts to save taxpayer dollars as Dauphin County Comptroller. Tim will work hard and keep an eye on Pennsylvania‚Äôs checkbook and work against the frivolous spending of the Wolf administration.
Stacy Garrity - Treasurer: served three combat tours in Iraq. She‚Äôs a retired Army Colonel who is accustomed to breaking glass ceilings. As Treasurer, Stacy will stop Governor Wolf‚Äôs blank check writing and return the staggering $3.5 billion dollars in unclaimed property taxes to the taxpayers.
Heather, Tim, and Stacy NEED your help TODAY! Can you support our 2020 Team with a donation of $20.20, double it for $40.40, $200.20 or even $2020.00?
Every dollar that is contributed will go directly into our grassroots efforts...hitting every door and every voter we can. Momentum is on our side, because of people like you. Click here to pitch in your support TODAY so we can get our great slate across the finish line.
With gratitude,
Chairman Lawrence Tabas
Republican Party of Pennsylvania

Chairman's Update
October 9, 2020
This is a weekly update from Pennsylvania Republican Party Chairman Lawrence Tabas filling you in on what our statewide party leaders are up to, along with relevant news pertaining to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
Good morning, Pennsylvania.
My spirits are up this week because President Trump and the First Lady are having a speedy recovery. President Trump is back to work in the White House. I am also happy to say I am confident that Pennsylvania is staying red this November! As I watch Republican voter registration surpass Democratic registration numbers, I become more confident in our success.
In a recent interview with 90.5 WESA, I explained Republican voter registration numbers have skyrocketed. This further proves President Trump can easily win Pennsylvania again when we compare to 2016 numbers. He won Pennsylvania by 44,000 votes and we now have 160,000 new Republicans registered in the state. Democrats are shrugging off the numbers. Let‚Äôs show them that numbers don‚Äôt lie on Nov. 3. Here comes the red wave!

#### A slight win for Republicans against Governor Wolf üí™
Governor Wolf has slightly lifted crowd restrictions for indoor and outdoor events. However, he does not plan to ease up until there is a vaccine or cure for the virus. Dr. Rachel Levine also noted they could roll back these restrictions if they feel the virus is spreading too much. The Wolf administration has a hard time giving up executive power.
Meanwhile, the next fight against Gov. Wolf‚Äôs effort to change the rules heats up as Republican legislators attempt to keep our election fair and uncompromised. Republicans want to create an ‚Äòelection integrity‚Äô committee to look into the election with all the new changes. Gov. Wolf views the creation of the committee as a threat to the election. We saw the chaos caused by early voting in Philadelphia. What‚Äôs the harm in making sure our election process is fair and trusted, Gov. Wolf?
‚Üí Read more: Pennsylvania Republicans propose ‚Äòelection integrity‚Äô committee amid voting concerns (Fox News)
#### We will miss Senator Toomey üò¢
Senator Pat Toomey announced he would not run for reelection in the Senate. Sen. Toomey has represented the Commonwealth since 2011. He assured voters he hopes to work with President Trump in the near future. He stated, ‚ÄúI hope to be serving these last two years with President Donald Trump having been reelected. I support his campaign and I support his reelection.‚Äù Although we won‚Äôt have Toomey in the Senate in 2022, we still have him fighting for Pennsylvanians for the next two years.
‚Üí Read more: Toomey announces retirement at end of 2022 (The Hill)
#### Different isn't working üëé
Attorney General Josh Shapiro calls Heather Hieldbaugh‚Äôs attempt to focus on Pennsylvanians ‚Äúlaughable.‚Äù Shapiro would rather sue President Trump and Little Sisters of the Poor instead of focusing on Pennsylvania‚Äôs rising crime. Heidelbaugh‚Äôs message is quite simple: Don‚Äôt be a legislator, be a lawyer for the citizens. Shapiro characterized Heidelbaugh‚Äôs critiques of his suing frenzy as ‚Äúdownright cynical.‚Äù Perhaps Shapiro needs to be reminded that his authority comes from the people of PA.
He proudly stated that he ran and won to be a ‚Äúdifferent kind of attorney general.‚Äù Well, Shapiro, Pennsylvania doesn‚Äôt need a ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù kind of attorney general. We need an attorney general who has legal experience and cares about the issues at home \-- not in Washington. Heidelbaugh has 36 years of experience in the courtroom, while Shapiro has zero.
Our Commonwealth needs an experienced attorney general because ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù is not working.

#### Can we really trust Josh Shapiro?
Pennsylvania House Republicans called on Attorney General Josh Shapiro to consider legal action against Governor Wolf for forcing nursing homes to readmit coronavirus patients. Gov. Wolf followed in the footsteps of Gov. Cuomo (NY) and Gov. Whitmer (MI), both of whom have been notoriously known for mishandling the coronavirus pandemic within their states. More than 4,500 Pennsylvanians have suffered on account of Gov. Wolf‚Äôs deadly nursing home order.
AG Shapiro‚Äôs office responded to House Republicans on July 6 stating they acknowledge the concerns brought against Gov. Wolf and will conduct a thorough investigation into any foul play. Can we really trust Shapiro to do his job? Keep in mind, Shapiro is a textbook career politician who is just using the position of AG as a stepping stone to run for governor. Not to mention Shapiro is buddy-buddy with Gov. Wolf, so can we really trust his office to run a detailed investigation at Gov. Wolf‚Äôs expense? Hard Pass.

#### Toomey works across aisle to help small businesses affected by riots üî•
U.S. Senator Pat Toomey is working with Rep. Dwight Evans (PA-03) to help small businesses in cities such as Philadelphia that were damaged during recent riots. We applaud Sen. Toomey for recognizing the importance of assisting Pennsylvania‚Äôs small businesses after they were unfairly broken into and vandalized.
The fact of the matter is, civil unrest and ‚Äúpeaceful protests‚Äù should have never gotten this far. The only statement that vandalizing small businesses sends is a bank statement to your local business owner. Now, unfortunately, we have to put forth more time and more energy to repair the damage that was done. With Sen. Toomey and Rep. Evans‚Äô Helping Entrepreneurs Access Loans (HEAL) Act, communities are able to be lifted up by the success of their small businesses.

#### Speaker Cutler discusses bipartisanship, fair elections and more üôå
Speaker Cutler spoke with Jon Delano of KDKA TV about how he finds success in his work. The answer? Bipartisanship. Speaker Cutler stated his whole time in the Pennsylvania Legislature has been about finding people to work with on both sides.
‚ÄúMy whole approach up there during my entire tenure has really been the same. I try to find those areas where there‚Äôs some commonality and some common ground. I always try to find a Democrat to work on major issues with,‚Äù  Speaker Cutler told Delano.
This is the kind of leadership we need in Congress.

#### Giving Gov. Wolf one last chance...
The Pennsylvania Legislature recently delivered House Resolution 836 to Gov. Wolf‚Äôs desk, which calls to end his emergency declarations. This comes after Gov. Wolf‚Äôs legal attempts to block the bill which, by the way, has bipartisan support. Senate President Scarnati and Majority Leader Jake Corman made the following statement on the matter:
‚ÄúBy presenting HR 836 to Governor Wolf for signature, we are hopeful he will abandon his attempt to govern on his own and begin to work with the legislature to do what is in the best interest of all Pennsylvanians.""
Gov. Wolf needs to understand we have a democratic system built on checks and balances, and it is not a place for his authoritarian-style ‚Äúleadership.‚Äù

#### Republican voter surge in Pennsylvania üìà
The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that Republicans have gained 165,000 voters since the last presidential election year. This is five times the number Democrats have registered between now and 2016. While Democrats overall have more voters registered in Pennsylvania, here is what I told The Philadelphia Inquirer: ‚ÄúWe have since picked up and narrowed the gap between us and the Democrats [by 135,000]. So we were already ahead 44,000, and look what we‚Äôve picked up. I predict we‚Äôre going to narrow the gap further between now and November.‚Äù

#### Anti-Semitism has no place here ‚ùå
Sen. Toomey called out Philadelphia NAACP President, Minister Rodney Muhammad for sharing an anti-Semitic post on Facebook on July 28. Statewide officials have even called for Muhammad‚Äôs resignation, even though Muhammad denies any malintent from sharing the post.
The post, which is now deleted, showed images of several celebrities ‚Äî who have all made anti-Semitic remarks lately ‚Äî along with a caricature of a yarmulke-wearing figure crushing people with a hook-turned hand. There is no mistaking this kind of blatant disregard for the Jewish community.

#### Gov. Wolf denies transparency in the Legislature üôÑ
The Lancaster County Republican Delegation, led by Speaker Cutler, called on Governor Wolf to sign the Legislature‚Äôs proposed government transparency bill. This bill would require the governor to have open discussions with the Legislature should an emergency declaration be thought of. It would also hold the governor accountable in the eyes of the media and Pennsylvanians, as we have a right to know what decisions are being made in regards to our livelihood.
The Lancaster County Republican Delegation said the following on the matter:
‚ÄúNo one person has the capacity to govern and issue mandates that affect the lives and livelihoods of millions of citizens across a diverse state during an emergency. It was for these circumstances that our Founders created three co-equal branches of government. We urge the governor to listen to the voices of unemployed Pennsylvanians, small business owners and those who have lost family members due to COVID-19.‚Äù

October 16, 2020
This is a weekly update from Pennsylvania Republican Party Chairman Lawrence Tabas filling you in on what our statewide party leaders are up to, along with relevant news pertaining to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
Good afternoon, Pennsylvania.
President Trump is back on the road after fully recovering from the coronavirus. Where was President Trump‚Äôs first campaign stop after recovering? The great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, of course! President Trump spoke to an electrified crowd in Johnstown who showed their support by chanting, ‚ÄúFour more years!‚Äù
A merchandise store owner and supporter, Diana Lohr, noted at the rally, ‚ÄúI've had people coming on buses from as far as Ohio, Indiana and Erie, Pennsylvania, to get a glimpse of [the president]. All of them wanting to ‚ÄòKeep America Great.‚Äù One thing is for sure -- President Trump draws a crowd. With less than three weeks until Election Day, the fight is clear. Pennsylvania is arguably the most critical state to win in this election.
I urge you to get out and vote. Tell your friends and family to vote. Do everything you can to keep PA red!

#### Governor Wolf against ACB, pro-ACA üëé
Governor Wolf and his Democratic colleagues oppose President Trump‚Äôs Supreme Court Justice nominee Amy Coney Barrett. Gov. Wolf criticized Senator Toomey for entertaining the idea of considering President Trump‚Äôs nominee. The hearings began this week and in typical left-wing fashion, the Democrats attacked Judge Barrett. They shamed Judge Barrett for not answering her specific thoughts on politically charged questions. I am wondering, do the Senate Democrats and mainstream media not realize it is a Supreme Court Justice‚Äôs job to be 100% impartial?
Democrats like Gov. Wolf are pushing a lie that Republicans do not support protecting those with pre-existing conditions. It is quite interesting that a sitting governor is getting involved in the Supreme Court nomination process. Gov. Wolf spoke with Senator Casey on plans to preserve Obamacare. Wolf stated, ‚ÄúThe most important thing we can do right now to protect health care for Pennsylvanians is to protect the ACA.‚Äù Gov. Wolf should focus on the economic destruction he created with his lockdowns and restrictions instead of focusing on D.C. issues.

#### Senator Toomey supports ACBüôå
Governor Wolf will be disappointed to hear that Senator Toomey supports Judge Amy Coney Barrett for Supreme Court Justice. Judge Barrett impressively answered all the questions the Senate Judiciary Committee asked for the past three days. She had zero notes. Her qualifications are impeccable but the Democrats oppose her nomination for political reasons only. They are calling it a ‚Äúsham.‚Äù
Sen. Toomey called out the pettiness of the Senate Democrats during the hearings. He stated, ‚ÄúUnfortunately, Senate Democrats continue to embarrass themselves by insisting that the next Supreme Court Justice disregard the law and the Constitution by acting as an unelected super legislator who imposes the Democrats‚Äô preferred policy outcomes.‚Äù
Senator Toomey supports Judge Barrett‚Äôs nomination because he believes in preserving the Constitution and defending our liberties.

#### Pro-law and order candidates üö® üöî
Heather Heidelbaugh is on the campaign trail in Erie. During this stop, Heidelbaugh vowed to focus on law enforcement as attorney general. The radical left‚Äôs agenda has pushed to defund our police. Heidelbaugh wants PA district attorneys to bring solutions to rising crime rates in our cities -- unlike Josh Shapiro. Shapiro does not condemn riots in our state nor assist law enforcement in handling the violence. Shapiro is too busy preparing for a gubernatorial race in 2022.
Heidelbaugh is not the only GOP candidate supporting our police -- Sean Parnell is right there with her. Parnell recently had a ‚ÄúBack the Blue‚Äù rally and the turnout was great! Parnell challenged his opponent Conor Lamb‚Äôs silence during the riots and violence. The Democratic Party is extremely vocal about defunding the police but who do they still call when they‚Äôre in trouble? That‚Äôs right, the police.
The Republican Party supports our police officers proudly and boldly. Vote straight red to keep our state safe.

September 16, 2020

Friend,
The almighty ‚ÄúKing Wolf‚Äù was FINALLY ruled unconstitutional by a federal judge.
Governor Wolf ruled unconstitutional!
Keep Gov. Wolf in check ‚òëÔ∏è
We have lost track of just how many months Pennsylvania has been under Gov. Wolf‚Äôs executive orders.
The Trump-appointed federal judge‚Äôs ruling decided that in a crisis, executive privilege can only go so far before it turns into executive abuse.
I agree.
Gov. Wolf‚Äôs office plans to appeal the ruling. See this is the disturbing part. Shouldn‚Äôt the governor follow and respect the Constitution while listening to the people of our great Commonwealth?
By immediately deciding to repeal this decision, it is clear Gov. Wolf does NOT respect the Constitution and he does NOT listen to what the people of Pennsylvania want -- despite these two key facets making up the majority of his job description.
Gov. Wolf thinks he is untouchable. This is extremely concerning for the people of Pennsylvania.
Not to mention, Gov. Wolf believes he has been Pennsylvania‚Äôs knight in shining armor against the coronavirus. Gov. Wolf was literally pushing to legalize marijuana in the middle of a pandemic.
Instead of reopening our businesses, Wolf was walking in anti-police protests and pushing for the legalization of marijuana!
There are no words to describe how little sense this makes.
Executive privilege can only get you so far. Do you think Gov. Wolf‚Äôs executive abuse should be checked?
>>> YES! Keep Gov. Wolf‚Äôs abuse of executive power in check ‚òëÔ∏è
We, as Republicans, need to look after our Commonwealth and stand up against the radicals of the left. This should only motivate us even more to elect more conservatives to office this November.
Will you help stand up to Gov. Wolf‚Äôs unchecked abuse of power?
>>Yes, I‚Äôll chip in $25
>>Yes, I‚Äôll chip in $50
>>Yes, I‚Äôll chip in $100
>>Yes, I‚Äôll chip in a different amount
Your support enables us to build out the grassroots army we need to keep Pennsylvania red. Join us in this fight and contribute today.
Sincerely,
Vonne Andring

Chairman's Update
October 2, 2020
This is a weekly update from Pennsylvania Republican Party Chairman Lawrence Tabas filling you in on what our statewide party leaders are up to, along with relevant news pertaining to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
The Pennsylvania Republican Party is sending our best well wishes to President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump. We wish them a speedy recovery and are keeping their families in our prayers.
Let‚Äôs continue to uplift all who have been impacted by the coronavirus.
Good evening, Pennsylvania.
Recently, the Atlantic published a story riddled with false accusations against me and the Pennsylvania Republican Party. The article takes my words and twists them in typical fake news fashion. Let me be crystal clear; I want every single vote cast by Pennsylvanians to be counted fairly. I have not had conversations with the Trump administration about the state legislature appointing electors. I believe President Trump will win Pennsylvania with a clear majority. The only strategy is to get out and vote!
I am urging you all to go to the polls and cast your vote. Our Republican candidates need your support and help against the radical left and fake news media. The only way PA will go red is if you vote!

#### Governor Wolf‚Äôs dangerous policies üö®
Another week another fight between Democratic Governor Wolf and the GOP lawmakers. Gov. Wolf claims the GOP is attempting to stop him from saving lives. It seems the Democrats‚Äô favorite word of the week is ‚Äúdangerous.‚Äù It is ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù to let parents watch their children play sports. It is ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù to ease restrictions on restaurants and bars. It is ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù to let Pennsylvanians decide what is best for them.
The GOP continues to fight for small businesses and families struggling through the heavy restrictions. Senate spokeswoman Jenn Kocker reacted to Gov. Wolf‚Äôs rhetoric, ‚ÄúWolf calling the high school sports bill ‚Äòdangerous‚Äô shows how out of touch Governor Wolf really is.‚Äù Pennsylvanians want to open up the Commonwealth. Gov. Wolf should work with the PA Legislature instead of grandstanding.
It is clear Gov. Wolf‚Äôs policies are the real danger to PA‚Äôs economy.

#### Sen. Toomey leads fight against Wolf üëä
Senator Pat Toomey announced he would nominate President Trump's Supreme Court Justice pick, Amy Coney Barrett. Gov. Wolf does not support Sen. Toomey‚Äôs decision agreeing to hold nomination hearings for Judge Barrett. Gov. Wolf stated, ‚ÄúIt would be an unconscionable error to rush into a nomination when the people of Pennsylvania and the nation as a whole make clear their wishes for the future of our country in a few short weeks.‚Äù Sen. Toomey is not taking Gov. Wolf‚Äôs on this topic. Fill that seat, Toomey!
Sen. Toomey, along with other PA Republicans, is urging Gov. Wolf to allow fans to attend sporting events. Within the letter, they write, ‚ÄúThe Commonwealth‚Äôs arbitrary 250-person limit on outdoor gatherings is needlessly preventing Pennsylvanians from responsibly enjoying sports events and should be adjusted immediately.‚Äù The governor‚Äôs office has received the letter but -- not surprisingly -- dismissed it. Governor Wolf clearly doesn‚Äôt think Pennsylvanians can use common sense to watch an outdoor football game.

#### Republican candidates close in on opponents üôå
A new poll shows 5% of voters are undecided on who to vote for in the attorney general election. Attorney General Josh Shapiro only has a 3% lead over Heidelbaugh. We need to continue getting Heidelbaugh's message out to get Shapiro out. It‚Äôs time Pennsylvania has an experienced lawyer in the attorney general‚Äôs office.
Another heated race, Sean Parnell versus Rep. Conor Lamb, spared off in a debate. Lamb focused on attacking Parnell for pointing out the faults in Obamacare. Parnell attacked Lamb on his silence about the riots. He held nothing back, stating, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre out marching with ‚ÄòDefund the Police‚Äô radicals, and as far as I‚Äôm concerned, I find that reprehensible.‚Äù Parnell appealed to all voters, assuring them he will keep his promises -- unlike Lamb.

Hi there,
The 2020 election will be the most consequential in generations. The future of our country and our democracy are at stake.
With Donald Trump and the GOP in control, we‚Äôve seen rampant attacks on voting rights, huge steps back in our fight against the climate crisis, and now a complete failure of leadership in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The American people need us to act, and act fast!
That‚Äôs why today I'm personally reaching out to you to ask that you support Democrats in four key battleground states‚ÄîArizona, Florida, Nevada, and Pennsylvania‚Äîby splitting a contribution to their state Democratic parties.

Here‚Äôs why this is so important: National Republicans have been prepping for this election for years‚Äîfilling their deep pockets with special interest and dark money while breaking fundraising records across the board.
Now, they‚Äôre ready to spend big, and they have their sights set on these four critical states. They know Democrats in Pennsylvania, Nevada, Florida, and Arizona stand between them and another four years of Donald Trump.
Let‚Äôs prove them right. Donate today and ensure Democratic state parties have the resources to deliver big wins up and down the ballot on Election Day and finally get this country back on track.
I know these are difficult times for our nation, but we will get through them as we always do: by coming together, as Americans, to fight for a better future.

PA Dems
Democrats,
Harrisburg Republicans just voted to force Pennsylvanians back to work against the advice of doctors, scientists, and frontline labor leaders.
They put profits over people in the middle of a global pandemic. If not for Governor Wolf, we'd be staring down a new surge of sickness and death‚Äîall to appease CEO donors sitting miles from the factory floor.
Together, we can put these anti-science, anti-worker profiteers on notice. Chip in to turn Harrisburg back to blue in November.

Let's just speak the truth: state Republicans don't give a damn about PA workers.
They're enforcing America's lowest minimum wage. They rejected state Democrats' plans for hazard pay and sick leave. And now they want to force workers back long before it's safe.
That's a message that will resonate with voters everywhere, and it's a message we need your help getting out.
If you donate today, we'll put your gift to work educating voters about the importance of a Democratic legislature. Please contribute to flip Harrisburg in 2020!

Friends: We need Joe Biden in the White House.
It's time to unite our party around bright ideas and big solutions from every part of our coalition. Only then can we work together to defeat Trump and secure big Democratic wins at every level.
Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders both know that, and today Bernie endorsed Joe during a joint Facebook Live! Together, they outlined Joe's plan for America and the big changes we can all win together, like:
‚úì A $15 minimum wage for every worker
‚úì Making the wealthy pay their fair share
‚úì Combating GOP voter suppression
‚úì Strengthening America's labor unions
‚úì Groundbreaking student debt forgiveness
(And that's just the beginning.)
Team, Donald Trump and his party are already trying to pull us apart, but the truth is that we have far more in common than we do that divides us.
Joe Biden has the vision and experience to unite our party around our shared ideals, and he will lead America to a safer, fairer, and more prosperous union.
ADD YOUR NAME if you endorse Joe Biden for President of the United States!

Click here to find a polling
PA Dems
Fellow Democrats,
The past few days have been difficult for Pennsylvania and our entire nation. The unconscionable murder of George Floyd was only the latest painful incident in an exhausting, centuries-long string of racist violence in America.
We hear all those who are speaking out, and we stand with all those who are peacefully protesting across our commonwealth.
And while we recognize it will take far more than an election to overcome the deeply rooted racism within our country, voting remains a crucial tool in our fight for justice.
In a beautiful essay he published today, President Obama reminded us our voices must be heard everywhere‚Äîboth in the streets and in the ballot box.
So Democrats, we're writing to urge you to make your voice heard in the PA Primary tomorrow.
If you're voting from home, make a plan to return your mail ballot.
If you're going at the polls, make sure you make a plan and confirm your polling place.
And if you're ready to take the next step, sign up to call voters in your community tonight and tomorrow.
We will not right the wrongs of racism with anything less than a sustained and multiracial movement for change in our homes, in Harrisburg, and in Washington DC.
As President Obama said, we can't fix the problems plaguing our nation with activism or voting alone. We have to do both.
And with your help, we will.
Onward,
The PA Democratic Party

Michael is a professor at Lebanon Valley College and one of the region's leading environmentalists. He's running to defend public spaces, clean up local waterways, and ensure Harrisburg invests in the people of South-Central PA.
With a win, Michael will lift Dems within three seats of flipping the state senate. And to be clear, we need the majority to ensure a living wage for all Pennsylvanians, combat partisan gerrymandering, and fully fund our public programs.
This race in South-Central PA will impact every inch of our commonwealth. Can you donate to help mobilize Dauphin, Lebanon, and York counties and take back the legislature?

PA Dems
Hi everyone,
On Friday, Governor Wolf and state health officials released their plan to defeat COVID-19 and lead Pennsylvania back to prosperity.
It's a plan backed by science, data, and the needs of everyday people, and we think it's important that every Pennsylvanian read it to understand the road ahead.
* * *
READ THE PLAN
* * *
The Wolf Administration has outlined its approach in three phases: Relief for families and businesses right now, Reopening when it's safe and sensible, and Recovery to build our economy stronger than ever.
RELIEF
Before we can move forward, we have to care for ourselves and our neighbors now. That's why Governor Wolf's plan starts with steps and resources to support workers, businesses, and care providers.
If you or your loved ones could use a little help, here are some quick links to get it:
‚Üí Find food assistance.
‚Üí Learn more about unemployment benefits.
‚Üí Learn about and request student loan help.
‚Üí Seek help for mental health.
‚Üí Explore resources for businesses.
REOPENING
We all want things back to normal, but without a measured and responsible plan to get there, we risk losing more lives and all the progress we‚Äôve sacrificed for.
To safely reopen PA, Governor Wolf and Health Secretary Levine have outlined six standards we must follow along the way.
RECOVERY
Finally, Governor Wolf's plan charts a course for Pennsylvania's future beyond COVID-19. And rather than return to the past, his agenda aims for a commonwealth stronger and more equitable than ever before.
The COVID-19 recovery plan outlines dozens of initiatives to get families and business back up to speed, while ensuring we're better prepared for future crises. Highlights include:
‚Üí A $12 minimum wage, gradually rising to $15/hour
‚Üí Expanded sick leave, family leave, and hazard pay
‚Üí Expanded student loan support/forgiveness
‚Üí Substantial new investments in job creation
‚Üí Additional funding/grants for small businesses
* * *
Know this, fellow Democrats: Together, we can defeat COVID-19 and emerge even stronger on the other side.
The Plan For Pennsylvania gives us the best opportunity at doing so. Thank you for supporting it and the Democratic leaders we need to see it through!
All our best,
Sincer√© Harris

This will be quick, team. We're writing to ask if you can donate to help flip four PA Senate seats and nine PA House seats needed for a blue majority. PA Republicans' political games are endangering frontline workers, and it's vital we have the resources to tell that story.
* * *
INSTANT DONATE $20.20
* * *
Here's what, with your help, we're going to tell PA voters...
First, Harrisburg Republicans blocked Democrats' plan to ensure paid sick leave, hazard pay, and proper safety gear for frontline workers.
Then, Republicans voted on party lines to force Pennsylvanians back to work in the middle of a pandemic.
And today, Republican lawmakers promoted and took part in dangerous protests that defied expert warnings, social distancing orders, and the pleas of healthcare workers.
Bottom Line: Harrisburg Republicans are rejecting science and putting PA workers at risk. We have to flip the majority in Harrisburg, and we only need four PA Senate and nine PA House seats to do it.

PA Dems
Happy Earth Day, fellow Democrats.
Today, as we celebrate the natural beauty of our commonwealth, we must also reflect on the need to address the urgent threats posed by climate change.
It's on all of us to keep up the good fight for clean energy and climate research. We must do all we can to protect our air and water, to preserve our oceans and waterways, and to save our forests and public lands so future generations of Pennsylvanians can marvel at the natural world around us.
Democrats know climate change is among our planet's greatest challenges, and we want to see America become the world‚Äôs clean energy superpower while creating millions of good-paying jobs.
Unfortunately, Donald Trump and his allies in Washington and Harrisburg are hell-bent on ignoring science.
Our planet can't survive four more years of Republican anti-science policy. That's why we have to work day and night to flip the Pennsylvania legislature and to defeat Donald Trump in November.
It will take all of us‚Äîstudents, scientists, and citizens‚Äîacting together to address the threat of climate change and keep our planet healthy for generations to come. Please join us.
All the best,

Fellow Democrats ‚Äî The Republican Party is using a global pandemic to suppress the vote everywhere they can.
In Pennsylvania...
Speaker Mike Turzai flagrantly put voters and democracy at risk when he forced special elections to take place amidst social distancing last month.
In Wisconsin...
Republicans fought all the way to the WI Supreme Court to stop safety measures in the WI primary. Then, they fought all the way to the US Supreme Court to disenfranchise mail-in voters.
And in Washington DC...
Trump admitted on live TV that he opposes making voting easier because ""you'd never have a Republican elected in this country again.""
But thanks to Democratic leadership, Republicans can't stop you from voting by mail in PA. Request your mail-in ballot online right now!

Democrats ‚Äî In a groundbreaking victory for LGBTQ+ Americans and allies, the Supreme Court just ruled that it's illegal to fire someone for being gay or transgender!
This is a major step forward for LGBTQ+ rights‚Äîone that we'll surely celebrate every Pride Month from here on. Still, we need to be clear that this does not guarantee full equality under the law.
In Pennsylvania, it's still legal to deny housing or other public services to LGBTQ+ people, and LGBTQ+ healthcare disparities are widening under Donald Trump. We need legislative action in Harrisburg to right those obvious wrongs.
The PA Fairness Act would do so. It's a Democratic bill that's been awaiting a vote in Harrisburg for years, but GOP leaders refuse even to allow debate on it, let alone pass it.
So today, send a message to Harrisburg Republicans: LGBTQ+ equality can not wait. Sign our petition to demand a vote on the PA Fairness Act and commit to voting out Republicans who oppose equality!

Slavery didn't end quietly with the Emancipation Proclamation, or even once the Civil War finished, friends.
For too many Black Americans, freedom was denied long after Lincoln signed it into law. For the people of Galveston, whose liberation sparks today's holiday, it was thirty long and painful months before freedom promised became freedom realized.
And for millions of Black Americans today‚Äîthose wrongly imprisoned, unjustly oppressed, or denied their basic humanity‚Äîtrue freedom and equality still feel a long way away.

In our commonwealth, June 19th sadly marks another milestone of racial injustice. Two years ago today, a young Black Pennsylvanian named Antwon Rose Jr. was killed by police in Pittsburgh.
We know, now more than ever, that his death is part of a terrible pattern of police brutality against People of Color across America. As Democrats, we're committed to fighting for justice in Harrisburg, Washington DC, and towns across PA.
Partners like the ACLU and Black Lives Matter are crucial to the success of that fight. In honor of Juneteenth and Antwon Rose, please split a donation among them to continue the fight for justice in PA.

Hi Democrats,
Two days after promising a special session to address police brutality and racial injustice, Speaker Turzai announced today that he'll leave office on June 15th. He did not say whether his pledge to allow votes on police reform will be fulfilled.
And just like that, Pennsylvanians' hard-earned progress towards equal justice is thrown into doubt by unreliable, self-centered GOP leadership.
The only way to guarantee progress is by flipping Harrisburg to give Democrats the gavel! Chip in $20.20 today to help Dems win nine PA House and four PA Senate seats.

INSTANT DONATE $20.20
or chip in another amount
* * *
Turzai spent his final days in Harrisburg pushing extremist bills that endanger workers and undermine Governor Wolf's leadership during a pandemic. But after promising action on police reform bills that voters actually want, he's suddenly retiring and leaving progress unfulfilled.
Undoubtedly, PA House Republicans will replace Turzai with a leader just as craven and beholden to corporate interests.
Friends, keeping men like Mike Turzai from setting the agenda in our legislature is why we need to flip Harrisburg in November.
Together, let's make sure every PA voter knows the opportunity at hand in legislative races this year. Please donate to power organizing, outreach, and advertising to flip the statehouse!

It's not right, and it doesn't have to be this way! Democrats have a plan, the HEROES Act, to extend enhanced unemployment benefits and invest millions into PA communities fighting COVID-19.
ADD YOUR NAME to tell DC Republicans that we need to pass the HEROES Act!
* * *
SIGN THE PETITION
* * *
The HEROES Act extends enhanced unemployment benefits for millions of people who can't safely work because of the pandemic. It also:
‚úì  Sends another round of direct cash payments to everyday Americans
‚úì  Provides hazard pay for essential workers putting their lives on the line
‚úì  Halts foreclosures, evictions, and debt collection for 120 days or more
‚úì  Cancels up to $10,000 in student debt and freezes loan payments
‚úì  Invests billions in hospitals and local governments to fight COVID-19
American families should not be forced to choose between safety and financial security in a pandemic. Congressional Dems' bold action would allow us all to focus on what matters most: beating COVID-19 together.
Sign our petition to demand that Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell, and PA Republicans in Congress get to work! It's time to vote on and pass the HEROES Act.

PA Dems
Hi Fellow Democrats,
June is Pride Month, when we celebrate our thriving LGBTQ+ community and the movement that began with the 1969 Stonewall Uprising, led by pioneering LGBTQ+ activists including transgender women of color Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera.
Those brave women laid the groundwork in our fight for equality in the face of violence and discrimination. It's because of their fight and their courage that I can celebrate the first anniversary of marriage to my partner next week!
Over 50 years on, the LGBTQ+ community is a vibrant and vital part of our commonwealth in towns large and small. And while we‚Äôve seen great strides since 1969, we must remain vigilant and continue to protect LGBTQ+ Pennsylvanians against discriminatory attacks from the right.
Together, we can elect Democrats who will step up to make sure LGBTQ+ folks are free to live authentic lives without fear of hate and violence.
The upcoming November election is our chance to flip the legislature and elect Democrats up and down the ballot‚Äîand to ensure we can protect every LGBTQ+ Pennsylvanian from the GOP‚Äôs attacks on our humanity.
If you believe in a future free from discrimination based on who you love or how you live authentically, commit to vote for Democrats at every level of our government this November.
From the state house to the White House, our elected officials have a duty to protect millions of LGBTQ+ Americans‚Äîlet‚Äôs make sure we elect folks ready to fight for our Democratic values.
In solidarity,
Rich Schweikart

Harrisburg Update | PADems.com,info@padems.com,It's Mike Turzai 2.0!,"For every corrupt and dangerous stunt Mike Turzai led this year, the new PA House Speaker, Bryan Cutler, was right there behind him. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
PA Dems
Folks ‚Äî A week after Mike Turzai left the capitol to cash in as a corporate lobbyist, Harrisburg Republicans selected his protege, Bryan Cutler, to be the next Speaker of the PA House.
For every corrupt stunt Turzai led this year, Cutler was right behind him. As Majority Leader, Cutler rallied the GOP behind a far-right agenda to sabotage Governor Wolf's work against coronavirus, allegedly going as far as covering up a COVID-19 case in his caucus.
And just like Turzai, Cutler is against raising minimum wage, against LGBTQ+ equality, and against a woman's right to choose.
In short, Republicans' new boss is same as the old boss: reckless, right-wing, regressive. Let's make his tenure a short one.
Invest in PA Democrats' Flip Harrisburg Fund to turn the PA House blue and make Bryan Cutler a six-month speaker!

Donald Trump, Pat Toomey, and Harrisburg Republicans are united against their newest common enemy. And no, it's not the virus that has killed nearly 90,000 Americans.
They've focused their attacks on Governor Tom Wolf and his administration that's trying to protect PA lives.
Rather than work on bipartisan solutions to a crisis impacting us all, the GOP has spent weeks undermining and verbally assaulting Democratic leadership. That's why we're launching new initiatives to show that voters stand firmly on the side of science and safety.
Get started by adding your name in support of social distancing, science, and a safe, steady reopening. Sign on now stand with Governor Wolf!

ADD YOUR NAME ‚Üí

With Donald Trump in Allentown today, we're expecting a new wave of attacks and disinformation against Governor Wolf and Secretary Levine. Here's what we've already beat back.
APRIL 15
Harrisburg Republicans try overriding COVID-19 mitigation efforts but are vetoed by Governor Wolf.
APRIL 20
GOP legislators speak at far-right ‚ÄúRe-Open PA‚Äù protests, where they make bizarre and misleading statements.
MAY 4
Republican Rep. Cris Dush, who is up for reelection in November, makes an outrageous claim likening the Wolf Administration to the Nazi Regime.
MAY 9
Republican Rep. Mike Jones, who is up for reelection in November, packs 150+ maskless people into an event where he claims that Republicans have Governor Wolf ""on the ropes.""
MAY 11
Donald Trump hits send on an inflammatory Tweet demanding ""freedom"" for Pennsylvania and attempting to undermine PA's safe, science-based reopening.
MAY 11
Twenty-five Harrisburg Republicans write a letter urging local officials to ignore the advice of medical experts and defy Governor Wolf's lawful orders.
Democrats, these partisan theatrics, which do nothing to help us defeat COVID-19, are sure to continue until we defeat the GOP in November, but we can take the wind from their sails if we stand up and push back right now.
Start by adding your name to say you support Governor Wolf and Secretary Levine's plan for a safe, science-based reopening‚Äînot the GOP recklessness that will only extend this crisis.

PA Dems
Fellow Democrats ‚Äî Under the failed leadership of Donald Trump, Americans are faced with three crises at once: a devastating pandemic, a nationwide reawakening to systemic racism, and the greatest economic crash since the Great Depression.
In times like this, our party and our nation need leaders who are smart, tough, and ready for action. That's precisely why Joe Biden chose Kamala Harris to be the next Vice President!
The daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants, Kamala has talked often about her experiences growing up as a Black girl. Those experiences made her stronger, and make her the kind of leader we need to beat back bigotry and injustice.
As a lawyer and Attorney General, Kamala led one of the biggest legal departments in the nation‚Äîwhere she was a powerful advocate for people in taking on the big banks and protecting women and kids from abuse.
And as a US Senator, she has been on the front lines of the fight against Donald Trump. We've all seen her fight fearlessly to hold the White House accountable, stand up to a Justice Department run amok, and speak out powerfully against extremist nominations.
Joe has often said he needs a Vice President that can lead with him on day one. Kamala Harris is ready and able.
With our support, the Biden-Harris ticket will lead Pennsylvania Back to Blue in November and rebuild America better than before. Please split a donation between their campaign and ours to power a complete Democratic victory.
If you've already saved payment info with ActBlue Express, your contribution will be processed immediately. Your gift will be split evenly between the PA Democratic Party and Joe Biden.

BREAKING | PADems.com,info@padems.com,Republicans want to impeach Governor Wolf.,"Fellow Democrats -- A far-right group of Harrisburg Republicans, led by infamous bigot Daryl Metcalfe, just announced their intention to try impeaching Governor Wolf for ""shutting down""
PA Dems
Fellow Democrats ‚Äî A far-right group of Harrisburg Republicans, led by infamous bigot Rep. Daryl Metcalfe, just announced their intention to impeach Governor Wolf.
The impeachment resolution they're circulating is baseless‚Äîone more desperate ploy to treat COVID-19 as a political game rather than a health emergency. While Dems wage war on coronavirus, the GOP wages war on science, reality, and political boogeymen.
That's why flipping the PA House and the PA Senate is just as important as beating Trump this fall. If you stand with Governor Tom Wolf, please donate to replace the extremist Republicans trying to impeach him with Democrats who'll work with him.

If you've already saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your contribution will be processed immediately:
$20$43$100OTHER
* * *
Let's be very clear: this impeachment effort will accomplish nothing. Harrisburg Republicans do not have the votes, thanks to the blue wave your donations and hard work fueled in 2018!
And the Republicans' motivation runs totally contrary to reality. Our commonwealth is already reopening, and it's doing so in a smart, science-based way that's saving lives!
Harrisburg Republicans, in all their ignorance and hate, would rather follow Donald Trump into a second wave of sickness and death than allow Governor Wolf to do his job. We deserve so much better.
So if you're able, folks, please make a donation of $20.20‚Äîor whatever you can afford‚Äîto take back Harrisburg. We only need nine PA House seats and four PA Senate seats to do it.

PA Dems
Democrats,
Speaker Mike Turzai, the most powerful Republican in the legislature, just announced he won't run for re-election. Good riddance.
Turzai isn't riding off into the sunset. He is running away from a tough re-election campaign that he fears will end in a Democratic majority. He's also leaving PA House Republicans leaderless, on the defensive, and without their best fundraiser.
Team, the hard work of Pennsylvanians like you has state Republicans reeling! If you're able, please chip in $20.20 to finish the job and flip the PA House.
* * *
INSTANT DONATE $20.20
or chip in another amount
* * *
Democrats are tantalizingly close to flipping the legislature in time to draw fair electoral maps, raise the minimum wage, and fully fund our schools in 2021.
Turzai is the ninth Republican representative to announce that he won't run for re-election. With only nine seats needed to flip the PA House, we can now take the majority without even beating a single GOP incumbent.
Let's ensure every PA voter knows the opportunity at hand in state and local races this year. Please donate to power organizing, outreach, and advertising to flip the PA legislature!

PA Dems
Hi Democrats,
All Pennsylvanians voting early or by mail must seal their ballot in TWO envelopes: the smaller, white secrecy envelope and then the larger return envelope! Voters also need to complete and sign their voter declaration on the back of the return envelope.
Voters who do not do this will not have their ballot counted in this crucial election!
Let's make sure every vote is counted by sharing this info with all the PA voters you know. It‚Äôs on each of us to ensure every citizen is informed and to fight for every vote!
If you have any questions about voting, visit [[URL REDACTED]] for complete information on all three ways to vote in Pennsylvania: by mail, early in-person, or on Election Day. You can also call us at 833-PA-VOTES (833-728-6837).
Thanks,

Just last week, our team mobilized nearly 500 volunteers to make over 125,000 phone calls to Democrats!
ADVERTISING
PA Dems recently launched one of our biggest digital ad buys ever. We're hitting millions of computer screens, phones, and social feeds across PA with one clear message: Go. Vote. By. Mail.

PARTNERSHIPS
From county parties to activist groups to your local neighbors association, our partners are firing on all cylinders to educate, organize, and mobilize their community for mail-in voting.
Online trainings, resources, and virtual meet-ups are the tools we're using to cultivate relationships and conversation in every ZIP code.
PRESS
Local press and their readers are hungry for information about voting in the midst of a viral outbreak. The PA Dems' communications team is working double-time to educate journalists and boost our visibility in media outlets all over the state.

Even in these early stages, our efforts to boost voting by mail show promising results! Democrats have opened up sizable margins in the number of mail-in ballots requested.
We can't slow down, though! Rather, we need to keep testing new and innovative ways to extend our advantage and grow the PA electorate.
Please donate now to help do that, team. There are still millions of potential at-home voters we haven't reached yet, and we need your help mobilizing them!

There are under fifty days until polls close on November 3rd and just a few days until the first early votes are cast.

Friends ‚Äî A Trump-appointed federal judge just decided he won't hear Donald Trump's lawsuit against mail-in voting until the PA Supreme Court has ruled first.
That's a big win for PA voters, and a huge blow to Trump's voter suppression scheme. Now, the PA Democratic Party's countersuit that protects mail-in votes and ensures every ballot gets counted becomes even more powerful.
But we are not out of the woods yet, team! It's now even more crucial that we prevail in state court and prepare for whatever schemes Trump may deploy on Election Day.
Please rush a donation to support all PA Dems' efforts to protect your vote. We're taking the fight to Trump in court AND building a massive team of poll watchers, poll workers, and voting rights advocates on the ground!

PA Dems
Democrats,
Joe Biden is going to be our nominee to defeat Donald Trump and become the next President of the United States.
Senator Bernie Sanders has suspended his campaign, allowing our party to unite around Vice President Biden. I'm deeply grateful for Bernie and his supporters‚Äîand every presidential candidate whose ideas and coalitions have strengthened our cause!
Bernie's supporters should know there is always a place for their movement and ideas in the Democratic Party. Together, let's keep up the fight for progressive values like a living wage, quality healthcare, and a commonwealth that puts working people first.
I invite anyone who shares our values to join our team electing Democrats at every level in November. Add your name if you're with us in this fight!
* * *
I'M VOTING BLUE!
* * *
Joe Biden is an honest, decent man who will restore the voice of everyday people in the White House. As Vice President, he helped lift our economy from recession, rescue the auto industry, and extend healthcare to millions of people, including those with preexisting conditions.
Behind Joe, Democrats can expand healthcare access, fix our top-down economy, safeguard our elections, and create a safer, more equitable nation.
No president can do it alone, though! That's why we must remain focused on ALL of the battles ahead‚Äîlike flipping the PA legislature, expanding our US House majority, and re-electing our statewide officers.
The task ahead is bigger than any one candidate, election, or office. Our movement will be one to reshape Pennsylvania at every level, in every community, and for every voter.
Fellow Democrats, let's work as one to make Joe Biden president, flip the PA legislature, and secure sweeping Democratic victories at every level. Please sign on if you're ready to unite and lead PA Back To Blue!
Together we win,
Nancy Patton Mills
Chairwoman | PA Democratic Party

Democrats,
The most unwelcome thing in my inbox all week was this email: a forwarded note from Team Trump outlining their plans to engage millions of supporters nationwide this weekend.
And I'll be honest: I have no doubt this weekend will be a big success for them.
All we can do is make sure that today, and every day from here until November, is just a little bit more productive for us. If we all work together, I have no doubt that will happen.
It will take everyone playing a part, though.
So team, we're calling on you to take action from home right now! Click here to start calling voters instantly‚Äîor pick from upcoming shifts happening today and on Tuesday.
Every call you make could bring us one vote closer to victory in November. Let's win this thing, together.

Hi Democrats,
There are four vacant seats in the PA House of Representatives right now, and we intend to fill every one with a Democrat in upcoming special elections!
The open seats are all over Pennsylvania: in bright blue cities, deep in GOP territory, and in some of the ""swingiest"" counties of America. Every race is winnable, though, and PA Democrats will fight for every vote in every ZIP code.
A lot will go into winning these races: organizing, ad buys, voter mail, and tons of elbow grease. Like in most special elections, funds will be tight, and candidates may be forced to cut back in key areas.
But team, we can give PA Democrats what they need to win in every county. Donate now to help win these special elections and flip the PA legislature!
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your monthly donation will be set immediately:

PA Dems
We're counting on top Democrats like you to keep voters informed. After reading this update, please fwd/share it with all the PA Democrats you know.
Hey voters ‚Äî All mail ballots need to be in election officials' hands, or a dropbox, by 8 PM tonight. If you still have your ballot or never received it, you have three options to cast your vote!
* * *
Return it by hand to your county.
To avoid lines at the polls and ensure timely delivery, the best thing you can do with your ballot is return it in person! Take your ballot straight to your county's elections office, a dropbox, or a satellite voting center before 8 PM.
Note that dropboxes and elections offices close promptly at 8 PM, even if voters are still in line at that time.
FIND DROPOFF POINT
Vote at a polling place by ""cancelling"" your ballot.
If you have your ballot in hand but cannot get to a dropoff point, you may take the ballot and envelopes to your polling place to be cancelled. Then, you may vote on a machine as you normally would.
To prevent long lines to vote and added work for poll workers, we only recommend this option if you cannot reach a dropbox or elections office.
CONFIRM POLLING PLACE
Vote at a polling place with a provisional ballot.
If your ballot is missing, damaged, or cancelled, you may vote with a provisional ballot at your Election Day in-person polling place. All polling locations will be open 7 AM ‚Äì 8 PM.
CONFIRM POLLING PLACE
Request additional help if you can't travel.
Many voters are unable to visit an elections office or polling location due to limited mobility, medical reasons, and the risk of COVID-19. If that describes you or someone you care for, call 833-728-6837 to make a personalized plan based on your needs and location.
* * *
We do not recommend returning your ballot by mail after October 26th, as it may not be received in time.

PA Dems
friends ‚Äî At a hearing of the PA General Assembly yesterday, GOP Representative Cris Dush made a truly vile remark likening Governor Wolf's COVID-19 response to the regimes of Hitler and Stalin.
‚ÄúMore and more, I go back to the German Democratic Nationalist Socialist Party, the Nazi Party. I go to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the USSR. This is a socialist playbook.‚Äù
A man who compares lifesaving mitigation efforts to the Holocaust and other crimes against humanity does not belong in state government, and party leaders who harbor him do not deserve the gavel.
Please make an urgent donation to replace Cris Dush and other Republican extremists with principled Democratic leaders.

Sadly, Dush's remarks are just the latest in a long list of ridiculous GOP reactions to the ongoing pandemic:
MARCH 17
Speaker Mike Turzai refuses to postpone special elections despite social distancing measures, forcing voters to choose between their health and their vote.
MARCH 24
Rep. Stephanie Borowicz calls for a ""Day of Humiliation and Prayer"" and calls the coronavirus a ‚Äúpunishment inflicted upon us for our presumptuous sins.‚Äù
APRIL 15
Harrisburg Republicans vote to reopen PA businesses despite pleas from concerned workers and dire warnings from public health experts; Governor Wolf vetoes their reckless bill.
APRIL 20
GOP legislators attend far-right ‚ÄúRe-Open PA‚Äù protests in Harrisburg, ignoring public health experts and making various bizarre, misleading statements.
These actions make one thing very clear: The PA Republican Party welcomes extremists and science deniers no better than their failed leader in the White House.
If you donate today, we'll put your gift to work educating voters about the importance of flipping the PA House and PA Senate. Please contribute to end Republican extremism at the polls.

Hi Democrats,
In 2016, Donald Trump won Pennsylvania by just 44,292 votes out of 6,000,000+ ballots cast. That's a difference of 1/135 voters.
On the campaign trail, we call that a field margin: those few, make-or-break votes only won by mobilizing reluctant and deeply undecided voters. In 2020, it's on you and me to make sure we don't lose by the field margin again.

PA Dems
Democrats ‚Äî The fight for free and fair elections amid a global pandemic is escalating quickly here in PA.
FIRST, Governor Wolf and a bipartisan coalition of legislators passed mail-in voting in PA, and our Vote By Mail campaign helped over one million Democrats vote from home in the PA Primary.
THEN, Donald Trump and PA Republicans got scared. They sued to throw out votes and make mail-in voting harder this fall.
NOW, we're taking the fight right back to them, with a countersuit of our own and the biggest voter protection team PA has ever seen.
Please chip in to fund our Voter Protection program, our Vote By Mail campaign, and our lawsuit to protect and expand at-home voting rights. We can't let Trump stop PA from voting!
* * *
INSTANT DONATE $20.20
or chip in another amount
* * *
Voter suppression is a cornerstone of Donald Trump's reelection strategy because Republicans know the easier it is for people to vote, the harder it is for them to hold power.
They'll do everything they can to disenfranchise PA voters, especially those in Black and Brown communities. And their efforts will be very well funded by billionaires, big business, and special interests.
We can't fight back without investments from donors like you. Our legal fees, voter advocacy programs, and digital outreach is largely funded by donations of $10 or $20 or $50 at a time.
Help protect everyone's right to vote this fall, friends! Make a donation to PA Democrats' Voter Protection programs today.

PA Dems
Voters ‚Äî In Pennsylvania's first ever election with no-excuse mail voting, our state and local election officials have performed incredibly.
They safely delivered an unexpected surge of over a million ballots and established well over one hundred ballot dropoff locations statewide, all while navigating several crises and resistance from some GOP leaders.
Still, we recognize that in some rare cases mail ballots were damaged or didn't arrive in time. Rest assured ‚Äî If you were approved for a mail ballot you can not return, you may still vote by requesting a provisional ballot at your assigned polling place.

VOTER ASSISTANCE HOTLINE: 833-728-6837

We understand voting in person is not ideal, and we only ask that you do so if you feel entirely safe. We don't recommend voting in person if you feel sick, or if anyone in your household has a severe health issue.
If you do decide to vote in person, here are some ways you can protect yourself and others at the polls:
1. Wear a mask at all times while at the polling place.
2. Wash your hands immediately before and after voting.
3. Bring your own pen (black or blue ballpoint) to fill in the provisional ballot.
4. Vote during low-traffic periods, such as the mid-morning or mid-afternoon, if your schedule allows it.
5. Be mindful of personal space. Limit your contact and try to keep six feet between you and other people.
If you have any additional questions about casting a provisional ballot, please call our Voter Support Hotline: 1-833-PAVOTES. Voting advocates will be standing by for your calls until 9 PM tonight and all day on Primary Day.
We'll spend the next several months working diligently to make Vote By Mail run even smoother in the fall. For now, please make your voice heard by heading to your assigned polling location tomorrow and requesting a Provisional Ballot.
Kindest regards,
Kay Yu

Hi folks,
Through Pennsylvania's first ever Vote By Mail campaign, PA Dems are building a HUGE advantage that could make all the difference this fall. To date, more than 850,000 Democrats have signed up to vote from home‚Äîrelative to just 400,000 Republicans.
Our 450,000+ ballot advantage has state Republicans on edge and has drawn attention from Reuters, who attributed the gap to Trump's Vote By Mail conspiracy theories. They give him too much credit, though.
Democrats, our early mail-in ballot dominance is built entirely on Democratic organizing and enthusiasm!
* * *
‚ÄúStatewide, Democrats have sent texts to over a million supporters, logged 500,000 calls, and hosted over 1,200 attendees in online training sessions, according to the state party.‚Äù ‚ÄîREUTERS
* * *
PA Dems volunteers, partners, and candidates have already engaged millions of Pennsylvanians to get out the vote. And the work we're all doing now will give our candidates a big head start in November.
That lead could vanish in an instant, though. Now that Republicans have seen our success, they're certain to strike back in a major way, and Team Trump has nearly unlimited resources with which to do so.
Help PA Democrats maintain and expand our VBM lead! Make a contribution today to power statewide Vote By Mail efforts.

PA Dems
Fellow Pennsylvanians,
In her role as PA Secretary of Health, Dr. Rachel Levine has guided our Commonwealth through a health crisis with wisdom, with empathy, and with honesty. Doubtless, she has saved many lives.
All the while, Dr. Levine has faced cruel and unnecessary harassment. Transphobia has no place in PA, and when it shows itself we must act to stamp it out‚Äîmeeting hate with kindness and intolerance with empathy.
In that spirit, please sign a thank you card and send a few words of encouragement to Dr. Levine today!
* * *
SIGN THE CARD ‚Üí
* * *
We will share your thoughts and well wishes with Dr. Levine and her staff in thanks for strong leadership during scary times.
Thank you,
The PA Democratic Party
SHOW YOUR SUPPORT FOR SECRETARY LEVINE

PA Dems
Wow, team! What a week.
We heard inspiring, sometimes heartbreaking, stories from Americans of every background, color, age, creed, and identity.
We made history and shattered glass ceilings when we nominated Kamala Harris as the first Black woman on a presidential ticket.
We officially named Joseph R. Biden, son of Scranton, our Democratic nominee to unite America and restore the soul of our nation!
And all week long, Pennsylvanians told us over and over: ""I finally feel like I have hope.""
Friends, we can't let this energy fizzle. Let's take this hope and love and energy and channel it into the biggest weekend of action that Pennsylvania has ever seen!
Volunteer this weekend to help unite America behind Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and Democrats at every level.
There are only 75 days until polls close on November 3rd. What we do with those days will quite literally determine the type of nation we are to become.
And we need you, friends. Even if you hate making phone calls. Even if technology gives you fits. Even if you swear that you can't make a difference. You can.
You can be the difference between four more years of hate and lies or renewed hope for America.
Sign up to take action this weekend, and together let's win this Fight for the Soul of Our Nation by electing Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.

Hey folks,
The weather is cool and crisp. The foliage is gorgeous. And Democrats all over PA are making a triumphant return to knocking doors ‚Äî with safety and social distancing measures in place!
Many of you have been eagerly awaiting a safe return to in-person voter contact, and now that time has come! Sign up tonight to knock doors and talk with voters about Joe, Kamala, and down-ballot Dems this weekend.

SIGN UP TO CANVASS
* * *
Safety has been a top concern for our organizing team all year, and we're taking five key steps to make knocking doors safe and comfortable for volunteers and voters alike:
1) Training every volunteer on COVID-19 safety
2) Requiring symptom surveys & temperature checks
3) Closely following CDC, state, and local guidance
4) Providing masks/PPE free of charge
5) Notifying voters when canvassers may arrive
And if you have limited mobility or are in a high-risk group, we still have plenty of virtual ways to get involved! Click here to call or text voters from home.
With under four weeks left until Election Day, it's on every last one of us to do the most we can. The Soul of Our Nation depends on it.

Democrats,
The Republican Party is using its national convention to paint a dark and disjointed picture of America. With each extreme speaker they roll out, the GOP further falsifies our agenda, rewrites Trump's dismal record, and papers over the crises gripping our nation.
It's enough to make you want to scream, but screaming won't help end this national nightmare. Only organizing can do that!
The best way to counter RNC lies is to commit to having hard conversations in your community. Volunteer this weekend to talk with voters near you about the Democrats on their ballot!

TAKE ACTION ‚Üí

There are under 70 days until polls close on November 3rd and under three weeks until early votes are cast.
That means we have extremely limited time to set the record straight and show swing voters what Dems really stand for: justice, equality, and a better life for ALL people.
You can be the difference between four more years of these hate and lies or renewed hope for America.
Sign up to take action this weekend, and together let's win this Fight for the Soul of Our Nation by electing Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.

As many of you know, we only need to flip 9 seats to flip the state house for only the second time since 2000. Our races are getting national attention because of your support!
Earlier this month we participated in a Day of Action with the most important legislative chambers in the country to highlight our key down ballot races. Groups from Washington, DC to California are chipping in to help us flip the Pennsylvania House of Representatives. On our day of giving, grassroots support came from across the nation -- the average contribution was less than 24 dollars.
Tomorrow is our final fundraising reporting deadline before Election Day. We need to raise $4,786 in less than 48 hours to reach our goal. Whether it‚Äôs $100.00 or $10.00, your support goes directly to the local Democrats in Pennsylvania that need it the most. We can do this, but we need your support.
Thank you,

Bad news -- We need to raise $3,876 before MIDNIGHT tonight.
The third quarter ends tonight at 11:59 PM. This is our final quarterly fundraising deadline before Election Day on November 3rd. We need to raise $3,876 before October 1st in order to enter the final 30 days of the campaign strong.
Republicans and their Washington allies have spent millions of dollars attacking and lying about our members and candidates on TV. They know they are misleading and manipulating voters. House Republicans will do anything to hold their power in Harrisburg, even if it means distorting the records and accomplishments of our members and candidates.
The money you donate stays in Pennsylvania and will be used to stop the negative Republican smear campaign. We need to set the record straight\--and to do that, we need the resources to communicate. If we miss this goal, we will enter the final month of the campaign with limited resources to reach voters as they are making their final decisions. Republicans know that our pathway to a Democratic majority depends on grassroots contributions. They are hoping that you‚Äôll miss this deadline!
Thank you for your continued support as we enter the final month of this campaign!

Good morning, folks ‚Äì
Our team is working on the front lines to elect Democrats, but corporate special interests and high-dollar Republican donors try to undercut us at every turn.
But I‚Äôve got three pieces of really good news.
1. In 2018, we won BIG: we flipped 14 seats in the Pennsylvania House. Ten years ago, a victory like that was unimaginable.
2. We won the popular vote by a LANDSLIDE. That means that we already have a huge base of strong Democrats like you, who can join us to win in 2020.
3. We can flip the House if we win 9 more seats. Let me repeat that: Nine. More. Seats. That‚Äôs all it takes to win a majority and make real change for working families in Pennsylvania.
For the first time in a long time, we have a clear path toward winning this race. But we‚Äôll need to buckle down, work smart, and get every single Democrat (like you!) on our team.
We don‚Äôt have a minute to waste.
So, are you in? Chip in a few dollars to our FLIP 2020 FUND:

Dear friends,
I‚Äôm a miner‚Äôs son from Clarks Summit, PA. My dad passed away suddenly when I was 7, leaving my mom Bessie to raise five children alone. She worked hard to put food on the table and raise us well.
I ended up earning a scholarship to Columbia where I played football and later married my law school sweetheart. Early in my career, I served as a Public Defender in Dauphin County and an Assistant District Attorney in Allegheny County, getting a first-hand look at all sides of our legal system.
Now that I‚Äôm the Democratic Leader of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, I know I‚Äôll never forget where I came from.
Every one of my colleagues has a story like this: a home town, a working family, a reason they‚Äôre in this fight. It‚Äôs our job to represent our neighbors, the people who keep this state going, the folks who don‚Äôt feel like they have a seat at the table.
We get it. Because we‚Äôve been there.
Our House Democratic Campaign Committee is working around the clock to flip the House blue so we can make real, positive changes for regular folks ‚Äì not big business and special interests.
We don‚Äôt have a long list of wealthy donors, so we need your support. Will you chip in $5 to stand with us?

I‚Äôm reaching out from Harrisburg because I need your help.
As a member of the House Appropriations Committee, I help shape our state‚Äôs budget. Every day, I fight to strengthen unions and worker protections, fairly fund public schools and increase Pre-K access, and build an equitable and just future for Allegheny County.
I am proud of the progress we have made. But I know how much more we could do with a Democratic majority.
Will you chip in $20.20 to flip the House? ‚Üí
The Republican Party in our state has one priority: obstruction.
Wasting taxpayer time and money. Throwing away good ideas. Blocking Governor Wolf‚Äôs proposals. This is their playbook.
And they say WE don‚Äôt get things done!

Every dollar that we raise is going right back out the door to reach undecided voters who will likely be making their final decision on Election Day.
Don‚Äôt pay attention to the polls -- House Republicans still have a strong shot at holding onto their majority in the state house. A decade ago, Republicans drew gerrymandered maps in these districts so they would never lose control of their majority -- we are simply just going against the odds.
In the final week, we are running out of time to reach voters in our most valuable and important seats across PA.

Taylor Brown,info@pasenatedems.com,A lifetime of service,"Friend,
I‚Äôm checking in to tell you about another one of our incredible Senators up for election this year.
Senator Jim Brewster has been serving Pennsylvanians for twenty-five years - first on McKeesport City Council, then as Mayor of McKeesport, and for the past ten years as state Senator.
[Chip in now to support Senator Brewster >>]
In the Senate, Jim has sponsored legislation that has brought education funding to his district and infrastructure investments to revitalize post-industrial communities. He has championed legislation to support workers and their families and was instrumental in bringing changes to laws that affect our local sportsmen and sportswomen.
He was one of the first Senators to address the Covid-19 pandemic with a detailed six-point plan he sent to the Governor in mid-March. He has continued to be a leader during the ever-changing crisis, prioritizing the security of our communities and workers, and introducing plans to exempt federal stimulus payments from state and local taxes.
We need Jim Brewster in the Senate to keep fighting for us in Allegheny and Westmoreland Counties.
Will you chip in $25, $50, or whatever you can to support Senator Brewster
and the SDCC‚Äôs efforts to protect our Democratic Senators facing reelection this year?
Thank you for supporting our Democratic incumbents!

M. Rose,info@pasenatedems.com,Our Senators,"Friend,
Over the past couple of weeks, we‚Äôve shared some of the partisan tricks the Republicans in Harrisburg are using to pass legislation that would put Pennsylvania workers in harm's way and limit access to reproductive health care for women.
Our members are fighting hard against these dangerous proposals and we think they deserve some recognition. Eight of our members are up for reelection this year, and they need your support to win. In the next couple of weeks, I‚Äôll send you some information about each of these fantastic members and the work they‚Äôre doing to help working Pennsylvania families.
Today we are highlighting our newest member, Senator Pam Iovino. She flipped a red seat blue in a special election in April 2019. Since being sworn in, Senator Iovino has sponsored legislation to provide relief for workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, supported legislation that would lower the cost of insulin, and has championed various measures to support our service members.
Will you contribute $25, $50 or more to support Pam and the SDCC‚Äôs efforts to support our Democratic incumbents?
We hope you‚Äôll follow along and support all of our incredible members facing reelection in 2020.

Senator Jay Costa,info@pasenatedems.com,A dangerous proposal,"Friend,
This week Republicans in the Senate passed SB613, which would have allowed non-essential businesses to reopen in the midst of this pandemic. I‚Äôll be frank - Republicans don‚Äôt want to reopen the economy because they are worried about working families, they want to support the bottom lines of the same corporate interests that line their campaign coffers. This is a failure of leadership and why we are working so hard to flip the Senate this year.

Friend, this bill is nothing short of dangerous. Re-opening businesses too soon poses a serious health risk to employees, consumers, and our health care systems. That‚Äôs why experts, nurses, and scientists oppose this dangerous legislation. We know times are hard for a lot of folks out there right now, but the solution cannot include putting corporate interests ahead of people‚Äôs lives.
Our caucus is focused on legislation such as The American Working Family Relief Action Plan, child care assistance, eviction and foreclosure protection for disaster emergencies and more, and concentrating on mitigating the unprecedented health crisis facing us.
We can flip the Senate this year, and doing so would mean that we have a majority to fight for all of this legislation and more to enact real change for citizens of the Commonwealth. Please contribute whatever you can now to support flipping the Senate this year.
Thank you.

Today is the 50th anniversary of the modern environmental movement. It‚Äôs the day we celebrate the beauty of our earth and even in times of uncertainty such as this, we encourage you to spend some time outside in the fresh air if you can today, while maintaining social distancing.
Our members in the Senate are leaders in the fight against climate change. Our caucus has introduced dozens of bills that would protect the air we breathe, require lead testing in schools, improve the safety of pipelines, and expand renewable energy.
It‚Äôs critical that we flip the Senate this year so these bills have a chance to be enacted and help to curb the effects of climate change. Will you contribute now to help us elect climate leaders?

Now that we made it through our primary, we know the Democratic nominees that will help us win back the Senate majority in November (less than five months away!).
[Donate now to our Flip the Senate fund]
Over the past several months, we have seen countless attempts by the Senate Republicans to block access to reproductive health care, put profits above people‚Äôs health, and ignore the advice of science and experts in the middle of a global pandemic.
Thanks to the progress made in 2018 and 2019, we flipped enough seats to break the veto-proof majority, and the Governor has been able to veto dangerous legislation. But, friend, this is not enough. There is too much at stake, and we need to elect leaders to flip the Senate so we can prioritize expanding access to health care, equitable education funding, and raising the minimum wage.
Our first post-primary fundraising deadline is TONIGHT and we need to raise another $10,000 to hit our goal. Will you contribute $50 or more NOW to help us hit our goal?

SDCC Action Team,info@pasenatedems.com,Out on the street,"Friend,
In the middle of the biggest public health and economic crisis we‚Äôve ever seen, Republicans in Harrisburg are willing to throw thousands of Pennsylvanians out on the street.
Chip in what you can now to help us fight back.
An Amendment to SB 976, introduced by SDCC Chairman Vincent Hughes, would have frozen evictions and foreclosures until 60 days after a county moved from ‚ÄúRed‚Äù to ‚ÄúYellow‚Äù under the Governor‚Äôs re-opening guidelines. Republicans voted against this amendment, instead favoring the rights of developers and wealthy landowners. These same developers and landowners are the ones that line these Republicans‚Äô campaign coffers.
Not to mention John DiSanto, Dan Laughlin, and Scott Martin are real estate developers and landlords who have personal financial interests in real estate and will profit from this vote. Their constituents deserve better, and that‚Äôs why their districts are top targets to flip in November.
‚è© Donate now to help flip these seats ‚è™
Our Senators are focused on providing relief for working Pennsylvania families during this crisis, not lining their own pockets or the pockets of wealthy campaign donors. At the SDCC, we are working hard to support our Democratic incumbents and candidates that support working families, living wages, and access to affordable health care. We know Pennsylvanians are ready to elect leadership that will work with them in a crisis and we can flip the Senate this year. But we can‚Äôt do it without your grassroots support.
Will you rush a donation to the SDCC today?
Thanks for your support.

Melanie Rose,info@pasenatedems.com,Today in the Senate,"Friend,
Today, Senate Republicans used the COVID19 pandemic to push forward their anti-woman agenda. Senate Bill 857 would have provided telemedicine coverage to Pennsylvanians across the Commonwealth who desperately need it.
Chip in now to fight back against attacks on women‚Äôs health care!
But instead, Republicans added an amendment restricting physicians from prescribing FDA-approved pharmaceutical abortion medication.
With social distancing recommendations and a state-wide Stay At Home order in place, Telemedicine has become an increasingly important way for Pennsylvanians ‚Äî particularly in rural communities ‚Äî to see their doctors and receive both diagnoses and treatment.
Legislators should not be using a pandemic to play partisan games and limit access to health care.
Will you donate $15, $25, or whatever you can now to support our efforts to elect more Democrats to the Senate to fight back against these dangerous policies?

I‚Äôm checking in with another Member Spotlight - Senator Judy Schwank!
Senator Schwank has been serving the 11th Senate District since 2011 but has been a community advocate in Berks County for almost three decades.
[Will you support Senator Schwank and our Democratic incumbents
with a $25 contribution now?]
In the Senate, Senator Schwank serves as the Democratic Chair of the Agriculture and Rural Affairs Committee, advocating for more sustainable agricultural policy including the preservation of natural resources, farmland and our farmers! She is also a strong advocate for education and women‚Äôs and family issues.
During the Covid-19 pandemic, Judy proposed legislation to protect the state-related benefits of Pennsylvanians. Her bill was designed to ensure that Pennsylvanians' state-related benefits would not be reduced when people received federal stimulus payments. This proposal received unanimous, bipartisan support in the Finance Committee.
Judy Schwank is a proven leader in the Senate and she needs our support to stay in Harrisburg.
Will you chip in $25, $50, or whatever you can to support Senator Schwank and the SDCC‚Äôs efforts to protect our Democratic Senators facing reelection this year?
Thank you for your support!

You might have seen what happened in Wisconsin this month - voters had to choose between going out to vote and risking their health or staying home and not having their voice count.
I‚Äôm happy to report, this will not happen this year in Pennsylvania. We implemented new vote by mail regulations in late 2019 to make voting more convenient and secure than ever before. This means that your vote and voice will be counted without you having to choose between your health and exercising your right to vote.
Here‚Äôs what you need to know:
1\. The primary election date has been moved to JUNE 2, 2020.
2\. Pennsylvania now allows no excuse mail in voting.
3\. Your application for a mail-in ballot must be received by your county office by 5:00PM on MAY 26, 2020.
4\. Your returned mail-in ballot must be returned by 8:00 PM on JUNE 2, 2020.
Your voice, your vote, and your health are protected this year.

Today marks 100 years since the 19th Amendment was ratified, giving women the right to vote. It would be decades before that right was extended to women of color and in 2020 we‚Äôre still fighting against voter suppression, disenfranchisement, and Republican gerrymandering.
In Pennsylvania, we have the opportunity to create our own history, and flip the Senate, by electing more women to the State Senate than ever before, including the first Latina State Senator.

We have 20 days until Election Day and we have a lot of work to do. In addition to taking back the White House and flipping the United States Senate, we must also pay close attention to legislative races on the ballot this November.
Supporting down-ballot Democrats is my mission, because I have been there. I know how important and critical local elected officials are to a community and a district. This year, I am rolling up my sleeves to support local Democrats running for legislatures across the country, and Pennsylvania is at the top of my list!

Other Amount
The Pennsylvania House of Representatives is one of the top legislative chambers in the country to flip from red to blue this November. They only need to flip nine seats to elect the second Democratic majority since 2000.
If we fail, Republicans will get a key spot at the table for redistricting in 2021, and gerrymander Pennsylvania even more for the next decade. As Democrats, every issue we care about from healthcare to wages to infrastructure to public school funding is on the ballot this November. We need to support local Democrats right now in Pennsylvania.
I have been a local candidate for public office before -- I know how challenging and defeating it can feel in the months leading up to an election. That‚Äôs why your support right now means so much more.
I hope you can support our fight to flip the Pennsylvania House of Representatives this November.

There are so many issues that make this fall‚Äôs elections the most consequential in our lifetime. From healthcare to the environment to gun violence prevention -- who you send to Harrisburg to represent you matters. And the stakes are even higher this year because the elected officials you choose at the state level will draw electoral maps that will be in place for the next 10 years.
After my time as U.S. Attorney General during the Obama Administration, I launched the National Democratic Redistricting Committee (NDRC) and committed to fight gerrymandering because I saw first-hand how it stalled an agenda focused on the needs of the people. Our team at the NDRC is determined to end this practice of politicians manipulating maps. We fundamentally believe that voters should choose their representatives ‚Äì not the other way around where politicians pick their voters.
Because of Republican investments and strategies a decade ago, Pennsylvania spent most of the past decade as one of the most gerrymandered states in the country. If we are going to secure fair maps for the next decade, we need to elect a Democratic majority to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives this fall.
That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm asking you to chip in $30 to the Pennsylvania House Democratic Campaign Committee today. It‚Äôll show you‚Äôve taken a stand against Republican gerrymandering.

Earlier this year, the NDRC endorsed 21 candidates and members running for the Pennsylvania House of Representatives. Prior to receiving our endorsement, each candidate took a pledge to stand against gerrymandering.
