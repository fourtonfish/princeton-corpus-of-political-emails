"Alex,
We all know that when Democrats show up, we win, but with social distancing and “Stay at Home” orders in place, we can’t just go pestering our friends, neighbors, and random people in line at the bakery to register to vote. Here’s our plan to stay home and still help.
We’re launching our Adopt-A-Voter program to give folks like you a unique way to increase voter participation in every single corner of our state. Check out this interactive map of all the counties and precincts in Missouri to see how many unregistered, likely Democrats there are out there, and for just $2, you can register one new voter! Explore your own neighborhood and see the impact you can have on your friends and neighbors!
How does it work?
Once you #AdoptAVoter, we will mail a pre-filled voter registration card to their home with a prepaid return envelope. All the recipient has to do is fill out the card and drop it in the mailbox. We track all cards to make sure they arrive at their local Board of Elections and most importantly, follow-up with anyone who hasn’t mailed theirs back in.
We need every Democrat to make their voice heard and we have an ambitious goal of registering hundreds of new voters in the coming weeks! If you can, pitch in $2 to get like-minded Missourians registered to vote!
We’ve got lofty goals, but together, we’ll vote in a new Governor, a new Congresswoman, and keep flipping seats in the Legislature!
Thank you for being so engaged and supportive during troubling times. We appreciate it from the bottom of our hearts. Stay safe and healthy.
-Team MDP
P.S. Please forward this email on to other friends and family who are safe and able to help get more Missourians registered to vote before November!

"Alex,
The news out of Jeff City is bad. Republican lawmakers will stop at nothing to gerrymander the redistricting process in their favor - including overturning the will of Missouri voters.
Republicans told the Kansas City Star last week that their first priority of the 2020 legislative session is to strike down the Clean Missouri law, a constitutional amendment that voters passed just last year with an astonishing 62% of the vote.
We pledge to hold every single Republican who tries to strike down this law accountable for their actions. Will you join with us and 62% of Missourians and make a $10 contribution before December 31st to stop GOP gerrymandering?
Democrats will be ready with boots on the ground in January to stop this abuse of power and our job is to make sure every single voter hears loud and clear that the GOP thinks they know better than you.
We're facing one final deadline before the New Year. Can you step up right now and contribute $10 before December 31st to keep fair maps and fair redistricting?
I want to thank you in advance for your support and for the phone calls and emails and letters to the editor that we'll need to uphold this law come January.

"Alex,
It’s the day before the end of this election and here’s what we need you to do:
* Vote absentee in-person at your local Board of Elections or County Clerk’s office TODAY before 5PM - find the address to yours here.
* Text or call three friends and ask them to make their plan to vote.
* Sign up to make phone calls today and tomorrow to get voters to the polls in the last hours of this race.
* If voting tomorrow on Election Day, double check your polling place here.
In-person absentee voting ends today at 5PM in every county in the state. It is imperative that you know when and where you’re going to vote - and if you can do it today before 5, do it.
Races up and down this ticket are going to be a dead heat, so it’s critical that you reach out to folks you know and sign to make calls to folks you don’t. Your extra touch could make all the difference.
Onward!

"Alex,
It’s official. Just before 2:00 p.m. today in the final days of session this year, the Republican majority in the Legislature passed SJR38, overturning the will of the people and putting Clean Missouri back on the ballot.
Voters overwhelmingly passed this ethics reform and redistricting package with 62% of the vote just two years ago, and the Missouri GOP has been scheming for a way to undo it ever since.
Today, 97 of them bowed to special interests.
If they won’t honor the will of their own constituents, they shouldn’t call themselves public servants.
Even fifteen of their own colleagues took a stand in opposition.
>>Click to hear the dire predictions from a fellow Republican made right on the committee room floor.
We will fight for fair maps and campaign finance reform all over again, and we’ll crush them all over again.
If you can pitch in on this fight, contribute $10 to put the nail in the coffin on gerrymandering once and for all.
It’s a long road ahead, but we’re marching toward victory.

"Alex,
While Gov. Parson gets whisked to and from the White House on private jets paid for by his high-dollar donors, we're here in Missouri building a team and a ground game that can win in 2020
While they're flying to fundraisers, we're voting to lower prescription drug prices, and pass background checks, and expand Medicaid.
While they lobbied in Washington, we stopped Right-to-Work, and increased the wage, and put ethics reform into law.
Next year, we can do even more to help middle-class families. Will you chip in $10 and we'll put it to work organizing for candidates on the ground?
We're up against our final end-of-quarter deadline of the year and we must start off 2020 on the right foot. We have real opportunities for a new Governor, new Congress members, and new state reps and state senators next year. We can make these gains, but only if we're in the fight together.
Can we count on you to pitch in $10 now to set up the canvasses and phone banks we need to elect new leadership for the Show-Me state?
Thank you for all your support!

"Tonight's the night, Alex - the end of the quarter, the end of the year, the end of the decade! We're pushing full steam ahead into 2020 prepared to build on our gains and make waves in a tough state.
Tomorrow is the start of the New Year and we're going to be on our toes ready for everything the GOP will throw at us.
Your support fuels this movement through ups and downs, wins and losses, off-years and election years. Will you ring in the beginning of a new, blue Missouri with a $10 contribution before midnight?
See you at the doors next year! Happy New Year!

"Alex,
March 31st is the LAST DAY to file to run for office this year! If you’ve been even remotely toying with the idea, we’re asking you to run!
The influx of regular folks deciding to take the plunge in the last 10 days or so has been incredible and one of the most consistent things we’ve heard from them is that they’re fed up with the lack of leadership and competence in the face of the Coronavirus outbreak.
So, whether it’s School Board or County Clerk or State Rep - we need you to serve your community however you can - especially in rural Missouri! Visit [[URL REDACTED]] and type in your county to find all the local offices that need folks like YOU to serve in them.
We’ve laid out all the information you need to file on our Candidate Recruitment Hub. If you’ve got questions or want to move forward, get back with us ASAP.
Okay, so what if running for office isn’t for you? The next best thing you can do is support our candidates!
We may be stuck indoors, but we’re still ramping up campaign season and hosting phone banks, text banks, getting new voters registered, creating digital ads, recruiting volunteers, and holding Republicans accountable every single day.
If you can chip in $1, $5, or $10 to join the fight to elect more Democrats, this is the most impactful time you can give. We're making decisions right now about which resources we can put where in the coming months, so please pitch in, if you’re able!
Onward,
-MDP Recruitment Team
P.S. Do you know someone who would make a great candidate - forward this email to them and ask them to run!

First, if you’re a volunteer or activist looking to get free, comprehensive training on grassroots campaigning, please join us for the 2020 Train the Trainer (T3) program! T3 is a free six-week, twelve-part webinar series designed to expand the skills of folks just like you. Register today, and help take our country back in November!
T3 trainings are held every Tuesday and Thursday from 6-7PM CST, from April 7 through May 14. The deadline to register is tonight, April 5 at 10:59 PM CST.

Trainings will be recorded and made available following each session via a weekly email on Fridays. Register for the T3 program now!
We are grateful to partner with the DNC and the Association of Democratic State Committees to bring you this free programming.
Second, we are also happy to be continuing our monthly Building Blue webinar series with Jen Slavik-Lohman tomorrow evening, April 6 at 8PM CST. This month’s topic is Voting 101 and Jen will be covering voter registration, voter ID laws, absentee voting, and the new municipal election postponements.
In this era of the Coronavirus outbreak, safe elections and expanding the number of ways we can cast our ballot is of the utmost importance. We need to get prepared now so that we don’t get disenfranchised later. Sign up to learn about your rights and voting options!
One more thing - our supporters have been terrific in helping us expand our digital reach at a time when it is critically important. You can add to the army of grassroots volunteers and activists being built by forwarding this email on to friends and contacts we’re not yet connecting with.

Thank you for your dedication to getting Democrats elected in the Show-Me State!
-MDP Training Committee

"Alex,
2019 has been a do-or-die year for Democrats in Missouri.
While we suffered a crushing Senate loss in 2018, we retained our Democratic State Auditor Nicole Galloway and passed four progressive ballot measures with astonishing margins - Missouri voters defeated Right to Work, passed fair redistricting and ethics reform, increased the minimum wage, and legalized medical marijuana.
We've spent 2019 dedicated to reorganization and preparation and that persistence has already started paying off. In this off-year, we flipped a traditionally Republican House seat by 9 points, flipped control of county government in our most-populous county, and are on-track to put Medicaid Expansion on the ballot. We're fielding good candidates for every single statewide office and congressional district and dozens of House and Senate seats. If the victories over these last two years have taught us anything, it's that Missourians have a big appetite for building a strong middle class.
So, I'm coming to you for your help in adding another victory to that list.
2020 will be filled with town halls, phone banks, canvasses, and postcard parties all across the state. Can you support our voter outreach program with a contribution of $10 before the end of the year?
We're taking our message of building a strong middle class to every corner of the state and I'm asking you to come along for the ride.
The final end-of-quarter deadline before 2020 is here. Can you chip in $10 and send a few Republicans into early retirement next year?
Grab your walking shoes, I'll see you in January.

"Alex,
Just sending a quick note this evening to say thank you all for your tremendous support of the Missouri Democratic Party over the first quarter of 2020! Even in these strange and scary circumstances, we’ve seen such an increase in folks running for office, completing online trainings, popping in to virtual happy hours, and signing up to volunteer. Democrats have stepped up to give small, recurring contributions of just a couple of bucks per month, for which we are truly humbled. Thank you!
Knowing how motivated you all are, we’ve got a couple next steps you can take to make an even bigger impact in the coming months:
* Help us increase our digital reach! Can you forward this email to just three people who can sign up for all the latest news, trainings, webinars, and calls-to-action?
* Can you share and comment on our social media posts on Facebook and Twitter?
* Today is Census Day! Don’t worry, it isn’t due yet, but it’s a good time to remind everyone that filling out your census is our constitutional duty and is required by law. Check your mail, then fill it out online in less than 10 minutes!
Bonus! If you’re able to chip in and help sustain our organizing efforts over the next few months, sign up to become a $3 recurring donor right now!
Thanks for everything you do!

"Alex,
The GOP is at an all-time low after last night.
True to his colors, Donald Trump was cold-hearted, incompetent, and uncaring. And it’s our duty to vote this man out of office so that the United States can come back from the precipice.
A president who won’t denounce white supremacy, who brings up his opponent’s deceased son, and who scams his way out of paying taxes doesn’t deserve one more day in the Oval Office.
The tides are changing in this election.
Joe Biden is galvanizing voters of all stripes and it’s showing. Across the country, Democratic candidates are winning in uphill battles - in Kansas, in Iowa, and here in Missouri, too.
You can take our state to the finish line by making a contribution that will help elect new leaders up and down the ballot. Will you support Democrats in these next 34 days with a $25 contribution right now?
We can put Joe Biden in the White House, Cori Bush in Congress, and Nicole Galloway in the Governor’s Mansion. It’s gonna be hard work and it’s going to mean giving everything we’ve got, but we can bring some victories home together.
Your support means we can put everything on the field until 7:00 PM on Election Day. Pitch in $25 and we’ll put it to work immediately.
Thank you so much,

Yesterday, our Republican-majority legislature proposed a new budget with massive cuts to higher education, roads, and bridges. Today, they are putting Clean Missouri on the chopping block too.
In a hearing this afternoon, the conservative-controlled body will take the first step toward overturning Clean Missouri, the ethics reform ballot initiative approved by voters two years ago with an astonishing 62% of the vote.
House Republicans are hoping you’re too distracted by coronavirus to pay attention.
What we need in our state are a few more flipped seats and a new Governor with veto power.
If you’re able, make a contribution of $5 today targeted toward putting Nicole Galloway in the Governor's mansion and turning some red seats blue. Together, we can elect leaders who will uphold Clean Missouri!
Thanks for taking action!

"Alex,
Just weeks after Missouri Democrats flipped a House seat held by Republicans for years in St. Louis County, we're aiming to do it again. This time, we have our eye on the suburban congressional seat held by Republican Ann Wagner.
With a difference of just 15,000 votes, Wagner barely squeaked by her Democratic opponent in 2018. Both Claire McCaskill and Nicole Galloway won this district and Ann knows she's on shaky ground.
We're all in for MO-02 and will do whatever it takes to win this race. If you're with us too, can you contribute $10 right now to flip this seat from red to blue?
Ann Wagner is a blank check for Donald Trump's agenda. We need someone in Congress who will fight for Missouri's middle class families, not pass tax breaks for Trump's rich friends.
This seat is flippable. We can win this race, but only if we're in this together. Pitch in $10 and let's tell Ann Wagner she won't be a blank check in Congress for much longer.
Thank you for jumping in the fight with us!

"Alex,
New polling out this week shows Gov. Parson’s handling of the coronavirus in Missouri has dropped to a dismal 38% approval.
Since just April, it’s dropped an astonishing 22 points.
This follows his recent jaw-dropping acknowledgement that children will get the virus and spread it to others, but that schools should reopen anyway.
We see the Governor talking up personal responsibility everyday in his press briefings at the State Capitol, but then see him indoors without a mask at his campaign rallies on the weekends.
His total inaction, and hypocrisy to boot, does not sit well with Missouri voters.
This is why who wins this race matters so much - because the health of our children, our families, and our neighborhoods are at stake.
We’re doing everything in our power to elect Nicole Galloway to lead our state through this mess and its aftermath.
This is personal.
So, we’re asking supporters like you to give $10 so that we can hire every single field and digital organizer we’ll need for the next 90 days.
Everything about this year is different - and Democrats are making gains they haven’t seen in a long time. This race is ours for the taking.
Dig deep and make a $10 or $20.20 contribution right now and we’ll put it to work right away organizing from Kansas City to St. Louis and St. Joe to Cape.
Thank you!

Alex,
Today is 10 days out and your support is more crucial than ever.
We’re turning out thousands and thousands of Missouri voters everyday because we must shatter records in this state if we’re going to elect Nicole Galloway as our next Governor.
The 10-days-out mark is critical because we need to know if we will have the resources to carry out our final voter turnout plans but, to be frank, we’re not where we need to be.
But every dollar you give today, we'll put to work immediately targeting the voters we still need to get to the polls. Chip in $20 bucks because we’ve still got a long way to go and only 10 more days to do it.
This is the time to put it all on the line and I know we’ve already asked a lot from you.
Thank you for volunteering, giving, and talking to your friends, family, and coworkers about this election. All the hard work you’ve done is making a huge difference in this race.
We’re on our way to breaking voter turnout records, but only if we have the resources to keep pushing every single day. Pitch in what you can - $5 or $50 - in these final days. It will truly make all the difference on November 3rd.
Onward!

At a certain point, you start to think that maybe the reason Gov. Parson and Secretary of State Ashcroft don’t want easier voting is because when we show up, we tend to win.
Let’s review their record on voting rights during a global health crisis:
* They refuse to classify the coronavirus epidemic as a valid excuse to request an absentee ballot
* They call the push toward vote-by-mail ‘partisan, political, and a Democrat-Republican issue’
* They moved the April municipal elections back to June but still refused to re-open the voter registration period
* They dismiss the wishes of 67% of Americans who want mail-in voting for the upcoming elections (Source: WSJ)
While these battles are making their way through the courts and the legislature, you can get a couple new voters registered and ready to cast their ballots.
Here’s how it works --
We’ve identified 154,000 likely Democrats in every part of this state. Visit our interactive map and click on your county. Zoom in and find your neighborhood or precinct. There may be 18 folks unregistered, there may be 1,800. Every $2 raised means we can mail a pre-filled, postage-paid registration form to your likely Democrat neighbor and all they have to do is sign and drop it in the mailbox. Since the forms are tracked, we have the unique ability to follow up with each individual and ensure it makes it to their election authority and they are added to the rolls.
There is strength in numbers. Why else would the Missouri GOP be so hellbent on not expanding voting access even during a pandemic?
If you’ve got two bucks to spare, get your neighbor registered to vote today.

"Alex,
You might have heard the big news already - the Missouri Democratic Party is bringing the presidential candidates to Kansas City live and in-person for a rally on Sunday, March 8th! Candidates will have their final chance to make their pitch to you ahead of our March 10th primary election when they will compete for Missouri’s 68 delegates.
Here’s how it’ll work: We have a limited number of tickets that have been released for undecided voters. Folks who are already committed to a candidate should contact that campaign for information on requesting tickets. We will release more tickets if/when they become available, so check back often.
Remember, there is a limited quantity, so if you definitely want to join a few thousand dedicated Democrats for an historic event, grab your ticket now! Please be sure to join the waitlist if we’re sold out.
If you’re interested in an event sponsorship, we have booths, blocks of tickets, and visibility offerings for purchase. You can email our Finance Director, Jordan Hunt, at [[URL REDACTED]] for more information. Funds raised from this event support our 2020 statewide coordinated campaign to get Democrats elected up and down the ballot.
Details and parking info can be found on our website at: [[URL REDACTED]] No one will be allowed entry without a ticket, so get yours now.
See you on March 8th!

"Alex,
The August 4th election is less than one week away and we are truly down to crunch time this election season. But there’s still time for you to have a huge positive impact on what happens in November.
Get a new voter or two (or ten!) registered to vote right now.
We can add hundreds and hundreds of brand new voters to the rolls and make big differences in precincts and districts all over the state.
$2 per voter is all it takes. Chip in $20 today and you can get 10 likely Democratic voters registered and ready to march to the polls.
This is a make-or-break time in a make-or-break year. We’re leaving nothing on the table.
Your $20 will go to work to push Nicole Galloway and Jill Schupp and so many others over the top. Pitch in and link arms with your neighbor because we are bringing some big victories home this November!
Onward,
-Missouri Democratic Party

Our statewide line-up of Missouri Democratic Party candidates is official!
We’re sending Nicole Galloway, Alissia Canady, Rich Finneran, Yinka Faleti, and Vicki Englund to the State Capitol to usher in a fresh, new era in Jeff City.
These are the folks who are bringing us victory in November. Get to know them, follow them on social media, and talk to your friends, family, and neighbors about them.
Medicaid expansion is a huge win for Democrats! Voters have finally expanded access to health care after Republican politicians failed to do so for a decade.
Republicans are worried. But Democrats, independents, moderates, moms worried about gun violence and schools reopening, teenagers who just got their first Voter Registration card, and our long-time activists have a whole lot to be optimistic about.
Just 90 days to go. Support the cause in the way we need it most - make a contribution of $10 right now, so we can get boots on the ground in front of targeted voters in the targeted precincts that we need to win this thing.
Today, we emerge unified and strengthened, with the wind at our backs.
Can we count on your help and support today? Dig deep and chip in $10 or $20.20, if you can.
Onward to November,
-Lauren Gepford, Executive Director

"Alex,
20 days to go...
July 8th is the last day to get registered to vote in the August 4th election and we’re doubling down on getting as many folks registered as we possibly can in the short time remaining.
Here’s how it works --
For every two bucks raised, one likely Democratic potential voter receives a pre-filled, postage-paid voter registration form and all they need to do is sign it and drop it in the mail. Forms are tracked so that we know who’s returned theirs and has been successfully added to the rolls and who still needs an extra nudge.
We’re here to provide as many nudges as it takes.
On August 4th, we’ll go to the polls to pass our fourth progressive ballot measure in two years. This time for Medicaid Expansion.
It’s also the first election held under our (slightly) expanded absentee voting rules.
With just 20 days until the next registration deadline, can you commit to registering one, two, or three new voters right now? If you can commit to even more, will you make a contribution of $20 today?
This is when you can have a serious impact. In these 20 days.
Let’s deliver the Republicans another defeat in August. And gear up for the big day in November.
We will make this state a better place to live if we work together to get other like-minded folks registered and ready to march to the polls. Chip in $10 or $20, or whatever you can spare today!
Onward to victory!

"Alex,
Happy Birthday to Harry Truman today! While everyone knows the buck stopped with him, our Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft cries crocodile tears saying he’s terribly sorry, but there’s just nothing he can do to make voting easier and more accessible for folks like you.
So, what we’re doing in response to their inaction is simple.
We need more voters.
And there are a lot of them out there.
Some folks moved and got taken off the rolls. Some got married and changed their names. Some moved for school. And others are lapsed voters ready to get engaged again.
We’ve identified thousands of likely Democratic voters who just need a nudge from you to get back in the game.
So, take a second to explore the map we created. See how many unregistered folks there are in your county or precinct. If you can, make a $10 contribution to get five voters ready to go to the polls in November.
Over 200 of you have already contributed toward this voter registration project and we couldn’t be more grateful.
If you haven’t done so yet, can you commit to safely registering five new voters by pitching in $10 today?
Here’s how it works: We’ll be mailing postage-paid, pre-filled voter reg forms to the likely Democrats we’ve identified, so that all they need to do is sign and drop it in the mail. We can also track these forms so that we can follow up with individuals and make sure they get them returned and added to the rolls.
Common sense can prevail in this state, but you’ve got to show up and bring ten people along with you.
Thank you for your hard work,

"Alex,
Missouri voters have spoken! We are so close to knowing which Democratic candidate will take on Donald Trump in just 238 days.
Since taking office, Trump’s net approval rating in Missouri has dropped 11 points, and today, we saw Missourians of all backgrounds soundly reject the extremist policies of the GOP by coming out in droves to support their Democratic candidate.
We will make Donald Trump a One-Term President by keeping our eyes on the prize, building momentum, and nominating a candidate who is steady, smart, and ready to lead on day one.
With our primary over, we’re staring down our very first end-of-quarter deadline of 2020 and we’re running out of time to build the resources we’ll need for November.
Your $10 contribution makes the most impact right now. We’re putting it to use knocking doors, making phone calls, sending text messages, registering new voters, and holding Republicans accountable for their actions.
November will be here before we know it, and together, we’ll show Donald Trump and the Missouri GOP that they don’t speak for us.
Onward to victory,

Join us for a phone bank to kickstart Truman Dinner and our “50 Days Out” Weekend of Action this Saturday at 4PM!
We are just weeks away from a critically important election and we’re putting in the work before we kick back and relax for the Missouri Democratic Party’s annual Truman Dinner.
Phone calls are one of the most effective ways to connect with the voters we need to elect Nicole Galloway and Democrats up and down the ballot. We’ll have a quick training to show you how it works and then we’ll pick up the phone, listen to voters’ concerns, and respond in a real conversation.
We can change the balance of power in Missouri, but only if we buckle down and start dialing together. Everyone is welcome and encouraged to join!
We’re putting everything on the table. Every single phone call you make gets us that much closer to sending new leaders to Congress, the White House, and the Governor’s Mansion.
Make sure you RSVP to make phone calls and elect Democrats this Saturday, 9/12 at 4PM!
See you there

Crisis reveals a leader’s true nature. And boy, is this crisis revealing.
Congressman Jason Smith voted against the Coronavirus relief bill to provide lifesaving assistance to working families and small businesses in the 8th district.
There are no talking points to hide behind when you take a vote like that.
Since he’s been in office, he’s seen six rural hospitals close, voted to repeal the ACA, voted to keep rural women from accessing reproductive healthcare, and just last year, he voted against protections for Missourians with preexisting conditions.
The time has come for Jason Smith to answer for his actions. Our COVID cases are skyrocketing and defeating him has taken on a new level of urgency for rural Missourians.
Kathy Ellis is a fighter.
She’s a social worker with a 35-year career and a first-person view of what happens when rural Missourians lose access to health care and mental health services.
She’s running to send Jason Smith back home, but victory is going to take two big things - your generous support and massive voter outreach.
Stretch your dollar twice as far and make an even bigger impact with one contribution of $20.20. All donations raised from this email will be split 50/50 toward Kathy’s campaign and the Missouri Democratic Party’s statewide voter outreach program.
We’re on the cusp of some big wins. Districts and seats are in play that no one ever dreamt would be in play this time last year. National attention is pouring in. Polls are showing a change in the winds.
Chip in $20.20 right now, if you’re able, and take advantage of a unique opportunity to give. Support a truly fantastic, hard-working candidate like Kathy Ellis and invest in the massive voter outreach program we will need to win all across the state.
96 days to go!

We know Gov. Parson isn’t jumping off the Trump Train - even when it’s crashing and burning.
Even as red states stop showing up for him, even as he admits he slowed down coronavirus testing, even as his approval ratings hit the lowest they’ve ever been.
He’s holding on to the bitter end.
But we’re uniting progressives, moderates, and Independents to stop the Trump sycophants in their tracks.
June 30th is the end of the quarter and it’s critically important that we show Republicans what they’re up against. Will you chip in $10 today to send a message to the Missouri GOP that the Trump era is over?
The first test of strength we face will be winning the Medicaid Expansion ballot initiative on August 4th and then we’re rolling all that momentum into November 3rd.
We’ve got so much left to do before then. Pitch in $10 bucks if you can. Together, we’re going to end this extremism in our great state once and for all.
Thank you for your hard work and support!

"Alex,
This is a tough time for our state and our country and it makes clear just how much we need leaders in charge who reflect who we are, who share our principals, and who will fight for us.
We can put power back into the hands of hourly workers, families, front line doctors and nurses, cashiers, young professionals, janitors, and the disenfranchised - by registering each of them one at a time.
There’s a reason voting is a convoluted process in our state. One of our state senators calls absentee voting “a slippery slope.” Our Governor says if you’re worried about the pandemic then just “don’t go out and vote.”
They want to make it inconvenient for you.
They want you to sit it out.
That’s how they hold on to power.
We’re registering voters and together, we’re going to vote them out. Chip in and join us, if you can.
In Solidarity,

"Alex,
The queen of “alternative facts” herself Kellyanne Conway will keynote the Missouri Republican Party’s annual Lincoln Days dinner in Springfield tonight.
In an effort to prop up unelected Governor Mike Parson and Congresswoman Ann Wagner, national Republicans are pulling out all the stops by sending in GOP favorite Kellyanne Conway and disgraced, defeated former Gov. Scott Walker to ease growing concerns about Republicans’ chances in 2020.
So, here are the actual facts:
* The Missouri GOP says publicly and privately that Rep. Ann Wagner is facing a tough battle against State Sen. Jill Schupp for her seat in Congress
* Gov. Mike Parson carelessly and heartlessly kicked 100,000 children off their health insurance
* Republicans across the state are terrified that Medicaid Expansion will pass when it’s put before the voters as a ballot initiative
Pitch in $10 and we’ll put it to work where it matters most - on the ground in every district, every precinct, and every region to turn out every single voter we need to push Democrats over the finish line.
We’ve got a ton of work to do fighting for a new Governor, a new Congresswoman, and access to healthcare for everybody.
Pitch in $10 and let’s elect Democrats who give a damn about the middle class.
Thank you for standing up for Missouri families. Let’s go win some elections.

We’re truly in the thick of this fight right now.
There are only 40 days until Election Day and only 6 days until our final end-of-quarter deadline of this presidential election year.
We’re putting our final plans into action right now - targeted phone calls, door knocks, lit drops, and more - and this is the most impactful time for you to make a contribution toward electing Democrats.
Can we count on your support of $20.20 today to make sure we leave everything on the field and wake up on November 4th knowing we did everything we could to elect Nicole Galloway as our new Governor.
We’ve got thousands more phone calls to make, texts to send, and voters to register.

In a bizarre response to being asked about expanding our right to vote during the coronavirus epidemic, Gov. Mike Parson brushed off both the health crisis we’re in and his own stay-at-home order, dismissing expanded absentee voting as just a “political issue.”
The truth is Gov. Parson wants to make it harder for people to vote during coronavirus plain and simple.
While Parson and the Missouri GOP are trying to win by making you jump through hoops to vote safely, Democrats are implementing massive plans to register new voters and walk folks through the absentee ballot process from start to finish.
You can register one new voter in the Show-Me state for just $2. Don’t leave a single vote on the table. Can we count on your support?
Let’s do this!

"Alex,
Got plans this weekend?
We’re just about 45 days away from this election and we need every single one of you reading this to sign up for a volunteer shift this weekend.
There are opportunities in every nook and cranny of the state for no-contact lit dropping, phone banking, text banking, and outdoor kick-off events to benefit Democrats up and down the ticket.
This election will be close.
The way we win is to out-work the Republicans and to do that, we need you.
You are our secret weapon.
Commit to doing a little bit more - start sending text messages, making phone calls, or put on your walking shoes and get out into the community.
Sign up for a shift and we will put you in front of targeted voters where you can have the most impact.
Each phone call and text message and “knock and drop” shift completed puts us that much closer to victory.
See you out there!

"Alex,
Have you seen the headlines lately?
In less than 200 days, we’ll be choosing new leaders and fresh ideas over the stale status quo. While Gov. Parson has to be sued just so he’ll stop making voters jump through hoops to cast their ballots, our Democratic officials have stepped up in a big way to fill in the leadership void, and voters have taken notice. We’re outraising opponents and increasing our chances.
If you’re able, can you contribute $5 to push Nicole Galloway and Jill Schupp over the finish line? Your support can make a huge difference!
Onward to victory,
-Team MDP

"Alex,
Times of crisis often shine a spotlight on the inequities in our society and this crisis may be the one that pushes us over the finish line on fights we’ve waged for years - health care access for all, paid sick leave, expanded unemployment insurance, worker protections, expanded voting rights, and rural broadband access.
While our state reps and senators draft and sponsor bills pushing for relief and protection for Missouri families and businesses, our Governor abdicates responsibility for the welfare of the people.
While cities and counties have made the tough choice to issue “Stay At Home” orders, Gov. Parson does nothing.
While our April municipal elections are postponed until June, Gov. Parson won’t re-open voter registration.
While our grocery and pharmacy workers are on the front lines putting their own health at risk everyday, Gov. Parson doesn’t offer them hazard protections.
While Missouri families go without health care during an epidemic, Gov. Parson still won’t expand Medicaid.
If there is one thing the blundering response to this crisis has done, it’s been to put a fire in the belly of Democrats, liberals, moderates, independents, and even those who weren’t all that interested in politics before - all demanding leadership, competence, and compassion. Enough is enough.
It is with this renewed sense of urgency that I say we can win back the Governor’s mansion. We can send a new representative to Congress. And we can flip seats in the suburbs of our four largest cities.
March 31st is the end of the first quarter of 2020 and we are not where we need to be in a presidential election year. If you’re able to, step up your personal commitment to get these Democrats elected. Can you support us with a $10 contribution today?
Onward to victory,
-Missouri Democrats

"Alex,
U.S. News & World Report has upgraded Nicole Galloway’s race AGAIN! From Solid to Likely and now to Lean, we’re diligently working our way over to Toss-Up status!
According to the latest rankings, Missouri is one of three competitive gubernatorial races this cycle and the only one where Democrats’ chances of winning were upgraded.
Some folks wrote off Missouri as Trump Country, but instead of taking it lying down, we kept up the hard work, knowing that every move we make is part of a bigger strategy to reach every possible voter out there.
And we will ultimately need dozens of organizers and hundreds of volunteers to reach those voters that will push Nicole Galloway over the finish line.
Our operation is statewide, all-inclusive, and expanding everyday. We need to be able to keep hiring the organizers who are the boots on the ground, the folks pushing our message digitally, the folks organizing at the precinct-level, the folks recruiting volunteers, the folks making phone calls and running text banks and talking to voters every single day.
You can help hire organizers and expand this operation by making a $10 contribution right now. This is how we win. We are 120 days out with no time to spare.
We will never lose sight of the end-goal. We are going to elect a new Governor for the State of Missouri.
Chip in $10 and ensure that the first-time voter, and the lapsed voter, and the independent voter isn’t forgotten. We will need them all.
Stay safe, wear your mask, and call three friends to remind them that Medicaid Expansion is on the ballot on August 4th!

Many regions in Missouri are now under a “Stay at Home” directive by order of mayors and county executives for the next 30 days, so we’ve put together some community resources and ways to stay engaged and active while we’re stuck at home. This is not an exhaustive list though - be sure to follow us, your favorite non-profits, news organizations, and elected officials on social media for the most updated information.
Community Resources
* Stay safe! Knowledge is power, get all the facts on prevention here.
* Red tape around applying for unemployment insurance has been removed, making it even easier for Missourians affected by Coronavirus to receive their benefits ASAP. Get all the info and start the process here.
* There are over 350 Food Pantries serving Missourians in need all over the state. Find a listing of pantries as well as hospital contact info here.
* Though all schools in Missouri are closed, most are continuing to serve school lunches curbside. Contact your local school district and follow them on social media to stay up to speed. Here is some additional info for the St. Louis region and Kansas City region.
Civic Engagement
* Fill out your U.S. Census! Make sure your city, region, and state receive the proper representation it deserves. It’s never been easier to do it! Check your mailbox, hop online to [[URL REDACTED]], or call 844-330-2020 to complete it by phone.

* If you are a volunteer, activist, or member of a county party or Democratic Club - please check out all the resources listed in our Campaigning During Coronavirus guide!
And finally, we’re not stopping the fight to pass Medicaid expansion and elect a new Governor, Congresswoman, and Legislature. In fact, we’re doubling down. But with fundraisers, and dinners, and receptions cancelled, we’re taking a financial hit. If you’re able to step up your personal commitment, make a $5 or $10 contribution right now.
Stay safe, the fight continues!

When Republican Rep. Ann Wagner takes over $182,000 from big pharma donors, it should come as no surprise that she votes in their best interests, not ours.
But 2020 is just around the corner and voters have the chance to hold her accountable.
We're facing a huge end-of-quarter deadline on Dec. 31st. Can you chip in $10 right now to elect a new Democrat to Congress next year?

"Alex,
You kept your head down and your eyes on the prize - and now, it’s finally paying off!
The non-partisan Cook Political Report has just upgraded Jill Schupp’s race for the 2nd Congressional District this morning.
We are officially a TOSS-UP race!
Your hard work, your dedication, and your persistence is going to send Ann Wagner into retirement in November.
We are hiring boots on the ground to target every single precinct in this district because we are not going to let MO-02 slip through our fingers this year.
We’re less than 90 days out and riding a wave of momentum toward victory. But don’t forget Ann Wagner’s Republican Party aren’t going to concede this seat without a fight and they’re willing to spend millions of dollars to keep it.
This is how we’re going to win - chip in $10 this morning and we can hire the field organizers and the digital organizers to reach each targeted voter we need to put Jill Schupp over the finish line.
It’s going to take each and every one of us to send Jill to the Capitol.
Don’t let your guard down. Buckle up for the next 88 days and pitch in $10.
Thank you!

"Alex,
Good news keeps pouring in for Missouri Democrats!
* Larry Sabato’s “Crystal Ball” is the latest election forecaster to upgrade Nicole Galloway’s chances of winning, moving her just one step away from declaring the race an official “toss-up!”
* Secretary of State candidate Yinka Faleti outraised incumbent Jay Ashcroft by an astonishing 7-1 margin this quarter!
* Sen. Jill Schupp continues her winning streak by outraising unpopular Ann Wagner for the third quarter in a row.
* Kathy Ellis has raised over $200,000 (with an average contribution of just $50) in her bid to unseat Jason Smith in Missouri’s rural 8th congressional district.
* Rep. Judy Baker outraised Caleb Rowden for the second quarter in a row in her targeted, toss-up state senate race in Mid-MO.
Democrats are making moves and grassroots supporters are lifting them up because we can all feel the wind at our backs this year.
Think about it --
We’re on the precipice of expanding Medicaid by a vote of the people. We’ve made the race for Governor competitive and now national attention is pouring in. The GOP is about to lose their last suburban congressional stronghold.
We’re 110 days out and it’s critical we keep this momentum going strong. Thank you so much for your support. If you haven’t given yet, chip in five bucks. If you have given, can you double down?
Candidates are challenging incumbents in tough districts and in tough areas and raising Democratic vote share all over the state. Once complacent Republicans are now struggling to answer what they’ve been doing this whole time.
Now is the time to capitalize on this progress. Your contribution today will have a major impact on voter outreach, GOTV, and last-minute voter registration. Pitch in $5 or $10 and let’s keep up the hard work.
Onward,
\- Jordan H., Finance Director

It’s #VoterRegFriday again! Every Friday we will be reaching out to you about our new interactive voter registration map that lets you explore how many unregistered, likely Democrats there are in any given precinct or county in Missouri. Then you can #AdoptAVoter in your own neighborhood or anywhere around the state for just $2.
Missouri Democrats are pushing hard to implement vote-by-mail in the general election to ensure that no one is discouraged or puts their health at risk to vote. While our State Reps and Senators are working to expand voting rights in the Capitol, our job is to get as many Missourians as we possibly can ready for November 3rd.
There are Democrats in every single corner of this state, and together, we can turn them out. Will you chip in $2 or more right now toward our goal of registering 500 new voters before the end of April?
Thank you for keeping your digital clipboards at the ready! Let’s get folks registered!

"Alex,
One year ago, Gov. Mike Parson signed into law one of the most extreme bans on abortion in the entire country - one that made NO exceptions for rape or incest.
One that banned all abortions after eight weeks, before many women even know they’re pregnant.
The cruel nature of the bill, and the passionate challenge of it by the Democratic minority, made national headlines.
Thankfully, a federal judge went on to temporarily block some of those restrictions, but our state remains a place where reproductive freedom is harder and harder to come by.
The law still includes a trigger that will automatically ban abortion in the state of Missouri if Trump’s Supreme Court justices overturn Roe v. Wade.
We can’t afford four more years of Governor Parson.
We can’t afford four more years of punitive bills, amendments, restrictions, and triggers winding their way through the Legislature.
Elect Democrats like your freedom depends on it.
Make phone calls, mail postcards, and organize online like your freedom depends on it.
Let us know we can count on you to volunteer. You are needed right now.
Together, we’re going to elect Nicole Galloway and take back our veto power.
Solidarity,

With the help of Missouri's two Republican senators - Roy Blunt and Josh Hawley - one of President Trump's hand-picked judges has just been confirmed to the federal bench in St. Louis.
Though Sarah Pitlyk was deemed ""not qualified"" by the American Bar Association, the only thing our U.S. Senators cared about is that she opposes abortion rights. But in a particularly cruel and extreme stance, she also opposes surrogacy and in-vitro fertilization, calling it ""harmful"" and saying it ""diminishes respect for motherhood.""
It is absolutely vital that we take back the Governor's mansion and regain the power to veto the extreme anti-abortion measures the Missouri GOP are cooking up for 2020.
Can you pitch in $5 to make sure we have the resources to take our state back next year?
We've already flipped one seat this year, but 2020 is coming up quick and we've got the fight of our lives ahead of us.
Will you reach into your pockets right now and chip in $5 to keep the extremist Republicans in check next session?
Missouri women are counting on all of us.

Like our Speaker of the House last night, the President’s prime-time speech didn’t fool any of us. “Frothy eloquence neither convinces nor satisfies me. I’m from Missouri, you’ve got to show me.”
Under Republican leadership in the White House, the Governor’s Mansion, and the State Legislature, here's what's really been happening:
Women face cruel and unconstitutional bans on abortion, ethics reforms are under threat, corrupt behavior is rampant, unions are being undermined, wages aren’t rising, pre-existing conditions protections are slipping away, school funding is down, and Medicare and Social Secrurity are at risk.
No matter how much Pres. Trump and Gov. Parson just like to hear themselves talk, we’re Missourians, you’ll have to show us.
If you reject a Republican future for our state, let’s elect Democrats up and down the ballot, all the way from County Legislature to Governor. Can you contribute $10 right now and let's tell President Trump we're not buying his vision?
We're all channeling Nancy today!

As we all tough it out for at least a few more weeks, we wanted to remind you of the community resources available to you and how you can help others during the Coronavirus epidemic.
If You Need Help
* If you’ve lost your job due to the virus, get all the info to apply for unemployment insurance here.
* United Way serves all corners of Missouri. Contact them to explore benefits and services you may be eligible to receive.
* There are over 350 food pantries serving citizens in need all over the state. Find a listing of pantries as well as hospital contact info here.
* If you’re eligible for SNAP benefits, you will now receive the maximum allowable amount for your family size. Get the info here.
* The deadline to file your federal taxes has been extended to July 15th. See the IRS directive here.
* Our friends at UNITE HERE Local 74 have put together a very comprehensive and in-depth guide to resources \- including some rent, mortgage, and utility relief options - aimed at folks in the St. Louis region.
How You Can Help Others
For folks whose families are safe and healthy, there are plenty of worthy causes that could use your spare change and support.
* American Red Cross, United Way, Community Services League, and Society of St. Vincent de Paul are just a few organizations providing emergency relief to our friends and neighbors.
* When grabbing takeout for dinner, try to buy local as much as you can. Curbside KC and Curbside STL have created a handy database focused on local restaurants (and bars, breweries, and distilleries too!) providing takeout service.
* Grocery and pharmacy workers are STILL not receiving the hazard protections they deserve because Gov. Parson has not designated them as essential. Call his office today at (573) 751-3222 and ask him to protect our workers.
Just like you, we’re trying to be as kind and responsible as we can by checking on neighbors, supporting local businesses, and flattening the curve as much as possible.
Thank you! Please reach out to us if we can be of assistance!

Missouri Democrats are a big tent but we’re all looking forward toward progress and we stand united in the fight to elect new leaders up and down the ticket this year.
We’ve got a lot riding on this election.
From gerrymandering to fighting against Medicaid expansion to trying to legalize brass knuckles, there is something seriously wrong with the GOP majority in power.
But Missouri is truly in a different place today than we were this time last year. We’re in a different place than we were in January.
We’ve clawed our way to a position of strength and we’re digging our heels in.
We’re taking this fight to the ballot box in a few, short weeks, but we need your help.
By supporting this year’s Truman Dinner, you are not only joining in on a great Democratic tradition, you are making sure we get in front of the targeted voters we must turn out in order to win.
We’re thrilled to be joined by Sen. Cory Booker, Nicole Galloway, Jill Schupp, and many others. Share in some joyful camaraderie with your friends and neighbors from Maryville to Kennet and everywhere in between.
We have a huge opportunity to make serious gains and we can get there together. Can I count on your support?
Thank you!

Cory Booker has an important message for Missouri Democrats.
“Your state has the chance to stand up in this dark [[URL REDACTED]] show America a way through the darkness. This is not gonna happen by accident..., it has to be worked for.""
And that's exactly what we're doing.
This weekend marked our first Weekend of Action - one full of phonebanks, textbanks, lit drops, and volunteer trainings.
We’ve got offices open from Sedalia to Hannibal.
We continue to register thousands of likely Democratic voters with the help of volunteers and allied organizations.
We’ve hired almost 30 dedicated field and digital organizers to get in front of the targeted voters we need to ensure Nicole Galloway heads to the Governor’s Mansion and Democrats up and down the ballot win their races.
But, we’re down to 50 days and there’s still more work to do. Like Cory says, can you commit yourself to doing a little more?
Can we count on you to chip in $20.20 today to set the stage for victory in November and lay the foundation for many more to come?
Thank you for putting it all on the line!

“These kids have got to get back to school.... And if they do get COVID-19, which they will — and they will when they go to school — they’re not going to the hospitals.... They’re going to go home and they’re going to get over it.”
Gov. Parson is sticking to his cruel and cavalier attitude toward school safety no matter how much national criticism he gets for it.
His goal is to show total and complete allegiance to Donald Trump. And because of that, we’re left living and dying by his incompetence during this pandemic.
Defeating Parson has taken on a new level of urgency.
In 105 days, we will send our unelected Governor into retirement and elect a proven leader for our state.
You can feel a change in the winds in Missouri.
While Parson doubles down on indefensible comments, Nicole Galloway is out earning every vote, every grassroots dollar, and every point in the polls that show she’s closing the gap in this race.
We know big changes are on the horizon.
And that’s why we’re hiring dozens of organizers and recruiting hundreds of volunteers to send Nicole to the Governor’s Mansion.
Our boots on the ground are holding drive-thru notary services to get ballots notarized, organizing text banks, making phone calls, and getting our message out digitally to targeted voters.
This is how we’re gonna bring this victory home. Pitch in $20.20, or whatever you can, and we can expand this operation to get every vote in every precinct.
We are putting our heads down for the next 105 days so we can walk away at 7PM on Election Night knowing we did everything we could to elect Nicole Galloway.
Chip in $20.20 and let’s reach every Democrat, every lapsed voter, every Independent, every person who didn’t think of themselves as particularly “political” before all this. We’re gonna need everybody to defeat Mike Parson.
Thank you!

"Alex,
TODAY is the last day to request an absentee ballot for the August 4th election!
1. If you consider yourself at-risk in regards to the COVID-19 virus, then you can submit your request form via email, fax, or in-person to your Local Election Authority today before 5PM. Download your request form here and look up your Local Election Authority here. Remember, this request must be received by 5PM today.
If you don’t believe you fall into that at-risk category, you can only submit yours via U.S. mail and unfortunately, don’t have enough time to get yours in.
2. Your second option is in-person absentee voting at your local Board of Elections or County Clerk’s office. In-person absentee voting varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, so you need to check with your Local Election Authority - find yours here.
3. Your final option is voting on Election Day itself, Tuesday, August 4th between 6AM and 7PM. Find your polling location here.
This election is critical. Expanding Medicaid is critical. It’s going to be our first victory to propel us into November and it will be the fourth ballot initiative that Republicans will lose in the state of Missouri.
But make no mistake, Republicans are still doing their very best to make voting during the pandemic as hard and confusing as possible. And that’s why we need even more resolve not to let them keep us from the ballot box.
Make a plan to vote. Ask three of your friends what their plans are to vote.
Never stop organizing!

"Alex,
We asked you all to step up and volunteer yesterday and we had a huge influx of new folks signing up for the final week of this election!
Thank you - the enthusiasm is palpable and you’re going to take us over the finish line in just 7 days!
Because of you, we’re texting thousands of Missourians every day to tell them their polling locations, turn them out for in-person absentee voting, turn them out on Election Day, and remind them who their Democratic candidates are from Nicole Galloway on down to their state reps and senators.
And with record voter registration efforts this year, we’ve got a lot of new voters to reach.
So, we’re asking for your help so we can contact every eligible voter over the next week. Each $5 contribution you make is enough to send about 500 text messages.
That’s astounding bang for your buck!
$5 bucks can do a lot in this election, especially when we know these races are going to come down to the wire and every single conversation we have with a voter pushes us closer and closer to victory. Chip in today and let’s get to chatting!
Thank you for everything you do!

"Alex,
What is going on with the Missouri GOP?
We’re led by a Governor who refuses to take even the simplest actions against coronavirus and his handpicked Attorney General is suing to repeal the Affordable Care Act and take your health insurance away during a pandemic.
Parson’s incompetence on COVID is a healthcare failure, an economic failure, and a jobs failure - and we can no longer put politicians in charge who fail to protect middle class Missourians.
The Governor and his campaign try to milk every opportunity for spin they can, but they’re going to have a hard time digging themselves out of this hole.
We might be stuck with Parson right now - but that’s about to change in just 5 short weeks.
Only Nicole Galloway has a plan to combat corona, protect pre-existing conditions, and keep kids on their health insurance. We have to stay focused and double down for the next 36 days until we elect her as our next Governor.
Will you commit to keeping the pressure on with a $5 weekly contribution for the next 5 weeks?
Gov. Parson ignores the will of doctors, nurses, and his constituents. Together, we can send him into retirement and protect our healthcare!
Make your contribution count right up until Election Day. Chip in $5 weekly today!

We are thrilled to announce that U.S. Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey will give the Keynote Address at this year’s Truman Dinner on Saturday evening, Sept. 12th!
Sen. Booker is a public servant who rose from City Councilman to Mayor of Newark to United States Senator and has worked on some of our toughest issues - housing access, economic mobility, and gun violence - challenges which have seriously affected our daily lives here in Missouri. He’s a fighter, an optimist, and he’s passionate that each of us has a role in changing our own communities for the better. We are so honored to have him join us.
Purchase your ticket today - you’re not gonna want to miss this remarkable speech.
We’re looking forward to a wonderful night,

The work of our 30 digital and field organizers and hundreds of volunteers has shaped Missouri races from long-shots into toss-ups.
* Nicole Galloway’s race for Governor is officially a toss-up
* Jill Schupp is tied with Ann Wagner for Missouri’s 2nd congressional district
* Cori Bush is poised to head to Congress representing St. Louis
* Judy Baker and Deb Lavender can change the balance of power in the State Senate and end the GOP’s veto-proof majority
Now, let’s finish the job.
Tonight at midnight is our final end-of-quarter fundraising deadline before Election Day.
This is our last, big push to gather the resources we need to reach every targeted voter in every targeted district to elect those Democrats and many more to office in just 34 days.
Pitch in $20.20 tonight before midnight and make an investment in our future. We can bring these victories home together!
Thank you!

"Alex,
Thank you for making our #ShowMe2020 State Convention Weekend with Stacey Abrams an incredible success!
We amassed 8,000 views on Facebook Live and raised small dollars from over 350 grassroots donors committed to electing Democrats up and down the ticket.
Just like Stacey said, one of the most vital issues that we will face this year is protecting the right to vote.
With an unchecked Republican majority, we see fewer polling places, longer lines, notary requirements, no online registration and unnecessary deadlines - all things designed to discourage your participation.
We have to organize and outmaneuver them.
And we have to do it quickly.
Check out Stacey Abrams’ fiery message to all of us Missouri Democrats ready to flip our state blue!
Together, we can send new leaders to Jeff City and bring thousands of new voters into the fold!
And once you’re fired up and ready to go, sign your name to tell Gov. Parson that refusing to expand voting access is voter suppression, plain and simple.
Onward to November,

"Alex,
We keep hammering it home because time is running out.
The August 4th election is critical. Expanding Medicaid will propel Democrats and deflate Republicans heading into the big election in November.
We know that Gov. Parson and the Missouri GOP has done their best to make voting during the pandemic harder and more confusing. And that’s why we need even more resolve not to let them keep us from the ballot box.
August 4th is 18 days away. Make sure you have a plan to vote.
If you’re going to vote absentee, your Local Election Authority (LEA) must receive your request by July 22nd at 5PM. Once they mail you your ballot and you mark it, it must be received by them by 7PM on Election Day.
Download and print your absentee ballot request form here.
Return it to your Local Election Authority (generally your Board of Elections or County Clerk) - find yours here.
If you’re going to vote at the polls, some areas - such as Kansas City, Jackson County, Boone County, St. Louis County, St. Louis City, etc - have in-person absentee voting, where you can vote like you normally would, just before the actual election day.
Dates and hours will vary, so be sure to check with your Local Election Authority. (Find yours here.)
It’s imperative that we do not sit out this election. This is the precursor to November and we must be a solid, united front.
Onward,
-Missouri Democratic Party

It's Debate Night in America!
We’re missing the old fashioned, in-person watch parties, so come hang out with us for the next best thing tonight on Facebook Live!
We invite Missouri Dems from all across the state to hop on our Facebook page a few minutes before and stay tuned as the debate begins at 8:00 PM. You’re encouraged to chat, like, approve, disapprove, and comment live throughout the event!
In light of the breaking news that Trump pays almost nothing in taxes and has just nominated an ultra conservative to the Supreme Court, we are feeling especially galvanized and ready to kick this man out of office in 35 days.
See you at 8PM to cheer on Joe!

Deadlines are a part of life and for state parties, we have a LOT of them. But each one is critical in a big election year like 2020. We are now to the end of January and we are not slowing down until every last ballot has been counted on the night of November 3rd.
With just 277 days left until E-Day, our fundraising numbers must remain strong to get the job done. If you can chip in $5 before our monthly deadline tonight, we can reach our goal.
When Democrats come together, we win, we flip seats, and we pass laws that strengthen Missouri families. Show your support and join us with a $5 contribution!

We are so grateful to Sen. Bernie Sanders and all of his staff and volunteers for pouring their hearts and souls into running a superb presidential campaign that challenged the status quo and energized millions of voters. Sen. Sanders has built a machine that will continue to fight the good fight for many years to come.
And now, after 1.5 years and 16+ contenders, through rallies and rope lines, caucuses and primaries, we now have our Democratic nominee for the President of the United States. Congratulations to our former Vice-President and Senator from the great state of Delaware, Joe Biden.
Missouri Democrats are united in the fight to replace Donald Trump and bring compassion, fairness, and accountability back to our highest office. Even in a tough state like ours, we’ve seen his approval ratings take a hit, along with our Governor’s.
The GOP is feeling anxious. Pitch in $5 if you can, and let’s keep the pressure on.
Just last week, Nicole Galloway and Jill Schupp’s races against Gov. Parson and Congresswoman Wagner were upgraded by the nonpartisan election forecaster Cook Political Report. With strong candidates at the top of the ticket and strong candidates running in the suburbs from Springfield to St. Louis County, Republicans have reason to take us seriously.
We’ll be engaging voters in every county in our state with phone calls, letters, text messages and door-knocking once it’s safe again. This is just the beginning. If you’re able, chip in $5 and let’s take back our state together.
Onward to victory,

Gov. Parson just delivered his final State of the State speech before the election, but what is most telling is what he left out of it.
Under Gov. Parson, 100,000 Missouri children have been kicked off their health care and we now officially lead the nation in the number of uninsured kids.
Under Gov. Parson, Missouri women’s menstrual cycles were literally tracked on a spreadsheet without their knowledge to use as political ammo against reproductive rights.
Under Gov. Parson, our rural hospitals keep closing, leaving 55 Missouri counties without even one hospital.
Under Gov. Parson, thousands remain without access to health care because he refuses to expand Medicaid.
Under Gov. Parson, the opioid epidemic is booming and he refuses to back a statewide drug monitoring program.
Under Gov. Parson, Missouri students are riddled with debt because he refuses to fully fund higher education.
Under Gov. Parson, the gun homicide rate is soaring because he refuses to support common sense safety measures like background checks.
Under Gov. Parson, Republicans are dismantling Clean Missouri to gerrymander districts in their favor because he has emboldened them to ignore the will of the people.
Missourians want a new way, and in November, we have the chance to change direction. Of course, it’ll take a lot of work but we can turn this ship around together.
It’s gonna take canvassing, phone banking, text banking, registering voters, and utilizing the best data and tech tools we have at our disposal.
With barely 11 months to go, can we count on your commitment to this cause by making a $3 contribution right now?
Thank you for jumping in!

Today marks 116 days until Election Day and that makes it a great day to get a brand new Democrat registered to vote.
Take a look at our interactive map and explore your own community. How many folks near you are potential voters? You can give them the nudge they need and bring some new friends along with you to the polls.
We’ve identified about 154,000 likely Democrats all over the state who aren’t currently registered. We’ll mail them their postage-paid, pre-filled voter reg form that needs only to be signed and dropped in the mail. With the ability to track these forms, we will follow up with folks and make sure they’re added to the voter rolls.
This is the easiest (and safest) way for you to directly impact your own community and to get new votes for folks like Nicole Galloway from every nook and cranny of our state.
$2 bucks can get one new voter marching to the ballot box. Please give generously, if you can!
Thank you!
-MDP Voter Reg Team
P.S. While we’re on the topic, have you requested your absentee ballot for the August 4th election? Get to movin’! (We recommend checking the second or last box on the form.)

Alex,
We’ve known it for ages, but the nation’s starting to notice, too: Missouri’s in play. Tonight’s debate showed just why Joe and Nicole are tied with Trump and Parson –– Missourians are sick and tired of the malarkey.
Your support will bring us over the finish line, send Joe to the White House, and make Nicole’s new title “Governor Galloway.” Chip in $10 tonight to get us there.

We moved the needle AGAIN!
Gov. Parson’s COVID approval rating plummeted this week to just 39% and Cook Political Reports upgraded Nicole Galloway’s chances of winning yet again, as Missouri Democrats move one step closer to victory.
We started off the year as “Solid Republican” and now, because of your hard work, we’ve made this a truly competitive race.
Every single dollar, every single phone call, every single text message, and every single conversation with a voter has moved us steadily closer to the Governor's Mansion.
That’s why, in these last 48 days, we’re asking you to give a little bit more to keep this race competitive. Will you chip in $20.20 to keep this momentum going strong?

In case you missed it, the Missouri Democratic Party officially opened our brand new 2020 St. Louis Headquarters to a standing-room only crowd on Saturday!
We are so honored to partner with Nicole Galloway to open this brick and mortar office to serve a huge Democratic community in the Eastern part of the state, but this is just the beginning. We’re going to be active and have boots on the ground from Kansas City to Cape and everywhere in between.
Just this past November, we flipped a Republican seat by a whopping 9 points and we’ve got more pick-up opportunities in places like Springfield, Mid-MO, and the KC suburbs. This will take a long-term commitment in voter and activist engagement, but with your help, that’s exactly what we’re going to do. Can you chip in $10 right now toward a sustained presence in the most competitive areas of our state?
The enthusiasm on Saturday was palpable. Will you join us too?
It’s 2020. Onward to victory!

"So many Republicans wrote us off at the beginning of the year.
But look where we are now:
* Cook Political Reports upgraded Nicole Galloway and Jill Schupp’s chances of winning.
* We’re preparing to register thousands of new Democratic voters all across the state.
* Our statewide Coordinated Campaign is staffed up and in full swing.
* We’re raising an army of volunteers to notarize every absentee ballot that requires it.
* Once-cocky Republican incumbents are feeling the heat facing serious Democratic challengers.
* Gov. Parson is one of the least liked Governors in the country.
No one can dismiss Democrats in 2020 anymore.
Here we are -- heads down, doing the work, with the gains to show for it.
Tomorrow at midnight is our second to last FEC deadline before Election Day. If you can step up in support, now is the time. Pitch in $10 and let’s bring this victory home.
Thank you,

"Alex,
Today is the first day of the 2020 legislative session in Jeff City and I had the honor of cheering on our caucus at the swearing-in ceremony.
While today is cause for celebration, I also know that Republicans have a few big items at the top of their agenda - overturning ""Clean Missouri,"" the ethics and anti-gerrymandering law passed by voters in 2018, strengthening devastating and cruel restrictions on reproductive rights, and passing even more tax breaks for the wealthy instead of the middle class.
But we are lucky and thankful to have each and every Democratic member of the House and Senate leading us through what is sure to be a tumultuous session. Our caucus has already pre-filed bills that aim to close the gun show loophole, expand access to health care, enable automatic voter registration, give teachers a tax credit for classroom expenses they incur, and protect Missourians from being discriminated against because they are gay.
If you're thankful for their hard work, let's support them together. If you can chip in $10, we'll put it to use on canvasses, phone banks, text banks, and digital outreach so we can have the backs of each of our members in this election year.
As you know, we flipped House District 99 and I am so proud to welcome Trish Gunby in to the Missouri House today, but remember that she will be right up for election again this November and it is imperative that we keep her seat and send more Democrats to the Legislature to join her.
We know the plans Republicans have in store for us. Show the Missouri GOP we're not backing down. Pitch in and together, we can keep flipping seats.
Thank you for your support and dedication,
-Lauren Gepford, Executive Director

Under Gov. Parson’s direction, Missouri is re-opening most non-essential businesses today and stay-at-home orders and restrictions are being lifted.
While we continue to see an upward trend in new coronavirus cases, with 368 confirmed just today - the largest in a single day since only this past Saturday - the Missouri Democratic Party will continue to take all necessary steps to help curb its spread and to do our part to protect the health and well-being of our staff, supporters, and fellow citizens.
To that end, we have just announced that our 2020 Democratic State Convention will be held virtually this year. We’ll be having an exciting event with special guest speakers, candidates, elected officials, and will choose the delegates who will represent Missouri at National Convention. We’re looking forward to seeing you on June 12th and 13th!
For the time being, our offices will remain closed to the public, our staff will continue to work from home, and we encourage all county parties and clubs to keep organizing and hosting events online.
But remember that we are moving into the summer of the most important election year any of us have ever seen, and our work of organizing to flip a Governor’s seat, a Congressional seat, and even more House and Senate seats moves full steam ahead.
We’ve had a tremendously positive response from folks who are making phone calls, connecting on social media, registering voters, and tossing their spare change toward getting as many Democrats elected as possible. Thank you, we couldn’t do this without you all!
Please be safe and stay healthy. Stay home as much as you can. Keep washing your hands constantly. Be courteous by wearing a mask when you leave the house. And keep a good six foot distance between yourself and others.
See you virtually for State Convention on June 12th & 13th!
Onward,

This is a big week for Democratic women - three fantastic challengers are debating their Republican opponents THIS Wednesday and Friday!
Tomorrow at 6PM \- Tune in for a debate double header beginning with Rep. Judy Baker, who will take on Caleb Rowden in the fight for a critical State Senate seat in Mid-Missouri. This is one of two seats that will rob Republicans of their veto-proof majority, if we can flip them. Listen live on 93.9 or check out ABC 17 for the livestream.
Then at 8PM \- Join us for the main event! Democrats from all over the state are getting together for a virtual watch party as Senator Kamala Harris takes on Vice President Mike Pence in Salt Lake City. Head over to our Facebook page where you’re encouraged to chat, like, approve, disapprove, and comment live throughout the event!
Friday at 2PM \- We’ll tune in again for the rescheduled Gubernatorial Debate between our State Auditor Nicole Galloway and Mike Parson! This event will be broadcast on KOMU-8 in Columbia and live streamed online as well. Don’t miss the chance to cheer on the next Governor of the State of Missouri!
Watch our amazing candidates debate their Republican opponents this week and chip in $20.20 to make sure we push them over the top on Election Day.
See you tomorrow night!

"Alex,
Today is Election Day in many cities and counties across the state!
But in an unbelievable moment last week, Gov. Parson told thousands of Missourians in his daily briefing that if any of them have safety concerns about the election today, just “don’t go out and vote.”
He’s using his bully pulpit in front of the TV cameras to dissuade you and I from coming out to vote for our city councils and mayors and school boards.
We have to call that what it is - voter suppression.
This is just a practice run for what Gov. Parson will do when August 4th arrives.
And it’s the same thing he’ll do when November 3rd arrives.
So, why not take the opportunity to prepare our response?
Take some simple precautions like wearing your mask, using your hand sanitizer, double check your polling place (some have been consolidated) and then cast your ballot.
In the meantime, get a likely Democrat registered and defeat Gov. Parson one new voter at a time.
Have a safe and happy Election Day and thank you for exercising your civic duty!

"Alex,
Thank you for supporting the Missouri Democratic Party's voter registration program we launched this year - Show Me Votes. I want to provide you an update with what we’ve accomplished so far, and ask you to help us finish out strong by the final voter registration deadline on Wednesday. This year, the Missouri Democratic Party has:
* Crowdfunded over $13,000 to sponsor registering voters across the state on our Voter Fund Map!
* Mailed 20,000 pre-filled voter registration forms with pre-stamped return envelopes. As of last week, 1,000+ of those potential new voters had sent their voter registration forms back in!
* Created a voter registration toolkit and empowered a distributed organizing program with 330+ canvassers hitting 29,000 doors of likely Democratic voters to get them ready to head to the polls!
Thank you to the donors and volunteer leaders who have made these efforts possible. We can’t wait to see the cumulative results later this month.
But right now, we must finish strong on October 7th.
I’m asking you to put your volunteer hat on and make a few follow-up phone calls to the likely Dems we mailed packets to and remind them to return their registration form by 5PM this Wednesday.
Can you join our virtual phone bank to target these soon-to-be voters and get them registered before the deadline? You can even call folks in your own neighborhood if you’d like by inputting your zip code.
We’ve only got about 48 hours left til the cut-off!
Let’s finish strong and make sure we register every last new voter we possibly can. Can you chip in making 10 calls in the next 48 hours before the deadline?
Thank you so much for your help and your hard work,
Lauren Gepford, Executive Director
P.S. We need all hands on deck! Will you forward this on to a friend who wants to register voters?

According to a new report profiled in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch this week, Missouri is now number one in the nation for uninsured young children.
Georgetown University's findings show that our state has seen an astonishing 46% increase in the number of uninsured children under the age of six. Overall, more than 100,000 Missourians have been kicked off Medicaid between August 2018 and July 2019.
We're working harder than ever before to elect a Governor and Congressmembers who will fight to make sure no child goes without health care in this state. Can you pitch in $10 to flip these seats and elect new leaders?
The egregious lack of courage among our Republican elected leaders is astounding, but not surprising to any of us. Together, we will hold them to account for cold-hearted policies that hurt families and children. Together, we will replace them.
Can you make a $10 contribution right now to end this kind of cruel extremism in Missouri?
In solidarity,

Just wanted to make sure you saw our message. We’re spending Valentine’s Day weekend raising contributions to elect a pro-choice Governor and I’m happy to report that we’re ¾ of the way to our goal!

Do you love women and reproductive freedom? Hate creepy men like this guy secretly tracking your menstrual cycle? Us, too!
Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services
^^^This is Randall Williams, head of the Missouri Dept. of Health. With Gov. Mike Parson's blessing, he kept track of patients’ periods without their knowledge in order to fuel their anti-abortion crusades.
Breaking up is easy to do and the best Valentine’s Day gift we could give you is a new Governor [[URL REDACTED]] a new Director of Health to boot.
Will you show your support for a new pro-choice Governor by making a $10 donation in Randy’s honor today?
Then, join us on social media Monday, when we’ll be calling attention to this outrageous intrusion and will announce the funds raised from this campaign using the hashtag #TrackThisRandy.
This is not the guy we want making decisions about our health. Show the GOP that we will do everything in our power to protect reproductive rights by showing some love for Democrats this Valentine’s Day.

Missouri voters, you’re up! Today is your day to choose who is the best candidate to defeat Donald Trump this November!
I’ll make this quick, so you can get out to vote - we’ve also got a major Medicaid Expansion initiative on the line this year. And the Republican-majority Legislature is running scared.
In 2018, voters showed up and passed four huge progressive ballot measures with over 60% of the vote each time. It was a phenomenal success on the part of organizers, labor unions, and everyday Democrats all around the state. That’s the kind of enthusiasm we need to expand Medicaid and take back the Governor’s mansion.
We’re building an army to send to the polls. With our very first end-of-quarter deadline of 2020 sneaking up on us, will you contribute $10 today and we’ll put it to use getting every single Democratic-leaning voter ready to march to the ballot box.
It’s incredibly important that we come out even stronger than we did in the midterms. Join us today!

Breaking news in the Governor’s race --
New polling shows Nicole Galloway down by just 2 points against Gov. Parson!
After months of flaunting not wearing a mask and contracting coronavirus himself, Parson’s disastrous mishandling of this public health crisis finally came home to roost. Nicole is exactly the leader we need, and she’s running a strong race that’s closed the gap from double digits down to well within the margin of error.
But, we know this is all going to come down to turnout.
With a dwindling number of days until Election Day, we must have the resources to get every single voter to the polls when it matters most. Can you support our statewide GOTV program with a contribution of $10 right now?
Missouri is in a special place this cycle. The wind is at our backs and Democrats have all the momentum.
We’re down to just 25 days until we know what kind of future is in store for us. Every single dollar from grassroots supporters like you is getting put to work immediately to make Nicole Galloway our next Governor. Will you make a $10 or $20 commitment today?
We’re so close to making this happen, but we cannot slow down now.
Thank you for your support, your volunteer hours, and checking with your friends and family to make sure they have a plan to vote.
Let’s bring it home,

For only the third time in our history, the House of Representatives has voted to impeach the President of the United States for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.
While the House performs its solemn duty, we look inward at our state and call on our Republican leaders to stand up for the rule of law.
In the Show-Me state, we're not easily fooled. President Trump's abuses of power have been on display since the beginning and Missourians have taken notice. With the President's declining approval rating, combined with flipping a suburban Missouri House seat in a special election, and big wins in Virginia, Kentucky, and Louisiana, voters are taking this frustration to the ballot box.
We are competing for every vote in every single corner of our state in 2020. Democrats' message of transparency, fairness, and accountability resonate. We can flip gubernatorial, congressional, House, and Senate seats but only if we go at it together.
Contribute $10 and we'll put it to work knocking doors, making phone calls, sending text messages, registering new voters, holding Republicans accountable, and electing Democrats up and down the ticket.
We have a lot of work ahead of us. Thank you for all your support.

"Alex,
Gov. Parson started off this year totally convinced his election was in the bag. Now that he’s more uneasy by the day about his prospects against rising star Nicole Galloway, he’s resorted to sticking red tape between you and the ballot box.
The Governor told us on live TV yesterday that “We’re not going to overhaul our voting system because of coronavirus. I’m not for that.”
And the entire Missouri GOP is falling in line.
In the closing hours of this year’s legislative session, Republicans have paid only the most minimal lip service to expanding your right to vote during this pandemic.
Under the guise of voter fraud prevention, none of their bills truly make voting any safer or any more convenient. In fact, some even strengthen the unconstitutional Voter ID provisions that judges have already struck down.
But there’s something we can all do to push back.
Register new voters.
Turns out there’s a lot more Democratic leaning folks out there than you might have imagined. About 154,000 of them actually.
You can take the first step to getting your neighbors ready to hit the polls in November by (safely) getting them registered today.
$2 per person will mail a postage-paid, pre-filled registration form to these identified potential voters so that all they have to do is sign and drop in the mailbox. Forms are tracked so that we can follow up individually until each one makes it back to their Board of Elections and a new Democrat is added to the rolls.
Explore the map we created.
Zoom in on your county and precinct to see the kind of impact you can have.
It’s less than six months until Election Day. Can we count on you to chip in $10 and bring five new voters to the polls with you?
Thanks for your support!
And don’t forget to vote in your local elections on June 2nd!

We are blown away right now by an amazing performance from a history-making nominee for Vice-President of the United States. Sen. Harris is razor sharp in holding Pence and Trump accountable for their actions.
November 3rd will have enormous consequences for millions of us, and we can count on this team to lead on the most critical issue of this election - healthcare and the coronavirus.
Joe and Kamala are the difference between rent being made, small businesses surviving, and testing and treatment for everyone who needs it.
Missouri’s chances to elect a new President, Governor, and a couple of new Congresswomen haven’t been so perfectly in our sights in a long time.
And we’re keeping our eyes on the prize for the next 27 days. Chip in $20.20 and your contribution means more conversations with voters, more phone calls, more targeted ads, and getting more folks to the ballot box for the next four weeks.
We couldn’t be more inspired and determined to elect her to help lead our country and stand by the President’s side on the world stage.
If you’re just as inspired, pitch in $20.20 and let’s send Donald Trump into retirement once and for all!
Onward to victory!

Besides anti-gerrymandering laws, the other thing Republicans seem to fear most [[URL REDACTED]] voting.
The supermajority rejected a truly progressive, vote-by-mail bill in the final hours of the 2020 legislative session last week, but we are proud that Democrats were able to secure a narrow expansion of absentee voting for the upcoming election season.
It’s a bit tricky, a bit convoluted, and doesn’t go nearly far enough, but we still savor our small victories.
And the folks over at Missouri Voter Protection Coalition made an easy, shareable info sheet to walk you through the new law.
To sum it up, voters who are 65+ or high-risk will have more options to request and return their absentee ballots and do not need to have them notarized.
For the rest of us, we no longer need to state an excuse to request our ballots, but we’re limited to the same old rules as before - we can only request by mail, return by mail, and ballots must be notarized. Remember, notaries cannot charge to notarize ballots and most banks are happy to provide this service for you. Just bring a current ID.
So, we’ve got a little bit more leeway for how we can exercise our right to vote, now we must ensure that we have the numbers to put a new Governor and a new Secretary of State in office and make vote-by-mail the law.
Register a voter and you will turn the tide in Missouri!
There are 154,000 likely Democratic voters who just need a nudge to get registered and ready to head to the polls.
Check out how many potential voters are in your own county and precinct with our interactive map. If you can, chip in $10 to get five of them registered!
With each new voter, we march closer to victory.

"The Missouri Legislature is on an extraordinary roll this week, Alex.
Called back to Jeff City to take action on coronavirus, Republicans are checking every single item off their right-wing wish list instead.
Here’s what they’re doing:
* Legalizing brass knuckles. (We kid you not.)
* Giving tax breaks to people who own airplanes.
* Repealing the Clean Missouri law on ethics reform that YOU passed in 2018.
* Stripping county health departments of their authority during a pandemic.
* Proposing a “Guns Everywhere” bill that allows guns at schools, bars, casinos, churches, airports, courthouses, sporting events, college campuses, and on public transit.
Here’s what they’re NOT doing:
* Passing a relief package for out-of-work Missouri families and devastated small businesses.
* Making it easier and safer to vote during a pandemic.
* Passing MONA so that you can’t be fired or denied housing for being gay, for example.
With Nicole Galloway as your next Governor, you will have a leader who will veto these terrible bills. With Yinka Faleti as your next Secretary of State, you will have a leader who will expand voting access.
Right now, there are 154,000 likely Democrats in Missouri who are not currently registered to vote. We’ll need every single one of them in November and we’re embarking on an ambitious project to reach as many of them as possible.
>>For $2, you can get your neighbor ready to cast their ballot. Can we count on you to sponsor a couple new voters to push Nicole and Yinka over the finish line?
Thank you for your work to elect new leadership in Jeff City!

Please RSVP as soon as possible. We’ve had tremendous interest in this event and need an accurate head count for streaming purposes.
Come hang out with us, get excited for this election season, and let’s flip some seats in November!
Onward,

"Alex,
We all know when Democrats show up, we win. It’s a numbers game and we need every single Democratic-leaning voter out there to show up on November 3rd. That’s why we’re so proud to announce our Adopt-A-Precinct Program today.
With this interactive map, you can see how many unregistered, Democratic-leaning voters there are in any given county or precinct so you can target a new voter and get them registered. Just $20 registers 10 new voters! Check out your own neighborhood and see the impact you can have on your friends and neighbors!
How does it work?
You choose how many new voters you want to sponsor and where. We mail pre-filled voter registration cards in a prepaid return envelope which means all the recipient has to do is sign their name and drop it in the mailbox. We track the registrations to make sure they arrive at their local Board of Elections and follow-up with anyone who hasn’t mailed theirs back in.
We’re committed to competing in every single corner of this state and we aren’t leaving anyone behind. Our scope is huge and we have an ambitious goal of registering 500 new voters this week.
This is truly going to take a group effort. Will you chip in and get new voters registered and ready to hit the polls?
We’ve got lofty goals, but together, we can replace Gov. Parson and Congresswoman Wagner and flip even more seats in the state legislature. Thank you for your support!

"Alex,
Show-Me State voters are setting records!
Despite everything Gov. Mike Parson and Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft have done to muddy, complicate, and outright block anything that makes voting easier for you, you aren’t letting them deter you in this election or any other.
More than 120,000 Missouri voters have already cast their ballots and we’ve still got 14 more days to go!
Here’s a refresher of your voting options, so you can choose what works best for you:
1. Vote absentee in-person right now at your Board of Elections or County Clerk’s office! Most offices are open 8AM-5PM Monday through Friday. Some regions like St. Louis, Kansas City, and others have satellite locations and expanded hours, including Saturday hours. Find your Board of Elections or County Clerk’s office here and head to the polls today.
2. Vote on Election Day on Tuesday, November 3rd! Polls are open from 6AM-7PM, find yours here. And remember, if you are in line by 7PM, you can still vote.
We know exactly who makes voting in this state as cumbersome and inconvenient as possible and that’s why we’re going to vote them out today and everyday until Election Day.
We’re on our way to beating records set in 2008, so make sure you have a plan to vote and make sure all your friends and family do too.
See you at the polls,
-Missouri Democratic Party
P.S. Forward this email on to anyone who needs a reminder about all the ways they can vote this year!

"Alex,
One of these states is not like the other.
Apple News
Gov. Parson hasn’t done anything to stop rising cases, hospitalizations, and deaths - and we can plainly see where that’s gotten us.
But remember, he failed us long before coronavirus came along.
Last year, he kicked 100,000 Missouri kids off their health insurance. Seven rural hospitals were closed. And his administration is suing to strike down the ACA and end coverage for Missourians with pre-existing conditions.
Make no mistake - health care is on the ballot.
But with your help, we can send the Governor into retirement and keep the GOP’s hands off our health care. Can you chip in $10 or $20 right now to make sure Missouri families stay protected and covered?
Our next leader has a true crisis to handle the moment she is sworn into office. So we’re treating each of these last 20 days like Election Day because we know what we could lose with 4 more years of Republican “leadership.”
We’re on the cusp of an upset victory that will make national headlines - but only if we’re all in this fight together. Pitch in $10 and let’s finish the job.
Thank you!

"Alex,
The 2020 Legislative Session ended Friday evening with both heartbreak and joy. We’re very proud of the bills and provisions our Democratic caucus introduced and passed, as well as what they were able to block.
Let’s take a look at what is being sent to the Governor’s desk for his signature:
* A provision to ensure COVID-19 testing is provided at no cost out-of-pocket for anyone whose doctor recommends testing.
* A narrow expansion of absentee voting which eliminates the excuse and notary requirements for voters 65+ or high-risk. All other voters will not need to state an excuse, but will need to notarize. A full and robust vote-by-mail bill introduced by Democrats was rejected by Republicans.
* The Sexual Assault Survivor’s Bill of Rights sponsored by Sen. Jill Schupp which will require all hospitals to provide rape kits and prohibits victims from being charged for rape kit testing.
We’re especially grateful our members blocked some truly extreme measures from becoming law:
* A dangerous new “Guns Everywhere” bill that would have allowed guns in schools, bars, casinos, churches, airports, courthouses, sporting events, college campuses, and on public transit.
* A provision endorsed by SOS Jay Ashcroft that would have strengthened Voter ID laws.
Meanwhile, the Republican majority:
* Refused to take up any further discussion of COVID-19 relief for families and small businesses.
* Voted to send Clean Missouri back to the ballot in November in hopes of getting a second chance to keep gerrymandered districts in place.
* Blocked the Prescription Drug Monitoring Program so that Missouri remains the only state in the union to not utilize this tool to combat opioid addiction.
* Let payday lenders tack on yet another fee to indebted consumers.
* Refused to classify frontline food, grocery, and pharmacy workers as temporary first responders while the pandemic is ongoing.
* Blocked the passage of MONA, Missouri’s Non-Discrimination Act for an astonishing 22 years in a row.
* Refused to address the continued issues with receiving unemployment assistance or with childcare for workers forced to return to their jobs.
* Legalized brass knuckles.
Democrats worked tirelessly to keep the GOP’s dangerous antics at bay and push legislation that improves the lives of people all across the state. The best thing we can do to thank them is to send them some brand new colleagues next year.
Republicans are sticking as much red tape as they can between you and the ballot box and that's why not a single one of us can sit this out. Take the pledge to vote on November 3rd.
When we show up, we win.
Onward to victory,

"Hey Alex,
Do you love women and reproductive freedom? Hate creepy men like this guy secretly tracking your menstrual cycle? Us, too!
Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services
^^^This is Randall Williams, head of the Missouri Dept. of Health. With Gov. Mike Parson's blessing, he kept track of patients’ periods without their knowledge in order to fuel their anti-abortion crusades.
Breaking up is easy to do and the best Valentine’s Day gift we could give you is a new Governor [[URL REDACTED]] a new Director of Health to boot.
Will you show your support for a new pro-choice Governor by making a $10 donation in Randy’s honor today?
Then, join us on social media Monday, when we’ll be calling attention to this outrageous intrusion and will announce the funds raised from this campaign using the hashtag #TrackThisRandy.
This is not the guy we want making decisions about our health. Show the GOP that we will do everything in our power to protect reproductive rights by showing some love for Democrats this Valentine’s Day.
Thank you for all your support in this fight!

"Alex,
The end of the Republican National Convention couldn’t have come soon enough but boy, was it a good reminder how critical it is that we fight for every single vote in every single precinct in our state - for Joe, for Nicole, and for every Democrat up and down the ballot.
We’ve got a do-nothing Governor, and an Auditor ready to act on day one. We’ve got long-time members of Congress shaken up by strong Democratic challengers. We’ve got competitive State Senate races that will determine a new balance of power in the Legislature.
The stakes are sky-high.
That’s why we’re building out plans for the massive GOTV effort it’s going to take to push them over the finish line in about 67 days.
That’s why we’re in the midst of registering voters online, by mail, and by safe “knock and drop” because we’re committed to showing these likely Democratic future voters that their voice matters.
That’s why we’re hiring and training the field and digital organizers who are our boots on the ground.
And that’s why we’ve hired a Voter Protection Director to take every action necessary to safeguard our votes.
We’re strengthening the infrastructure that is vital to winning in November. Chip in $20.20 right now and we can put your contribution to work this weekend.
Thank you for everything,
-Missouri Democratic Party

The good news just keeps rolling in!
A brand new poll out today from SLU/YouGov shows Nicole Galloway in a statistical tie with Gov. Parson.
With 100 days to go, Galloway has dramatically slashed Parson’s lead down to just 2 percentage points -- 41% to 39%.
This comes one week after U.S. News & World Report upgraded Galloway’s chances of winning yet again, taking us just one step away from declaring this race an official “toss-up!”
We’ve always known Missouri isn’t as red as they say. Now we’re seeing the data and the research to back that up.
Let’s be clear though, we’re the underdogs here. And we will need every single vote in every single county in every part of this state if we’re going to send Nicole to the Governor’s mansion.
We’re hiring digital and field organizers and recruiting hundreds of volunteers to make sure we bring this victory home.
We’re just over 100 days out. Every moment counts. Chip in $10 or $25 or whatever you can and let’s elect Nicole Galloway as the next Governor of the State of Missouri.

We have BIG news!
We are so pleased to announce that Fmr. Georgia House Democratic Leader Stacey Abrams, the 2018 candidate for Governor and founder of Fair Fight, will be joining us live for the Missouri Democratic Party’s Virtual State Convention Welcome Night event next Friday evening, June 12th!
RSVP now and let us know you’re coming!
Leader Abrams ran a remarkable campaign that excited Democrats all across the country, earning immense national attention, and giving hope to folks in states like ours who were particularly impacted by the conservative wave of 2016.
Facing extreme voting rights restrictions and purges during that election, Abrams came up short by only about 55,000 votes, bringing in the most Democratic votes ever cast in Georgia in the closest election since 1966. Now, as Founder of Fair Fight, she’s continuing to protect our right to vote and push for election reform in states all over the country.
This is an event you do not want to miss! Please RSVP today!
We are living through unprecedented times, and that calls for unprecedented action. We are so lucky to have someone like Leader Abrams share her experiences with us as we gear up to flip seats all over the state.
Thank you,

In light of the COVID-19 outbreak, the Missouri Democratic Party is taking all necessary steps to help curb its spread in Missouri and to do our part to protect the health and well-being of our staff, supporters, and fellow citizens. As of Friday, March 13th, MDP has postponed all in-person party events, meetings, and fundraisers through at least Friday, May 1st. MDP offices will be closed and all staff will be working remotely until at then as well. Wherever possible, we will hold events and meetings virtually; those that cannot be held virtually will be rescheduled.
We urge all county parties, Democratic clubs, and allied organizations to postpone or cancel in-person events and follow the guidance of the CDC and state and local Departments of Health. We’re practicing social distancing, rigorous hand-washing, and staying inside as much as possible, and we encourage you to do the same.
This epidemic again highlights so many inequities in our state and gives us a renewed sense of urgency in our fight for paid sick leave, healthcare access for all, expanded worker protections, expanded voting rights, and rural broadband access.
Even in these unprecedented circumstances, the important work of this organization moves forward. This is an election year and we are continuing a robust advocacy of our candidates, policies, and values. We will monitor the situation closely and adjust steps as necessary but until we’re through the thick of this, we’re making a quick transition to online campaigning. While door-knocking is on hiatus right now, we are committed to making more phone calls, sending more texts, creating more digital content, and connecting to even more voters online.
As we transition into an online-focused presence, here’s how you can stay involved and updated:
1. Follow us on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.
2. Forward this email to like-minded friends who can sign up for email updates here.
3. Sign up to volunteer for phone banks, text banks, letter writing campaigns, and postcard campaigns.
4. Follow your local newspaper online and consume the most credible information out there.
We need our volunteers and supporters now more than ever. Be safe and stay healthy. Get in touch with us via email and social media.

"Alex,
We made it through the final quarter of 2019 and surpassed expectations, thanks to you! Our long-time supporters stepped up yet again with endless energy and enthusiasm and we saw an outpouring of new supporters ready for a fresh start for Missouri.
Because of your generosity, we are knocking doors, making phone calls, sending text messages, registering voters, and rallying our base in the New Year.
But we do have one more thing to ask of you: if you haven't yet filled out our End of Year Survey, please take this last opportunity to tell us what you're focused on in 2020.
We want your opinion on what we're doing well, what we need to work on, and what your priorities are so we can improve this organization. We are your Missouri Democratic Party and we couldn't exist without your engagement and support.
Thank you for everything you've done this quarter. Take a minute to share your opinion before Sunday, January 5th.
Happy New Year!

On this May Day installment of #VoterRegFriday, we want to make sure you’re ready to vote in the June 2nd local elections happening in many cities and counties across the state.
If you plan to vote in-person, be courteous and wear a mask and sanitize your hands before and after voting. Polls are open from 6AM-7PM.
If you wish to vote from the comfort of your home, we’ve attached the Missouri Secretary of State’s Absentee Ballot Request Form for you! The deadline to request a ballot is May 20th. Here’s how it works:
* Print your request form and fill it out completely. Check a reason for requesting a ballot. (If you have not voted in person before, you may be required to include a copy of a form of ID. Check out the bottom of the request form for detailed info.)
* Mail it to your local election authority - find yours here. (Do not mail your form to the Secretary of State’s office).
* Your local election authority will then mail you your official ballot.
* Read the instructions carefully. Mark your ballot and return it ASAP. It must be received by 7PM on Election Day to count.
* Congratulations, you’ve voted!
We won’t sugar coat this. It’s crystal clear that there’s a lot of red tape and unnecessary hurdles to jump through to vote in this state.
And our Republican governor and Republican legislature want to keep it that way.
Don’t let them discourage you.
Show up.
When we do, we win.
-Missouri Democratic Party
P.S. You can take a look at all that red tape for yourself on the Secretary of State’s website.

Alex,
This is the Missouri GOP’s last, desperate attempt to try not to lose their fourth ballot initiative in a row.
In a disgraceful move on the very last day he could legally do it, Gov. Parson has moved the Medicaid Expansion ballot initiative from the November election to the August election.
We have less than 70 days until August 4th.
Parson is playing the same tricks he played with Right to Work. When they’re terrified of losing, they move progressive issues to an election with lower turnout.
They figure that you and your neighbors will definitely show up for the presidential election in November, but they’re hoping you won’t in August.
It didn’t work for them last time, and Right to Work suffered an overwhelming defeat in August 2018. Now, we’ve got to show up again.
This is going to take a lot of phone calls, a lot of postcards, a lot of text message reminders, and when it’s safe to, a lot of door knocks.
Will you chip in $10 to start this ground game off strong?
It’s all hands on deck.
Thank you for your support,
-Jordan H., Finance Director, Missouri Democratic Party

"Alex,
Have you heard the news? The nonpartisan election forecaster Cook Political Report shows top Missouri Democrats are breaking away from their Republican opponents! Nicole Galloway and Jill Schupp are steadily working their way toward “toss-up” status in a tough state.
This ratings change shows that the work we’ve been doing on the ground - and now, on our computers - is making a difference and voters have taken notice. Now is not the time to let up. If you’re in a position to support our Democratic candidates, chip in $5 now.
Republican insiders have privately recognized that they are on shaky ground in suburban Missouri. Fueled by gross mismanagement of the coronavirus response and changing attitudes on gun safety and school funding that have been brewing for a long time, both Gov. Parson and Congresswoman Wagner are pleading to national Republicans for help to save their seats.
Will you continue to build up this momentum all the way through November 3rd? If you can pitch in $5 right now, we’ll put it to work shoring up every vote in every targeted precinct to elect a new Governor and a new member of Congress.
Thank you for working so hard to elect Democrats.
Onward,

What are you doing TODAY to elect Nicole Galloway and Democrats up and down the ballot?
The race for Governor is in a dead-heat so that means we’re doubling down on making phone calls, sending text messages, dropping lit, and having one on one conversations with voters across the state.
Sign up right now to volunteer and push our candidates over the finish line with each phone call you make or text message you send.
We’re going to win by outworking the other side, but we can’t do that without you.
We’ve got something for everyone - so make these last 8 days count by signing up for a shift and get to work tonight.

"Alex,
What do you call legislators who get rich off the very laws they write and pass themselves?
Corrupt.
Congresswoman Vicky Hartzler has been passing laws that enrich her family businesses for years.
To the tune of a whopping half a million dollars.
Her family farm and tractor company received hundreds of thousands of dollars in public relief funds in just the last two years, even though they’re valued between $1 million and $5 million dollars.
Corruption is a story as old as time.
Vicky has been real comfortable getting rich off the backs of 4th District taxpayers, but now, the time has come for you to tell her enough is enough.
Lindsey Simmons is a young mother and wife of an active-duty serviceman running to replace Hartzler and end this blatant corruption.
She’s part of something really special that’s happening in Missouri this year.
Fundraising records are being broken. National attention is pouring in. Districts and seats are in play that no one dreamt would be in play this time last year.
We’re on the cusp of some big victories.
But it’s going to take two big things - your generous financial support and massive voter outreach.
You can stretch your dollars and make a huge impact on two critically important causes with this one, simple contribution. All donations raised from this email will be split 50/50 toward Lindsey’s campaign and the Missouri Democratic Party’s statewide field and GOTV programs.
Together, we can send Lindsey Simmons to the Capitol and Vicky Hartzler into retirement!
This is a unique opportunity to kill two birds with one stone. Give $20.20 or any amount you can afford and your support has double the impact!
Thanks for your work to keep the House in Democratic hands!

We’re smack in the middle of the last weekend of GOTV before this crazy ride is over, so I’ll keep this short because I know you’ve got a lot going on.
Tonight at midnight is the last end-of-month deadline of the entire 2020 election cycle. If you haven’t made your final investment in Missouri’s future, today is the day to do it. Pitch in an extra $10 bucks or whatever you can.
Your donation means we can make more phone calls, knock more doors, place more targeted ads, give more rides to the polls, and send more text messages tomorrow, Monday, and Tuesday.
We’re in the fight of our lives for the next three days. Here’s what we’re doing:
* Turning out the precincts we need so Nicole Galloway can overcome the Republican vote
* Ending the Missouri GOP’s veto-proof majority in the Legislature by focusing on the SD-15 and SD-19 races in Columbia and St. Louis County
* Turning out both Democratic and independent voters to elect Jill Schupp as our next Congresswoman in MO-02
Missouri is in a dead heat. Give it everything you can.
Happy Halloween!

Alex,
We've got 200 days, 4,800 hours, 288,000 minutes (approximately) until we make our voices heard! As you can tell, we are literally counting down the days until we can vote Donald Trump out of office, elect Nicole Galloway as our next Governor, flip another couple of State House seats, and pass progressive policies!
Election Day is final. We’ve got the time we’ve got and not a second more. With only 200 days left to go, let’s reach as many voters as possible.
Just $2 is all it takes to send a pre-filled, postage-paid voter registration form to a likely Democrat in any county in Missouri, and track that form until it’s returned to the election authority, allowing us to follow up and engage with every single potential voter.
Can you spare a couple bucks to register one new voter today?
Make sure to double check your own registration and update any changes here and forward this email on to friends and family to get even more folks connected to this project.
It’s on each of us to get a new voter or two registered and ready to hit the polls.
You all have responded so enthusiastically to this call-to-action, thank you!

New internal polling released this morning shows Biden up by 2 over Trump in Missouri!
If you really wanna stick it to the GOP, today’s the day to send them a message loud and clear that the Trump era in Missouri is over.
In 35 days, we will defeat them and expand Medicaid.
In 126 days, we will defeat them and end gerrymandering, elect a new Governor, send new folks to Congress, and flip important House and Senate seats.
Barack Obama lost narrowly in 2008 and Democrats still won across the board. A good candidate at the top of the ticket can raise up every candidate below them.
Anything is possible. Put it all on the line.
Pitch in $10 before the deadline at midnight tonight.

It’s official! “Show Me Change,” our unified, statewide, coordinated campaign dedicated to electing Democrats up and down the ticket launches this week!
We’re bringing on new staff with a long history of winning in red states, and we plan to go after every vote from Buchanan County to Cape and Greene County to Jefferson to elect Nicole Galloway as Governor along with a whole new slate of Democrats for Lt. Governor, Secretary of State, Attorney General, and Treasurer.
Coming just four points shy of flipping the 2nd congressional district in 2018, we’re targeting every leaning Democratic voter to make Jill Schupp our next Congresswoman representing the suburbs of St. Louis.
We’ve identified thousands of Democrats, moderates, lapsed voters, and independents out there looking to make a big change this November, and we’ll be making thousands of phone calls, sending text messages, mailing postcards, and organizing online to reach them in the most streamlined and efficient operation ever.
If you’re committed to pushing our statewide and congressional candidates over the finish line, and are able to chip in $5 today, let’s launch the Show Me Change coordinated campaign!
Along with challenging Republicans in every Congressional district we don’t already hold, we’re building on our victory flipping the 99th House district and challenging Republican House seats in suburbs all across the state.
>>Pitch in $5 if you can.
Your hard work, your phone calls, your spare change, and your conversations with neighbors are going to elect a new Governor for our state this year. This is such an exciting time for our party!
Thank you!

We’ve finally reached the end of the quarter and the last day to file to run for office in 2020! Now that we’ve got candidates for every statewide office, every congressional district, and over 100 state rep seats from Hannibal to Joplin, here comes the hard part.
Every day Democrats are putting pressure on Republicans to sign on to Paid Leave For All, Medicaid expansion, Vote-By-Mail, expanded voter registration, and better worker protections for our grocery, pharmacy, and food workers. With a new Governor in Jeff City and freshly flipped seats in the state legislature, we can win these hard-fought battles.
If you’re able to, chip in $5 and we’ll put it to use making phone calls, registering new voters, hosting text banks, and connecting with volunteers and supporters online to get every last voter we can to the ballot box come November.

"Alex,
Mike Parson is drowning - and the GOP is throwing him a lifeline.
Nicole Galloway is within just two points of Mike Parson and national Republicans are so scared they sent millions of dollars to Missouri this week to try to save his seat.
They never thought they’d have so much trouble winning here, but when you field a strong Democratic candidate, push hard for things like protecting pre-existing conditions, and your fumbling incumbent is too scared of Donald Trump to do anything to stop a deadly virus, you get millions of Missourians fired up to make a big change at the ballot box.
You’re already showing up in massive numbers to vote absentee this year, but there are still thousands and thousands more that must show up for us to win.
Can we count on you to help make sure no voter is left behind? Chip in $20 and we will break records getting every single eligible voter to the polls.
Remember, the GOP is pouring money in because we’re the strongest we’ve been in a long time and if each one of us gives it everything we’ve got, and then just a little bit more, we are going to elect a new President and a new Governor and new Democrats up and down the ticket.
Your support has never been more critical than in these final 13 days. Pitch in to get one more voter to the polls by chipping in $20 today.

Today is a red alert level Election Year deadline.
It’s the last day to register to vote or update your registration in order to cast your ballot for Medicaid expansion on August 4th.
Have you moved? Did you get married and change your name? Unsure if your info is up-to-date?
Right now is the time to check it. Click here.
Whew, okay, you’re all good to go?
Then why don’t you request your absentee ballot today and get the whole thing over with right now?
We’re not gonna sugarcoat this. Republicans are making it harder to vote during the pandemic.
This is how you push back.
They’re closing polling places, causing long lines, and basically throwing obstacles in front of you as you’re walking up to the voting booth.
Request your absentee ballot, bypass their red tape, and make history by voting for Medicaid expansion.
Absentee voting is so convenient - we recommend checking the second or last box to make it even more convenient.
It’s a simple action you can take today, but the impact will be felt for a generation.
Thank you,

Normally, during this beautiful spring weather, we’d be asking you to volunteer with us for canvassing days, but since we’re stuck at home, we have a backup plan! We launched our #VoterRegFriday program in February to make sure every likely Democrat in our state is registered to vote.
It’s a lofty goal, but together, we’re going to make a huge impact.
Our interactive map does the canvassing for you! Check out how many unregistered, likely Democrats there are in your own neighborhood and for every $2 you contribute, we can turn one person into a new voter. Can you pitch in $10 today and get 5 new voters ready to go to the polls?
Thank you for all your help and support. Please forward this email to friends and family who can help register Missouri voters too!

Thank you so much for making this such a successful quarter for the Missouri Democratic Party and for all our candidates from the State House to the White House! We depend on your support and you did not let us down!
We’re making these last 33 days count where it matters most.
So far, we’ve knocked and dropped lit at thousands of doors, had tens of thousands of one-on-one conversations, and sent hundreds of thousands of text messages. All aimed at targeted voters in targeted districts and precincts that must turn out to put us over the top.
We’re going to win by outworking the other side, but we can’t do that without you.
Sign up today for a volunteer shift to make phone calls, drop lit at doors, register new voters before the October 7th deadline, or send reminder text messages to everyone who needs a little push.
Every action you take puts us one step closer to victory.
Will you sign up and get to work this weekend?

We have a very special, nationally-known guest speaker who will be joining us -- and ticket holders will be the very first to know who it is!
Mark your calendars and be sure to reserve your sofa and a rocks glass (we’ll have a recipe!) for an all-virtual version of our longest-running, statewide, Democratic event to kick-off the fall election season.
This will be a jam-packed night featuring some of our amazing slate of candidates including:
Auditor Nicole Galloway, next Governor of the State of Missouri
State Sen. Jill Schupp, Candidate for U.S. Congress (MO-02)
Councilwoman Alissia Canady, Candidate for Lt. Governor
Mr. Yinka Faleti, Candidate for Secretary of State
Mr. Rich Finneran, Candidate for Attorney General
Rep. Vicki Englund, Candidate for State Treasurer
Purchase a “table” for you and 9 of your closest friends or grab an individual ticket and support our statewide, coordinated effort to send a few, good Democrats to Jeff City, the Governor’s Mansion, and the U.S. Capitol.
We’ve got all the info and details online at [[URL REDACTED]]
Grab your ticket now and be the first to know who our Keynote Speaker will be! See you on Sept. 12th!

"Alex,
We’ve watched Gov. Parson refuse to take the reins and lead the response to the coronavirus pandemic for months.
But now, he’s signed a no-bid contract to have an out-of-state consulting firm try to do his work for him.
The State of Missouri has already paid a whopping $800,000 to these consultants, but as Nicole Galloway said this week, “All we have to show for (the contract) is rising infections, delayed school reopenings, a positivity rate over 10% and a spot on the White House Coronavirus Task Force's ‘Red Zone.’”
Gov. Parson has abdicated his responsibilities. But in 58 days, we can elect a leader who’s not afraid of the hard work and the tough decisions.
We’ve hired over 20 organizers all across the state who are recruiting and training volunteers, holding phone banks and text banks, organizing lit drops, and manning field offices in order to elect Democrats from the top of the ticket to the bottom.
Pitch in $20.20, or whatever you can, and support the work of our boots on the ground.
If we work together every single day from here on out, we will push Nicole Galloway over the finish line and bring true leadership to the Governor’s Office.
Can we count on your support of $20.20 today?
Thank you!

"Alex,
Our fumbling Republican leaders have created new absentee voting rules that require a flow chart to follow and they’ve patted themselves on the back for it.
While they conveniently vote absentee year after year, they put obstacle after obstacle into law to make voting just a little bit harder for YOU.
But what they can’t do is stop you from registering voters.
And that’s what makes them nervous.
There are about 154,000 identified likely Democrats in every part of this state - rural, suburban, and urban potential voters that you can ask to step up and join the fight.
The more new folks we bring into the fold, the more immune we are to their voter suppression tactics.
$2 bucks is all it costs to safely register a new voter.
They’ll receive a postage-paid, pre-filled voter registration form straight to their home, sign their name, and drop it in the mail. Forms are tracked so we can follow the process from start to finish.
It’s that simple and easy - no flow chart needed.
The fact is that time is running out and there are a lot of people to register. Can we count on you to step up and make a $20 commitment to bring 10 new voters to the polls?
Thank you for organizing right from your home as we all deal with the pandemic outside.
Stay safe, wear your mask, and commit to adding 10 new voters to march alongside you to the ballot box.
Onward,
-MDP Voter Reg Team
P.S. Pass this email on to folks who don’t yet know about our voter registration project!

"Alex,
It’s your 3-hour warning! Are you going to vote after work?
Remember that polls close at 7 o’clock today, so be prepared and mindful of how much time you have. Make your plan right now.
Check your polling place here before you leave work so you can head straight there.
If you are already in line by 7PM, you can still vote - please stay in line.
Have any trouble with your ballot being accepted? Call 1-866-OUR-VOTE.
We know our leaders have done a great deal to make voting a little more difficult and a little more inconvenient. But we’re not staying home and you’re not staying home. This election means a great deal.
Deliver the Missouri GOP their first defeat of 2020 by voting Yes on 2 today.
Already voted? Or have your voting plan in place and you’re good to go? Then organize a couple people and get them out to vote before 7:00! Send a text, make a call, or shoot an email to a few friends who could use the reminder.
We’re all in this together. Do your part and we’re going to bring a big victory home tonight.
Thank you!

"Alex,
We’ve been waiting for this day since 2016.
We are officially 100 days out from the November 3rd election.
You only have 100 more days to organize your friends, your block, and your neighborhood. Only 100 more days to phonebank, drop lit, send text messages, mail postcards, write a letter to the editor, and contribute your hard-earned dollars to the effort.
It’s a gorgeous Sunday today, so we’ll make this short.
We’re hiring the organizers, mobilizing the volunteers, and coordinating the kind of field operation that we will need to wring every vote out of every county and lift Nicole Galloway to victory.
But we need all the boots on the ground we can muster. Chip in $20.20 today so we make sure we have the organizers and volunteers and resources we need to get the job done.
We’ve got a serious opportunity to elect a new Governor and transform the way this state is run.
100 days out. We’ll put your $20.20 to use today targeting the voters and the districts we need to reach our win number.
100 days until victory.

And we hope you will join us, too.
Get your ticket for this longtime Democratic tradition and you’ll be helping elect Democrats up and down the ballot in a just a few, short weeks.

You must request the ""Green Party Ballot"". Three candidates have filed to be on our ballot; you may also select ""uncommitted"". The results of this primary will instruct our delegates' first round voting in the presidential nominating convention in July; we have 7 delegates and they will cast their votes proportionally based on the primary results (BTW - if you are interested in being a delegate to the nominating convention in Detroit, send an email to [[URL REDACTED]]).
Candidate information:
Howie Hawkins: [[URL REDACTED]]
Dario Hunter: [[URL REDACTED]]

Dario Hunter's campaign has also sent a statement to our voters, which follows.
Thanks for being a part of this historic primary!
Sue Edward, Secretary, Missouri Green Party
[[URL REDACTED]]
Statement from Dario Hunter's campaign:
About Dario Hunter
I’m a rabbi, a former environmental attorney, high school educator and administrator, as well as an anti-fracking activist. I am also a Black, gay, son of an immigrant who has engaged in activism on behalf of all of those communities. As a former member of the Youngstown, Ohio Board of Education, I led in the effort to combat state takeovers and protect the public’s voice in public education. I’ve fought governmental agencies in Ohio Supreme Court cases to assert the public’s right to know, winning settlements to provide public records.
The Hunter campaign seeks to engage those personally familiar with the struggle for justice and empower all oppressed and underserved communities to assert their rights. Our team reflects the value we place on diversity and in shaping a new generation of activism that transforms the fight for equality.
About Darlene Elias, Our Candidate for Vice President
I'm proud to be a part of a team effort with my running mate, Darlene Elias, an activist for many causes in her community of Holyoke, Massachusetts, including housing, education, discrimination, and workers' rights. Darlene first encountered the Green Party when she approached them for assistance in helping to prevent the demolition of Lyman Terrace, a low income housing complex where she grew up. Green activism helped turn the tide for Lyman Terrace and its almost 500 tenants.
Darlene has a history of service to the Green Party, including as a former Co-Chair for the National Party, Chair of the Massachusetts Green-Rainbow Party, as well as Co-Chair and Delegate for the Latinx Caucus. On a national level, Darlene wants to ensure the future of our party by focusing on increasing membership and strengthening party infrastructure. She believes that the Green Party must be the voice of the 99%, and work to ensure the fair and equitable treatment of the disenfranchised and marginalized by creating a fair and more just democracy.
Our Platform
“The Green Party is the party of Justice – Justice for the Earth and all its people.”
Employment
* Ensure a universal basic income and guarantees of employment at a living wage (tied to inflation and cost of living) as well as housing, food and essential utilities for all.
Environment
* Reverse climate change and secure clean air, water and soil, through our REAL Green New Deal, transitioning to 100% renewable energy by 2030.
* Through our campaign's Green Path Forward, we will focus diplomatic efforts on building stronger relationships with the world's top carbon emitters to meet global benchmarks for eliminating carbon emissions, achieve a global ban on single use plastics, ban fracking, and achieve global agreements to reduce the effects of abusive corporate agribusiness on climate change.
Education
* Provide free college and early childhood education, fighting privatization and protecting community control of public education.
* Forgiveness for past student loans.
Healthcare/Communities
* Provide single payer, publicly-controlled health care for all, increasing healthcare availability in minority and other disenfranchised communities - including rural America.
* End environmental and educational racism, empowering disenfranchised communities.
Equality and Human Rights
* Stop the senseless killing of people of color by law enforcement. Demilitarize the police, establish community oversight and limit use of force.
* Provide reparations for American descendants of enslaved Africans.
* End efforts to roll back voting rights – such as discriminatory voter ID laws.
* End deportations, detentions and family separations.
* Fight judicial and employment discrimination.
* Affirm tribal sovereignty.
* End colonialism (e.g. Puerto Rico).
Economy
* Transform to a sustainable, eco-socialist economy with green jobs, funding for clean energy and local green businesses.
* Return wealth to workers through employee-owned businesses and cooperatives.
* End corporate personhood, as well as corporate control of politics, education, basic utilities, healthcare and mass incarceration.
Democracy
* Provide ranked choice voting, proportional representation and open debates.
* Open ballot access, letting the public decide which candidates are viable.
Military/Policing
* End war and cease its funding, closing over 700+ military bases abroad.
* Achieve international nuclear disarmament and the elimination of war funding in favor of a Dept. of Peace and caretaker funding for veterans.
* End the war on drugs feeding into mass incarceration.
Party Building Goals
Our campaign will:
* Work collaboratively to achieve ballot access in all states and DC.
* Aim to get more Greens elected in 2020 and beyond, pursuing a strategy for party growth beyond the Presidential election.
* Train party members and candidates in all states to reach out to a diverse electorate, empowering economically disenfranchised, minority, and rural voters.
* Attract more Greens to the party by emphasizing our truly revolutionary answers to issues of environmental, racial and social justice as well as by seeking to bring the voices of the oppressed to the forefront of political change.
We will build an organized network of coordinators enhanced by making personal connections with those interested in a genuine alternative to corporate ownership of our democracy (i.e. most Americans), and active online outreach to diverse, disempowered voters. In doing so, we will meet people where they are, sometimes in places where the Green Party has never gone before – working with non-partisan activist groups and non-conventional centers of political power and debate, and institutions that are apolitical but traditionally open to our perspective (e.g. coops).
Party building means honoring the voices of the marginalized masses. It means strengthening leadership to create a party that is not only perceived as viable but is functionally viable in its ability to accomplish change through the concerted actions of its members. We must actively seek to diversify party chapters all across the country and seek diverse candidates for office whose experiences speak to the actual demographics and real world realities of the American public.
Our ongoing #SeeGreensLead campaign is an effort to support and promote Green candidates in various parts of the country so that we create a national movement of elected Green leaders that will provide an anchor beyond the 2020 race for growth in membership.

Missouri Green Party candidates will be available to chat with you over coffee and cocktails. This is your chance to get to know the candidates, ask questions, or just socialize.
We can't take over a coffeeshop or bar, but Zoom is the next best thing. Please join us for one or more (or all!) of the following:
