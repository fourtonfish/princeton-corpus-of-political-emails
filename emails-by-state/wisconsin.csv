The left is pulling out all the stops in Wisconsin. Millions of dollars are pouring into the state in an effort to remove our state elected officials in hopes of turning out the vote for Biden.
Additionally, the left is attempting to tear down the newest Supreme Court nominee, Amy Coney Barrett. Amy is a Conservative, pro-life, devout Catholic, which is everything the left hates.
Please consider attending (or simply donating) to the last district fundraiser of the 2020 election cycle. Information and links are below.
This money is used directly for our 6th district candidates. We are all volunteers and the district is not supported by the state or federal party structure.

STEALING THE ELECTION
FROM JUSTICE DANIEL KELLY
Milwaukee and Dane County clerks are encouraging voters who request absentee ballots to declare themselves ""indefinitely confined,” allowing them to vote without showing a photo ID.
The left is trying to steal the election from Justice Daniel Kelly and they aren't even trying to hide it anymore. Additionally, all over the state, local clerks are shutting down or limiting in-person voting, even though there are practical and safe ways for early in-person voting to continue.
Without a crystal ball to tell us if in-person voting will be allowed on election day, we must cast our votes now. We cannot allow the left to steal this election!
Please go online and request your absentee ballot by April 1st or go into your local clerks office. If you are homebound and do not have a witness to sign your absentee ballot, please reach out to one of your local party members or one of theTrump Victory staffers (listed below). They can witness through a screen door, there's no need for them to even enter your house.
We have a great team of people all across this state working for Justice Kelly including Team Kelly, Trump Victory, and the Republican Party of Wisconsin. Help is still needed and much can be done from the confines of your house. Please reach out to your local county party or to one of the Trump Victory contacts below.
As always, please let me know if you have any questions.
Darryl Carlson - 6th District Chair
Read on for a message from one of the 6th District Trump Victory Regional Directors and for a list of Trump Victory staff covering the 6th District.
MyVote Wisconsin - Register to Vote & Reqeust an Absentee Ballot Here
A Message from London Beth - Trump Victory Regional Director
Hey everyone I’m emailing to let you know the plan for our upcoming statewide get out the vote (GOTV) effort, beginning tomorrow. We are twelve days away from Wisconsin deciding if they want Justice Kelly to remain on the court, and that means that it is time for all of us to put our efforts into high gear.
We cannot lose elections because governments have done the right thing in asking people to stay in their homes. But this does not mean all we can do is sit at home and cross our fingers, making sure Kelly and Trump stay in office is a process everyone can take part in. Obviously during the times we are in we can not host events or knock doors, but that does not mean we stop the reelection effort!
Voter contact will be the difference between a social justice warrior on the bench, or a tried and true honest justice. Voter contact will be the difference between the successful America we know and love, and a socialist America.
To get more information on how we can get Trump elected despite quarantines, please reach out to the Trump Victory field staff closest to you—they await your contact!

Wisconsin's 6th Congressional District - Republican Party of Wisconsin,shebgop.yahoo.com@mail.mailchimpapp.com,Attack on Private School Education,"View this email in your browser
Dane County issued an order shutting down all in-person instruction for both public and private schools after 5pm on the Friday before most private schools were set to start.
This may not affect any school districts within the 6th District at this time, however the same thought process may be applied by the Governor to shut down in-person instruction across the state.
This is what is allowed:
1. 4-Year kindergarten
2. Youth Camps & Services
3. K-2 public and private schools
4. Childcare services at PUBLIC schools
5. Private colleges & universities
6. UW-Madison
7. Public & Private dormitories
8. Tech Schools
What isn't allowed:
1. Grades 3-12 public and private schools (BUT THEY ARE ALLOWED TO BE IN PUBLIC/PRIVATE DAYCARE)
Where is the logic in this?
Where is the data?
The likely cause for this is that many of the public schools decided to go virtual and were losing students to the private schools who were overwhelmingly going to be conducting in-person instruction.
Share your opinion below with a short 3 question survey.

After having been violated and desecrated by vandals more than two months ago, it is unconscionable that the Wisconsin Veterans Museum today remains covered in graffiti. This is a failure of leadership, and we call on you to work together to immediately rectify this disgrace.
News coverage and documentation indicate that, despite a group of veterans having a realistic plan and funds to cover the graffiti – you all refuse to allow them to get the job done.
It is imperative that you all work together to rectify this stain on our state's legacy and the very real people who have laid their lives on the line to protect the freedoms that vandals now flaunt.

Cities Burning and
Guillotines in the Streets
Wisconsin cities are under siege and businesses have burned to the ground. State street in Madison is still boarded up and many businesses are closing for good.
Domestic terrorism under the guise of social justice is here in our streets. Groups such as ANTIFA and the Freedom Road Socialist Organization want to fundamentally destroy our way of life.
The Chicago Teachers Union publicly supported a guillotine being built in front of the house of Amazon owner, Jeff Bezos. It's simply crazy, there are no other words.
These actions are being allowed and even instigated by Democrat officials at every level of government, including Wisconsin State Representative David Bowen and Governor Tony Evers.

London Beth,lbeth@wisgop.org,🚨Calling all Patriots!🚨 The President needs our help THIS Friday.  ,"friend,
For three years, the Do-Nothing Democrats have carried out their witch hunt trying to undo the 2016 election. After far-left House Democrats impeached the President at the end of the year, it's now time for the Senate to do its job, stop the madness, and get Congress back to work.
This Friday, Wisconsinites in Green Bay will make clear to Senator Baldwin that she must vote to acquit the President after Shifty Adam Schiff and his radical colleagues rest their case. Wisconsin is Trump Country and Senator Baldwin cannot ignore the majority of her constituents who voted to elect President Trump.
Join your fellow Republicans, patriots, and supporters of the President for a protest in front of Senator Baldwin's Green Bay office THIS Friday, January 24th from 1:00–2:00pm.
We encourage every Wisconsinite to show their support for
President Trump by attending the protest to help make a statement!
When:
Friday, January 24, 2020
1:00PM–2:00PM
Where:
Green Bay Office of Senator Tammy Baldwin

Robin Vos,raccinfo@wisgop.info,“Safer at Home” Challenge Update  ,"Good Afternoon,
We need your help to fight Tony Evers order to unilaterally extend the shutdown.
You might have heard the news yesterday, that while the citizens of Wisconsin continue to be denied a voice through an unprecedented administrative order, we had no choice but to ask the Supreme Court to rein in the governor’s abuse of power and give the people of Wisconsin a say in the decision making process.
Could you chip in to help us fight Tony Evers’ efforts to shutter our economy?
We’re hearing from you and thousands across the state who are frustrated as the Safer at Home order was extended as positive COVID cases decrease or flatten. There are some areas of the state that haven't seen many cases at all. Governor Evers thinks we should sit by with no voice in the process.
This is a fight we can’t afford to lose!
Other Midwestern states with more confirmed cases like Ohio, have set firm dates to begin a phased reopening far earlier than the Evers administration. Wisconsinites deserve certainty, transparency, and a plan to end the constant stream of executive orders that are eroding both the economy and their liberty.
Please chip in $25, $50, $75, or $100 to help us fight to save Wisconsin jobs.
Robin Vos
Leader
Republican Assembly Campaign Committee
P.S. Your generous donation of $25, $50, $75 or $100 will help us fight back against this latest attempt to halt our economy with no plans to reopen.

Robin Vos,raccinfo@wisgop.info,What's the plan?   ,"Friend,
I’m frustrated and angry with the Governor’s new order to unilaterally keep our state on lockdown. And I know you are too!
We are owed a comprehensive economic recovery plan, yet Governor Evers has yet to give any actual metrics, measurable goals, and most importantly, a clear plan to reopen the state going forward. That’s why we must continue to fight back against his efforts to keep our state on lockdown.
Could you chip in to help us fight back against Evers power grab?
Assembly Republican leadership is working hard to fight back against the Governor’s lockdown order. While we all share the goal of protecting public health, the Governor has gone too far. We will do whatever it takes to block Evers’ attempt to shut down our economy through Memorial Day. We need to fight to protect our economy before it’s too late.
This is a fight we can’t afford to lose!
Democrats are picking winners and losers in this state. The Evers’ power grab is having real consequences and the job losses we’re seeing will have devastating and long-lasting effects on our economy.
Please chip in $25, $50, $75, or $100 to help us fight to save Wisconsin jobs.

Elisa Kelly,campaign@justicedanielkelly.com,I have held my tongue long enough  ,"Friend,
Okay, that is IT … I have held my tongue long enough!
I will no longer sit idly by while my husband is attacked. It would be one thing if we were dealing with respectful disagreements on his judicial philosophy or civil debates about the issues.
But we are not.
We are dealing with lies, lies, and more lies.
Chip in now to help us fight back with the truth.
The Democrats have piled on lie after lie after lie about my husband’s allegiances. Let me be VERY CLEAR: as a Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice, his only allegiance is to the Constitution. He is committed to upholding the rule of law and has always \-- and WILL always -- keep politics out of the courtroom.
We cannot say the same for his opponent Judge Jill Karofksy.
After weeks of slanderous lies about my husband, we just got proof that Jill Karofsky is basically bought and paid for by the Democratic Party of Wisconsin.
Newly released campaign finance reports show they have recently dumped a staggering $1.3 million into her campaign fund!
We cannot let them buy this election!
These are the final days of the campaign and we cannot allow their hypocritical lies to go unanswered! Please chip in whatever you can to help us set the record straight and expand our digital voter outreach.
Karofsky has already all but said she would legislate from the bench and the Democratic Party of Wisconsin just gave her 1.3 million reasons to make good on her promise.
Please, I am begging you … we cannot allow the radical left to slander my husband and buy Jill Karofsky a seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court at the expense of an experienced, proven, independent leader like Daniel.
Chip in $25, $50, $100, $250, or more now to help keep Justice Daniel Kelly on the Wisconsin Supreme Court and protect the rule of law.
Thank you so much for your support for our family, our shared values, and the rule of law!

Charles Nichols,campaign@justicedanielkelly.com,BREAKING: Liberals exploit tragedy for political gain  ,"Friend,
Last week the good folks at the Wisconsin Firearms Training Center (“WFTC”) hosted a campaign event for Justice Daniel Kelly. The WFTC dedicates itself to providing our fellow Wisconsinites with the tools and training necessary to protect themselves and their families from those who would do them harm, and Justice Kelly is grateful for their support and enthusiasm for his campaign. It was a pleasant and productive evening for everyone who attended.
But then our opponent’s allies did what they always do … they made it political and exploited a tragedy for their own benefit.
Our opponent’s allies attacked us for appearing at this event because a very sick individual had recently shot several of his co-workers at a major Milwaukee business. Along with the rest of our fellow Wisconsinites, we were shocked and saddened by this terrible tragedy, and we continue to pray for the victims and their families.
However, this attempt by Judge Jill Karofsky and her allies to exploit this tragedy for their own political gain is inexplicable and grotesque. They equated an evil murderer with the good folks at WFTC who are simply trying to make sure they have the tools and training to protect themselves and their families from those who would do them harm.
This is not just an attack on Justice Kelly, this is an attack on everyone who cares about protecting themselves and the innocent people around them. Perhaps we shouldn’t be surprised by this. After all, it fits the same disgraceful pattern we have seen in the rest of Judge Karofsky’s campaign.
Please help Justice Kelly fight off these disgusting and despicable attacks!
Chip in at least $25 today and we will send you a free pocket-size copy of the Constitution as a token of our thanks.
Judge Karofsky and her radical liberal allies want to disarm law abiding citizens, but Justice Kelly will always uphold the Constitution, which protects our cherished rights.
With a contribution of $25, $50, $100, $250, or more today, you can send a powerful message to Judge Karofsky’s allies that you stand with the brave and courageous people who protect themselves and the innocents around them.
The right to keep and bear arms is explicitly protected by both the United States and Wisconsin Constitutions, and Justice Kelly will continue to uphold and protect all of our constitutional rights on the Wisconsin Supreme Court -- as he has done since joining the court in 2016.
Our opponents clearly do not care about the Constitution, but Justice Kelly does -- and we hope you do, too. Chip in at least $25 today to get your own pocket-sized copy of the Constitution.
The Wisconsin Supreme Court election is just over a month away and I fear the attacks will only get more disgusting, despicable, and desperate as the election nears.
Please stand with Justice Kelly in defense of the Constitution today.
Thank you,
Charles Nichols

Charles Nichols,campaign@justicedanielkelly.com,"Holder: 200,000 dollars to stack the court  ","Friend,
First the Democrats file a lawsuit to try to rig the election …
Then we get word that municipal clerks are willfully breaking state election law concerning voter ID requirements …
And now Barack Obama’s Attorney General Eric Holder is jumping in to try to stack the Wisconsin Supreme Court as part of a plan to gerrymander state legislative and congressional districts and alter future elections in the state.
Groups backed by Holder just announced they will pump a total of $200,000 into Wisconsin to defeat Justice Daniel Kelly and put liberal activist Jill Karofsky on Wisconsin’s Supreme Court.
We urgently need your help to counter Holder’s money dump!
Chip in $25, $50, $100, $250, or more to help keep
Justice Daniel Kelly on the Wisconsin Supreme Court.
Your generous continued support will help us continue our aggressive voter outreach efforts, which have changed dramatically due to the ever-changing COVID-19 situation.
What started as a grassroots-oriented campaign has now turned into a largely digital and airwaves campaign with the added need to answer $200,000 worth of late game liberal rhetoric.
We did not plan for it -- or budget for it.
But we are adjusting to it and need your help to counter Eric Holder’s big money dump.
Support Justice Daniel Kelly for Supreme Court now.
Justice Kelly knows that judges do not create the law -- they just apply the law as it’s written -- and we need to keep him on the Wisconsin Supreme Court ahead of the landmark cases heading its way.
Former Obama Attorney General Eric Holder is dumping money into Wisconsin to stack the courts so he can gerrymander and rig elections. We must stand strong together to stop him in his tracks.
The election is just days away and every hour and every dollar counts! Please chip in what you can now to help us defend this Wisconsin Supreme Court seat and safeguard our conservative majority.
Thanks for your help!

We hope you and your family are staying safe and healthy. I want to take this opportunity to give you an update on Justice Kelly’s re-election campaign for the Wisconsin Supreme Court.
We will continue to monitor the situation closely and are adjusting in real time based on the latest recommendations from authorities and experts. There is a lot we do not know yet.
But here is what we know: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we’ve been forced to change our voter contact strategy in these final weeks of the campaign. We will need to reach out to people in different mediums and this late game switch will cost a great deal of money.
As one our team’s most loyal supporters, any amount you can chip in will help us adjust our strategy and meet the demands of a rapidly changing political environment.
In uncertain times, it is more important than ever to ensure our leaders are proven, tested, and committed to upholding the rule of law.
Please support Justice Daniel Kelly for Supreme Court.
We will continue to provide campaign updates as the situation unfolds.

Hi Friends,
Hope this finds you doing well! It’s been a fast start to 2020 with No Better Friend traveling all over the state this January, living out our mission of growing the conservative movement. Since the New Year, we’ve put on a great policy forum in Hudson with an outstanding group of partners, celebrated Martin Luther King Jr. Day with Pastor Jerome Smith and his congregation at the Greater Praise Church of God In Christ in Milwaukee, and we’re now preparing for the 30th Anniversary of National School Choice Week and a rally at the Capitol in Madison in support of School Choice on January 28 at 12pm. Vice President Mike Pence will even be in attendance! See below for more details!
We Welcome Justice Michael Gableman to the No Better Friend Advisory Board
We also have an exciting new addition to the No Better Friend team - Former Supreme Court Justice Michael Gableman will be joining the No Better Friend Corp. Advisory Board where he’ll be helping us to grow the conservative movement across Wisconsin.
Justice Mike Gableman grew up in New Berlin. After graduating from Ripon College in 1988, he taught American history at Washington High School in Milwaukee. After law school, he served as a law clerk to Judge Paul Ballard in Alexandria, Minnesota. Following his appointment to the bench in 2002, Gableman was elected Circuit Court Judge of Burnett County with 78% of the vote. Judge Gableman led the effort to establish the Burnett County Drug and Alcohol Court, the Burnett County Restorative Justice Center, and the inmate community service program. In 2008, Judge Gableman became the first candidate in over 40 years to defeat a sitting Supreme Court Justice, winning majorities in 60 out of the 72 counties. After serving on the Supreme Court for ten years, Justice Gableman did not seek reelection to the court and returned to the private practice of law. He remains active in numerous charitable and civic works and is frequently called upon to speak on legal issues of the day.
National School Choice Week Capitol Rally

The No Better Friend Green Bay Forum was a great success! For those who have not yet attended one of our Forums, I’m sharing a few quotes from prior attendees below:
At the Green Bay Forum we covered many top-of-mind issues including, lowering taxes in Wisconsin, reforming our broken healthcare system, the importance of clearing registrants from the voter rolls who are registered in other places, growing the School Choice movement, and promoting local pro-life pregnancy resource centers. Thanks to the generous donations of those in attendance, we also provided nearly 2,000 diapers to A & A Alexandrina pregnancy resource center in Green Bay. It was a great night, with lots of excitement for learning and doing more to grow the conservative movement in 2020!

Andrew Hitt - RPW Chairman,info@wisgop.org,Nancy’s Haircut  ,"Friend,
This week, Fox News broke a report that Nancy Pelosi broke the California lockdown restrictions to visit a salon. All while not wearing a mask (how hypocritical is that?).
These Double Standard Democrats need to be accountable. Wisconsin liberals like Rep. Ron Kind have pushed these lockdowns. Now their leader wants to play by a different set of rules.
In a comment, one salon owner called Pelosi’s visit a slap in the face all while other salons have been forced to keep their businesses shuttered. This is just another example of the double standard that Democrats allow to exist for themselves.
Let’s help that salon owner send a message to Pelosi and Kind by sending Derrick Van Orden to Congress. Any donation you make will help!
Day after day, Democrats nationwide are engaging in hypocrisy and attempting to control the actions of everyday Americans. Joe Biden has said he’s open to another round of lockdowns if he wins …
With your generous contribution we can fight back against Nancy Pelosi, keep Wisconsin open for business, and make sure that liberals can never lock us down again. Can we count on your support?
Forward,
Andrew Hitt

Alesha Guenther - WisGOP Communications,info@wisgop.org,ICYMI: Democrats File Lawsuit to Rig Spring Election  ,"ICYMI: Democrats File Lawsuit to Rig Spring Election
[Madison, WI] – In case you missed it, the Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Party of Wisconsin are using the COVID-19 pandemic to rig Wisconsin’s Spring Election for Jill Karofsky.
Their lawsuit aims to do away with requirements to provide identification and proof of residence when registering to vote or requesting an absentee ballot online or by mail. Instead of encouraging clerks across Wisconsin to provide more opportunities to vote early, they want to use the national pandemic as an opportunity to put a liberal social justice warrior on the Wisconsin Supreme Court.
Suspending common-sense rules that protect the integrity of our elections is simply not an acceptable response to holding an election in a time of crisis. While Wisconsin families are trying to deal with the extremely disruptive effects of COVID-19 on their daily lives, incomes, and businesses, Democrats are trying to use this crisis to their advantage.
Democrat Gov. Tony Evers already worked to suppress rural-votes by calling a second special election in the Seventh Congressional District, now his allies are attacking the integrity of this election in court.

Evers’ election mess and the latest attack on Voter ID
Empower Wisconsin
M.D. Kittle
March 19, 2020
…
The lawsuit filed by the Democratic Party of Wisconsin and the Democratic National Committee seeks to get rid of voter ID as well as giving voters extended time to register to vote online, without providing proof of residence.
The state GOP blasted the Democrats’ move, sold as a way to protect voting rights.
“Democrats are trying to hijack a national health crisis to rig an election in their favor. If they cared about accessibility at the polls, they’d join us in urging clerks across Wisconsin to allow early voting immediately, not just those in their communities of support. Instead, they insist on suspending common-sense rules in an effort to further rig the election,” Mark Jefferson, executive director of the Republican Party of Wisconsin, said in a statement.

[Madison, WI] – In case you missed it, Planned Parenthood Advocates of Wisconsin endorsed candidate for the Wisconsin Supreme Court, Jill Karofsky. This comes after Karofsky compared the decision to get an abortion to the decision to get one’s wisdom teeth removed.
Planned Parenthood is endorsing Jill Karofsky because they know she wants to bring her political agenda to the Supreme Court. Jill Karofsky has already promised to fight for social justice issues from the bench and compared the decision to get an abortion to the decision to get one’s wisdom teeth removed.
This isn’t the only issue where Karofsky has made her political agenda for the Supreme Court known–Karofsky has also admitted that she believes the Constitution allows limiting our possession of firearms and has previously called for gun control. The Supreme Court is no place for political activism, but that’s exactly what Wisconsin will get from Jill Karofsky.

[Madison, WI] – In case you missed it, liberal Dane County Judge and Supreme Court candidate Jill Karofsky sentenced a man convicted of abusing and causing great bodily harm to nine babies—including fractured skulls and multiple broken bones— to just 13 years in prison despite facing 140 years behind bars. Karofsky’s latest light sentence represents another example where Karofsky was unwilling to give a dangerous criminal a sentence that matched their crime and keep our communities safe.
This isn’t the first time Judge Karofsky has been called out for her dangerously lenient sentences. Karofsky once gave the lightest sentence possible to a murderer convicted of brutally killing and hiding the remains of a 21-year-old-man. She also let a hardened criminal off easy which allowed him to lead a group of criminals that invaded and robbed homes across Wisconsin. Karofsky sentenced a serial child sex offender to more probation after assaulting a third child while on probation. Karofsky also failed to sentence several criminals convicted of attacking or threatening police to a single day in jail.
Karofsky’s record as a Dane County Judge proves that she is unwilling to hold dangerous criminals accountable for several serious crimes. Wisconsinites have had enough of liberal Dane County Judges like Jill Karofsky endangering their communities in order to prioritize their social justice warrior agenda and some higher “progressive” cause. If Jill Karofsky consistently refuses to protect Wisconsin families as a judge, Wisconsinites can expect that she would continue to endanger Wisconsin families as a Supreme Court justice.

Light Sentence Karofsky orders 13 years in prison for baby abusing nurse
Empower Wisconsin
M.D. Kittle
February 24, 2020
Light Sentence Jill Karofsky strikes again.
Last week, the liberal Dane County Circuit Court Judge and state Supreme Court candidate handed down her sentence against former nurse Christopher M. Kaphaem. He faced a maximum of 140 years in prison on 19 felony charges of abusing and causing great bodily harm to nine infants at a Madison hospital’s neonatal intensive care unit.
Karofsky sentenced Kaphaem, 44, to 13 years in prison followed by seven years of extended supervision. He could have received even more time behind bars, but Karofsky ordered three years of the prison sentence to be served concurrently.
Kaphaem also was credited for 143 days time served.
Karofsky finished second in last week’s primary election and will face conservative Supreme Court Justice Daniel Kelly in the April general election.
The criminal complaint describes a horrifying list of injuries to the infants in UnityPoint Health-Meriter’s NICU between March 2017 and February of last year. A baby described only as “Infant 1” sustained a “Fracture to his skull, a wrist fracture, and left humerus fracture,” according to the criminal complaint.
Child abuse expert, Dr. Barbara Knox previously testified that doctors were concerned about “soft tissue swelling” on the back of the baby’s head.
One infant suffered 17 fractures, including one to the skull and eight to the ribs.
…
Kaphaem abused the most vulnerable.
…
“My son was injured when I wasn’t there,” one mother said at the sentencing hearing, according to the Wisconsin Stater Journal. “I struggle with this guilt daily. I should have stayed. I could have protected my son. This could-have, should-have, would-have battle plays itself over and over in my mind even to this day 2½ years later.”
…
The lighter sentencing decision is ultimately the responsibility of the judge, however.
Republican Party of Wisconsin spokeswoman Alesha Guenther said “extremists” like Karofsky are eroding the judicial system “by watering down sentences and jeopardizing the safety of our communities.”
“Wisconsinites have had enough of judges like Jill Karofsky handing down soft sentences and putting their families in danger all in the name of some higher ‘progressive cause,’” Guenther said.
Karofsky has earned a reputation of going easy on violent criminals.
…
The Supreme Court candidate has said she will be a social justice advocate who, if elected, would use her seat on the court as a bully pulpit for criminal justice reform.
The concern from Karofsky’s critics is that she will try to reform the criminal justice system from the bench. They accuse her of being soft on crime during the former prosecutor’s three year’s on the bench.
The Republican Party of Wisconsin has pointed to Karofsky’s ruling in the case of Cleaster Moon, a 24-year-old felon charged last year as the “kingpin” of a string of burglaries and robberies in Dane and Waukesha counties.
…
Her critics also have chided her for giving a serial child sex offender a lenient sentence after he groped a third child while she was on her way to school.
Karofsky’s campaign has not returned calls seeking comment.

In case you missed it, this morning the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel published a story on the Democrats’ fundraising totals here in Wisconsin. Since 2018, the Democratic Party of Wisconsin has raised $58.7 million dollars. Most of that money came from coastal liberal elites who do not represent Wisconsin values and Wisconsin voters -- like George Soros!
Election day is just 6 days away-- we need your help now to re-elect President Trump!
With just 6 days until the election, it is more crucial than ever that we have the support we need to deliver Wisconsin to President Donald J. Trump. The race is razor thin in Wisconsin and will likely have a large impact on who is in the Whitehouse. We need your help to push President Trump across the finish line.

Alesha Guenther - WisGOP Communications,info@wisgop.org,ICYMI: Jill Karofsky Promised To Be a “Social Justice” Justice  ,"ICYMI: Jill Karofsky Promised To Be a “Social Justice” Justice
[Madison, WI] – In case you missed it, candidate for the Wisconsin Supreme Court, Jill Karofsky, promised to act as a “social justice” justice from the bench of the Wisconsin Supreme Court.
When she didn’t think anyone was listening, Karofsky had no problem revealing the real reason she is running for Wisconsin’s highest court. She wants to bring her social justice warrior agenda to the bench and decide cases based on her political agenda—not based on what the law actually says.
Such a brazen promise to legislate from the bench effectively disqualifies Jill Karofsky to serve on Wisconsin’s Supreme Court. Justices should commit themselves to upholding the rule of law and the Constitution, not their own personal political beliefs. Justice Daniel Kelly has a proven record deciding cases based on what the law is, not what he thinks the law should be.

A Social Justice Justice
The Maciver Institute
Dan O’Donnell
March 4, 2020
When someone tells you who they really are, listen. When a politician tells you who they really are, listen extra closely because it doesn’t happen all that often.
...
Invariably, it takes a hidden camera to find it.
“You said that when you were running for Dane County judge that you’d be able to advocate for social justice issues. How do you plan on doing that on the Wisconsin Supreme Court?” a member of the University of Wisconsin Pre-Law Society asked Supreme Court candidate Jill Karofsky during a meeting caught on hidden camera late last year.
“So I did say that when I ran for judge and I’ve done it since I’ve been on the bench,” Karofsky answered without hesitation. “As a Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice I’d do it just the way I do it now.”
In a rare moment of total honesty, Karofsky admitted and promised that she will be a social justice Justice.
...
She also admitted that she will be a poorly informed social justice Justice. While Wisconsin does indeed have more than 23,000 inmates in its prison system, Minnesota has about 11,000; less than half of Wisconsin’s state prison population but far less than the “four times as many” lie that Karofsky told so as to better rail against it.
“The Department of Corrections budget in Wisconsin is more than the Department of Education budget. How does that make sense?” she continued.
This, too, is misleading at best and completely dishonest at worst. Funding for education in Wisconsin goes to the University of Wisconsin System and individual school districts directly, so the Department of Education itself—a relatively small agency that provides only oversight and support for these districts—does not need the massive budget that, say, the Department of Corrections does.
She rather obviously means, though, that Wisconsin spends far more on incarceration than it does on education, and this is an absolute lie. Total spending on the Department of Corrections in the 2019-2021 biennial budget is $2.68 billion. Spending on the UW System alone is nearly six times that at $12.6 billion. In addition, Wisconsin will spend $14.57 billion this biennium on K-12 education through state aid.
Were Karofksy a more honest social justice Justice, she would have told the Pre-Law Society that Wisconsin spends nearly 15 times more on education than it does on its Department of Corrections, but being a social justice Justice doesn’t seem to require honesty.
And Jill Karofsky was only truly honest when she thought no one was really listening.
“We need to continue to figure out how we can help people instead of incarcerate them,” she continued. “We need more drug programs, we need more mental health programs, and we need more diversion programs. Those are all things I advocate for as a judge and things I use every day as a judge and those are the things I’ll continue to advocate for as a State Supreme Court Justice.
“People kind of listen to me now, but a State Supreme Court Justice walks into the room and everyone listens to that person. You’re a few steps up on the bully pulpit.”
In other words, Karofsky sees a seat on the highest court in the state as little more than a louder megaphone for her to espouse her personal political and socioeconomic opinions, especially regarding Wisconsin’s criminal justice system.
She advocates for a system of social justice with herself as one of Wisconsin’s moral leaders; making decisions based not on the Constitution, statutes, or case law, but rather on what just feels right.
That is the dangerous essence of the modern social justice movement: None are equal before the law, but rather are judged on how sympathetic they are to those who will decide their fate.
Karofsky herself admitted that this is how she has judged cases in the Dane County Circuit Court and how she will judge cases on the Wisconsin Supreme Court. Needless to say, this flies in the face of pretty much every notion of constitutional and ethical jurisprudence in this country, but hey, Karofsky wouldn’t be the only social justice Justice on the Supreme Court.
...
The aim, of course, is to make those reforms here; not through a law passed by the Wisconsin Legislature and signed by the state’s Governor, but through judicial fiat.
In a rare moment of honesty, Karofsky revealed exactly what sort of Supreme Court Justice she would be and how she would unethically use her position as a “bully pulpit” from which she can advance her personal policy preferences.
When she thought no one could hear, she told Wisconsin exactly who she is. Now it’s up to Wisconsin to listen.

Alesha Guenther - WisGOP Communications,info@wisgop.org,Gov. Evers’ State of the State Preview  ,"Gov. Evers’ State of the State Preview
What (Not) To Look For In Tonight’s State of The State Address
[Madison, WI] – Gov. Tony Evers will give his second State of the State address tonight, and we shouldn’t expect to hear much about the help he received from Republicans to keep Wisconsin strong during the last year.
Gov. Evers made it clear during the past year that he is largely disinterested in running the state and would rather hand off responsibilities to the liberal activists who staff his office. As a result, he didn’t accomplish much of anything for Wisconsin. Instead, the Evers administration went out of its way to circumvent open records laws, actively suppress votes in the 7th Congressional District, and veto legislation to protect the unborn. Gov. Evers was relegated to the sidelines where he spent his time calling Republican legislators names.
When Gov. Tony Evers proposed more than $1 billion dollars in tax increases, legislative Republicans held the line on Evers’ radical agenda and passed a conservative budget. The Republican budget cut taxes for hardworking Wisconsin families, made record investments in education and made improvements in infrastructure without raising the gas tax. It passed without a single Democrat vote in the legislature.
Gov. Tony Evers likely won’t give any credit to legislative Republicans for the state of the state in Wisconsin tonight. Instead, he will simply continue to make promises he knows he can’t keep and add more radical ideas to his liberal wish list.

Alesha Guenther - WisGOP Communications,info@wisgop.org,WisGOP Statement on Ballot Access Ahead of April 7 Election  ,"WisGOP Statement on Ballot Access Ahead of April 7 Election
[Madison, WI] – In response to growing concerns about ballot access ahead of the April 7 election during the COVID-19 national pandemic, the Republican Party of Wisconsin issued the following statement from Executive Director Mark Jefferson:
“The best course of action during elections in times of crisis is to ensure equal access to the polls, not to suspend all common-sense regulations that ensure fair elections in a democracy.
“Many of Wisconsin’s 1850 municipal clerks are not accepting early ballots until next week, and even then at restricted times. Many communities note their sparse population as an explanation for their late start to early-voting. However, according to the City of Appleton website, (pop. 74,600) Appleton does not open its early-voting until Tuesday, March 24, and then only for two hours, and only twice next week. There have been reports that other cities are unresponsive and residents do not know when early-voting will be available.
“On the other hand, Madison has allowed early-voting since last Thursday, and Milwaukee is among the cities that began early-voting this week.
“We call on local election officials to make early-voting available immediately and we are exploring what legal options may be available. Suspending rules that ensure fair elections is simply not an acceptable solution. We understand local election officials do not work for political parties, so we ask our local officials to make voting a priority in their communities and for our supporters to voice their support for early-voting immediately. Other government functions are taking place, and the right to vote should be an equal priority, just as it is in Madison and Milwaukee. All state residents deserve an equal opportunity to have their voices heard, on a level with our fellow Wisconsinites who live in our largest cities.”

Throughout her campaign, Jill Karofsky has fabricated one lie after another in an attempt to slander Justice Daniel Kelly and our state’s highest court. Her habit of throwing out desperate allegations devoid of fact or reasoning continued during today’s forum when Karofsky refused to apologize for disgraceful comments. Justice Kelly appropriately denounced Karofsky’s accusations as a tool to service her political ambitions, stating, “If you didn't have slander, you wouldn't have a campaign.”
Karofsky’s cavalier attitude towards the truth should deeply concern voters, and calls into question her character and judicial temperament.

Dan Kelly, Jill Karofsky erupt in feud during Supreme Court Forum
Wisconsin State Journal
Riley Vetterkind
January 30, 2020
Supreme Court candidate Jill Karofsky's accusations of corruption toward Supreme Court Justice Daniel Kelly came to a head during a Thursday forum, resulting in the two candidates breaking out into a feud.
Advancing a line she's used throughout her campaign, Karofsky, a liberal-backed Dane County Circuit Court judge, again tore into Kelly, who is supported by conservatives, for repeatedly siding with the conservative groups that support him.
""Every single time that Justice Kelly has the opportunity to rule in favor of the right-wing special interests, of the Republicans, he does it every single time,"" Karofsky said. ""And that is why people think that there is corruption on our Supreme Court.""
Kelly, as well as Karofsky and Marquette Law School professor Ed Fallone, both backed by liberals, are set to compete in a Feb. 18 primary that will determine which two candidates advance to the April general election. The winning candidate is elected to a 10-year term on the court.
The accusations Karofsky repeatedly leveled against Kelly, which he categorically denied, drew a heated reply from Kelly, who defended his legal decisions as based in logic and not influenced by his political views. He dismissed Karofsky's accusations as slander against him and his Supreme Court colleagues and as a tool to service her political ambitions.
""You owe me an apology for this disgusting slander,"" Kelly said. ""If you didn't have slander, you wouldn't have a campaign.""
Kelly continued, arguing Karofsky's criticism of his actions on the court equated to slander against himself, the institution and other Supreme Court justices who have ruled similarly to him, such as Chief Justice Patience Roggensack. Karofsky, however, did not name any specific judges beyond Kelly.
""(Roggensack) did not ask to be slandered by some careless trial judge who can't even be bothered to keep her insults focused on the target,"" Kelly said.
Karofsky didn't offer any apologies.

[Madison, WI] – In response to the decision handed down by the U.S. Supreme Court, the Republican Party of Wisconsin issued the following statement from Chairman Andrew Hitt:
“Consistent with years of precedent, the U.S. Supreme Court concluded that election laws should not be changed on the eve of an election. The confusion and time wasted as a result of these multiple lawsuits when we should have all been solely focused on preparing for a challenging election is truly sad and unfortunate. While some have argued that we should quickly change or circumvent our laws in a time of crisis, justifications in the moment can quickly lead us down a slippery slope that erodes our democracy.”

Alesha Guenther - WisGOP Communications,info@wisgop.org,ICYMI: Judge Jill Karofsky Let a Serial Child Sex Offender Off Easy  ,"ICYMI: Judge Jill Karofsky Let a Serial Child Sex Offender Off Easy
[Madison, WI] – In case you missed it, Wisconsin Supreme Court candidate Judge Jill Karofsky gave a serial child sex offender a lenient sentence after he groped a third child while she was on her way to school. This displays a continuing pattern that Karofsky is incapable of holding criminals accountable and keeping our communities safe.
While on probation for prior convictions of 1st Degree Sexual Assault of a child, Micknvgm M. Keodouangsy groped a 12 year-old girl as she walked to school. Karofsky thought it would be appropriate to sentence Keodouangsy to more probation with the first year spent in jail, despite probation clearly not working the last time. Keodouangsy’s latest child sexual assault marks the third time he groped a child in less than a three year period. As a self-proclaimed champion of women’s rights, Karofsky’s refusal to stand up for child victims of sexual assault calls into question her commitment to defending women from dangerous predators.
This isn’t the first time Judge Karofsky has been called out for her lenient sentences. Karofsky once gave the lightest sentence possible to a murderer convicted of brutally killing and hiding the remains of a 21-year-old man. She also let a hardened criminal off easy which allowed him to become the “kingpin” of a group of organized criminals. The criminals terrorized Wisconsin communities by robbing several homes, stealing several vehicles, and leading police officers on a dangerous high speed chase.
Karofsky’s light on crime record stands in stark contrast to Justice Daniel Kelly’s record of protecting our rights and standing up for the rule of law. Justice Kelly believes that judges should decide cases based on what the law is, not what he thinks the law should be.

Court Candidate's Lenient Sentence Put Child Sex Offender Back on Streets
1130 WISN
Dan O’Donnell
January 31, 2020
Wisconsin Supreme Court candidate and Dane County Circuit Court judge Jill Karofksy sentenced a serial child sex offender to just a year in jail and five years' probation when the maximum sentence called for 66 years in prison.
Micknvgm M. Keodouangsy, 37, was convicted of two misdemeanor counts of fourth degree sexual assault in 2015. According to a criminal complaint, he groped two teenage girls outside of Madison East High School. Dane County Circuit Court Judge David Flanagan sentenced Keodouangsy to 60 days in jail with Huber work release privileges and placed him on probation for two years.
In 2017, he was before Judge Karofsky and pleaded guilty to a charge of battery (domestic abuse). Karofsky sentenced him to nine months in jail and placed him on probation for an additional two years.
While still on probation for both prior convictions, Keodouangsy groped a 12 year-old girl as she walked to school. He was charged with first degree child sexual assault, a Class B felony in Wisconsin that carries a maximum penalty of 60 years in prison. However, Keodouangsy was charged as a repeat offender, meaning that he could have faced a maximum sentence of 66 years.
In spite of this, Karofsky sentenced him to just a year in jail and five more years of probation. Even though he had violated probation twice before and had groped three girls in the span of less than three years, Keodouangsy spent just a year behind bars and was released last year. According to the Wisconsin Sex Offender Registry, he is homeless and thus could be anywhere in the Greater Madison area.
Karofsky, who has served on the Dane County Circuit since 2017, and Marquette University Law Professor Ed Fallone are challenging incumbent Supreme Court Justice Daniel Kelly in the Spring Election.
Kelly, an appointee of Governor Walker, is seeking election to a full 10-year term. He is part of the Court's 5-2 conservative majority and is considered a strict constructionist in his interpretation of constitutional law. Karofsky and Fallone are both considered political and judicial liberals who believe in an activist judiciary.
The three candidates will appear on the primary ballot on February 18, with the top two vote-getters moving on to the general election on April 7.

[Madison, WI] – In case you missed it, the hyper-partisan nature of the Evers era hit a new low on Wednesday when the Evers Administration was caught secretly recording Republican lawmakers with the goal of scoring cheap political points.
Not only does Gov. Tony Evers’ secret recording demonstrate Wisconsin Democrats’ eagerness to throw political civility to the wayside, it raises questions as to the motivations of the Evers Administration in general. When Wisconsin’s Republican leaders thought they were meeting with Gov. Evers to discuss COVID-19 in Wisconsin, the Evers Administration made sure they had a Nixon-esque recording of the meeting in hopes of scoring political points.
The Evers Administration claims the Governor was unaware that his conversation with Republican lawmakers was recorded. Throughout his time in office, the Governor has been largely disinterested in running the state and would rather have his hyper-partisan staff call the shots. So far, the Evers Administration has not apologized to Republican lawmakers or announced any disciplinary action against the state employee responsible.
Despite promises to bring people together during his campaign for Governor, Evers’ time in office has been marked by political posturing while it has sought to conceal its work from the public eye. Gov. Evers and his administration have made efforts to conceal records from public scrutiny and will not let in critical media outlets to his press briefings.
The secret recording also raises questions about other actions the Evers Administration has taken during his time in office. Was this the first time the Governor or his staff secretly recorded lawmakers? When did Gov. Evers become aware of the secret recording? What other decisions are the staff making without his consent? Will the staff member responsible be held accountable?

Republican leaders secretly recorded by Gov. Tony Evers' staff, infuriating GOP lawmakers
Milwaukee Journal Sentinel
Patrick Marley and Molly Beck
June 10, 2020
Republican legislative leaders lashed out Wednesday at Democratic Gov. Tony Evers after his staff secretly recorded a May 14 phone conversation over how to respond to the coronavirus pandemic the day after the state Supreme Court struck down the state's stay-at-home order.
The recording and the reaction to it all but ensures a permanently broken relationship between Evers and Republicans who control the Legislature. The two sides have rarely gotten along since Evers was elected in 2018 and Wednesday's episode was characterized by GOP leaders as unprecedented.
Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald of Juneau called the recording ""Nixonesque."" Assembly Speaker Robin Vos called it ""shameful.""
Evers' spokeswoman, Melissa Baldauff, said the governor was not aware of the recording and instructed his staff not to do it again.
""This conversation was supposed to be about a potential path forward on a statewide approach to the COVID-19 crisis in our state following the Republican lawsuit to overturn the Safer At Home order,"" Baldauff said in a statement.
""The recording was intended for internal use only to inform detailed note taking and planning next steps. This was not intended for release to the media or anyone else, however, we were obligated to comply with the open records law to release these records once they were requested.""
…
The Evers' administration had put a stay-at-home order in place to fight the coronavirus, and Vos and Fitzgerald sued over it when the administration extended it past Memorial Day.
The court ruled 4-3 in Republicans' favor and the state's top leaders met soon afterward. During the call, Evers sought a new rule to fight the coronavirus, but Vos and Fitzgerald said they wanted more details about what it contained and questioned whether one was necessary.
Fitzgerald, who is running for Congress this fall, said in a statement that the recording “will completely erode our ability to work together for the foreseeable future.”
“In 26 years in the Legislature, this is one of the most brazen examples of unethical, unprofessional conduct I have ever seen,” his statement said. “The governor has gone so far off the deep end, he’s making secret Nixonesque recordings from the East Wing of the Capitol. This conduct is totally unbecoming of our state’s top executive and opens up questions about what other recordings his administration may have.”
Vos called the recording “clearly outside the norm.”
“Governor Evers has dragged partisan politics to a new low in Wisconsin and damaged his reputation and the state's, as well,” his statement said.
Bill Lueders, president of the Wisconsin Freedom of Information Council, said recording a conversation without alerting the other parties isn't illegal in this state, but is in bad form — and that the nature of the meeting should have pushed the three to talk publicly instead of privately.
…
Assembly Majority Leader Jim Steineke, R-Kaukauna, said someone in the Evers administration should lose their job over the recording.
""If no one in the administration loses their job over this, it’ll be a clear indication that this secretive taping was an order from the very top,"" he tweeted.

Tony Evers’ weak leadership has led to far-left activists taking over our state. Do you think things will be ANY different under a Joe Biden and Kamala Harris Administration?
If we do not secure a victory for President Trump, the Radical Left will fundamentally alter the character of America. We cannot let that happen, Friend.
The only thing standing between the American People and a socialist takeover is FOUR MORE YEARS of President Trump!
Our success in November will require every Patriot stepping up - and it starts with YOU, Friend.
Please consider donating any amount you can as we look to hit our $10,000 fundraising goal during our Convention week!
I look forward to hearing back from you.

Alesha Guenther - WisGOP Communications,info@wisgop.org,ICYMI: Karofsky Earns Backing of Socialist Bernie Sanders  ,"ICYMI: Karofsky Earns Backing of Socialist Bernie Sanders
[Madison, WI] – In case you missed it, after Jill Karofsky attacked Justice Daniel Kelly for receiving the endorsement of President Donald Trump, Karofsky is now endorsed by Socialist and Democratic Presidential candidate, Bernie Sanders.
Jill Karofsky’s hypocrisy truly knows no bounds. Karofsky spent her entire campaign attacking Justice Daniel Kelly for the support Republicans have given him, but is now gladly accepting Socialist Bernie Sanders’ endorsement, $1.3 million from the Democratic Party of Wisconsin and hundreds of thousands from other liberal groups. Karofsky demonstrates the epitome of a “do as I say, not as I do liberal.”
Sanders threw his support behind self-proclaimed social justice warrior Jill Karofsky because he believes that judges like her know “that addressing the gun violence epidemic in this country is one of the most critical issues of this generation.” This comes after Jill Karofsky advocated for gun control and said that our Constitution allows limiting our right to possess firearms.

Karofsky nabs Sanders' endorsement in Supreme Court race after criticizing Kelly for getting Trump's backing
Milwaukee Journal Sentinel
Patrick Marley
April 2, 2020
Bernie Sanders endorsed Jill Karofsky for state Supreme Court Thursday as Wisconsin prepares for a mostly absentee election next week.
""Judges should know that women have the right to control their own bodies, that workers have the right to bargain for better wages, that same-sex marriage is a right, and that addressing the gun violence epidemic in this country is one of the most critical issues of this generation,"" Sanders said in a statement. ""Judges should stand up for the needs of working people and civil rights, not huge corporate CEO donors, which is why I strongly endorse Judge Jill Karofsky for the Wisconsin Supreme Court.""
Karofsky, a Dane County Circuit Court judge, faces Justice Daniel Kelly in Tuesday's election. Kelly was endorsed by President Donald Trump in January during a rally in Milwaukee.
…
The Supreme Court race is officially nonpartisan, but like those before it has turned into a partisan brawl. Karofsky has criticized Kelly for getting Trump's endorsement and headquartering his campaign in the state Republican Party's office, even as she has leaned heavily on the Democratic Party for $1.3 million of support.

Wednesday morning, we discovered that our new Milwaukee office was vandalized. We will not back away from our commitment to engage in the community.

Yet this is exactly the intolerance we’re up against and we need your help to push back with our message of empowerment and economic growth!
Could you chip in to help us continue our commitment to take President Trump’s message of empowerment to every community?
The left is clearly afraid of what kind of impact our Milwaukee office could have on voters in Milwaukee. Unemployment in the African American community continues to decrease and more than 350,000 have been lifted from poverty nationwide under President Trump! So now some are resorting to intimidation tactics to try to stop us from reaching people with our message. But their intimidation tactics won’t slow us down.

Alesha Guenther - WisGOP Communications,info@wisgop.org,ICYMI: Jill Karofsky Let a Brutal Child Rapist Off With the Lightest Sentence Possible  ,"ICYMI: Jill Karofsky Let a Brutal Child Rapist Off With the Lightest Sentence Possible
[Madison, WI] – In case you missed it, candidate for the Wisconsin Supreme Court, Jill Karofsky’s record as a Dane County Judge took another disturbing turn when it was revealed that she let a brutal child rapist off with the most lenient sentence possible.
Jay Perez was convicted of brutally raping his sister when she was between five and six years-old. According to the victim, Perez assaulted her while their 4 year-old autistic brother cried outside the door. Perez was able to keep his victim quiet by threatening that she would be taken away from their family if she ever came forward about his abuse.
Karofsky herself admitted that “it really doesn’t get much graver” than Perez’s crimes, but still gave him the minimum sentence possible despite the fact that he faced 225 years in prison. Even the notoriously lenient Dane County District Attorney’s office recommended a harsher sentence for such a brutal crime.
This case is just the latest example in a string of cases where Jill Karofsky has refused to give a brutal criminal a sentence that matched their crime. As a Dane County Judge, Karofsky let a baby abusing nurse, a brutal murderer, a serial child sex offender, criminals who assault police officers, and hardened criminals off easy. Karofsky’s abysmal record as a Dane County Judge stands in stark contrast with Justice Daniel Kelly’s record of upholding the Constitution and the rule of law.

The Karofsky Case Files: Jay Perez
1130 WISN
Dan O’Donnell
March 6, 2020
In 2017, Jay Perez was charged with five felonies--first degree sexual assault of a child under the age of 12, incest, and child enticement--in connection with the repeated sexual assault of his adopted sister when she was between five and six years old.
The horrifying details were discovered when the girl's diary was found years later.
""I think there is something I need to tell mom, dad [and my siblings] because it's not okay and even though it happened a while back it's still not okay,"" she wrote. ""When we used to live at the farm house & mom and dad would leave & Jay would babysit us He would lock me in his room and basically make me have sex with him.""
According to the girl, Perez would leave their four year-old autistic brother crying outside the door.
For years, Perez was able to keep both children quiet through repeated threats that the girl would be taken away from the family that adopted her. His abuse terrorized her for years, eventually causing so much anxiety and depression that she stopped going to school and began harming herself.
When his horrendous crimes finally came to light, Perez was tried and found guilty of all five counts against him. He faced a maximum sentence of 225 years in prison.
He never once admitted his guilt and, throughout the proceedings, blamed the victim--his sister--and his mother for his conviction.
Ahead of his sentencing hearing, the Dane County District Attorney's Office recommended 25 years in prison followed by 20 years of extended supervision.
Instead, Judge Jill Karofsky sentenced Perez to just 15 years in prison followed by 10 years of extended supervision. Even though, Karofsky herself admitted that ""it really doesn't get much graver"" than Perez's offenses, she gave him the absolute minimum sentence that she legally could.

Andrew Hitt - WisGOP Chairman,info@wisgop.org,Did you see the news?   ,"Friend,
Outgoing Democratic Senate Minority Leader Jennifer Shilling recently appointed her new pick to the Wisconsin Ethics Commission, calling him someone who champions “clean” government. The Appointee, Scot Ross, has spent years tweeting vile and unhinged things about Wisconsin Republicans, and now will have the opportunity to rule on matters that come before the ETHICS Commission!
Can you believe this amount of hypocrisy?
The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel just reported on Ross’ tweets that included photoshopped images of protestors carrying large sex toys. Radio talk show host Dan O’Donnell also compiled some of the worst examples.
Here are some of the most egregious examples of what Ross has to say about Republicans:
* “@SenRonJohnson is the literally biggest piece of (expletive) in Wisconsin. There you go. He wins.""
* “Ron Johnson, please go social distance and at the same time, (expletive) yourself.""
* Called Speaker Robin Vos “The Wisconsin Grand Wizard of the Flu Klux Klan”
This is not someone fit to represent ethics in the state of Wisconsin!

Alesha Guenther - WisGOP Communications,info@wisgop.org,"Congressional Democrats, Nancy Pelosi… Jill Karofsky?  ","Congressional Democrats, Nancy Pelosi… Jill Karofsky?
Just Like Her Allies, Karofsky is Trying to Manufacture a Fake Crisis
[Madison, WI] – In the race for Wisconsin Supreme Court, liberal activist and Dane County Judge Jill Karofsky is now taking a page out of the book of her Democrat allies. As Congressional Democrats continue to pursue a baseless impeachment investigation against President Trump, Jill Karofsky is similarly trying to manufacture a fake “corruption” crisis to further her own political interests.
Similar to the pathetic lies spewed by Nancy Pelosi, Adam Schiff, and Chuck Schumer, Jill Karofsky is spreading slanderous lies and attacking the institution of Wisconsin’s highest court without any evidence to back it up. Karofsky and her Democrat allies have consistently shown that there are no lengths they will not go to tear down their political opponents, even if it means destroying institutions that Americans hold dear.
Since announcing her campaign, Karofsky has continuously attacked Wisconsin’s Supreme Court as an institution, along with its members, claiming that the Court is corrupt. In Washington, Democrats have put a target on President Trump’s back and have stopped at nothing to impeach the president, even if it means manufacturing a crisis built on lies.
In her new TV ad, Karofsky once again doubles down on her attacks against the Wisconsin Supreme Court and its members by continuing to her slanderous and reprehensible claim of corruption. But much like her partisan allies, Karofsky hasn’t provided any evidence to support her claims. Karofsky’s attacks are not only baseless, they are beneath the integrity expected of a Judge.
Karofsky’s cavalier attitude towards the truth should deeply concern voters and calls into question her character and judicial temperament. When asked to back up her claims of corruption, Karofsky refuses to take responsibility for her ridiculous accusations and instead tries to shift the responsibility to others by claiming that she is only repeating what she has heard others say.
Karofsky’s attacks on the Court prove that she has no real interest in serving the people of Wisconsin and upholding the Constitution. Karofsky’s only interests include serving her political ambitions and upholding her social justice warrior agenda, no matter the cost.

[Madison, WI] – In case you missed it, a majority of the Wisconsin Supreme Court condemned candidate for the Wisconsin Supreme Court, Jill Karofsky’s vile attacks on the integrity of the Court.
Since the start of her campaign for the Wisconsin Supreme Court, Jill Karofsky has leveled categorically false and harmful attacks at the Court, even going as far as to call it and its members corrupt. Karofsky’s attacks have no factual basis and she still has not been able to back up her slanderous claims.
In a rare move, a majority of the Wisconsin Supreme Court, including the Chief Justice, rightfully condemned Karofsky’s slanderous attacks and warned against political outcome-driven approaches to the law. Justice Bradley and Justice Hagedorn specifically called into question Karofsky’s fitness to serve on Wisconsin’s highest court stating, ”slanderous statements about Justice Kelly’s work on the Court are evidence of [Karofsky’s] lack of fitness for this bench.” Such strong statements condemning Karofsky’s attacks display the gravity of such brazen allegations and the threat they pose to our judicial system.
Karofsky’s attacks on the Court prove that she has no real interest in serving the people of Wisconsin and upholding the Constitution. Karofsky’s only interests include serving her political ambitions and upholding her social justice warrior agenda, no matter the cost.

""Attacks on the integrity of the court strike at the heart of the judicial system,"" wrote Chief Justice Patience Roggensack and Justice Annette Ziegler in a joint statement. ""Such language risks undermining the court’s legitimacy with parties, attorneys, and the public.""
…
In this year's Wisconsin Supreme Court race, Karofsky has long criticized Kelly, without proof, of being corrupt for repeatedly siding with the conservative groups that support him. Kelly has shot back at those remarks, calling them ""disgusting slander.""
…
On Thursday, the Kelly campaign shared a joint statement from two of the other conservative-backed justices, Rebecca Bradley and Brian Hagedorn, advancing Kelly's characterization of the attacks as out of line.
""Her slanderous statements about Justice Kelly's work on the Court are evidence of her lack of fitness for this bench,"" Bradley and Hagedorn said. ""At no point has she actually engaged in a substantive critique of Justice Kelly's opinions, reasoning, or legal analysis. She simply casts aspersions based on the outcomes of cases, which evidences her own outcome-driven judicial approach.""
They said Karofsky's critiques of Kelly show she places more emphasis on the political outcome of cases rather than the right result based on the law.

[Madison, WI] – In case you missed it, Gov. Evers’ record of concealing public records took a new turn when his administration threatened to prosecute a journalist, a move the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel says could violate the Constitution.
In response to Gov. Evers’ latest snub to public records and the media, The Republican Party of Wisconsin issued the following statement from Executive Director Mark Jefferson:
“The rollback of open government reforms and stonewalling public records have become defining characteristics of the Evers era. Gov. Evers has tossed the public and the Constitution to the wayside in hopes he can wear down the public to the point where he can run state government in secret.”

Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers' administration threatened to prosecute reporter over confidential child abuse records
Milwaukee Journal Sentinel
Molly Beck
February 4, 2020
Gov. Tony Evers' administration sought to block a journalist from publishing information from a confidential child abuse investigation by threatening prosecution, a rare move that could violate the U.S. Constitution.
Wisconsin Department of Children and Families officials in January warned an NBC News reporter that his planned publication of a story that included information from the investigation file would violate state law and could result in six months in jail and a $1,000 fine.
""Please cease and desist immediately from any further illegal use and disclosure of the documents in the child abuse investigation file illegally disclosed to you, and any information obtained in that file,"" Therese Durkin, chief legal counsel for the agency, wrote to NBC News reporter Mike Hixenbaugh on Jan. 24\. ""Failure to comply will lead to further legal action.""
…
But media law experts say the First Amendment protects journalists' possession and publication of truthful information in the public's interest, regardless of how the information was released to them — and even trying to stop a reporter from publishing violates the U.S. Constitution.
""If somebody unlawfully discloses information to the journalist, but the journalist did nothing wrong, they have a First Amendment right to publish that information,"" Sarah Matthews, a staff attorney with the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, said in an interview.
Hixenbaugh, the NBC News reporter, obtained records related to a child protective services case involving a former emergency room doctor at Children's Wisconsin Hospital who has been charged with physical abuse of his newborn daughter. The reporter did not ultimately cite the records in his reporting.
The story includes details of the case, including information from medical records, and raises questions about whether the child was injured by an accident, rather than by abuse.
…
An attorney for NBC News wrote back to the department, saying virtually all the information contained in the investigation file is available through other sources, including court records — which are public records — and cited two U.S. Supreme Court decisions from 1975 and 2001 that said the First Amendment protects the publication of information required to be confidential by state law, even if the information's release to a journalist is illegal.
Robert Drechsel, a journalism professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who specializes in media law and constitutional issues, said the agency is free to ask the reporter not to publish but cannot legally compel them to do so.
""I don’t know how common it is for a Wisconsin state agency to tell a reporter to 'cease and desist' and threaten prosecution this way. No other examples come to mind in all the years I’ve lived in Wisconsin,"" Drechsel said after reviewing the agency's letter to NBC News. ""Any formal legal cease and desist order issued against the news media would be a prior restraint that is almost certainly unconstitutional.""
Matthews said the warning also could have a chilling effect on journalists who receive information in the public's interest.
""We don’t want to stifle vigorous reporting on an area of public interest,"" Matthews said. ""Ultimately it means the public could lose out on having important information.""
Matthews cited two more Supreme Court cases from 1979 and 1989 that said the First Amendment protects journalists from being held liable for reporting information that was illegally released to them.
…
Bill Lueders, president of the Wisconsin Freedom of Information Council, said Hixenbaugh's reporting raises legitimate questions about whether such systems are working properly for the public.
""Even if the materials were improperly released, it does not follow that using them in a story — especially a story that raises serious questions about the conduct of child abuse professionals — is a punishable offense,"" he said.

“During the past couple of weeks, Democrats have repeatedly asked courts to change our election laws and created chaos in our democratic process. While the courts have repeatedly rejected nearly all of their demands, the district court in Wisconsin has allowed absentee ballots to be collected even past the April 7th election, which is a relief that the plaintiffs never even requested. We are grateful for the success we achieved at the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in partially staying Judge Conley’s order, but we have asked the United States Supreme Court to grant an emergency stay to prevent voting after election day, which dramatically changes our election laws on the eve of an election.”

Alesha Guenther - WisGOP Communications,info@wisgop.org,ICYMI: Democrat Hypocrisy Ahead of Spring Election  ,"ICYMI: Democrat Hypocrisy Ahead of Spring Election
[Madison, WI] – In case you missed it, Bernie Sanders didn’t even wait for ballots in Wisconsin to be counted before dropping out of the race for President to boost Jill Karofsky’s numbers--all despite opposing in-person voting on election day.
As reported by the New York Times, Sanders aides even admit that they wanted Bernie Sanders to stay in the race to boost Jill Karofsky’s numbers. At the same time, Democrats were calling for Republicans to discourage voting in-person on election day. Despite saying that it was too dangerous to vote in-person, Democrats had no problem using Sanders’ candidacy to send their supporters to the polls to prop up Karofsky.
Such hypocrisy displays how far Democrats were willing to go to play politics with this election, and how far they’ll go in November. They suppressed votes in the 7th Congressional District, sued to chip away election integrity laws and caused mass confusion surrounding the election.

How Bernie Sanders Beat Daniel Kelly
MacIver Institute
Dan O’Donnell
April 15, 2020
Buried beneath a thick layer of spin and second-guessing is the universal truth about elections: The numbers don’t lie.
…
And the numbers from the Wisconsin Supreme Court Election couldn’t be clearer: Jill Karofsky didn’t beat Justice Daniel Kelly. Bernie Sanders did.
His presence in the race ensured that Democrat turnout would be sky-high since the party’s presidential primary was still technically contested. Tellingly, Sanders dropped out of the race the day after Wisconsin voted…but five days before any results were released.
His campaign knew he didn’t have a prayer in Wisconsin and hadn’t had a prayer to win the nomination from Joe Biden for more than a month, yet he stayed in the race solely to boost turnout for Karofsky—a radical liberal darling backed by millions of dollars from out-of-state left-wing groups (including billionaire financier George Soros).
Because of the Coronavirus outbreak, neither Sanders nor Biden spent any time campaigning in Wisconsin and because the race was effectively over long before, neither spent any money on ads in the state. What, then, did Sanders have to lose by staying in the race for an extra few weeks?
…
Sanders’ remaining presence (spectral though it was) in Wisconsin ensured that liberal turnout in the state would be massive. Four years ago, he won the state’s Democratic Primary with a staggering 57%-43% shellacking of eventual nominee Hillary Clinton. Then, of course, his voters thought he still had at least a puncher’s chance of stealing the nomination from her (not realizing that the Democratic Party had rigged the race against him).
This year he didn’t have a chance, but his voters either didn’t realize this or didn’t care. They turned out for him anyway, pushing total turnout in the Democratic Primary to 924,151 votes. Even during a pandemic that had all but shut down Wisconsin, this total represented just an eight percent decrease from the 1,003,904 votes cast in the 2016 Wisconsin Democratic Primary.
By contrast, President Trump did not face a primary challenger and as such, his supporters—who are perhaps even more loyal than Sanders’—did not have an incentive to vote. This resulted in just 628,469 total votes cast in the 2020 Republican Presidential Primary—a 43 percent decrease from the 1,101,123 cast in 2016.
This is well in line with recent primary history in Wisconsin.
The last time one party had an incumbent President and the other had a contested primary was in 2012, when President Barack Obama ran unopposed in the Wisconsin Primary and eventual Republican nominee Mitt Romney had to fend off a challenge from Rick Santorum.
…
This was the story of the 2020 Wisconsin Supreme Court race. Democrat turnout was simply higher because Republicans didn’t have a contested presidential primary. That’s it. That’s the entire story. Everything else is spin.
Karofsky was nothing more than the beneficiary of the Biden-Bernie battle, such as it was. She garnered 856,470 total votes, while 924,151 were cast in the Democratic primary. That was the turnout driver, not her. By contrast, Kelly received 692,976 total votes, while 628,469 were cast in the Republican primary. He was the turnout driver, not the uncontested race.
Since Wisconsin Supreme Court elections are nonpartisan, there may have been some Democratic votes for Kelly and some Republican votes for Karofsky, but that number is likely to be vanishingly small. Neither candidate made any secret of their beliefs, and Karofsky practically grabbed the Democratic Party in a bearhug in her advertising.
In return, the Democratic Party propped her up as its candidate—both in a $1.3 million ad buy on her behalf and, more importantly, in maintaining the charade that the Wisconsin Democratic Presidential Primary still mattered; that a vote for Sanders was still worthwhile.
That belief and nothing else drove Democrat turnout to levels that Kelly simply didn’t have a prayer of matching. Had Sanders dropped out of the race when every other Democrat did (or even a few weeks later), his vote totals in Wisconsin might have been closer to Warren’s 14,055 and Kelly might have eked out a win.
Instead, he stayed in the race even as he was telling the public the night before the Wisconsin primary that holding an election during the pandemic “is dangerous, disregards the guidance of public health experts, and may very well prove deadly.”
He could have easily ensured that turnout was dramatically lower by dropping out. He did two days later anyway, long before a single vote was counted.
Sanders’ safety concerns were about as genuine as his belief that he could win Wisconsin and his presence in the race was nothing more than a get-out-the-vote effort on Karofsky’s behalf.
The numbers don’t lie: It worked. Karofsky won solely because Democrats had a contested primary and Republicans didn’t. There’s really nothing more to it than that.

[Madison, WI] – In case you missed it, Justice Daniel Kelly received the endorsement from the Milwaukee Police Association who cited Justice Kelly’s record of protecting the public and enforcing the law as it is written.
Justice Kelly’s record stands in stark contrast with Judge Jill Karofsky, who has let several violent offenders convicted of assaulting or threatening police officers off without a single day in jail. Karofsky’s record of protecting our communities is abysmal, she once let off a brutal murderer with the lightest sentence possible and let another hardened criminal off easy. Time and again, Karofsky’s interest has been in protecting criminals who threaten our communities rather than the brave men and women who keep us safe.
The Milwaukee Police Association’s endorsement of Justice Daniel Kelly recognized his outstanding record. MPA President Dale Bormann said, “During his time on the Court, Justice Kelly has demonstrated his commitment to protecting the public and keeping Wisconsin families safe by enforcing the laws as they are written.”
Organizations like the Milwaukee Police Association understand that Justice Daniel Kelly’s proven record of adherence to the Constitution and rule of law makes him the most qualified candidate to serve on Wisconsin’s Supreme Court.

Carlton Huffman - Director of Strategic Initiatives,info@wisgop.org,Can our police count on you?  ,"Dear Friend,
Radical left Democrat mayors and their allies are dramatically cutting police budgets across the country—leaving our communities and our first responders less safe. Instead of standing up to them, Joe Biden has joined them in their calls to Defund the Police. We must fight back and Defend our Police!
Wisconsin Trump Victory invites all patriots to join us for a ""Defend the Police"" gathering at the Westallion Brewing Company in West Allis on Monday, August 3. All who support our police and the work that they do are invited to bring their friends, family, and neighbors to what we know will be a great evening. Our police put their lives on the line day in and day out to keep us safe. While radical left politicians refuse to have their backs, we will not be silent.
Please RSVP Here to join us on August 3rd from 6-8 pm in West Allis.

Alesha Guenther - WisGOP Communications,info@wisgop.org,Who’s Backing Tricia Zunker?   ,"Who’s Backing Tricia Zunker?
Far-Left Groups See Zunker As an Ally Who Will Push Their Radical Agenda
[Madison, WI] – Not only is Tricia Zunker a member of and tied to several radical liberal groups, she is now receiving their backing in her run for U.S. Congress. As the old adage goes, “a person is known by the company they keep,” and in this case, Tricia Zunker has done everything possible to tie herself to the far-left.
Planned Parenthood: Tricia Zunker received the backing of Planned Parenthood because she is connected to groups that support late-term abortion. Tricia Zunker proudly touts Planned Parenthood’s endorsement.
Emily’s List: Emily’s List is a dark-money PAC that aims to elect pro-abortion female Democrats to office. Naturally, they threw their backing behind Tricia Zunker’s run for congress. Emily’s List is one of the supposedly “pro-women” groups that aimed to block Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination to the United States Supreme Court on unsubstantiated allegations of sexual assault. Now, they refuse to apply the same standard to the sexual assault allegations from Tara Reade against Joe Biden.
Citizen Action: Tricia Zunker isn’t just receiving financial backing from Citizen’s Action, Zunker is also a member of Citizen Action of Wisconsin’s North Central organizing co-op. Citizen Action supports several radical policies like providing taxpayer-funded healthcare for illegal immigrants and efforts to make private health insurance illegal.
Elizabeth Warren: Ultra-liberal and failed Democratic Presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren threw her support behind Tricia Zunker’s race for Congress. We shouldn’t forget that Elizabeth Warren supports radical policies like the healthcare plan that would make private health insurance illegal and costly “free” college for all plan.
WI AFL-CIO: Wisconsin AFL-CIO put their big-union stamp of approval on Tricia Zunker’s campaign for congress.
Moms Demand Action/Everytown: Tricia Zunker was one of the founding members of her local chapter of an anti-gun group, Moms Demand Action. Zunker even supports banning certain kinds of firearms. Moms Demand Action is a subsidiary of Everytown, the anti-gun group bankrolled by failed presidential candidate and billionaire Mike Bloomberg. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Everytown claims that governors should feel confident banning gun sales in the midst of shutdowns.
ACLU of Wisconsin: Tricia Zunker sits on the board of directors for ACLU of Wisconsin. ACLU of Wisconsin just unsuccessfully tried to free inmates from prison in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The case was filed on behalf of two inmates who are not in prison for petty crimes. One of them shot a woman in the head while trying to steal her car and the other is in prison for his 5/6th OWI charge. In places like New York, letting some inmates out of prison had disastrous consequences.

“The Republican Party of Wisconsin is proud to stand up for the integrity of Wisconsin elections by filing an original action with the Wisconsin Supreme Court. While some clerks have effectively managed the current crisis, other clerks are unilaterally rewriting our state’s election laws and encouraging other clerks around the state to follow suit.”

“Gov. Tony Evers has caused mass confusion for people and businesses across Wisconsin. Yesterday, he chose to announce his forthcoming shelter in place order on Twitter, sat silent for nearly 24 hours, and then released a 16-page order that exposes violators to up to 30 days of imprisonment.

Mark Jefferson - Executive Director,info@wisgop.org,Help Us Meet Our Goal  ,"Hi Friend,
TOMORROW is election day and we need your help today to make sure we can push the President to the finish line! While President Trump is back in Wisconsin today boasting the accomplishments of his first term, Democrats remain motivated to do anything it takes to ensure President Trump is not re-elected. Money from East and West Coast liberals is continuing to pour into Wisconsin. Since 2018, the Democratic Party of Wisconsin has raised $58.7 million. Between now and the time the polls close, we are trying to raise $20,000.
Friend, we need your help to meet our goal before the polls close?
President Trump won’t win Wisconsin unless we have the resources to activate our grassroots army and fight back. We need your help before election day so that we can ensure a victory for President Trump.
Any contribution goes a long way toward achieving victory this Tuesday.
This election is bigger than the Republican Party of Wisconsin. If we turn control of our country over to Joe Biden, it means more chaos and lawlessness in our cities, and an America where the radical socialist agenda of the left will be in control. Can President Trump count on your support?
Four More Years,

Alesha Guenther - WisGOP Research,info@wisgop.org,What’s at stake in the Supreme Court Race  ,"Friend,
The race for the Wisconsin Supreme Court is underway and it is extremely important that Wisconsin re-elects Justice Daniel Kelly--whoever wins on April 7 will serve on the court for the next 10 years. As we’ve looked into the record Justice Kelly’s opponent, we’ve found out just what’s at stake in this race.
Could you chip in to help us inform voters about the importance of this race?
Liberal Dane County Judge, Jill Karofsky, is challenging Justice Daniel Kelly for his seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court. Karofsky has promised to be a social justice warrior on the bench, believes that the Constitution allows limiting our possession of firearms, has compared abortions to having wisdom teeth removed(!) and has repeatedly let dangerous criminals off easy. Her record disqualifies her from serving as a Supreme Court Justice, and we need your help to inform voters about the clear choice they have on April 7th.
Can you help us inform voters about what’s at stake?
Your donation will help us reach voters and inform them about the importance of this race. Liberals want to put Jill Karofsky on the Supreme Court because they want an ally on the court that will help them undo years of conservative reforms. Justice Daniel Kelly is committed to upholding the Constitution and the rule of law and his opponent is not.
Please chip in $25, $50, $75, or $100 to help us push back against the left’s intolerance.

Alesha Guenther - WisGOP Communications,info@wisgop.org,ICYMI: Jill Karofsky Doesn’t Care What the Department of Corrections Recommends When Sentencing Hardened Criminals  ,"ICYMI: Jill Karofsky Doesn’t Care What the Department of Corrections Recommends When Sentencing Hardened Criminals
[Madison, WI] – In case you missed it, Jill Karofsky admitted in open court that she does not think the Department of Corrections expert opinion is relevant when making sentencing decisions. Furthermore, Karofsky said she usually doesn’t take the time to remember what the Department of Corrections recommends.
Karofsky admitted her careless attitude toward the Department of Corrections’ recommendations when she let a man convicted of first degree reckless homicide off with two years behind bars when he faced 40 years in prison. The Department of Corrections recommended a different sentence, but Karofsky said she doesn’t even pay attention to the expert opinion of the Department of Corrections.
In situations such as these, the Department of Corrections makes their sentencing recommendation after compiling an extensive pre-sentencing investigation (PSI) to help inform the judge ahead of the sentencing hearing. Jill Karosfky’s distaste for any opinion other than her own further calls into question her ability to serve as a Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice. Not only does Karofsky let hardened criminals off easy time and again, she doesn’t even care what the experts have to say about it.
Time and again, Jill Karofsky has demonstrated that she has no interest in keeping Wisconsin communities and families safe. Instead, she sees letting criminals off easy as a way to advance the social justice warrior agenda she wants to bring to the Wisconsin Supreme Court.

The Karofsky Case Files: Kendall Ragland
WISN 1130
Dan O’Donnell
March 19, 2020
Wisconsin Supreme Court candidate and Dane County Circuit Court judge Jill Karofsky ignored Department of Corrections guidelines and gave a heroin dealer whose product killed a man just two years in prison when he could have faced 40.
Kendall Ragland, 41, was charged with first degree reckless homicide, second or subsequent offense, in 2018 in connection with the death of a man who overdosed on heroin he purchased from Ragland in 2015.
Ragland was a well-known drug dealer who has been in trouble with the law literally his entire adult life. From almost the moment he turned 18 in 1997, he has been convicted of possession of TCH with intent to deliver, resisting an officer, illegally carrying a concealed weapon, bail jumping, possession of cocaine with intent to deliver, domestic violence battery, criminal damage to property, and possession of heroin.
Despite his lengthy criminal record and his refusal to admit guilt on the reckless homicide charge (which carried a maximum sentence of 40 years in prison and $100,000 in fines), Judge Karofsky sentenced him to just two years in prison and two more on extended supervision as part of his ""no contest"" plea.
Disturbingly, Karofsky said during the sentencing hearing that while she knew that her extremely lenient sentence went against the Wisconsin Department of Corrections' recommendation, she didn't much care.
""Let's not worry about the recommendation,"" she said. ""I will tell you that I don't put a lot of weight on the recommendation of the Department of Corrections. I feel like that's my job.""
She reiterated this later in the hearing.
""I've said it once in this hearing and I will say it again: I really don't pay any attention to what the Department of Corrections recommends in PSIs [pre-sentence investigations],"" she said. ""Often, if I do look at it, I forget what the number is, quite frankly, by the end of the hearing or even by the time the hearing starts if I've looked at it in days prior to a hearing. As I sit here right now, I couldn't tell you what it is.""

Andrew Hitt - WisGOP Chairman,info@wisgop.org,EVERS TRIES TO RIG THE ELECTION  ,"Friend,
Democrats will stop at nothing to rig the April 7th election. After weeks of saying he can’t change the election, Evers signed an executive order TODAY trying to move the election to JUNE! Thankfully, the Wisconsin Supreme Court just struck it down! But we continue to fight back against efforts to rig this election.
Could you chip in to help fight back?
The Republican Party of Wisconsin and our Republican legislators worked hard to fight back against Evers’ order that had no regard for the Constitution. We’ve also joined the RNC with a case before the U.S. Supreme Court fighting for election integrity. We will continue to fight for the law! Our case in front of the U.S. Supreme Court ensures that the election laws that protect ballot security are followed.
This is a fight we can’t afford to lose!
The Republican Party of Wisconsin has been fighting back hard in court against Democrat attempts to rig the election. But our work means nothing if we can’t turn out a groundswell of support for Justice Daniel Kelly tomorrow. Liberals want to put Jill Karofsky on the Supreme Court because they want an ally on the court that will help them undo years of conservative reforms. Justice Daniel Kelly is committed to upholding the Constitution and the rule of law His opponent is not.

Tiffany demonstrates that he has the values and leadership to represent the people of Northern and Western Wisconsin, Zunker caters to the socialist left
[Madison, WI] – Friday night’s debate demonstrated that the choice for voters in the Seventh Congressional District could not be more clear–Tom Tiffany is a proven leader that will represent Wisconsin values and Tricia Zunker is trying to audition for AOC’s socialist squad.
On Friday night, Tricia Zunker doubled down on her anti Second Amendment positions and her desire to align herself with the far-left if elected to Congress. Tom Tiffany discussed his proven-record of fighting for Wisconsin families and his plans to get Washington and Wisconsin back on track.
In tonight’s debate, we will hear more of Tricia Zunker’s plan to cater to the far-left groups that are backing her run for Congress instead of the interests of the people of her district. Tom Tiffany will continue to demonstrate that he is the only candidate with the proven ability to lead Wisconsinites through a crisis and represent our values in Washington.
Here are some of the highlights from Friday’s debate:

Tom Tiffany: “I believe the safer at home order that we had through April 24th really had broad support here in Wisconsin and people were ready for that. Now that it's been extended through May 26th some people are starting to question it. I believe we can do both. We're Americans here. We can do both. We can both protect the public's health and safety as well as be able to open up our state, open it up cautiously, do it a step at a time.”
Tricia Zunker: “We absolutely have to focus on this, uh, in the way that we currently are.”
On the Second Amendment:
Tom Tiffany: “I will always defend people’s right to keep and bear arms under the Second Amendment. I think one of the great concerns that we have in this country, and we don't see it here in Northern Wisconsin, but there are law enforcement agencies across the country that are not enforcing laws that are already on the books. … You’re either going to defend the 2nd Amendment or you’re not.”
Tricia Zunker: “Well, that's a common answer that we already have laws on the books and we should address those. Um, but they're not working. And one of the things that will be effective is expanding universal background checks.”
On Life:
Tom Tiffany: “I voted to end late term abortion abortions here in Wisconsin and that was the right vote to take. I was there at the birth of all three of my daughters. I was there in the delivery room. I saw the miracle of life enter this world. There's some that say we should be able to snuff out that life at any point during an abortion. I believe that we did the right thing by limiting that here in the state of Wisconsin. Also, I have voted to defund planned Parenthood and I did because your tax dollars should not be used if you do not agree with an abortion happening.”
Tricia Zunker: “I believe that the laws that exist currently are the correct laws.”
On National Security:
Tom Tiffany: “We need border security and I believe it should be a bipartisan resolution that we secure our borders so we know who's coming in and out of our country.”
Tricia Zunker: “We need comprehensive immigration reform, but we need 20th century technology, not first century technology with a wall.”

Mark Jefferson - WisGOP Executive Director,info@wisgop.org,ALERT: Democrats identified Wisconsin as a top target  ,"Friend,
Democrats just announced that Wisconsin is one of their top target states in 2020 and they’re sending in even more resources. They’re bringing their convention here and are even filling their state coffers with money from national mega donors like George Soros and Steven Spielberg, among others. We have to be prepared to fight back.
Can you chip in to help us fight back?
It’s no secret that Democrats now realize that they made a mistake in 2016 when they essentially ignored the state of Wisconsin and Hillary Clinton ended up losing. They’re going to be investing in Wisconsin in a big way and we need to be ready to match their commitment.
Can you help us get ready to defend President Trump in the state of Wisconsin?
President Trump is fighting hard for the American people, and we need to make sure we’re fighting for him. Democrats will stop at nothing to tear him down--they even advanced a sham impeachment against him after coming up short with their Russia hoax.
Your donation will allow us to place regional offices around Wisconsin so we can fight for every vote, put money toward large signs and yard signs, and ensure we have the data we need to turn out voters like never before.

[Madison, WI] – In case you missed it, President Donald J. Trump endorsed Justice Daniel Kelly for Wisconsin’s Supreme Court during his “Keep America Great” rally in Milwaukee on Tuesday.
President Trump said, “Last spring, Wisconsin voters, as you know, elected a great judge to your State Supreme Court, and this spring you have a chance to re-elect another terrific judge, Justice Daniel Kelly. Go vote for Justice Daniel Kelly to defend the rule of law in Wisconsin.”
Watch the video here:
Justice Daniel Kelly is an experienced incumbent with the knowledge, temperament, and principled decision-making the people of Wisconsin want on their Supreme Court. Justice Daniel Kelly is the only candidate in the race for Wisconsin’s Supreme Court with a proven record of adherence to the Constitution and rule of law.
On Wednesday, the Associated Press also reported on Justice Kelly’s commanding fundraising lead over his two opponents. Kelly's campaign raised more than half-a-million dollars over the last half of 2019, easily outpacing his two liberal challengers.

Alesha Guenther - WisGOP Communications,info@wisgop.org,ICYMI: Judge Jill Karofsky Goes Easy on Police Attackers  ,"ICYMI: Judge Jill Karofsky Goes Easy on Police Attackers
[Madison, WI] – In case you missed it, Dane County Judge and Supreme Court candidate Jill Karofsky let several criminals convicted of attacking police officers off easy—she didn’t even sentence them to a single day behind bars. These are just the latest in a string of cases where Jill Karofksy has been unwilling to hold criminals accountable and keep our communities safe.
As reported by Empower Wisconsin, Jill Karofsky let at least five violent offenders convicted of assaulting or threatening police officers off easy without a single day in jail. Such an offense carries a maximum penalty of six years in prison, but Karofsky sentenced them to two years probation instead. Such lenient sentences for crimes committed against law enforcement demonstrate Karofsky’s interest in protecting criminals who threaten our communities over the brave men and women who keep us safe.
This isn’t the first time Judge Karofsky has been called out for her lenient sentences. Karofsky once gave the lightest sentence possible to a murderer convicted of brutally killing and hiding the remains of a 21-year-old man. She also let a hardened criminal off easy which allowed him to become the “kingpin” of a group of organized criminals. The criminals terrorized Wisconsin communities by robbing several homes, stealing several vehicles, and leading police officers on a dangerous high-speed chase.

Karofsky goes easy on police attackers
Empower Wisconsin
M.D. Kittle
February 11, 2020
Dane County Circuit Judge Jill Karofsky has been accused of being soft on crime. Multiple rulings suggest the Supreme Court justice candidate has been even softer on criminals who attack police officers.
In at least five separate cases, Karofsky withheld sentence for the violent offenders, instead ordering parole for crimes that carried a maximum of six years in prison, according to case files obtained by Empower Wisconsin.
Karofsky and Marquette University Law professor Ed Fallone are the two liberals running for the Supreme Court seat held by incumbent conservative Justice Daniel Kelly.
In one case before Karofsky, a female police officer was viciously assaulted by a suspect in possession of a handgun and bags of heroin and cocaine.
Martin J. Jacob, 17, was arrested in February 2019 on felony charges of battery to a law enforcement officer and possession of narcotics. He was also charged with obstructing a police officer and unlawfully carrying a concealed weapon. While Madison police officers were arresting Jacob, he head-butted a female law enforcement official, giving her a “very noticeable bruise on the right side of her forehead.”
Karofsky found Jacob guilty of battery, but gave him two years probation instead of a prison sentence. Granting the terms of a plea deal, the judge dismissed five other counts, including possession of heroin, cocaine, and carrying a concealed weapon. Last month, Jacob was charged with battery with use of a dangerous weapon, and disorderly conduct. Karofsky is again the presiding judge.
In another case, a repeat offender threatened the lives of police officers on two separate incidents occurring within days of each other. Karofsky withheld sentencing and handed out probation.
Gene E. Rouse, 48, no known address, was arrested of Feb. 23, 2019 on charges of threatening a police officer and resisting. Rouse, who has a long rap sheet that includes convictions on burglary and theft, was arrested after he became disorderly and screamed racial epithets at his fellow passengers on a Madison Metro bus, according to court documents. When an officer attempted to take Rouse into custody, he shouted, “I’m gonna kill you,” among other threats. He continued to do so through the booking process.
Then, days later, on March 8, police were called to deal with Rouse again, this time passed out drunk on a city bus, court documents state. Rouse, whose blood alcohol content level was more than three times the legal limit, threatened the arresting officer, declaring that, “18 people watching you.” “You just got killed, dude,” he threatened the officer.
Despite Rouse’s long record and repeated incidents of threatening police officers, Karofsky withheld sentence and gave Rouse two years of probation. She ordered that the convicted felon remain sober and receive treatment. He previously had received credit for 98 days served in jail awaiting sentencing.
In another case, a Mount Horeb woman kicked, swung at and bit a Mount Horeb female police officer, screaming, “I’m going to kill you, you (expletives deleted),” court documents show. When Emergency Services workers drew blood from Sierra M. Tanner during a blood alcohol test, the suspect “flicked her blood” at the officer.
Karofsky, again, found the offender guilty and granted a plea deal and withheld sentence. Tanner got two years of probation.
“These cases display the continuing pattern that Jill Karofsky is unwilling to hold criminals accountable and keep our communities safe,” said Alesha Guenther, deputy communications for the Wisconsin GOP. “In these instances, Karofsky wouldn’t even give criminals convicted of assaulting police officers a single day behind bars.”
The Supreme Court candidate has said she will be a social justice advocate who, if elected, would use her seat on the court as a bully pulpit for criminal justice reform.
“I won’t be able to pass laws, right?” Karofsky said in a secretly recorded video obtained by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. “But I will be able to listen and I’ll be able to talk about what I see. I believe we need to reform the criminal justice system in the state of Wisconsin.”
The concern from Karofsky’s critics is that she will try to reform the criminal justice system from the bench. They accuse her of being soft on crime during the former prosecutor’s three year’s on the bench. The Republican Party of Wisconsin has pointed to Karofsky’s ruling in the case of Cleaster Moon, a 24-year-old felon charged last year as the “kingpin” of a string of burglaries and robberies in Dane and Waukesha counties.
As the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported, In 2018, Karofsky initially sentenced Moon to probation in a plea deal recommended by prosecutors. But after his probation was revoked, she ordered him to 1½ years in prison and 1½ years extended supervision. Because of the time served behind bars while awaiting sentencing, he was back out on the street in six months.
Karofsky’s campaign did not not return a call seeking comment.

“It is tragic to see such a reckless disregard for the Constitution from Gov. Tony Evers who just days ago admitted he did not have the power to change the election.

Today, Republican Tom Tiffany was sworn in to replace Congressman Sean Duffy in Wisconsin’s 7th Congressional District. Despite Democrat attempts to rig the election in their favor by suppressing rural votes to flip this seat blue, we still pulled off a strong double-digit win! While this is certainly a victory for Republicans, we still have a lot of work to do between now and November to ensure Tom and other Republicans keep their seats. That’s right--Tom Tiffany must be re-elected this November.

[Madison, WI] – In case you missed it, Judge Jill Karofsky recently compared the decision to get an abortion to the decision to get one’s wisdom teeth removed. Moreover, eroding the rights of law-abiding gun owners remains a high priority for Karofsky as well.
As reported by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Jill Karofsky said, “I think that any medical decision, whether you're talking about having your wisdom teeth out or your meniscus repaired or you're talking about an abortion, it should be a conversation between a patient and his or her doctor.”
Karofsky also stated the following on limiting our Constitutional right to bear arms: “I think that there are ways that are constitutional that we are able to limit people's possession of firearms.”
This is just the latest way that Judge Jill Karofsky has made her political agenda for Wisconsin’s Supreme Court known. Karofsky was recently caught on tape saying that she would advocate for social justice issues from the bench of the Supreme Court if elected.
Karofsky’s record of prioritizing her political views stands in stark contrast with Justice Daniel Kelly’s record of standing up for the rule of law and the Constitution. Justice Daniel Kelly has the knowledge, temperament, and principled decision-making the people of Wisconsin want on their Supreme Court.

Wisconsin's Supreme Court candidates' opinions on past cases show their views on abortion, guns and voter ID
Milwaukee Journal Sentinel
Patrick Marley
January 24, 2020
The candidates for state Supreme Court won’t say how they’d rule on a host of issues, but past cases offer some clues to their legal thinking.
State Supreme Court Justice Daniel Kelly faces challenges from Marquette University law professor Ed Fallone and Dane County Circuit Judge Jill Karofsky. A Feb. 18 primary will narrow the field to two for the April 7 general election.
Kelly, who was appointed to the high court in 2016 by then-Gov. Scott Walker, has won the backing of conservatives. Fallone and Karofsky are getting support from liberals.
…
The candidates also differed over a 2008 U.S. Supreme Court decision known as Heller that determined the right to bear arms in the Second Amendment is an individual right, rather than a collective right for groups like militias.
Kelly: “I've read it carefully, and I've not identified any errors.”
Fallone: “The Heller decision is judicial activism on the right. Justice (Antonin) Scalia took individual words of the Second Amendment, rearranged them and created something new. … I adamantly disagree with the reasoning, but I do not advocate overturning it because I do not think it is healthy to constantly turn these issues into political footballs.”
Karofsky: “I think that there are ways that are constitutional that we are able to limit people's possession of firearms so that we're able to live in a country where we don’t have to send our kids to school for code-red drills.”
Kelly said he owns a shotgun and two hunting rifles and obtained a concealed weapons license a couple of months ago. Fallone and Karofsky are not gun owners and do not have concealed weapons licenses.
…
Asked if that meant he thought the landmark Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion was improperly decided, Kelly said, “It certainly carries a suggestion, but as with all the other things that I've written about in the past before coming to the court, that's going to have to stand on its own. You know, I certainly wouldn't want to be opining on matters that may come before the court.”
Fallone said Kelly’s blog posts suggested that “his understanding of human sexuality is about 100 years out of date.”
“Roe vs. Wade is settled constitutional law and should not be overturned,"" he said. ""The court has had many opportunities to do so and has rightfully declined.”
Karofsky agreed.
“I think that any medical decision, whether you're talking about having your wisdom teeth out or your meniscus repaired or you're talking about an abortion, it should be a conversation between a patient and his or her doctor,"" she said. ""And those are the people who should make that decision.""

The Republican Party of Wisconsin,info@wisgop.org,Where is Joe?  ,"Friend,
Today, Democrats are “gathering” in Milwaukee to open their first day of the virtual Democratic National Convention. Despite how much they say they support Wisconsin, Joe Biden and his out-of-touch liberal allies are nowhere to be found. In fact, our best estimate is that it’s been over 650 days since Joe Biden last set foot in Wisconsin.
Help us beat Joe -- Donate today
Where is Joe? While he hides in his basement, President Trump is coming to Wisconsin today. The President is committed to fighting for hard-working Wisconsin families and so are we. Any donation you make today will help the Republican Party of Wisconsin fight against Joe Biden’s assault on our way of life. We need to reelect President Donald J. Trump. Can we count on your support?

Last night, we held our grand opening for our office in the heart of Milwaukee, to reach Urban voters in a whole new way. The opening was a huge success but we need your support to use the office to share the President’s message.
Will you chip in to fund our efforts?
We need to do everything we can to meet people where they are with a message that resonates with them on a personal level. Just as an example, over 1.6 millions new jobs for black Americans have been created and more than 350,000 African Americans have been lifted out of poverty under President Trump. That’s why we’re making sure the people of Milwaukee and all of Wisconsin know that President Donald Trump is fighting for them!
Can you help us reach out to voters in Milwaukee?
Your donation will fund our efforts to build relationships with community members in Milwaukee and talk to them about President Trump’s bold agenda for America in the same year that the DNC is coming to the city. And it will allow us to organize alongside conservative candidates in Milwaukee and provide assistance the Party simply hasn’t given in the past.

[Madison, WI] – In case you missed it, Justice Daniel Kelly is endorsed by a bipartisan majority of Wisconsin Sheriffs for the Wisconsin Supreme Court. This comes after Justice Kelly was endorsed by the Milwaukee Police Association.
Justice Daniel Kelly is endorsed by law enforcement because they trust him to safeguard the rule of law from the bench of the Wisconsin Supreme Court. While these brave men and women protect our communities, Justice Daniel Kelly protects our Constitutional rights in his role as a Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice. Justice Kelly’s record of upholding the rule of law and protecting Wisconsin families is a far cry from Judge Jill Karofsky’s soft on crime record.

Alesha Guenther - WisGOP Communications,info@wisgop.org,ICYMI: Supreme Court Candidate Judge Jill Karofsky Wants to “Limit People’s Possession of Firearms”  ,"ICYMI: Supreme Court Candidate Judge Jill Karofsky Wants to “Limit People’s Possession of Firearms”
[Madison, WI] – In case you missed it, Supreme Court Candidate Judge Jill Karofsky believes that lawmakers can limit our Constitutional right to possess firearms, a clear indication of how she would rule from the bench of Wisconsin’s Supreme Court. Karofsky has previously called on lawmakers to restrict Wisconsinites’ access to firearms and is running on a platform that calls for stricter gun control.
Jill Karofsky’s comments are even more concerning seeing as Democrat Gov. Tony Evers has floated the idea of mandatory gun confiscation and red flag laws. If elected to Wisconsin’s Supreme Court, Karofsky could be responsible for voting on the constitutionality of such measures.
This is just the latest in Jill Karofsky’s record of promising to prioritize her own social justice warrior agenda from the bench. Karofsky previously said that she would be able to advocate for social justice issues from the bench of Wisconsin’s Supreme Court and compared the decision to get an abortion to the decision to get one’s wisdom teeth removed.

Karofsky: Lawmakers can ‘limit people’s possession of firearms’
Empower Wisconsin
M.D. Kittle
February 5, 2020
Liberal Supreme Court justice candidate Jill Karofsky has been guarded in discussing most legal issues, but her comments over time give a pretty clear indication about where she stands on the Second Amendment.
To the Dane County Circuit Court judge, the constitution is flexible on gun rights.
“I think that there are ways that are constitutional that we are able to limit people’s possession of firearms so that we’re able to live in a country where we don’t have to send our kids to school for code-red drills,” Karofsky was quoted as saying last month in a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel story.
Does than mean she would vote to uphold the kind of gun-confiscation laws (Red Flag laws and government-led gun buyback programs) Democrats like Gov. Tony Evers have been pushing? Karofsky won’t say. She did not return Empower Wisconsin’s request for comment regarding her views on the Second Amendment and gun control.
…
Karofsky’s views on limiting “people’s possession of firearms” have been attacked by Second Amendment defenders and the conservative candidate she is trying to unseat, Supreme Court Justice Daniel Kelly. They see the Dane County judge as just another liberal activist set on interpreting the law to reflect her personal beliefs. She has denied the claim.
...
In reading the federal and state constitutions, Kelly has said he strictly adheres to their text and historical meaning, and that philosophy fully applies to gun ownership.
Kelly told the Milwaukee Journal he found no errors in District of Columbia v. Heller, a 2008 Supreme Court ruling that reasserted the right to bear arms is an individual right. That’s when Karofsky made her comment about finding constitutional ways to limit the possession of firearms. The other liberal in the race, Marquette University Law School professor Ed Fallone, called the Heller decision “judicial activism on the right,” but he said overturning it would only “turn these issues into political footballs.”
Karofsky certainly isn’t opposed to firing off verbal rounds at her conservative opponent. Kelly recently accused her of slander for claiming the justice always rules in favor of “right-wing” special interests, even as Karofsky draws her base of support from left-wing interests.

[Madison, WI] – Candidate for the Wisconsin Supreme Court, Jill Karofsky, can’t stop making false claims in her campaign for Wisconsin’s highest court. Today, the Republican Party of Wisconsin launched a new website called “[[URL REDACTED]]” to hold Jill Karofsky accountable for her lies and expose the truth about her record.
“Jill Karofsky has shown that she will do or say anything to advance her political agenda but Wisconsinites deserve to know the truth. Whether it’s covering up for her abysmal record of endangering Wisconsin families as a judge or trying to hide her radical liberal views, Karofsky has effectively disqualified herself to sit on Wisconsin’s highest court,” said Mark Jefferson, Executive Director of the Republican Party of Wisconsin. “In stark contrast, Justice Daniel Kelly has a proven record of standing up for the Constitution and the rule of law and deserves a full-term serving the people of Wisconsin.”

“While this is certainly an unprecedented and challenging time, the Supreme Court’s decision made it clear that the Governor’s orders cannot alter state statutes and we cannot suspend common-sense laws that ensure fair elections in a democracy. Officials carrying out our elections must respect those laws. The Dane County Clerk’s reliance on Gov. Tony Evers’ Emergency Order #12 advising that all voters are indefinitely confined was ‘legally incorrect’ and the Wisconsin Supreme Court concluded that ‘Voters may be misled to exercise their right to vote in ways that are inconsistent’ with state statutes. We applaud the Court’s ruling.”

[Madison, WI] – In case you missed it, as Wisconsin Supreme Court candidates make their case to voters, Justice Daniel Kelly stands out as the only candidate who will uphold the rule of law. Justice Daniel Kelly made it clear that he has the knowledge, temperament, and principled decision-making the people of Wisconsin need on their Supreme Court.
Justice Kelly’s proven record of adherence to the Constitution and rule of law – that means deciding cases based on what the law is, not what he thinks the law should be – stands in clear contrast to that of his opponents. The Wisconsin State Journal reported that both of Kelly’s opponents, Jill Karofksy and Edward Fallone, fully acknowledge their “progressive” political leanings.
One of his opponents, liberal Dane County Judge Jill Karofsky, even acknowledged that she would stray from the original intent of the Constitution. Speaking to the State Journal, Karofsky stated, “we need to be interpreting the Constitution with today in mind. It’s 2020.” This isn’t the first time that Jill Karofsky has revealed her political agenda for the Supreme Court, she said that she would advocate for social justice issues from the bench, spoke out in favor of gun control and has a history of giving light sentences to hardened criminals.

Wisconsin Supreme Court candidates make case to voters
Wisconsin State Journal
Riley Vetterkind
January 13, 2020
Control of the Wisconsin Supreme Court may not be up for grabs in this spring’s election, but the three candidates vying for a 10-year term on the court still argue their election would drive it in a significantly different direction.
Incumbent Justice Daniel Kelly, who is backed by conservatives, and Dane County Circuit Judge Jill Karofsky and Marquette Law School professor Ed Fallone, both backed by liberals, are set to compete in the Feb. 18 primary that will determine which two candidates advance to the April general election.
…
But political observers say the race nevertheless carries political weight. A win by a liberal-backed candidate this year would give liberals the chance to retake the majority on the court in 2023, when conservative-supported Chief Justice Patience Roggensack’s term expires. If Kelly wins election in April, conservatives will hold onto the majority until at least 2025.
…
Kelly, who was appointed to the court in 2016 by former Republican Gov. Scott Walker to replace retiring Justice David Prosser Jr., said serving a full term would help ensure the court remains faithful to the state and U.S. Constitutions.
…
“For me, it’s a very straightforward issue,” Kelly told the Wisconsin State Journal. “This is about being faithful to the Constitution, the Constitution as it is actually written, not as we might wish it to be written, but as it was actually adopted and maintained by the people of Wisconsin.”
Kelly, who is supported by conservatives, describes his judicial philosophy as “textual originalism,” meaning he looks for the original public meaning of the text of the law or the state or U.S. Constitution or their amendments when they were adopted.
“It’s important that we not insert ourselves into what we think the text should be, we just take it as it is actually written,” Kelly said. “It’s kind of a humble role in the governmental structure.”
If today’s society opposes provisions of the Constitution, they can be changed through the amendment process, not through Supreme Court justices, he said.
To understand the meaning of a law, he said, he references only the text to understand its intent, consulting historical sources to understand the meaning of words and phrases, rather than explore the intent of the law. Kelly said his judicial philosophy most closely aligns with conservative-backed Justices Rebecca Bradley and Brian Hagedorn on the Wisconsin Supreme Court, and with Justice Neil Gorsuch and on the current U.S. Supreme Court.
A component of his judicial philosophy that has prompted criticism from Fallone and Karofsky is his view toward precedent. While Kelly said stability of law is important so Wisconsinites know what’s expected of them, overturning precedent is important if a justice believes a prior high court ruling is incorrect.
“The only time that a precedent should be overturned is when it’s just flat wrong,” Kelly said. “But it’s important that we do overturn it if it’s wrong. Our role is not to perpetuate errors. Our role is to state accurately what the law is.”
Kelly said a prominent example of such a doctrine was Brown vs. Board of Education, the racial segregation case that overturned a 60-year precedent set by Plessy v. Ferguson.
…
When it comes to constitutional law, she [Karofsky] said “we need to be interpreting the Constitution with today in mind. It’s 2020.”
…
Karofsky has faced several lines of criticism from conservatives and her opponents, who say she would be a “social justice warrior” on the bench, that she doesn’t have sufficient experience with civil cases and that she is soft on crime.
Karofsky acknowledges her progressive politics but said fairness and the rule of law dictate her decisions, not her personal policy preferences. She said her time on the front line of the criminal justice system made it clear to her that some criminal justice reform is necessary.
…
Fallone defended himself against accusations he doesn’t have sufficient experience in Wisconsin courts. As a law professor, he said, he follows a notable line of other influential justices, such as Abrahamson — a former chief justice — and U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. He said the idea that Wisconsin Supreme Court justices should have trial experience is a false qualification.
…
Fallone declined to say which justices his judicial philosophy most closely aligns with. He said he identifies as a progressive.

Mark Jefferson - Republican Party of Wisconsin,info@wisgop.org,Dems push to defund the police  ,"Friend,
Just when you think the far left can’t get any worse, they take it a step further. And as if turning a blind eye to destruction and lawlessness wasn’t enough, Joe Biden has openly said he “absolutely” supports the re-directing funds away from police departments.
This is what we are up against!
Democrats and the far-left don’t care about keeping our communities safe! Now more than ever we need to take action. Right here in Wisconsin, we have Democrat candidates that openly support the “complete abolition of the police and prison system.”
We can’t let them get away with it!
The Republican Party of Wisconsin is fighting against the far-left and their agenda that they want to bring to Wisconsin. With your help, we can deliver a win for President Donald Trump and Republicans up and down the ticket this fall.

Alesha Guenther - WisGOP Communications,info@wisgop.org,ICYMI: In-person Voting Didn’t Lead to a Spike in COVID-19  ,"ICYMI: In-person Voting Didn’t Lead to a Spike in COVID-19
[Madison, WI] – In case you missed it, in-person voting on April 7 did not cause a spike in cases of COVID-19 in Wisconsin despite promises from Democrats that the election would be responsible for an outbreak.
Despite the Democratic Party of Wisconsin’s fear-mongering and irresponsible efforts to even fundraise off of a potential spike in deaths of their fellow Wisconsinites, there was not a spike in cases or deaths. Wisconsin proved that with careful planning, we can protect people’s access to the polls while safely and fairly conducting an election. Democrats again engaged in voter suppression by limiting access to the polls and causing mass confusion before election day. Governor Evers had no interest in moving the election until the big party bosses at the DNC finally gave him permission.
“What’s striking here is the disappointment of Democrats, and even their continued denial that there was no election-caused spike in COVID-19 cases. The Wisconsin Democrat party and their allies in numerous media outlets eagerly predicted a massive spike, with gruesome hopes on capitalizing politically. They sought to exploit a global pandemic to fit their narrative and failed,” said Mark Jefferson, Executive Director of the Republican Party of Wisconsin.
“The over the top, hysterical language used by Democrats leading up to the election that was clearly wrong is exactly why we should not make last minute, unconstitutional changes to our election laws,” said Andrew Hitt, Chairman of the Republican Party of Wisconsin. “Such dramatic changes under false pretenses erodes our democracy.”

In-person voting didn’t lead to a spike in COVID-19
Milwaukee Journal Sentinel
John Diedrich
April 29, 2020
Three weeks after Wisconsin residents cast ballots, researchers see no spike in COVID-19 cases attributable to in-person voting, though they say the effect from the election may be hidden in the numbers and difficult, if not impossible, to ever detect.
Predicted by some experts and officials, a surge in cases from the chaotic day of voting may have been prevented by precautions embraced at the polls. Wisconsin residents also appeared to follow the stay-at-home orders carefully in the days after the election, data show.
…
Given the incubation period of the coronavirus, epidemiologists said a surge in new cases would have appeared statewide last week. Except for a slight increase that could have been explained by other reasons, no surge appeared.
""I don’t think that the in-person election led to a major effect, to my surprise. I expected it,"" Alagoz said, adding they don't expect to see a spike in the future.
…
Officials at the Department of Health Services said they also did not see a spike.
""We didn’t observe any overall significant surge in infections associated with that,"" Westergaard said. ""There is reason to think some people may have been exposed based on interviews done locally but not enough to create a trend or signal that we can detect on a statewide basis.""
…
Some have characterized these numbers as an ""uptick,"" but the experts are cautious.
""With the data we have, we can't prove an association,"" Westergaard said. ""It would be speculative to say that was definitely the cause without really investigating closely and being clear that somebody really had no other potential exposure to infected people. I don’t think we have the resources to really do that to know definitely.""

Mark Jefferson - WisGOP Executive Director,info@wisgop.org,Far-Left Socialists are targeting Wisconsin   ,"Friend,
The far-left socialist agenda is not just something that exists in the Swamp and on the coasts. Just today, Ilhan Omar endorsed Wisconsin state Senate candidate Nada Elmikashfi, of Madison, so these ideas are closer to home than ever!
We have to be prepared to fight back!
Nada Elmikashfi is a rubber stamp for Democratic-Socialists like Ilhan Omar. After rioters tore down a statue of an abolitionist and a women’s monument in Madison, she responded “F*** your statues.” She wants to completely abolish the police and the prison system. This is how far to the left the Democratic Party in Wisconsin is becoming and we have no choice to fight back.
I wish that the stakes in this year’s election were not so high. The Democratic Party of our parents and grandparents simply doesn’t exist anymore. As they move further to the left, we must continue to highlight how extreme the Democratic Party has become.

Alesha Guenther - WisGOP Communications,info@wisgop.org,ICYMI: Jill Karofsky’s Campaign is Built on a Dangerous Lie  ,"ICYMI: Jill Karofsky’s Campaign is Built on a Dangerous Lie
[Madison, WI] – In case you missed it, Jill Karofsky built her entire campaign for the Wisconsin Supreme Court on a dangerous lie that is in direct conflict with her record. At the same time she is claiming that she is tough on crime, she let dangerous criminals off easy time and again.
Karofsky has repeatedly bent over backwards to give light sentences to dangerous criminals. While Karofsky’s television ad claims that she “locked up criminals and protected families as a prosecutor and now as a trial judge,” her actual record reveals otherwise.
Just a month before she announced her Supreme Court run, a 21-year-old murder victim’s family and the Dane County District Attorney’s Office begged Karofsky not to let a brutal murderer off easy, but Karofsky let him off with the lightest sentence she legally could give. When a repeat child sex offender who raped his five-year-old sister appeared in Karofsky’s courtroom, she let him off with the lightest sentence that was legally allowed despite the fact that he faced 225 years behind bars.
When a serial child sex offender groped a third minor on her way to school while he was on probation, Karofsky gave him more probation with the first year in jail. After Karofsky let a career criminal off easy, he committed several more dangerous crimes.
Karofsky can try to brand herself as a tough on crime judge, but that doesn't change the fact that her record demonstrates exactly the opposite. Time and again, she opted to let dangerous criminals off easy with sentences that did not match their crimes.
Read the full write up here, or read excerpts below.
Jill Karofsky’s Dangerous Lie
MacIver Institute
Dan O’Donnell
April 1, 2020
Wisconsin Supreme Court candidate Jill Karofsky doesn’t mess around. At least she would like you to believe she doesn’t. Her courtroom, her latest television ad boldly intones, is her “arena, and she doesn’t mess around.”
Karofsky, the ad continues, has “locked up criminals and protected families as a prosecutor and now as a trial judge.”
“Whether you’re a violent criminal or a corrupt politician, I will hold you accountable,” Karofsky says as she looks directly into the camera, desperate to convince you that she doesn’t mess around.
Her actual record on the Dane County Circuit Court, however, reveals otherwise. As perhaps the single most liberal, soft-on-crime judge on the single most liberal, soft-on-crime court in the state, Karofsky has repeatedly bent over backwards to not hold violent criminals accountable.
Just a month before she announced her Supreme Court run, the Dane County District Attorney’s Office begged her to sentence Daniel Lieske, a brutal murderer to life in prison without the possibility of extended supervision.
Lieske (61) was convicted of the calculated murder of 21 year-old Jesse Faber last April. So callous and remorseless was Lieske that he laughed and joked with friends just hours after shooting Faber to death and hiding his body in a storage unit.
Dane County District Attorney, Ismael Ozanne, who personally prosecuted the heinous crime, joined with the Faber family in pleading with Karofsky to throw the book at Lieske. If any crime warranted it, certainly this one did. Especially in the “arena” of a judge who “doesn’t mess around.”
Instead, Karofsky handed Lieske the most lenient sentence she legally could.
…
Solely because Lieske would be old, Karofsky allowed him to live out his golden years as a free man even though he had robbed another man of all but 21 years of his life.
It was a sentence so inexplicable that it would shock the conscience if it wasn’t part of a longstanding pattern of Karofksy coddling just about every hardened, convicted criminal who had the good fortune of landing in her “arena.”
In 2018, for instance, a repeat child sex offender named Jay Perez was convicted of the brutal rape of his five year-old adopted sister…while their four year-old brother sat crying outside the room.
For years, Perez kept his victim quiet by threatening that if she ever told, she would be taken away from her family. Eventually, she became so depressed that she dropped out of school and began harming herself.
Perez refused to accept a plea deal and went to trial. After he was found guilty on all five felonies with which he was charged, he faced a maximum sentence of 225 years in prison.
Even though the Dane County District Attorney’s Office recommended 25 years in prison and 20 more on extended supervision and Karofksy herself said during Perez’s sentencing hearing that “it really doesn’t get much graver” than his crimes, she again issued the lightest sentence that was legally allowed: 15 years in prison and 10 more on extended supervision.
A year earlier, Karofsky gave a similarly disgusting break to a serial child sex offender named Mick Keoduangsy.
In 2015, he was convicted of groping two teenage girls outside of their school and then, while still on probation, went before Karofsky on a charge of domestic battery. She sentenced him to nine months in jail with work release privileges and, while he was out, he groped a 12 year-old girl as she walked to school. He was charged with first degree child sexual assault and, as a repeat offender, faced a maximum sentence of 66 years in prison.
Karofsky sentenced him to just a year in jail and five more years of extended supervision.
According to the Wisconsin Sex Offender Registry, Keodouangsy is homeless, meaning that he could be literally anywhere and totally free to grope more girls as they walk to school.
As soft on murder and child sex crimes as Karofsky has proven herself to be, she is just as soft on violent drug dealers…even when their product kills.
In 2018, Dane County prosecutors charged a well-known heroin dealer and career criminal named Kendall Ragland with first degree reckless homicide after he sold the heroin that killed a young man.
He faced 40 years in prison and despite his decades-long criminal record and refusal to admit his guilt following a no contest plea, Karofsky willfully ignored sentencing guidelines from the Wisconsin Department of Corrections and handed Ragland a gift of a two-year prison sentence.
...
“I really don’t pay any attention to what the Department of Corrections recommends in PSIs [pre-sentence investigations]. Often, if I do look at it, I forget what the number is, quite frankly, by the end of the hearing or even by the time the hearing starts if I’ve looked at it in days prior to a hearing. As I sit here right now, I couldn’t tell you what it is.”
Karofsky’s willful ignorance of sentencing guidelines and dangerous desire to keep violent criminals on the streets is still harming Wisconsinites to this day.
Just three months ago, prosecutors charged an organized crime “kingpin” with new counts of theft, car theft, and burglary.
Cleaster Moon was before Karofsky in 2017 following a battery and burglary crime spree and while he faced 40 years in prison, Karofsky sentenced him to just 18 months.
“There is no joy in sending someone to prison, especially when someone is as young as you are,” she told him during his sentencing hearing.
Although Moon has been in and out of jail since he was 17 years old and has a rap sheet longer than his leg, Karofsky believed him when he promised to change his ways, especially since he had a job interview scheduled at Madison-based Sub-Zero a few weeks later.
“I’m confident that if you go down the road that you’re talking about today,” she said, “you’ll end up, in the future, putting this behind you and — and working at a place like Sub-Zero.”
He didn’t. The second he got back out on the streets, he went right back to committing crimes.
Moon, it seems, isn’t messing around, either. His case, along with those of Lieske, Perez, Keoduangsy, Ragland, and dozens of other dangerous sociopaths given a break in Karofksy’s courtroom prove that her assurances that she has “locked up criminals and protected families” are dangerous lies.
She is in fact quite possibly the most terrifyingly lenient circuit court judge in Wisconsin.

Mark Jefferson - WisGOP Executive Director,info@wisgop.org,Democrats won’t stop ripping on America’s Accomplishments  ,"Friend,
Last night during his State of the Union Address, President Trump celebrated America’s accomplishments and the lives of extraordinary American heroes. Nancy Pelosi ripped it all to shreds and ranted that she couldn’t find one page with truth on it.
Will you help us fight back against this level of insanity?
President Trump is working hard to build Americans up in the face of unprecedented attacks from the left. Nancy Pelosi and Democrats showed yet again last night that they would rather sit on their hands and tear America apart than celebrate American accomplishment.
We can’t let the Democrats tear down our President!
Nancy Pelosi can rip paper all she wants, but we can’t let her rip up and roll back President Trump’s Accomplishments. Winning the state of Wisconsin for President Trump is key for President Trump to win four more years in the White House.

Alesha Guenther - WisGOP Communications,info@wisgop.org,Jill Karofsky Refuses to Turn Over Public Records  ,"Jill Karofsky Refuses to Turn Over Public Records
Jill Karofsky falls in line with her Democrat allies and closes the curtain on open government
[Madison, WI] – The Republican Party of Wisconsin announced on Monday that Dane County Judge and candidate for the Wisconsin Supreme Court, Jill Karofsky, refused to fulfill open records requests sent to her office, raising questions on her opinions on government transparency.
On December 10, a Republican Party of Wisconsin staff member sent two separate open records requests to Karofsky’s office asking for emails containing certain search terms, her central calendar and copies of records requests sent to her office after receiving an anonymous tip that Karofsky was campaigning out of her official office. On December 18th, a Wisconsin Courts staff member acknowledged receipt of the requests and said that the records would be released, “as soon as practicable and without delay.”
After several attempts to follow up with the Wisconsin Courts staff member who informed receipt of the request and Karofsky’s office, the Republican Party of Wisconsin still has not received the records or even an update as to when Karofsky’s office will release the records. After not receiving the records for nearly five months, it’s clear that Jill Karofsky has no intention of following Wisconsin public records law and turning over the records. Furthermore, it raises the following question: What exactly is Jill Karofsky trying to hide?
Jill Karofsky is falling in-line with her democrat allies by refusing to comply with open records law. Governor Tony Evers was heavily criticized for not turning over even one day’s worth of his emails. Supreme Court Justices in Wisconsin should be committed to upholding the law, not refusing to comply with it and withholding records from public view. Such a blatant disregard for the importance of government transparency from our government officials further disqualifies Karofsky for the bench of the Wisconsin Supreme Court.

[Madison, WI] – In response to the Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Party of Wisconsin’s attempt to rig the April 7 election in their favor, the Republican Party of Wisconsin issued the following statement from Executive Director Mark Jefferson:
""Democrats are trying to hijack a national health crisis to rig an election in their favor. If they cared about accessibility at the polls, they’d join us in urging clerks across Wisconsin to allow early voting immediately, not just those in their communities of support. Instead, they insist on suspending common-sense rules in an effort to further rig the election.”

Alesha Guenther - WisGOP Communications,info@wisgop.org,Jill Karofsky’s Allies Exploit Tragedy in Milwaukee to Attack Justice Kelly  ,"Jill Karofsky’s Allies Exploit Tragedy in Milwaukee to Attack Justice Kelly
Liberals Attack Law-Abiding Gun Owners of Wisconsin
[Madison, WI] – Jill Karofsky’s allies were quick to try to exploit the tragic events that occurred in Milwaukee last week for political gain. Now, they are trying to use the tragedy to attack Justice Daniel Kelly and law-abiding gun owners across Wisconsin.
Just hours after the shooting, Democrats like Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes were quick to politicize the heinous crimes in Milwaukee. Before having all the facts, Democrats attempted to blame Republicans for the shooting citing Republican opposition to controversial red-flag laws. Now, Jill Karofsky’s Democrat allies are trying to equate law-abiding gun owners—who go to a gun range to practice how to better protect themselves and their families—to vicious killers who senselessly murder innocent people.
Make no mistake, such a disgusting attack on Justice Daniel Kelly and his supporters is an attack on all the law-abiding gun owners of our state. By launching such a distasteful attack, Karofsky’s allies apparently believe responsible gun-owners and mass murderers are one and the same.
Attempts to tie Justice Daniel Kelly and supporters of the Second Amendment to the shooting in Milwaukee demonstrate that there is no low that Jill Karofsky and her allies won’t stoop to for political gain. Under no circumstance should law-abiding citizens who legally exercise their rights to bear arms be blamed in any way for the tragic events that occurred in Milwaukee.
Jill Karofsky has already made it clear that she will not respect our Second Amendment rights if elected to the Wisconsin Supreme Court. Karofsky has previously called for gun control and believes the Constitution allows limiting our possession of firearms. Democrats are lining up to support Jill Karofsky because they know she supports limiting our Second Amendment rights and will use the Wisconsin Supreme Court as a vehicle to achieve her goal.
What’s more, Jill Karofsky has made it clear through her numerous light sentences that she has no interest in protecting Wisconsin families in her current role as a trial court judge. Just recently, Karofsky let a nurse convicted of abusing babies off easy. In the past, Jill Karofsky has also let brutal murderers, serial child sex offenders, and other dangerous criminals off with a slap on the wrist.

Alesha Guenther - WisGOP Communications,info@wisgop.org,Who’s Backing Social Justice Warrior Jill Karofsky’s run for the Supreme Court?  ,"Who’s Backing Social Justice Warrior Jill Karofsky’s run for the Supreme Court?
Far-Left Groups See Karofsky As an Ally Who Will Push Their Radical Agenda
[Madison, WI] – After promising to be a social justice warrior from the bench of Wisconsin’s Supreme Court, the radical Wisconsin Working Families Party recently announced that it is supporting Judge Jill Karofsky’s campaign.
Despite claiming that she will act as a fair and independent judge, Karofsky is aligning herself with some of the most radical far-left groups in Wisconsin and lying about her supposed judicial independence. As the old adage goes, “a person is known by the company they keep.” In this case, that person is Judge Jill Karofsky and the company she keeps is the quasi-Marxist, union-backed group known as the Working Families Party.
Groups like the Wisconsin Working Families Party are endorsing Karofsky because they see her as an ally that--if elected--will carry out their radical agenda from the bench, and they are right to claim her as their ally. Karofsky has already promised to advocate for social justice issues from the bench, advocated for limiting our Second Amendment rights, and compared getting an abortion to getting one’s wisdom teeth removed.
According to Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Working Families Party is “the closest thing” to a party that believes in socialism. Born out of an alliance of union leaders and far-left groups like ACORN, the Party was designed to push Democrat officials further to the left and is known for pressuring candidates to take union-friendly stands on issues. This should be no surprise considering that WWFP is backed by big labor unions.
Major union donors to the WWFP include:
* American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME)
* Service Employees International Union (SEIU)
* United Food and Commercial Workers International Union (UFCW)
* United Auto Workers (UAW)
* Communications Workers of America (CWA-COPE)
* American Federation of Teachers (AFT)
The WWFP is also financed by the We Are Wisconsin Political Fund, a committee created by a coalition of national labor unions to support the recall of Governor Scott Walker. The group has also received millions of dollars from unions and liberal groups like For Our Future -- the mega-union super PAC financed by billionaire liberal activist and failed Presidential candidate Tom Steyer.
The WWFP openly admits that they view their judicial candidates as allies that will push their radical agenda in our judicial system. When WWFP endorsed radical Lisa Neubauer, they said “If Neubauer wins her election, the balance of power on the Court will shift toward more progressive jurists.” WWFP knows that Jill Karofsky will be the same rubber stamp for the far-left on the Wisconsin Supreme Court and joins other labor unions in endorsing her.
The facts are in: Jill Karofsky wants to bring her social justice warrior agenda to the Wisconsin Supreme Court and big labor unions and radical leftist groups want to help her do it. She is blatantly lying to the people of Wisconsin when she claims that she will be an independent voice from the bench, and that is exactly why liberal groups gave Karofsky their stamp of approval.

[Madison, WI] – In case you missed it, the city of Green Bay’s Mayor, Eric Genrich intentionally caused chaos ahead of the April 7 election. Rather than prepare to administer the election as safely and efficiently as possible, Genrich caused confusion and made it more difficult for people from his city to vote. His efforts to throw the election into chaos caused massive lines in the city of Green Bay to vote.
The City of Green Bay declined free extra poll workers from the Wisconsin National Guard despite having a shortage of poll workers leading up to the April 7 election. As a result, the City of Green Bay only opened two polling locations when the city normally opens 31. Brown County Clerk, Sandy Juno, called the mismanagement of the election “unacceptable.”
The City of Green Bay’s mayor claimed that they didn’t want to have inadequately trained poll workers administering the election. It takes a few hours to be fully trained as a poll worker. The Brown County Clerk also explained that members of the National Guard were properly trained to be poll workers the weekend ahead of the election.
Green Bay’s mayor unsuccessfully sued state election officials to restrict access to in-person voting last month. If the City of Green Bay would have spent a fraction of the time preparing for the election that was spent launching a lawsuit against the state, they would have been able to run an election as smooth as other communities across the state.
Meanwhile, Democrats continue to blame Republicans for long lines on election day even as other areas in the state were able to run election day smoothly. Mayor Genrich prioritized playing political games over properly administering an election.

Brown County Clerk says election in Green Bay was mismanaged
Brittany Schmidt
WBAY
4/8/2020
We're learning more Wednesday about major problems during the spring election which many people say prevented them from exercising their right to vote.
Action 2 News showed viewers the long lines at Green Bay polling places Wednesday after COVID-19 led the city to consolidate voting locations. Fewer poll workers and extra safety precautions meant the voting process took longer of each person.
At Green Bay West High School, one of two polling locations in the city, operations didn't wrap up until about 1 a.m. on Wednesday.
…
""Unacceptable. To me that's unacceptable,"" said Sandy Juno, Brown County Clerk. ""Clearly, the size of Green Bay only having two polling locations with one tabulator at each location was insufficient.""
Green Bay Mayor Eric Genrich declined an interview with Action 2 News on Wednesday, but in a Facebook Post he wrote, ""I want to stress that this was not an option we chose eagerly. In fact, it was our last resort. Our contingency plan, once first realizing a significant decline in available poll workers, involved the use of our four high school gyms. That number fell to two locations as the number of experienced and trained poll workers fell further.""
…
A city staff member told Action 2 News that over the past few weeks the city lost 85 percent of its experienced poll workers. In an effort to maintain safety, the staffer said they needed to consolidate and find locations big enough to allow social distancing.
When Action 2 News asked Juno if she had any control over Green Bay's decision to only have two polling places, she said 'no.'
In the Facebook Post, Mayor Genrich goes on to say, along with City Clerk Kris Teske who also declined an interview with Action 2 News on Wednesday, that they ""had the option of bringing inexperienced individuals into the process, but our city clerk and I did not feel comfortable implicating untrained city employees, members of the public, or members of the National Guard in a dangerous and stressful environment.""
Juno said the National Guard members were trained.
""The Wisconsin Election Commission trained all of the National Guard over the weekend. So they were all trained in elections. They just didn't have practical experience working in the polls,"" said Juno.
…
Juno said the City of Green Bay could have had more help because she had about 50 National Guard members who could have helped out at the polling locations.
""On Sunday, I did talk to the mayor because I was looking for a site to dispatch the National Guard from on Monday. And he again reiterated that they did not need them and they did not want them,"" said Juno.
Action 2 News asked Juno if she could force Green Bay to use the National Guard members and she said, 'No. That is not under my control. That is a municipal function.""
Juno said she had 140 National Guard members available to dispatch in Brown County. Of those, she used 92. Juno said she had 48 that were on-call Tuesday.
Action 2 News asked Juno if Green Bay could have called her to get those people and she said, 'all they had to do was notify us. we had a whole bunch of them on call. We had 48.""
When Action 2 News asked Juno, after she received several calls from voters upset about the long lines, why she didn't call Green Bay saying she could send some help, she said, 'You can't talk to people when they have their phone automatically forwarded to voicemail. They did not reach out to us.""
""The failure yesterday was not because of COVID-19 because we had 1850 municipalities that successfully performed, all their elections went off with excellence. We had two that failed. (she is referring to the City of Milwaukee and City of Green Bay) That was not COVID 19 that was mismanagement of the election.""

In less than three weeks, voters across Wisconsin will go to the polls to re-elect Justice Daniel Kelly. With the ever-changing news on the corona-virus pandemic, we need to encourage as many voters as we can to consider voting early via absentee or in-person.
Could you chip in to help us encourage Wisconsinites to vote early?
There is so much at stake in this election and we can’t afford for any of our supporters not to participate. Justice Daniel Kelly is committed to upholding the Constitution on our Supreme Court. The Madison liberals are back at it trying to sneak a soft-on-crime, pro-abortion, gun control advocate on to the Supreme Court! Yet the health and safety of our supporters remains a top priority, which is why we want to make sure they know they can vote from home if they choose. This requires digital advertising, mail and phones.
Can you help us inform voters about the benefits of voting early?
Your donation will help us reach voters and inform them about the importance of this race. This race is as important as ever. We need to do everything we can to ensure Justice Daniel Kelly a full-term on the Wisconsin Supreme Court.
Please chip in $25, $50, $75, or $100 to help us encourage voters to vote early.

[Madison, WI] – In response to Tom Tiffany’s victory in the Wisconsin Seventh Congressional District Primary, the Republican Party of Wisconsin issued the following statements from Chairman Andrew Hitt and Executive Director Mark Jefferson:
“The Republican Party of Wisconsin would like to congratulate Tom Tiffany on his victory in Tuesday’s Spring Primary election. Tom Tiffany is an ideal candidate to replace Rep. Sean Duffy and fight for the people of Wisconsin’s Seventh Congressional District in Washington. The Republican Party of Wisconsin is pleased to support him on May 12,” said Andrew Hitt, Chairman of the Republican Party of Wisconsin.
“Democrats recognized early that they have little chance to win this race, given the conservative make-up of the district, and their candidate’s extreme views on issues ranging from supporting the impeachment of President Donald Trump to attempting to roll back our 2nd Amendment rights. That’s why Gov. Tony Evers fought to suppress votes in the seventh district by calling the election on May 12, instead of the already scheduled General Election on April 7. Gov. Evers didn’t want too many votes from northern Wisconsin to sway the race for state Supreme Court. Now area voters will have to go to the polls twice to have their votes fully count. We urge northern Wisconsin voters to choose Tom Tiffany to represent them in Washington this May,” said Mark Jefferson, Executive Director of the Republican Party of Wisconsin.

Andrew Hitt - Republican Party of Wisconsin,info@wisgop.org,How much does it cost to violate a shelter in place order?   ,"Friend,
If you haven’t already heard, the Democratic Party of Wisconsin has raised nearly $10 million during the last fundraising period alone. Democrat Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, who was recently caught violating his own shelter in place order by traveling to Wisconsin, gave $2.5 million dollars to Wisconsin Democrats alone!
They are trying to build a war chest to defeat President Trump this November, and we can’t let them get away with it!
These donors aren’t from Wisconsin and they don’t share our values. Nearly 90% of their donors are from outside Wisconsin and nearly 95% of their money raised came from donations of $10K or more.
They aren’t going to ignore Wisconsin this time!
Coastal elites have put a target on Wisconsin and they are flooding our state with millions of dollars to attack President Trump and Republicans. We’re working hard to make sure we have a ground-game to match their war-chest, but we need your help to fund it!
Could you chip in $25, $50, $75, $100, or even $500 to help us fight back?

Alesha Guenther - WisGOP Communications,info@wisgop.org,ICYMI: Wisconsin’s Supreme Court Race Comes Down to Activism vs. Principle  ,"ICYMI: Wisconsin’s Supreme Court Race Comes Down to Activism vs. Principle
[Madison, WI] – In case you missed it, Supreme Court Justice Daniel Kelly and liberal Dane County Judge Jill Karofsky will face off in April’s General Election for the Wisconsin Supreme Court. Wisconsinites have a distinct choice between a principled justice with a demonstrated record of following the rule of law and a judge who would engage in judicial activism.
Whether it’s promising to be a social justice warrior from the bench or ranting on twitter, Jill Karofsky demonstrates the very essence of judicial activism. In stark contrast, Justice Daniel Kelly has demonstrated throughout his career that he is committed to upholding the Constitution and the rule of law.
On April 7, Wisconsinites will have a choice between a Justice who has demonstrated he can put his personal political beliefs aside and a judge who is pledging to bring her agenda to the bench of Wisconsin’s Supreme Court.
Read the full write-up here, or find excerpts below.
The Supreme Court Race Comes Down to Activism vs. Principle
MacIver Institute
Dan O’Donnell
February 19, 2020
Like any good politician, Jill Karofsky wants the public to know where she stands on the issues and how she will enact an agenda based on her ideals once elected.
“I believe in protecting our environment from corporate polluters, protecting women’s health care, and holding corrupt politicians accountable,” she says in a television ad that has been running all month.
It’s direct, to the point, and effective. It also completely disqualifies her as a serious candidate for the office she seeks.
…
The irony here is at once laughable and terrifying. Karofsky, a very liberal Dane County Circuit Court judge, is promising to make decisions based on the law while listing off decisions that she would leave to her own conscience. Restrictions on abortion? She’d strike them down because she believes in “protecting women’s health care.” Disputes over mining regulations? Sorry, corporate polluters, but she will be the greatest champion for the environment since Captain Planet.
Not content to simply legislate from the bench, Jill Karofsky is promising to legislate from a hunch—relying on nothing more than the brilliance and morality of…Jill Karofsky.
Hers is the worst sort of judicial arrogance; a deeply held belief in her own ability to delineate right from wrong independent of the U.S. or Wisconsin Constitutions, applicable statutes, and relevant case law. It also violates the state’s Code of Judicial Conduct.
SCR 60.06 3(b) explicitly provides that “a judge, judge-elect, or candidate for judicial office shall not make…with respect to cases, controversies, or issues that are likely to come before the court, pledges, promises, or commitments that are inconsistent with the impartial performance of the adjudicative duties of the office.”
Promising to stand up against “corporate polluters,” “corrupt politicians,” and anyone who would threaten “women’s health care” is about as blatant a violation of both the letter and spirit of this guideline as one could imagine.
Land use, abortion issues (which is rather obviously what Karofsky means by “women’s health care”) and political corruption cases will obviously come before her, should she be elected to the Supreme Court, and could conceivably come before her in her current role on the Dane County Circuit Court.
How can she possibly adjudicate these cases fairly when she is openly advertising the fact that she will rule for certain parties and against others?
In December, she used her Twitter account (@JudgeKarofsky), which clearly identifies her as a judge, to publicly call for stricter gun control legislation.
…
“We can respect constitutional rights and at the same time take steps to make every family safer. It’s way past time for lawmakers to step up to the plate.”
Does that screed leave any conceivable doubt about how she would rule on gun control legislation signed by Governor Evers? Even if such a law represents a gross violation of the citizenry’s Second Amendment rights, Karofsky’s stated belief that “more action is needed” to “make every family safer” prejudices her in favor of the law’s constitutionality.
It is thus impossible for Karofsky to impartially (and therefore ethically) hear any gun control case that would come before the Wisconsin Supreme Court, but given her stated mission to crusade against the proliferation of firearms, does anyone really believe that she would recuse herself?
Of course not. Activists like her live to decide these sorts of cases by substituting personal political preferences like the ones Karofsky tweeted for actual precedent and Constitutional principle.
By contrast, her opponent, incumbent Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Daniel Kelly actually did recuse himself from the most hot-button political case of the year, even though it meant handing a (temporary) victory to his political opponents.
…
Wisconsin faces a clear choice on April 7th: Principled, moral deference to governing law or shameless, reckless politicking.
Karofsky’s advertisements and Twitter rants are the very essence of judicial activism and illustrate why it is so dangerous. Justice Kelly, on the other hand, has just demonstrated his strict adherence to the Rule of Law. The April 7th election, then, isn’t so much a contest between two judges as it is a battle for what Wisconsin wants its Supreme Court to be.

“Democrats asked the federal court to quickly rewrite our election laws, and while the court rejected nearly all of their demands, the court’s decision to change the date by which absentee ballots can be received without any limitation on the postmarked date effectively changes the date of the election. Such a substantial decision normally left to our elected officials requires the review of the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals.

[Madison, WI] – In celebration of Juneteenth, The Republican Party of Wisconsin issued the following statement from Chairman Andrew Hitt:
“Today, Americans join in celebrating the 155th anniversary of the day when the news President Abraham Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation finally made it to Americans enslaved in Galveston, Tx, marking the end of slavery in the United States. While this proclamation meant the end of slavery in the United States, our collective fight to ensure freedom and opportunity for all must continue.
“Earlier today, the Republican Party of Wisconsin issued a statement from Gerard Randall, the Chair of the African American Council of the Republican Party of Wisconsin. In part, Gerard’s statement read, ‘By working together, we have made great progress, and we must continue that work to ensure Wisconsin is the best place in America to live, work, and raise a family.’
“Gerard’s words highlight the work he has done in his community to advocate for policies that will ensure more opportunities and freedoms for all Wisconsinites. Gerard has been a tireless leader and advocate in his community for decades, and I am so grateful for his leadership in the Republican Party of Wisconsin. Thanks to Gerard’s work, the Republican Party of Wisconsin opened the first office of its kind in the Bronzeville neighborhood of Milwaukee, allowing us to further engage in communities where we have not been present enough in the past.
“At the same time, we need to recognize that the Republican Party needs to do more to engage with the black community and celebrate important occasions such as today’s. Developing better public policy and instituting change comes from having a better understanding of the challenges these community members face and being a part of the community. We aren’t going to find answers to the issues we’re facing without engaging in open and honest dialogue. We must recognize our failures and continue to commit ourselves to do better.”

“While Juneteenth is certainly a time for celebration and remembrance, it is also a time to thank the men and women who have bravely acted as catalysts for change.

Congratulations to Judge Jill Karofsky on advancing to the State Supreme Court general election on April 7th. Now the real work begins.
Wisconsin's 2020 State Supreme Court race is going to shape the future of the state for a generation – and the presidential election in the fall.
Let's defeat right-wing Justice Dan Kelly, appointed by Scott Walker and endorsed by Trump, and elect a Justice who believes in justice for all!
Support our field teams today as they mobilize massive amounts of voters for the April 7th spring election.
In Wisconsin's 7th Congressional District – the seat vacated by Sean Duffy - the GOP candidate in the May 12th special election is now official: Tom Tiffany, who sides with corporate polluters over communities and people every chance he gets.
The Northwoods of Wisconsin are some of the most beautiful areas on earth. Earth Day itself was born in the 7th Congressional District. If you want someone who believes in taking care of the planet, rather than despoiling it, help us elect Tricia Zunker to Congress.
Contribute today to open more field offices in Northern Wisconsin’s 7th Congressional District!
Our field teams have already knocked on 10’s of thousands of doors this spring, but we need to expand our voter mobilization efforts to win the Spring Elections on April 7th and the Congressional Special Election on May 12th.

In Wisconsin, Scott Walker thought he'd broken us. He and the Koch Brothers and Reince Priebus and Paul Ryan flooded the state with dark money, smashed unions, and suppressed voters.

I hope you’re having a warm and relaxing holiday season!
But it doesn’t look like the GOP are relaxing. The Associated Press reported that the Republicans are getting ready to turn to their old-strategy in 2020: suppressing the vote in key states like Wisconsin.
That’s why we need to double-down on our grassroots strategy. We’re expanding voter mobilization teams all over the state and hiring staff for our Voter Protection, Communications, and Data Analysis teams.
However, the GOP-led effort to purge 234,000 voters means we need your help to double down on our voter registration efforts. We added $13,000 to our budget for these efforts and we hope you will help us meet this goal.
Help us get there by clicking here.
Why is this goal so important? Elections in Wisconsin are often decided by less than 1 percent of the electorate. We need to make sure folks know they've been purged. This won't happen by itself, but that's what our organizing teams are built for. As Republicans try to suppress the vote, we must outwork them to register voters.

Grassroots @ WisDems,info@e.wisdems.org,Introducing the 2020 grassroots organizing team!,"Team –
Our grassroots organizing team is critical to making sure we can reach every voter in Wisconsin ahead of the 2020 election and now we will need to organize even more quickly (and even more people!) so we can re-register the 234,000 voters the GOP is purging from the records.
Building a winning grassroots organizing team is why we need your help today. Here’s where your donation will go:
1. The Field Organizer: The enthusiastic go-getter who gathers teams of volunteers to speak to voters. This is a key role in any grassroots strategy and can make a big difference in turning out voters on election day. Click here to support our field organizers!
2. The Phone Banker: The always upbeat dialer who speaks to undecided voters and discusses the issues that impact them. Not only does the phone banker sway voters, they also collect important data we use to measure public support. Click here to support our phone bankers!
3. The Canvasser: A staple of any successful campaign, the canvasser braves the elements to talk to voters face-to-face. Vital to voter mobilization and persuasion efforts, the one-on-one time with voters is priceless and immensely important to our party. Click here to support our canvassers!
Building this massive team is not going to be an easy task, but it is the only way to effectively fight back against Republican voter suppression efforts.
Remember: Wisconsin is the tipping point state and elections here are often decided by less than 1 percent of the electorate. As Republicans try to suppress voters, the Democratic Party of Wisconsin is working to register voters. Please support our democratic efforts to win in 2020!

DEFEND ACA NOW,info@e.wisdems.org,The ACA is under new threats,"TODAY: THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT TURNS TEN
Ten years ago, Democrats gave millions of Americans access to quality, affordable healthcare and protections from price-gouging insurance companies.
Ten years later, the GOP still wants to strike down the ACA and privitize the health insurance industry – stripping millions of their insurance.
Will you sign on now to protect your healthcare before it’s too late?
SIGN ON NOW
* * *
Folks – Ten years ago today, President Barack Obama signed the Affordable Care Act (ACA) into law. The ACA delivered healthcare to millions of Americans and protections for those with preexisting conditions.
However, ten years later, this life-saving legislation is facing its biggest challenge yet as Trump and the GOP continue their attempts to gut it, remove protections, and cater to the health insurance industry.
That’s why we need 1,000 signatures in the next 24 HOURS to say that Wisconsin wants to keep their healthcare and defend the ACA from those who want to abolish it. Add your name here →
ADD YOUR NAME
There’s no better time to bring attention to this pressing issue than today, on the law’s anniversary. Celebrate its passing by defending it when we need it the most.

Friend –
Trump’s remarks five years ago echoed around the world. Since then, Trump has continued to show just how racist he is while working to divide us for political gain.
Here are just a few of his worst racist tropes.
* Trump has called the majority-Black Baltimore a “rat and rodent infested mess.”
* Trump called white nationalists in Charlottesville “some very fine people.”
* Trump has attacked Congresswomen Ocasio-Cortez, Omar, Tlaib, and Pressley, and told them to 'go back where they came from.'
Team, we need your help before the end of the day tomorrow – we want to get another 2,500 grassroots donations by midnight tomorrow so we can give our organizing teams more resources they need to help Wisconsin Democrats win.
Remember: Wisconsin came down to only a few thousand votes in 2016, so we must be prepared for another tough fight.

We fought to extend absentee voting so people could vote from the safety of their homes, and to decrease the exposure and spread of the deadly Coronavirus. But the GOP struck it down to suppress the vote.
In fact, in Milwaukee, the number of polling locations decreased from 180 to just 5, which meant bigger crowds and longer waiting periods. That means more exposure and more spread of Coronavirus.
In the upcoming weeks, we are sadly going to see just how many people get infected, hospitalized, and die due to the GOP’s carelessness. We cannot let this happen again.

Folks,
We’re fighting for the soul of America. If we give Donald Trump another four years in the White House, he will fundamentally alter who we are as a nation.
The road to the White House goes straight through Wisconsin. The great people of the Badger State are crucial to restoring our values, rebuilding our middle class, and unifying this country.
We’re Americans: tough and resilient. We choose hope over fear. Science over fiction. Truth over lies. And unity over division. And together, there is not a single thing we cannot do.
Will you chip in $5 today to my campaign and to the Democratic Party of Wisconsin’s grassroots team, which is so important to winning in November?
If you haven’t had a chance to contribute, or if you’d like to help us start off the month on a good foot, please send your support to our digital organizing teams who played such a vital role in electing Justice Karofsky:

In Wisconsin, grassroots teams worked together to elect Jill Karofsky to the state Supreme Court, despite conservative judges suppressing the extension of vote by mail options during a global pandemic.
Wisconsin Democrats know how to win. They have incredible momentum after sweeping statewide elections in 2018. With your support, we will work together to make sure Donald Trump is a one-term President. Republicans have stockpiled millions to make sure we don't succeed. We’ve already seen their senseless attacks against me, against Governor Evers, and against Democrats across the country.
So if we are going to be successful in this election, it's imperative we hit our fundraising goals so we have the resources we need to win.
It's going to take committed Democrats like you to do it. We need your help now more than ever.
Can you chip in today?

Sen. Brian Schatz has been in the U.S. Senate since 2012. He was the Chair of the Democratic Party of Hawaii from 2008 – 2010. He was elected to be the Lieutenant Governor of Hawaii in 2010 and in 2012 he became the youngest Senator in the 112th Congress.
Sen. Schatz is working to help Senate candidates achieve a Democratic majority this fall, but he also knows we need to defeat President Trump. Since Wisconsin is the tipping point state in the 2020 election, Sen. Schatz has been using his large Twitter following to promote our efforts to defeat Trump in Wisconsin.
Last fall, a senior Trump campaign official said in a closed-door briefing ""If we lose Wisconsin, we lose the election."" And that, indeed, is exactly what we're planning for Trump. Chip in to join me and Sen. Brian Schatz at this virtual event to hear how:

Hey there!
We already know the 2020 election is going to be the most consequential of our lifetimes. But we must also realize that Wisconsin is going to have an extremely important role in deciding who wins the White House.
That’s why we must be prepared for 2020 – especially in the states that will tip the scales one way or another.
And when it comes down to the biggest issues of our time – universal health care, gun safety, immigration reform, preventing climate catastrophe – we need to be ready to achieve victory in 2020.
That’s why I’m reaching out to ask if you can chip in $3 to the Democratic Party of Wisconsin so they can build up the grassroots teams in what might be the most important swing state in 2020.

When I speak to voters – in the Midwest and around the country – they tell me they expect their government to put aside their petty differences to join together and pass meaningful legislation that helps all Americans.
Before we can take on the issues that truly matter to Americans, we need to make sure we’re in the best place possible to win back the White House. That starts with your help in making sure we have what it takes to flip Wisconsin blue.
Thank you for giving so much of yourself to this important cause. I’ve never been more hopeful for what we can do when people from all walks of life come together to win a new era.
We can do it, together.

This race is going to help decide so much of our future for generations to come: partisan gerrymandering, health care, gun violence, and climate change could all land in the hands of the State Supreme Court.
If Dan Kelly gets reelected, we are guaranteed that Republicans will continue to get away with ignoring the will of the voters and bringing Trump and the GOP’s destructive agenda to Wisconsin.
We need a fair and impartial judge who will make decisions based on the rule of law, not their personal agenda. That’s why we need your help to elect Judge Jill Karofsky to the Supreme Court on April 7th!

Here are some key members of our grassroots team who will benefit if you send your support today:
The Field Organizer: The enthusiastic go-getter who gathers teams of volunteers to speak to voters. This is a key role in any grassroots strategy and can make a big difference in turning out voters on election day.
Support our field organizers!
The Phone Banker: The always upbeat dialer who speaks to undecided voters and discusses the issues that impact them. Not only does the phone banker sway voters, they also collect important data we use to measure public support.
Support our phone bankers!
The Canvasser: A staple of any successful campaign, the canvasser braves the elements to talk to voters face-to-face. Vital to voter mobilization and persuasion efforts, the one-on-one time with voters is priceless and immensely important to our party.
Support our canvassers!
We want to build organizing teams where each part can operate to the best of its abilities. We already have over 200 teams all over Wisconsin, but Republican voter suppression efforts remind us we need to keep building more teams!

If we start early and work together, we will ensure that every American voter’s voice is heard and that Democrats up and down the ballot win.
Wisconsin Democrats are already at work, organizing, talking to voters, and fighting voter suppression across the state.

Trump has been doubling-down on building support in our state. He’s making it clear that he knows just how important winning Wisconsin is to his reelection campaign.
That’s why we need to raise at least $5,000 to offset the money he’s getting from his oil lobbyists, his real-estate developer friends, and his Super PAC buddies.

In Wisconsin's Supreme Court race, we ran a massive organizing operation to help Wisconsinites vote by mail. It crushed all expectations – and toppled an incumbent Supreme Court justice for only the second time in half a century.
Jill Karofsky performed 10 percentage points better than her conservative opponent in votes cast by mail than she did in votes cast at polling places.
That's no accident. That's the result of tireless work by thousands of us across the state – not just in the three and a half weeks before April 7, but in the three and a half years since our year-round field program was launched.
We won on April 7 because our values drive us to care for our communities. To keep people safe. To help people vote, not shut people out. To make democracy work.
We will continue to win elections by out-organizing the GOP.
We have a lot of work to do, but we know we will achieve more victories with your help.
Will you chip in $5 to our team today?

friend, Joe Biden has a small lead on Trump in Wisconsin, but the Trump campaign has been purchasing tens of millions of dollars of attack ads against Biden in an attempt to take the lead.
Trump knows that his reelection campaign hinges on Wisconsin and that these results are within the margin of error. That is why we need to continue to expand our organizing efforts – it’s the best way to fight back against Trump’s attacks.

Tony Evers,info@e.wisdems.org,I am asking for you to help Wisconsin's Democrats,"Friend,
Wisconsin will be the center of the action in this critical election year.
On June 30th, the Democratic Party of Wisconsin (DPW) is facing a big Federal Election Commission (FEC) reporting deadline. That report will help national Republicans determine how much they’ll spend here in Wisconsin.
As a leader for Wisconsin’s Democrats I’m proud to support the organizing work they’re doing. They are investing in the organizing necessary to fight back against Republican special interest money and win elections up-and-down the ballot.
Listen, I am asking, can I count on your support to help ensure the Democratic Party of Wisconsin shows their strength when the FEC reports are released?

As Governor, I was proud to use my first year in office to travel to all 72 counties in Wisconsin. And I’m glad that DPW has built an organizing machine to compete in all corners of our state. I know that I won my race in 2018 because DPW organized early and organized everywhere.
That is why I am so proud of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin and the team they’ve put in place to organize and mobilize our state this fall.
The bottom line is this: the stakes are too high for Wisconsin Democrats to be out-organized.
That is why they need your help. Can you chip in?

ELECTION DAY UPDATE [via @WisDems.org],info@e.wisdems.org,UPDATED: about tomorrow [VERY IMPORTANT],"IMPORTANT UPDATE: moments ago the Wisconsin Elections Commission clarified that voters who have not yet received their absentee ballot will not be able to call their clerk and receive a ballot by email (as suggested in the below email). Unfortunately these voters will have no recourse and will instead have to go to their polling location tomorrow if they wish to vote.
Moments ago the U.S. Supreme Court and the WI Supreme Court put the lives of Wisconsinites at risk because they refused to modify the rules for absentee ballots or dates for in-person voting.
Here is what that means for tomorrow's election:
→ If you’ve requested an absentee ballot – Your absentee ballot has to be postmarked by tomorrow or dropped off at a polling place.
Wisconsin Democrats are strongly encouraging voters to drop off their ballot at their polling place by 8pm CT to ensure that it is counted reliably.
If you don’t know where your polling place is you can click here to find out.
→ If you did not receive your Absentee Ballot – Call your Municipal Clerk [Click here to find the phone number.] They will send a printable ballot via email that you must print off, fill out, and return in-person to a polling place.
The sad truth is that this is a disgusting attempt to suppress Wisconsin voters while putting the voters lives at risk.
We will hold them accountable for this.
But first, we need to have the best showing possible tomorrow.
Please let us know if you have any questions.

Election Security (DPW),info@e.wisdems.org,[NEW] Voter purge headed to the WI Supreme Court,"Team,
Conservative groups want to purge over 200,000 voters – and now they’re taking the case to our Supreme Court.
The truth is: Republicans need to win our state in 2020 and they can’t match us in grassroots grit. So, they’re turning to their favorite voter suppression tactics to tip the scales in their favor.
That’s why your support is so important. We need to raise $5,000 by the end of the week so we can arm our organizing teams with the resources they need to re-register purged voters. Show your support today →

Ben Wikler,info@e.wisdems.org,In honor of our 2nd Independence Day,"Today is Juneteenth and we want to make sure that all of our supporters know its history, and sign on to help make it a federal holiday.
The Emancipation Proclamation was issued in 1862. But it wouldn’t be until 3 years later when the last group of enslaved people found out they were free.
That date – June 19th, 1865 – is known as Juneteenth.
Black people have observed and celebrated Juneteenth for over 150 years with gatherings, parades, singing, and readings of the proclamation.
Every year, Democratic Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee introduces a resolution in Congress commemorating the significance of Juneteenth. This year, she is going to be introducing a bill to make Juneteenth a federal holiday.
Sign our petition supporting the effort in Congress to make Juneteenth a federal holiday.
Wisconsin Democrats are proud to support and celebrate Juneteenth. That’s why the Juneteenth Flag (pictured below) is being flown above the state Capitol today.
Here’s what Wisconsin Lt. Governor Mandela Barnes recently said:
“This year, Juneteenth has particular significance as we find ourselves in the midst of a movement for racial justice and an end to systemic racism. We have won significant freedoms since 1619, but our work will not be over until all Black lives matter by way of equity and the opportunity to thrive.""
He’s absolutely right. Observing Juneteenth is more important than ever today.
Add your name: “I believe that Juneteenth should be a federal holiday.”
In solidarity,
Ben Wikler

Joe Biden,info@e.wisdems.org,The road to the White House runs through Wisconsin,"Folks,
We’re fighting for the soul of America. If we give Donald Trump another four years in the White House, he will fundamentally alter who we are as a nation.
The road to the White House goes straight through Wisconsin. The great people of the Badger State are crucial to restoring our values, rebuilding our middle class, and unifying this country.
We’re Americans: tough and resilient. We choose hope over fear. Science over fiction. Truth over lies. And unity over division. And together, there is not a single thing we cannot do.
Will you chip in $10 today to my campaign and to the Democratic Party of Wisconsin’s grassroots team, which is so important to winning in November?
If you haven’t had a chance to contribute, or if you’d like to help us start off the month on a good foot, please send your support to our digital organizing teams who played such a vital role in electing Justice Karofsky:

In Wisconsin, grassroots teams worked together to elect Jill Karofsky to the state Supreme Court, despite conservative judges suppressing the extension of vote by mail options during a global pandemic.
Wisconsin Democrats know how to win. They have incredible momentum after sweeping statewide elections in 2018. With your support, we will work together to make sure Donald Trump is a one-term President. Republicans have stockpiled millions to make sure we don't succeed. We’ve already seen their senseless attacks against me, against Governor Evers, and against Democrats across the country.
So if we are going to be successful in this election, it's imperative we hit our fundraising goals so we have the resources we need to win.
It's going to take committed Democrats like you to do it. We need your help now more than ever.

In Wisconsin, Republicans have filed more lawsuits than they have passed bills during this pandemic to help Wisconsin workers, families, farmers, and small businesses affected by COVID-19.
Apparently, instead of acting quickly and decisively to respond to a crisis, Republicans would rather force our state to jump through hoop after hoop and ask Republicans for permission to save lives.
Democrats are working to pass laws that will protect families and boost our economy. It’s time for Republicans to do the same! Now is not the time for spin – it’s time for action.

Conservative groups are trying to purge hundreds of thousands of records from voter lists. Do you know why?
It’s because they know they can’t out-organize us! Their only hope is to rig the rules and purge thousands of voters off the bat.
Well, I hate to break it to them, but that won’t work either. We’re building neighborhood teams all over Wisconsin to mobilize more voters than Republicans can disenfranchise and suppress.

Wisconsin is the tipping point state in the 2020 election. That is why Vice President Mike Pence was here this week. That’s why the RNC just pledged to send 300 field organizers to swing states like Wisconsin.
As a Trump campaign advisor recently said, ""Wisconsin is the state that's going to tip this one way or the other. We're going to win Wisconsin and win the election... or lose Wisconsin and lose the election.""
Trump is terrified of losing Wisconsin. That's why the Trump campaign is sending surrogates to Wisconsin and trying to suppress our voters. Our job: fight back.

"Eric H. Holder, Jr.",info@e.wisdems.org,This should never be allowed to happen again,"Hi there,
I am appalled at what happened in Wisconsin on Tuesday.
Our fellow Americans were forced to make an impossible choice that no one should ever have to make in a democracy: Put your health and your family’s health at risk by casting a ballot or stay home and have your voice silenced.
As Chairman of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, I’ve seen all too clearly the devastating impact that gerrymandering has on people across the country. So it was saddening, but not shocking, to see the leaders of Wisconsin’s gerrymandered legislature and the state Supreme Court put Wisconsinites in this unconscionable position. They abdicated their sworn duty to keep their constituents safe and to ensure fair elections, all because they thought it might help conservatives win a state Supreme Court seat that was on the ballot.
That’s why I believe that democracy itself is at stake in 2020. Can you make a donation to the Democratic Party of Wisconsin and prepare their grassroots teams to bring dignity back to our politics?

After the U.S. Supreme Court reversed a lower court’s decision to push back Wisconsin’s absentee ballot deadline, Justice Ginsberg wrote that “the court’s order, I fear, will result in massive disenfranchisement.”
And she was right.
We’re fighting back, friend. This moment is a test for our democracy, and we can’t let politicians who are bound and determined to silence the will of the people hold on to power.
But I need your help. Can you make a donation to protect our elections in 2020?

We fought to extend absentee voting so people could vote from the safety of their homes, and to decrease the exposure and spread of the deadly Coronavirus. But the GOP struck it down to suppress the vote.
In fact, in Milwaukee, the number of polling locations decreased from 180 to just 5, which meant bigger crowds and longer waiting periods. That means more exposure and more spread of Coronavirus.
In the upcoming weeks, we are sadly going to see just how many people get infected, hospitalized, and die due to the GOP’s carelessness. We cannot let this happen again.
Chip in $5 below so we can take our campaign digital and hold those who purposely endangered Wisconsinites accountable.

What happened in Wisconsin this spring was a disgrace – with hundreds of polling places shut down, hours-long lines to vote, and people not getting their vote-by-mail ballots in time to vote safely from home.
Let's be clear: Right-wing politicians are taking advantage of the coronavirus crisis to kick their voter suppression efforts into high gear.
Donald Trump claimed that if we make it easier for more people to vote, “you’d never have a Republican elected in this country again.” Now he’s threatening states if they plan safe, secure elections with vote-by-mail options.
But we’re fighting back.
Wisconsin field organizers mobilized enough voters to sweep all statewide elections in 2018 and fought through Republican voter suppression efforts this spring to win an important state Supreme Court election. Now they need our help to throw Trump into the dustbin of history this fall.
Trump caters to corporations, special interest groups, and dark money donors, but if we organize together, fight together, and persist together, he won’t be able to match the power of our grassroots movement.
Help make sure Wisconsin Democrats have what they need to launch their biggest grassroots field organizing campaign yet. Can you chip in $10 so we can make Trump a one-term president?

This summer, Wisconsin Republicans plan to purge the registrations of over 100,000 voters in a swing state that was decided by only 22,748 votes in 2016.
That’s why it’s so important to support the Democratic Party of Wisconsin today. Their field organizers will contact purged voters to make sure they re-register and request vote-by-mail ballots. We cannot allow the GOP to continue suppressing the vote and shutting out the voices of working people.
Wisconsin could come down to the wire this November, so your support might be just the thing that tips the scales in our favor.
If you can, will you support the Democratic Party of Wisconsin with a donation today?

Let’s take a look at what the GOP has been up to in Wisconsin this month:
* Blocked laws that make it safer to vote and then forced an in-person election during the pandemic
* Sent Vice President Pence to Wisconsin to distract from their loss after Democrats out-organized them and elected Justice Jill Karofsky to the state Supreme Court
* Spent millions of dollars on attack ads while planning to spend even more corporate PAC money to help Donald Trump
This month has taught us Republicans will do anything to win. That’s why we need to be prepared for anything.

President Trump recently said mail-in ballots will lead to, “levels of voting that, if you ever agreed to it, you’d never have a Republican elected in this country again.”
We agree! We won our spring elections because organizers and volunteers helped voters request and return thousands of absentee ballots.

We only have six and a half months to stop Trump, and even though the GOP suppression tactics backfired this time, Republicans will keep trying to find new ones. And they’ll have Trump and his arsenal of dark money to help.
Now is the time to double-down on our online organizing so we can win in November and prevent another debacle like last week’s election.

I was born and went to high school there. In fact, I graduated from Madison East High in 1977. And I’ve been going back to Wisconsin almost every election cycle since 2000 to campaign in the state.
This year the stakes are higher than ever before. And that’s why I’m asking you to join me in supporting the Democratic Party of Wisconsin. They are building an organizing army to defeat Trump, but they can’t do it alone.

What I love most about Wisconsin are the people. My life has gotten crazy since my childhood there. But what keeps me grounded are the people I grew up around.
Wisconsinites are humble and kind and they deeply care. In short, Wisconsinites are the opposite of Donald Trump.
Under the Trump-Pence administration, we’ve had the normalization of racism, misogyny, and economic injustice.
While Wisconsin farmers have a deep respect for the planet and the land that they tend, the Trump administration has a contempt for the environment.
If we want to defeat Trump, Wisconsin is a must-win state. Donate today!
I’ve always been proud of the fact that I’m from Wisconsin and I’m looking forward to working hand-in-hand with the Wisconsin Democratic Party this year to ensure not only that Trump loses, but that decency wins. The decency that I’ve known since my childhood in Wisconsin. The decency I’ve seen from Wisconsinites across the state.
Donate $5 and help elect Democrats up and down the ballot.

In Wisconsin's Supreme Court race, we ran a massive organizing operation to help Wisconsinites vote by mail. It crushed all expectations – and toppled an incumbent Supreme Court justice for only the second time in half a century.
Jill Karofsky performed 10 percentage points better than her conservative opponent in votes cast by mail than she did in votes cast at polling places.
That's no accident. That's the result of tireless work by thousands of us across the state – not just in the three and a half weeks before April 7, but in the three and a half years since our year-round field program was launched.
We won on April 7 because our values drive us to care for our communities. To keep people safe. To help people vote, not shut people out. To make democracy work.
We will continue to win elections by out-organizing the GOP.
We have a lot of work to do, but we know we will achieve more victories with your help.

From calling white nationalists in Charlottesville “some very fine people” to telling Black and Brown Congresswomen to 'go back where they came from,' Trump has doubled-down on racist attempts to divide this country.
Trump’s campaign was built on racist rhetoric from its start.

The election in 2020 won’t be decided by dark money, tweets, or voter suppression. It will be decided by one thing: Did Democrats have a big enough ground game in Wisconsin?
It’s up to us. A GOP-led voter suppression effort to purge 234,000 voters from the rolls threatens our progress. That is why we need to double our efforts to register voters all over the state.

Ben Wikler,info@e.wisdems.org,Support Ron Kind Today,"This WI District is Ground Zero in 2020 Democratic Party of Wisconsin
Defend Wisconsin by helping Ron Kind today
Donald Trump knows he can’t get reelected without winning Wisconsin. He also knows he can’t win Wisconsin without carrying the Third Congressional District and defeating Democratic Congressman Ron Kind.
Trump won this district in 2016. He knows he needs to win it again.
That’s why Trump’s favorite dark money groups are already running ads against Ron.
Ron Kind is leading the way to ensure family farmers get relief from the reckless Trump trade war. He’s working to lower prescription drug prices for seniors and families. He’s fighting to ease the burden of student debt and protect our natural heritage here in Wisconsin.
Ron Kind fights for us. It’s time we fight for him.
Chip in $10 now to support Wisconsin’s own Ron Kind:
CHIP IN $10
Team:
We all know that the path to defeating Donald Trump runs through our own backyard here in Wisconsin. We also know that we need to compete in every county across the state. That’s why I’m asking you today to pitch in $10 or whatever you can afford to support Ron Kind.
He is the only Wisconsin Democrat representing a district won by Trump in 2016. That means he and his district are top targets in the fight to win back the White House and hold our majority in the House of Representatives next year.
Ron is facing a tough fight in 2020 and a contribution today will go a long way to ensuring we win next year.
Republicans are spending millions to try to defeat Ron. We all know the best way to fight back against these attacks is by investing in grassroots organizing in local Wisconsin communities.
Can you join us today by contributing to Ron Kind’s campaign?

Bradley Whitford here. You may know me from shows like the West Wing and The Handmaid’s Tale. But what a lot of people don’t know about me is that I’m from Wisconsin.
I was born and went to high school there. In fact, I graduated from Madison East High in 1977. And I’ve been going back to Wisconsin almost every election cycle since 2000 to campaign in the state.
This year the stakes are higher than ever before. And that’s why I’m asking you to join me in supporting the Democratic Party of Wisconsin. They are building an organizing army to defeat Trump, but they can’t do it alone.

What I love most about Wisconsin are the people. My life has gotten crazy since my childhood there. But what keeps me grounded are the people I grew up around.
Wisconsinites are humble and kind and they deeply care. In short, Wisconsinites are the opposite of Donald Trump.
Under the Trump-Pence administration, we’ve had the normalization of racism, misogyny, and economic injustice.
While Wisconsin farmers have a deep respect for the planet and the land that they tend, the Trump administration has a contempt for the environment.
If we want to defeat Trump, Wisconsin is a must-win state. Donate today!
I’ve always been proud of the fact that I’m from Wisconsin and I’m looking forward to working hand-in-hand with the Wisconsin Democratic Party this year to ensure not only that Trump loses, but that decency wins. The decency that I’ve known since my childhood in Wisconsin. The decency I’ve seen from Wisconsinites across the state.
Donate $5 and help elect Democrats up and down the ballot.

Wisconsin families know the truth about Trump’s record: putting Wisconsin’s farmers at risk, suppressing votes, and turning his back on workers suffering from his coronavirus response. These events will only serve to further remind Wisconsinites of Trump’s disastrous leadership.
And after his sparsely attended and disastrous rally in Oklahoma — in the middle of a pandemic — we know that Wisconsinites do not need or want the same sort of spectacle here. That’s why we need to make it clear that Trump’s strategies of attacks and false statements are not welcome here.

On behalf of all of us, we wanted to give a big thank you to Justice Karofsky and all our grassroots supporters who made her victory possible.
But let’s be clear: We won because our organizers had the resources needed to reach voters online and help return thousands of absentee ballots.
We now have six and a half months to stop Trump. The polling puts Wisconsin in a statistical tie. Even though GOP suppression tactics backfired this time, Republicans will keep trying to find new ones.

We cannot forget that this election could have been done safely by mail, but Republican legislators and GOP-backed judges put their political interests above the lives of Wisconsinites.
This was a far harder-fought battle than anyone anticipated. Elevating Jill Karofsky to the Supreme Court is a terrific outcome. Now it's time to organize, organize, organize — and win some more.

I’ll keep this brief as we prepare to celebrate the New Year (Happy New Year!)
We need to raise just $1,500 more to reach our voter registration goal!
The Republican effort to purge 234,000 voters makes this goal crucial in a swing state like Wisconsin. We're fighting back. But we can't do it alone. Help support the organizing teams that will make a difference in 2020 by registering and mobilizing as many Democratic voters as possible.
We are so close. Please chip in $10 now to make sure we can hit this goal.
CONTRIBUTE NOW
This goal means we can hire more field organizers, buy more phones for phone-banks, and ship more clipboards to canvassers during GOTV. The road to the White House will be determined by what we do in Wisconsin. That’s why your support is so important.
If you’re with us, help make sure we have the resources to win this.

Dear Friend \--
About our drive to get Greens on the ballot in Wisconsin - we've got good news, bad news, and a call to action.
The good news is that last Tuesday, we turned in nearly 4,000 signatures, and the Wisconsin Elections Commission certified 3,737 as valid - far more than the needed 2,000.
The bad news? Political operatives have challenged our petitions in an underhanded attempt to suppress voters from having a real choice this year. See this just-released statement from the Howie Hawkins/Angela Walker campaign for details. We expect a WEC hearing next week to decide on the legitimacy of the challenge, so stay tuned.
If this heavy-handed attempt to suppress our democratic rights makes you mad, please take action by helping our neighbors in Minnesota get Greens on the ballot by sharing their online petition.
If we all share the online petition with our friends and family in Minnesota and ask them if they'll sign to give people another choice in this supposed land of freedom and democracy, we can help put the Minnesota Greens over the top - and show the political elites that we won't lie down and take their voter suppression tactics.
Thank you for all your help to get Greens on the ballot this year, and stay tuned for updates on our ballot access fight in Wisconsin!
Peace,

Dear Friend \--
We are going all out in the last week of our petition drive to put original Green New Deal champion Howie Hawkins and Milwaukee's own Angela Walker on the ballot in Wisconsin as our 2020 Presidential and Vice Presidential candidates!
We have only until Tuesday August 4 to collect at least 2,000 valid signatures. To make it happen, we need the help of everyone who wants the opportunity to vote Green this year. We need people to sign the petition, and collect signatures either as volunteers or as paid petitioners. Here's how to help:
1\. Sign the Petition! If you can print, print out the petition. If you don't have printer access and you're in the Milwaukee or Madison areas, submit our petition request form and we'll do our best to get petitions to you. Ask your friends, family, co-workers, neighbors etc. to sign too. Every signature helps! (see below for how to submit your petitions)
2\. Collect Petition Signatures! We need people to help collect signatures, either as volunteers or as paid petitioners. We are offering $1 per valid signature to people who can collect at least 20 signatures between now and Monday August 3. If you are interested in petitioning either as a volunteer or as a paid petitioner, please contact our Ballot Access Director Barb Dahlgren at at [[URL REDACTED]] or 708-829-5315.
We need as many people as possible out collecting signatures between now and August 3 to make sure we reach our goal! See below for important information for petitioners.
3\. Submit your Petitions! Once your petitions are complete, make sure to fill out and sign the Certification of Circulator at the bottom of each sheet (do not fill out the page number). PLEASE SUBMIT YOUR PETITIONS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE SO WE RECEIVE THEM BEFORE THE DEADLINE!
If you are outside the Milwaukee or Madison areas, mail your petitions as soon as possible, and no later than Friday July 31st, to:
Wisconsin Green Party
PO Box 108
Madison, WI 53701
If you have significant numbers of signatures in your possession after the Post Office closes on Friday, and are unable to personally deliver your petitions to Madison or Milwaukee, contact Barb Dahlgren, [[URL REDACTED]] 708-829-5315 to figure out an alternative way to get us your petitions.

4\. Important information for petitioners
Change on petition to Angela Walker's address
We recently learned that Angela Walker recently changed addresses, and her old address was on our petition. Since then, we have been working with the State Elections Commission staff to ensure that we update our petitions accordingly.
Her new address is:
315 Royal St., Apt A, Florence, SC 29506
So here's the deal:
* There are new petition sheets on the Wisconsin Green Party website:
[[URL REDACTED]]
If you are able to, download and print these new forms with the new address.
* If you have petition sheets with signatures on them, don't add any more signatures to that form. Turn them in to us ASAP. Once a voter has signed the petition, no candidate information on that page may be changed.
* If you have (or are expecting to get) printed sheets that we sent you with the old address, and you are unable to print new petitions, follow these steps on each unused sheet before collecting signatures on it:
>   * Cross out Angela Walker's old address,
>   * Place your initials (in ink) with today's date by the correction,
>   * Write the new address (see above) in the remaining space.
>
Safe Petitioning Protocols
Here are some safe petitioning protocols that you should follow:
* Wear a mask. A face shield and gloves are a good idea too.
* Keep several extra pens with you that you can swap out and sanitize after each use. These should be black or blue ballpoints only.
* Keep hand sanitizer handy, for yourself, to offer to signers, and to wipe down pens after someone signs
* When watching the signature, try to only get close enough to read what they're doing.
Petitioning Tips 101
Look for areas with foot traffic like main streets, parks, beaches, supermarket parking lots, etc. Approach people, wave, and say something like:
""Hi! Are you eligible to vote in Wisconsin? [IF YES] Great! Could you help me out real quick with a signature to help get Green Party candidates on the ballot and give people another choice?""
If they say yes, get their signature, printed name, and the address where they're registered to vote (or if they're not registered, their home address - no PO boxes).
If they say no, wish them a nice day and move on to the next person. Remember: we're not out to argue or have long political debates, we're out to get as many signatures as we can before the deadline.
If they hesitate, say something like:
""It's just to give people another choice, you don't have to support them or vote for them. Signing just means you support people having the right to more choices in a democracy.""
If people are rude or blow you off, don't take it personally! Just take a deep breath, sip some water, and move on to the next person. Petitioning is basically a numbers game: the more people we ask, the more signatures we'll get, and that's how we get it done.
We are hoping to reach our goal by Saturday August 1, before rainier weather moves in on Sunday. We are in the last big push and we need everyone out who can petition. It's up to us to make sure that everyone in Wisconsin has the opportunity to vote Green for the only national campaign for Medicare for All, a Green New Deal, Ranked Choice Voting, an end to endless wars, and the better world we know is possible!
If you have any questions, please contact Barb Dahlgren at [[URL REDACTED]] or 708-829-5315.

Dear Friend \--
“If you're not careful, the newspapers will have you hating the people who are being oppressed, and loving the people who are doing the oppressing.” ― Malcolm X
This July, a courageous band of Wisconsin Green Party supporters braved the risk of contracting COVID-19 to get our presidential ticket of Howie Hawkins and Angela Walker on the ballot. We turned in 3,966 signatures of Wisconsinites who supported putting a Green choice on the ballot, almost double the minimum requirement.
On Monday, the Wisconsin Supreme Court upheld a concerted effort by Democratic Party operatives to overturn the will of those Wisconsin voters, and the hard work of those volunteers.
After trampling our rights, the Democrats are trying to cover the shame of this blatant voter suppression by vilifying the Green Party, aided and abetted by the corporate media.
We’re not lying down and we’re not giving up, but we need your help to fight back.
If you support our long, hard fight for real democracy in the United States, please contribute now to support grassroots Green organizing and campaigns in 2021 and 2022, and sign up to volunteer to build the party for people, planet, and peace over profit!
So here’s what happened:
We submitted 3,966 signatures of people who supported placing Howie Hawkins, a lifelong activist and union worker, and Angela Walker, a working-class Black woman from Milwaukee active in the Wisconsin Uprising, on the ballot for President and VP. The Wisconsin Election Commission (WEC) staff validated 3,737 signatures.
The Democratic Party members of the WEC refused to accept the signatures of qualified, eligible voters we turned in. Why? Because of a minor technicality: Angela Walker moved in July and some of the petitions listed her previous address. The WEC upheld a challenge to those petitions from Democratic operatives, despite the fact that we communicated with them about Angela’s move and followed their complicated instructions.
Why should the fact that Angela moved from one apartment to another in the same town in South Carolina during the campaign disqualify not just her, but also Howie Hawkins, from running for national office? No one has been able to answer this basic, but crucial, question. The reality is that the Democratic Party kept the Green Party off the Wisconsin ballot using the type of maneuver the US media decries when deployed by authoritarian regimes in countries like Belarus.
The Supreme Court’s 4-3 decision was the last, successful barrier placed in front of the WIGP and Hawkins/Walker campaign, but the WEC made it harder than it should be, as the dissenters to this decision pointed out. The Supreme Court’s majority decision was not based on the merits of the case, but on their opinion that it was too late because county clerks had already started printing ballots in spite of the fact that the Hawkins/Walker campaign had a pending ballot access lawsuit.
Thus, the short period of confusion and delay in printing 2020 ballots was caused not by the Greens, but by the bureaucratic failures of the state and counties in the face of pending ballot access lawsuits.
Meanwhile, the same pundits who railed against the WIGP for supposedly delaying ballots have studiously avoided mentioning that the Democratic Party has delayed certification of the ballot in Pennsylvania with a lawsuit to - you guessed it - throw the Green Party off the ballot. Actually, they’re not all ignoring it - one Philadelphia media outlet is telling readers to blame the Green Party for the delay.
Finally, not content with throwing their political opposition off the ballot like the authoritarian rulers they decry in other countries, the Democrats are trying to invent a scandal out of the fact that a lawyer for the Hawkins/Walker suit has ties to Republicans. First of all, the Wisconsin Green Party was peripheral to the campaign’s lawsuit; WIGP members had nothing to do with hiring lawyers and had no communication with any Republicans regarding ballot access.
Secondly, the Hawkins/Walker campaign worked hard to find a liberal or Democratic lawyer who would take their case against the Democrats’ voter suppression, but not a single one would. That echoes the WIGP’s fruitless attempts to find a liberal lawyer to sue the state for relief during the spring petitioning period, when the state was under a total lockdown and gathering signatures was a harrowing ordeal, particularly for grassroots candidates.
Since not a single Democrat-aligned lawyer in Wisconsin was willing to challenge voter suppression coming from their own party, the Democrats have no high ground to criticize the Hawkins/Walker campaign for accepting the legal counsel they could find. In fact, the campaign wasted precious time trying to find a liberal lawyer, a delay that ultimately helped the Democrats argue that it was too late for the Supreme Court to decide the case on its merits.
The irony is rich: after a Democratic National Convention loaded with Republicans from John Kasich to Michael Bloomberg, the Democrats are trying to concoct a scandal out of Howie Hawkins and Angela Walker turning to a Republican lawyer out of necessity.
The Republican and Democratic duopoly will always collaborate to keep political outsiders out. Despite their theatrical shows of opposition, the twin parties of war and Wall Street have long worked hand in glove to maintain a stranglehold on the political system for the corporate donor class that funds them both. This is one reason why almost half of eligible voters in the US don’t vote.
Polls show that the majority of people who vote Green wouldn't vote if Greens weren't on the ballot (see: ""No, Jill Stein did not cost Hillary Clinton the White House.""). Greens aren't the reason why Democrats lose. We give disenfranchised people a reason to vote. Democrats scapegoat and persecute us because they care more about power than democracy.
As Briahna Joy Gray, former press secretary for the Bernie Sanders 2020 campaign put it: “If you hate spoilers, support ranked choice voting. But corporate Dems don’t, because blaming the Green Party for Republican wins is how they keep Dem voters from realizing that Greens represent so-called “Democratic values” better than the Democratic party.”
The Green Party has long fought for voters’ rights, including the 2016 recount effort that brought unprecedented transparency to our flawed voting system and resulted in unreliable voting machines being decertified, with a comprehensive investigation of voting machine source code still pending in the courts.
Wisconsin Greens will mount a vigorous write-in campaign for the Hawkins/Walker ticket over the next 49 days, with the goal to win at least one percent of the statewide presidential vote, the state’s threshold for ballot access. Reaching this goal will ensure that Wisconsin voters will have a pro-worker, pro-climate, pro-democracy alternative to the corrupt corporate duopoly.
We’ve faced a national smear campaign and an avalanche of hatred in the past few days, simply for standing up for the basic American right to vote for what we believe in.
Despite the haters, we’ll keep fighting for real democracy in the United States, for them too. We can’t wait to free them from the self-destructive cycle of fear-based voting, and with simple reforms used around the world like ranked-choice voting and proportional representation, empower us all to vote our hopes, not our fears.
We need you in this fight too. Please donate now to support grassroots Green organizing and campaigns in 2021 and 2022, and sign up to volunteer to build the party for real democracy.
Thank you for listening to our side of the story, and thank you to everyone who has shown solidarity, friendship, and kindness throughout this ordeal. People, planet, and peace will prevail.
Peace and solidarity,
The Wisconsin Green Party

We are still fighting and will continue to fight beyond November for the real change Wisconsinites need: universal healthcare, a clean and healthy eco-system, peace, and justice for real humans - not ""corporate persons"".
While the WI Democratic Party and the WI Supreme Court succeeded in taking away the ballot line we worked so hard for, Wisconsin will still be able to vote Green. We have become a hidden choice, but you can still help build a powerful grassroots political force adding to over a million courageous people around the nation.
How to write in votes for Howie Hawkins and Angela Walker in WI
Here's how you can make your vote count and bring back that choice to other disenfranchised Wisconsinites:
In the write-in section for president and vice president, to make your Green vote count, write in Howie Hawkins and Angela Walker in the write-in spots for president and vice president.
Each vote will still get the Green Party greater access to the ballot and the resources it needs to become a more powerful force for change. During our relatively short history as a nationally recognized party the Greens have run thousands of candidates (succeeding in a large percentage of local elections), held ballot status in the majority of states, and forced the two corporate parties to talk about ideas like Medicare for All, student debt forgiveness, ranked choice voting, and the Green New Deal because they are wildly popular with Americans.
Your vote will help us continue to fight for these and other programs, and run candidates who are not beholden to corporations and actually work to make these changes for the greater good.
You can also share this message with friends and family. While the media and the partisan election commission does not want anyone to know about us, you can undermine their efforts to silence us.
A third way to help is to pledge to write-in Howie Hawkins and Angela Walker on our website to inspire others by showing they are not alone at the ballot box and have a whole movement behind them. You can also sign up to volunteer or donate to get more involved in the Green movement.
Thank you so much for your continued support!
Peace and solidarity,
The Wisconsin Green Party
PS. Please join us at the Wisconsin Green Party Fall Gathering on Saturday November 14 to help us keep building the party for people, planet, and peace over profit!

Dear Friend --
Wisconsin Greens have voted and the results are in! In the presidential preference vote, 50% of first-round votes went to Howie Hawkins, 47% to Dario Hunter, 1.6% to David Rolde and 1.6% to none of the above. With 4 delegates available, Hawkins and Hunter win 2 delegates each.
Barbara Dahlgren, Jo’Nathan Kingfisher, Mike McCallister, and Tiffany Anderson were chosen as delegates to the Green Party US Presidential Nominating Convention. Dave Schwab, Jennifer Kedroske, Nero Grok-Gallagher, and Monte Letourneau were chosen as alternate delegates.
A proposed WIGP bylaws amendment to lower the voting threshold from two-thirds to 60% was approved by 90% of the vote.
See our website for a full breakdown of the results.
Thank you to the candidates who took the time to join us at our Spring Gathering to speak about the issues, and thank you to the Green Party members who participated!

Dear Friend \--
We're going all out in the last few days of our petition drive to put original Green New Deal champion Howie Hawkins and Milwaukee's own Angela Walker on the ballot in Wisconsin as our 2020 Presidential and Vice Presidential candidates!
If you have petition signatures, please either drop them off with us in Milwaukee or Madison, or mail them ASAP. Petitions must be in Friday's mail for us to be reasonably confident we'll get them before the deadline.
We have just 4 days left until the deadline of Tuesday August 4 to collect at least 2,000 valid signatures. To make it happen, we need the help of everyone who wants the opportunity to vote Green this year. We need people to sign the petition, and collect signatures either as volunteers or as paid petitioners. Here's how to help:
1\. Sign the Petition! You can print out the petition from our website. Ask your friends, family, co-workers, neighbors etc. to sign too. If you're not able to print, you can sign the petition at stations in Madison and Milwaukee. Every signature helps! (see below for how to submit your petitions)
2\. Collect Petition Signatures! We need people to help collect signatures either as volunteers or as paid petitioners. We are offering $1 per valid signature to anyone who can collect at least 20 signatures between now and Monday August 3. If you are interested in petitioning either as a volunteer or as a paid petitioner, please contact our Ballot Access Director Barb Dahlgren at at [[URL REDACTED]] or 708-829-5315.
We need as many people as possible to join us in collecting signatures between now and August 3 to make sure we reach our goal! See below for important information for petitioners.
3\. Submit your Petitions! Once your petitions are complete, make sure to fill out and sign the Certification of Circulator at the bottom of each sheet (do not fill out the page number). PLEASE SUBMIT YOUR PETITIONS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE SO WE RECEIVE THEM BEFORE THE DEADLINE!
If you are outside the Milwaukee or Madison areas, mail your petitions no later than Friday to:
Wisconsin Green Party
PO Box 108
Madison, WI 53701
If you have significant numbers of signatures in your possession after the Post Office closes on Friday, and are unable to personally deliver your petitions to Madison or Milwaukee, contact Barb Dahlgren, [[URL REDACTED]] 708-829-5315 to figure out an alternative way to get us your petitions.
Milwaukee area: Drop your petitions off at:
Barbara Dahlgren
1928 S. 56th St.

Milwaukee area contact: Barb Dahlgren, [[URL REDACTED]] 708-829-5315

4\. Important information for petitioners
Change on petition to Angela Walker's address
We recently learned that Angela Walker recently changed addresses, and her old address was on our petition. Since then, we have been working with the State Elections Commission staff to ensure that we update our petitions accordingly.
Her new address is:
315 Royal St., Apt A, Florence, SC 29506
So here's the deal:
* There are new petition sheets on the Wisconsin Green Party website:
[[URL REDACTED]]
If you are able to, download and print these new forms with the new address.
* If you have petition sheets with signatures on them, don't add any more signatures to that form. Turn them in to us ASAP. Once a voter has signed the petition, no candidate information on that page may be changed.
* If you have (or are expecting to get) printed sheets that we sent you with the old address, and you are unable to print new petitions, follow these steps on each unused sheet before collecting signatures on it:
>   * Cross out Angela Walker's old address,
>   * Place your initials (in ink) with today's date by the correction,
>   * Write the new address (see above) in the remaining space.
>
Safe Petitioning Protocols
Here are some safe petitioning protocols you should follow:
* Wear a mask. A face shield and gloves are a good idea too.
* Keep several extra pens with you that you can swap out and sanitize after each use. These should be black or blue ballpoints only.
* Keep hand sanitizer handy, for yourself, to offer to signers, and to wipe down pens after someone signs
* When watching the signature, try to only get close enough to read what they're doing.
Petitioning Tips 101
Look for areas with decent foot traffic like main streets, parks, beaches, supermarket parking lots, etc. Approach people, wave, and say something like:
""Hi! Are you eligible to vote in Wisconsin? [IF YES] Great! Could you help me out real quick with a signature to help get Green Party candidates on the ballot and give people another choice?""
If they say yes, get their signature, printed name, and the address where they're registered to vote (or if they're not registered, their home address - no PO boxes).
If they say no, wish them a nice day and move on to the next person. Remember: we're not out to argue or have long political debates, we're out to get as many signatures as we can before the deadline.
If they hesitate, say something like:
""It's just to give people another choice, you don't have to support them or vote for them. Signing just means you support people having the right to more choices in a democracy.""
If people are rude or blow you off, don't take it personally! Just take a deep breath, sip some water, and move on to the next person. Petitioning is basically a numbers game: the more people we ask, the more signatures we'll get, and that's how we get it done.
We are hoping we can reach our goal by Saturday August 1, before rainier weather moves in on Sunday. We are in the last big push and we need everyone who can petition to help out.
It's up to us to make sure that everyone in Wisconsin has the opportunity to vote Green for the only national campaign for Medicare for All, a Green New Deal, an end to endless wars, and the better world we know is possible!
If you have any questions, please contact Barb Dahlgren at [[URL REDACTED]] or 708-829-5315.
Thank you for all your help getting the Green Party on the ballot this year. It's in our hands!

The votes are in, and the Green Party of the United States Presidential Nominating Convention has chosen original Green New Deal champion Howie Hawkins and Milwaukee's own Angela Walker as our 2020 Presidential and Vice Presidential candidates! Congratulations to Greens everywhere who participated in our democratic process.
Now it's up to us to make sure we get our candidates on the ballot in Wisconsin. We have only until August 4 to collect at least 2,000 valid signatures.
To make it happen, we need the help of everyone who wants the opportunity to vote Green this year. We need people to sign the petition, and collect signatures either as volunteers or as paid petitioners.
Here's how to help:
1\. Sign the Petition! If you can print, print out the petition. If you don't have printer access, submit our petition request form and we'll mail it to you. Ask your friends, family, co-workers, neighbors etc. to sign too. Every signature helps! (see below for how to submit your petitions)
2\. Collect Petition Signatures! We need people to help collect signatures, either as volunteers or as paid petitioners.

3\. Donate for Ballot Access! The Hawkins/Walker campaign has qualified for federal matching funds, meaning that all contributions will be matched dollar-for-dollar by public money up to $250.

We are now in the final week of our 2020 Wisconsin Green Party ballot petition drive. If you want to be able to vote for Howie Hawkins and Angela Walker on the Green ticket in 2020, please act now to make sure our candidates are on the ballot in November - we need your help!
Here's how to help:
1\. Sign the Petition! If you can print, print out the petition. If you don't have printer access, submit our petition request form and we'll mail it to you. Ask your friends, family, co-workers, neighbors etc. to sign too. Every signature helps! (see below for how to submit your petitions)
2\. Collect Petition Signatures! We need people to help collect signatures, either as volunteers or as paid petitioners.

Friend-
Here’s what we’re up against: Our first fundraising deadline of the year is coming up in just 4 days. It’s a test of the resolve of Wisconsinites to vote for change, at every level. And, if we do well it’ll send a clear signal to Robin Vos -- and Trump Republicans across the country -- that Wisconsin is moving full speed ahead in 2020.
Here’s what we need your help with: 400 donations. That’s our goal for this deadline, and one of the biggest grassroots goals we’ve ever set. It may sound like a lot, but in reality, when you donate $3 and someone else does too, it begins to add up quickly.
Here’s what we need you to do today:
We noticed you haven't had a chance to contribute yet — we're hoping you can make your contribution today so we have a chance to hit our goal. You can use the button below to donate right now!
Thank you for all that you do to win.
Our success depends on your ongoing support. So just know that Wisconsin Democatic candidates and everyone on the ADCC team are incredibly grateful that you are a part of this mission to restore our democracy.

Friend-
I am going to keep this short.
Yesterday Wisconsin Republicans previewed what they have planned for 2020. Ignoring the pleas of public health experts and clerks across the State of Wisconsin, they forced tens of thousands of Wisconsinites to choose between their health and well-being or exercising their constitutional rights. Yeah, it makes me livid too.
Let’s not kid ourselves: once again Wisconsin is being used by Donald Trump and the RNC to field-test the voter suppression tactics they intend to roll out nationally. As we know all too well, what starts in Wisconsin does not end here. But we have a plan.
Let me cut to the chase: I need your help. Taking on Wisconsin Assembly Republicans is what we do here at the ADCC. Every day our team gets up and goes to work to hold Republicans accountable for their failures to protect the health and safety of Wisconsin.
But we can’t do it alone and we can’t do it without resources. We know how much you care about core values like ballot access and protecting the right to vote. Will you join forces with others across Wisconsin and make your first contribution today to ensure that we are building the program necessary to make Robin Vos and Wisconsin Republicans pay in November?
We’re scrappy. We’re resourceful. And we’ve been at this fight for a while. I hope you’ll consider joining us today so we can keep on fighting, together.

Dianne Hesselbein,info@assemblydemocrats.com,These women,"On Women's Equality Day, stand with Wisconsin women.
Friends-
100 years ago, the 19th Amendment was certified to guarantee the right to vote for women. Today, we celebrate Women's Equality Day in honor of that milestone and remember the women who had to fight twice as hard against the compounded harm of gender and racial bias to win their rights.
Today is also a day to reflect on how far we still have to go -- and how we must safeguard against the erosion of our hard-won rights. We've come a long way together, but recent events remind us to keep fighting harder and more fiercely for every single American woman.
Last night, the Republican National Convention featured speaker Abby Johnson, who has publicly advocated for head-of-household voting that historically barred women and people of color from casting ballots.
Time and again, Republicans prove that they plan to roll back the clock on voting rights, women's rights and civil rights. But, we're fighting back.
We're working hard to make sure all Wisconsin women can exercise their right to vote because we know they will be the key to turning Wisconsin blue, and winning up and down the ballot this year.
Will you join 100 for Wisconsin to help us keep fighting to protect the fundamental right so many protested and organized for a century ago?
Wisconsin women aren't just voting in record numbers in 2020 -- they're also running for office!
This year we have 44 Democratic women on the ballot -- the strongest slate of Democratic Assembly women candidates that Wisconsin has had in years.
These women have been working incredibly hard the last few months, doing everything they can to make sure Wisconsin women and families have a strong voice in our Capitol, but they can't do it alone.
This is where you and I come in. By pooling resources we’re able to help our candidates in must-win districts hire critical campaign staff, print literature and reach voters to make sure they turn out this year.
With a contribution of $100 – the equivalent of just $1.45 per day until the election – you can join with others across our state to ensure that the voices of women and families are powerfully heard in November.
Time is running out for women and families in Wisconsin.
With fewer than 70 days until the election, we need you to become part of 100 for Wisconsin today.
This year presents big challenges and even bigger opportunities. Together, we can empower each other to build a better future and honor the legacy of those who fought for political equality.
Stand with Wisconsin women today with your pledge of $100 -- or whatever you can afford -- to ensure we continue a legacy of women leading change in our state and our nation.
Your support at any level will make a big difference and is greatly appreciated!
Many thanks,

Trump won Wisconsin by just 0.77% in 2016. Pollsters didn’t see it coming --

In 2016 Wisconsin was THE tipping-point state for the election. We've been working overtime to defend this critical swing state and turn Wisconsin blue -- but we’re running low on resources in these final days.
Joe Biden won't win Wisconsin unless we turn out voters in every district. That’s why our must-win Assembly races are so critical -- and why we're fighting hard to win battleground districts across the state.
We know the margin of victory in many areas will come down to 100 votes or less and we're working round-the-clock to reach every last voter and make sure every vote is counted on Election Day.
Will you stand with Joe and our Democratic candidates across the state and chip in to win this battleground? Together, we can FLIP WISCONSIN BLUE!

Rapid Response Team @ ADCC,info@assemblydemocrats.com,RAPID RESPONSE NEEDED: We have to fight back,"Republicans step up attacks against LGBTQ candidate
Friend -- We knew that big money Republican groups were spending major money to double down on their attacks against Jessica Katzenmeyer. But the ridiculous lows that these folks will sink to continue to surprise us.
Wisconsin Family Action -- a radical right group that opposes marriage equality and has fueled transphobia with their support of trangender bathroom legislation -- is now attacking Jessica.
Apparently, they think having the endorsement of U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin is a negative 🙄, but we need to make sure voters see through their thinly veiled bigotry.
Take a stand against discrimination in Wisconsin politics.
Chip in to our rapid response fund for Jessica>>
Jessica's been running one of the most competitive campaigns the district has seen. Meanwhile Joe Sanfelippo -- Chair of the Assembly Health Committee -- has taken a 200 day vacation during the pandemic and recently told the public that ""there's nothing the goverment can do"" and ""we just need to sit back and let the medical community deal with this thing.""
Do-Nothing Joe has a real chance at losing his seat this November. It's no wonder that his Republican allies are resorting to fearmongering to cast doubt on Jessica's character.
We knew there would be nasty tactics used in this election to try and defeat Jessica, but we never guessed how low our opponents would stoop to try to maintain the status quo.
Now these folks are doubling down on their attempts to smear Jessica's character and confuse voters. We need you on board right now so we can fight back against these attacks and keep this election focused on the real issues that are so critical this November.
Help show that hate-fueled politics don't belong in Wisconsin.

Will you pitch in $10 or more before our major end-of-month deadline tonight at midnight? It’s not just about how much we raise but also the amount of people who have chipped in to help get us there. Every donation counts.
With just two months to go in this race, every decision we make now is one we need to get right. As we finalize our plan to get out the vote for our candidates across Wisconsin, we need to know we'll have the resources to fund it. That's why your donation today is so important.

Voter Access Team,info@assemblydemocrats.com,❗ BREAKING ❗ WI voter suppression laws reinstated,"126 days before election, Wisconsin Republican voter suppression laws upheld by federal panel
Friends --
Last night, a panel of three Republican appointed judges on the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated Wisconsin's Republican-authored limits on early voting, ruling more than three years after it heard the case and just 126 days before a critical election.
The ruling overturns two previous lower court decisions that found Republican attempts to limit early voting intentionally discriminated based on race.
What we raise by midnight tonight will determine how hard we can push back against these assaults on our democracy.
Disturbingly, the panel ruled that, ""Legislators are entitled to consider politics when changing the rules about voting.""
So, if you can't win fairly, you can just change the rules and unfairly disenfranchise some voters?
We're not going to allow this decision to restirct access to the ballot box. While the fight for voting rights continues in court, we're mobilizing staff and volunteers across the state to make sure voters know their rights and receive absentee ballots ahead of Election Day.
Fight back against these continued assaults on our democracy. Help us reach more voters to make sure they have access to absentee ballots ahead of the November election.
This decision rolls back the clock on voting rights and makes it harder to exercise the fundamental right to vote at a time when a pandemic has changed the way people vote.
Restricting in-person absentee voting -- a crucial tool Wisconsinites used in April to reduce the size of crowds at polling locations -- means longer lines and greater health risks to voters and poll workers.
We should be making it easier and safer, not harder and more dangerous, for Wisocnsin to vote.
Take a stand for democracy today.  Contribute before our critical fundraising deadline at midnight tonight and help us build our voter access outreach teams.

While the Trump era has been an unmitigated disaster, it’s important to
remember that Republicans have enabled him every step of the way.
Nowhere is that truer than in our state.
That’s why we’re teaming up with the Assembly Democratic
Campaign Committee here in Wisconsin to help ensure that we
elect strong public servants in down ballot races this year.
Team, there’s still a ton of work left to do if we want to throw out
reckless Republicans and replace them with Democrats who will
fight for our communities. Can you split a donation between
Mandela for Wisconsin and the ADCC to help win back control of
the state legislature?
The ADCC is fighting to elect a new era of leaders who share our
values and will stand up for Wisconsinites. 2020 represents our best
chance in years to flip seats in the state legislature — and in a climate
where outside influences and dark money are pouring into our state to
help preserve the status quo for Republicans, we need your grassroots
support to turn the page.
It’s been a staggering 197 days since the Republican-led state
legislature passed a bill, team. With your help, we can give Governor
Evers the Democratic majority he needs to protect our communities from
COVID, expand economic opportunity, fight for racial justice, and so much
more.
We hope you’ll join Mandela and the ADCC in the fight to defeat
Trump and elect a strong Democratic majority in the state
legislature that can help rebuild Wisconsin. Split a donation today
if you’re with us.

Assembly Democrats,info@assemblydemocrats.com,🚨 BREAKING NEWS: Republicans fail to protect Wisconsin ,"Friend-
10 seconds. That's how long it took Republicans to gavel in and out of Saturday's special session called by Governor Evers to discuss postponing Wisconsin's primary election.
That’s why we have to act quickly to make sure everyone is able to exercise their right to vote safely and securely. With the lives of Wisconsin voters on the line we must ensure safe and fair access to the ballot ahead of Tuesday’s election!
Add your name to our petition now to send a clear message to GOP lawmakers that their first priority must be the health and safety of Wisconsin's citizens.
15 other states have postponed primary elections and expanded vote by mail options for their citizens, but Wisconsin’s GOP is playing a dangerous game by refusing to follow the advice of health experts and putting politics ahead of people.
If you agree Wisconsinites shouldn't have to risk their health to exercise their fundamental right to vote, sign our petition to demand Republicans postpone Wisconsin's primary and expand access to mail voting.
During this unprecedented time, there are valid reasons for unease and uncertainty, ensuring that the voices of Wisconsin citizens are heard shouldn't be one of them.
Together, we can hold Republicans accountable to make the decision experts recommend to save lives.
Thank you for making your voice heard to protect our community during this difficult time,

It's coming down to the final hours before our deadline at midnight tonight. There's still time -- but we can't come up short for this one -- there's too much at stake.
Donate right now to be one of the final donors that puts us over the top for this crucial deadline!
Any last-minute support you can give us before the clock strikes midnight could help push us over the top.
With your help, I know we can get this done!
Thank you for all you're doing for Wisconsin,
Kara
Finance Director

subject: ❗ BREAKING WI voter suppression laws reinstated
Kara --
Last night, a panel of three Republican appointed judges on the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated Wisconsin's Republican-authored limits on early voting, ruling more than three years after it heard the case and just 126 days before a critical election.
The ruling overturns two previous lower court decisions that found Republican attempts to limit early voting intentionally discriminated based on race.
What we raise by midnight tonight will determine how hard we can push back against these assaults on our democracy.
Disturbingly, the panel ruled that, ""Legislators are entitled to consider politics when changing the rules about voting.""
So, if you can't win fairly, you can just change the rules and unfairly disenfranchise some voters?
We're not going to allow this decision to restirct access to the ballot box. While the fight for voting rights continues in court, we're mobilizing staff and volunteers across the state to make sure voters know their rights and receive absentee ballots ahead of Election Day.
Fight back against these continued assaults on our democracy. Help us reach more voters to make sure they have access to absentee ballots ahead of the November election.
This decision rolls back the clock on voting rights and makes it harder to exercise the fundamental right to vote at a time when a pandemic has changed the way people vote.
Restricting in-person absentee voting -- a crucial tool Wisconsinites used in April to reduce the size of crowds at polling locations -- means longer lines and greater health risks to voters and poll workers.
We should be making it easier and safer, not harder and more dangerous, for Wisocnsin to vote.
Take a stand for democracy today.  Contribute before our critical fundraising deadline at midnight tonight and help us build our voter access outreach teams.
Thank you for all you do,

Assembly Democrats,info@assemblydemocrats.com,Join us Wednesday for Protect the Vote Virtual Town Hall,"Voters should not have to choose between their health and their vote.
Friend-
The COVID-19 outbreak has changed much of our world, but it hasn't changed the core mission of the Assembly Democrats. In fact, this crisis has only strengthened our commitment to the people of our state. Wisconsinites need protection, solutions, and safety. They need responsible leadership at all levels, and we're fighting to make that happen.
The April 7th election forced many voters to make an impossible choice: surrender your right to vote and stay healthy or cast a ballot and put yourself and your community at risk.
That cannot be allowed to happen again.
Join us for a discussion this Wednesday on the urgent need to defend our democracy and #ProtectTheVote.
Our Democracy is under threat and the Wisconsin April primary disaster is the perfect example of why we must take action now.
The same forces that blocked options for voters to cast their ballot safely in April have rejected proposals to ensure our upcoming August and November elections are safe and accessible for all registered voters.
Our guests will discuss the need for swift action to secure our right to safely vote in elections this year, and the solutions we must implement to protect our health and fair ballot access for all Wisconsinites.
Can we count on you to join this important conversation? Register to attend the town hall. You will have an opportunity to submit questions during the town hall or post questions in advance on our facebook event page.
We look forward to talking with you this Wednesday!

"Kara, Team Assembly Dems",info@assemblydemocrats.com,Under Attack,"Wisconsin Republican are on the attack
Friend,
Over the weekend a Democratic Assembly candidate was the target of racist comments and vandalism at their home.
This latest attack is a direct result of the viscious culture that Trump and his allies in the Wisconsin Assembly have fostered in our state.
For weeks now, we've been fighting off attacks from dark money groups and their Republican allies. Given a chance to denounce these attacks, Republicans have only provided credence to their existence and claimed they are powerless to stop them.
Just today, Wisconsin Republicans and their dark money allies launched an unprecendented spending spree on radio and mail against our top candidates.
These attacks represent the worst of our politics, and it's exactly why we deserve leaders who will focus on the issues affecting our families and communities, not mudslinging.
Will you rush a contribution today to make sure we're equipped to fight back?

Assembly Democrats,info@assemblydemocrats.com,🚨 URGENT: Wisconsin GOP threatens lives,"Good government matters
Friend-
The conservative majority on the Wisconsin Supreme Court just sided with GOP lawmakers in striking down Wisconsin’s safer-at-home policy.
While public health experts at every level of government are warning of the serious consequences of opening up states too soon, Wisconsin Republicans are once again putting politics before people.
Just last month, Republican lawmakers refused to allow for safe primary elections and sued to disenfranchise thousands of Wisconsin voters.
This crisis has reminded us that good government matters.
Facts and science matter, and the facts show that Democratic leadership is saving lives in Wisconsin. But that isn’t stopping the right from fanning the flames of partisanship and threatening the lives of our citizens.
These attacks aren’t going away anytime soon, and that means we need your continued support if we’re going to win this fight and stop these partisan attacks.
We need to unite against the attacks from the radical right and fight to defend our state. Chip in a monthly recurring donation of anything you can right now to help us defend against the political games.
Right now, we need leaders who are informed and honest, who bring people together rather than drive us apart. We need leaders who put the health and safety of our citizens first.
We're gearing up to stop the partisan games, and we have to win in order to keep making progress while keeping Wisconsinites safe. Chip in a monthly recurring donation to show that we are in this fight together, for the long haul, and put an end to dangerous and petty partisan games.

Dianne Hesselbein (personal),info@assemblydemocrats.com,This is how we protect voting rights in Wisconsin,"Dear Friend,
This week has been difficult for those of us who care deeply about democracy and protecting our fundamental rights. We’ve witnessed Republicans systematically advance their voter suppression agenda while jeopardizing the health and safety of Wisconsin residents.
Assembly Republican’s refusal to postpone the primary election and allow residents to vote by mail left Wisconsin voters with the impossible choice of braving the polls – putting their own and other’s safety at risk – or losing their right to vote.
In the shadow of our national public health crisis, this blatant effort resulted in polling site closures, wide-spread voter confusion and fear, and long wait times in the cold and rain – making it harder and more dangerous for people to vote.
The message from Republicans was clear: if they can’t count on your vote, they don’t want you to be counted.
But Wisconsin Assembly Democrats have an answer. We have introduced legislation that would give all voters greater access to the ballot by mailing every voter in Wisconsin a ballot they can use to safely vote by mail.
In a year in which we honor two milestones of democracy – the 150th anniversary of the 15th Amendment which granted black men the right to vote and the centennial anniversary of the 19th Amendment guaranteeing women’s right to vote – it has been especially disheartening to see efforts to roll back access to the ballot. The passage of these amendments marked the largest expansion of democracy in the history of our country. Yet, today, Republicans are once again using Wisconsin as a test case for massive disenfranchisement.
I wish I could say this is something new for Wisconsin Republicans, but you and I both remember the Scott Walker tactics that left our state with some of the worst voter-suppression laws in the country and became a blue-print for other states. Their actions this week only compound this tragedy that is toxic to our democracy.
Now, America is watching to see what we will do. There’s no question that our state will be ground zero for the 2020 election. With vital electoral college votes at stake in the presidential election, and competitive races in our state Assembly, all eyes will be on Wisconsin.
Preserving our right to vote is not only about defending against these attacks, but also about expanding access. That’s why Assembly Democrats introduced legislation yesterday to give all registered voters greater access to the ballot box. By moving Wisconsin elections in 2020 to vote by mail, we can safeguard voter rights while keeping voters and poll workers safe. Take a stand for democracy today by adding your name >>>
During this public health crisis, it is vital that we preserve and protect the fundamentals of our democracy to ensure that every eligible voter can access a ballot and cast a vote that will be counted. Moving to a Vote by Mail system will protect our democracy and our citizens — and in doing that, we restore faith and trust in our system and send the message to every voter that their voice matters.
Together, we can stop the assault on voting and guarantee that every voter has the right to cast a ballot and make their voice heard. If not, they’ll continue their quest to chip away voting rights in Wisconsin, and the entire country.
Add your name to join the fight.
Thank you for stepping up,

big news @ ADCC,info@assemblydemocrats.com,✅ Healthcare heroes stand up to Vos & Trump,"Doctors and nurses 100% MATCH >>
Friend -- Robin Vos and Republicans in the legislature have taken a 200 day vacation -- using the pandemic to turn Wisconsinites against each other, filing frivolous lawsuits to end common sense public health measures, and hosting packed fundraisers where they flout social distancing and mock science-based recommendations.
Vos stood by silently as Trump pushed conspiracy theories against medical professionals who have selflessly put themselves at risk fighting at the forefront of this crisis.  Healthcare heroes have had enough of the dangerous lies and inaction that are costing American lives, and they are stepping up to MATCH your donation today!
A group of doctors and nurses have stepped up to 100% MATCH your contribution to elect leaders who will get to work and protect us. Will you chip in whatever amount makes sense for you to stand with healthcare heroes in these final hours before the election?
The daily records being set for new cases, hospitalizations and deaths is the terrible but predictable outcome of inaction by leaders at every level. Donald Trump, Robin Vos and GOP legislators have forfeited their right to reelection by refusing to do their jobs.
Right now, Americans are hurting. We need leaders who understand the challenges we're facing, who will rise to meet this moment, and who will fight to keep us safe and healthy. Chip in now to turn the page and usher in a new era of leadership that will show up for work and fight for us!

Friend -- Today marks 200 days of Wisconsin Republican inaction on Covid.
With daily records being set for new cases, hospitalizations and deaths, Robin Vos and the GOP legislature sat on their hands for 200 days -- refusing to take steps to protect our health, our jobs, and our businesses.
We have one shot on November 3 to elect leaders who will get back to work and put an end to the Covid-19 crisis.
DOUBLE YOUR IMPACT & CHECK OUT OUR NEW VIDEO>>
With less than 48 hours until Election Day, a group of doctors and healthcare workers is MATCHING your donation – giving each online gift 2X the impact for electing new leaders who will get to work and do their job! We must act immediately to have the biggest possible difference in the final hours.
As doctors and nurses on the front line of this pandemic, these healthcare heros see every day how Robin Vos and the Republican led legislature have failed Wisconsinites. And, they know that another 4 years of a Trump presidency would be a disaster for their patients.
They've watched as Trump and Vos have used the COVID-19 crisis to divide and turn Wisconsinites against one another to distract us from their own failures — putting partisan politics over public health time and time again.
They've witnessed GOP leaders mock masks, flout social distancing by holding packed campaign rallies and fundraisers, and bring endless lawsuits to prevent common sense, science-based public health measures -- all while the virus took hold of our corner of America.
The challenges we face today cannot be solved by division, deflection or distraction. We need to elect leaders who will unite and work together to end the ongoing public health crisis.
Victories up and down the ballot are within reach, friend – but NOTHING is guaranteed unless we step up urgently. Chip in a 2X-IMPACT gift now to give Robin Vos a permanent vacation >>
If you've had enough of the lies, the embarrassment, and the broken promises, we need you to stand with us now to elect leaders who put people before politics, and work with scientists and public health experts to end the COVID-19 crisis, save lives and get our economy working again.
Thank you so much for being our partners in this fight. Together, we will win.
