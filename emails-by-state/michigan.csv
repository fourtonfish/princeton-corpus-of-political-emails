"Folks -
Things did not slow down following the historic success we saw for Democrats in 2018, which included winning every statewide office in Michigan and flipping the U.S. House from red to blue. The past year has seen both triumph and tragedy, celebration and mourning, but one thing is certain: we are stronger.
We watched as Michigan women made history during the inaugurations of Gov. Whitmer, Attorney General Nessel, and Secretary of State Benson, and we suffered the loss of heroes and history-makers like Reps. John Dingell and John Conyers.
Together, let's make history again! Can you chip in right now so we can continue building our winning team of organizers across the state to keep Michigan moving forward? >>>
We fought back as Donald Trump continued to corrupt our democracy and make a mockery of the American presidency, and we cheered as voters in Kentucky, Louisiana, and our own communities rejected the direction Trump and the GOP want to take us as a country and a people.
All the while, we have been putting more field organizers on the ground throughout the state, knocking on doors, making phone calls, and strengthening the party's grassroots and digital infrastructure to get our message out to voters everywhere in Michigan.
I said it when I was elected to lead our party, and I will continue to say it: movements go forward, not backward. With your support, this Michigan Democratic Party is only going in one direction heading into 2020: full-speed ahead.
Chip in $10, $25, or whatever you can afford right now to help us continue building the statewide operation that will lead Democrats in Michigan to victory up and down the ballot next November >>>

Winning in 2018 was only half the blueprint.
We laid the groundwork, stayed united, and grew stronger in 2019.
Together, in 2020, we will finish the job by putting Democrats in the majority in our State House, re-electing Senator Gary Peters, and defeating Donald Trump once and for all. If we have you with us, I know we will get it done.
Thank you for all you have done and all that you are about to do.

"Friend -
Lies and broken promises. That's the truth of Donald Trump's time in the White House. The list grows longer every minute he's in office, but here are a few of Trump's top promises to Michigan voters that don't match his actions or reality:
Promise: 25 million new jobs in his first term.
Reality: Job growth has actually slowed since Trump took office, and Michigan lost over 5,300 manufacturing jobs last year alone.
Promise: Better, more affordable healthcare for all Americans.
Reality: Trump is currently suing in federal court to overturn the ACA and has fought desperately to gut protections for pre-existing conditions, threatening health care for over four million Michiganders.
Promise: Protect Social Security and Medicare.
Reality: Trump declared that major cuts to Social Security and Medicare are on the table if he gets a second term.
Trump's presidency is built on a foundation of fabrication and falsehoods, and the list above is just the tip of the iceberg. These aren't small matters or open to interpretation--they are major issues that dramatically impact the vast majority of Americans.
[300 RESPONSES NEEDED]
Should Trump be held accountable for his lies and broken promises?
YES →
NO →
The ultimate accountability is victory. Michigan's working families and the future of our country CAN'T AFFORD another four years of Trump.
Brick by brick, we will tear down Trump's house of lies and leave him nowhere to hide from the truth this November--but we can only get it done if we stand together all the way to Election Day. Take the poll and let us know where you stand! >>>
Thank you for all that you do.
Onward,
Team MDP

"Hello,
Paul Begala and Lavora Barnes are holding a virtual fundraiser this Tuesday at 7 PM ET, and it looks like you haven't RSVP'd yet! You won't want to miss out on their conversation — and the chance to ask these veteran campaign strategists a question yourself.
Time is running out to secure your spot, but it's not too late to make a contribution to join this special event to discuss our party's plan to win this election
If you become a host you’ll even receive a signed copy of Paul's new book, You're Fired: The Perfect Guide to Beating Donald Trump.
RSVP
Paul and Lavora have been on the campaign trail for years, and they know how pivotal these final few weeks will be. We have a plan to win by reaching voters in every corner of this state, but it will take considerable resources.
The contributions that you make to events like this one will go directly toward hiring organizers, expanding our advertising, and electing Democrats up and down the ballot on Election Day.
So I'm personally asking you: Will you chip in to reserve your spot at Tuesday's fundraiser with Paul and Lavora?
We hope you won’t miss out on your chance to attend such an exciting event with one of America's greatest political talents.

"Friend, the stakes could not be higher.
With a vacancy on the Supreme Court, there’s so much on the line: health care protections for pre-existing conditions, Roe v. Wade and women’s health care, civil rights, voting rights, and ensuring we're putting workers before corporate special interests. In some states, voting is already underway, and voters should have their voices heard. There should NOT be a Supreme Court nomination until the next presidential term begins.
But just weeks before an election, Mitch McConnell has vowed that Donald Trump's nominee will fill the Supreme Court vacancy and be put on the Senate floor for a vote.
The Supreme Court is on the ballot this November, friend. And with analysts at CBS News reporting that Michigan’s Senate race will decide Senate control, we’ll have ZERO chance of taking back the Senate from McConnell and protecting the Supreme Court if we lose this seat.
That’s why Trump, McConnell and their Republican-allies are funneling TENS of MILLIONS of dollars to buy this seat — and after weeks of nonstop GOP attacks against me, a recent poll shows my Trump- and McConnell-backed opponent in the lead by TWO POINTS.
Keeping Michigan blue and flipping the Senate has never been more important, that’s why the Michigan Democratic Party and I have set a $20,000 emergency goal by 11:59 p.m. TONIGHT. Friend, I’m personally asking: Will you split a $10 donation or more now to keep Michigan blue, take back the Senate, and protect the Supreme Court from Mitch McConnell?

We know the next Supreme Court Justice will rule on cases that touch millions of lives. There’s no better example of this than a case on the Affordable Care Act the Court will hear this November following the election.
If Donald Trump’s new justice is confirmed, millions of Americans and 700,000 here in Michigan could lose their health care in the middle of a pandemic. We have to stand up together right now before it’s too late.
Can you donate now and help Michigan Democrats at this history-making moment?

Through it all, Governor Gretchen Whitmer has taken decisive action to save thousands of lives and protect our families. Yet even in the midst of a pandemic, Republicans have failed to put their partisan attacks aside.

As eager as we all are to get results, I am grateful for the extra effort and due diligence by Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson and all of our election workers to make sure every voice is heard and every vote is counted.
Right now, I want to thank every single person on this team for every way that you've shown your support — by volunteering, chipping in, and talking about the campaign.
Without supporters like you, we wouldn't be in the strong position we are. I have never felt more hopeful than I do right now.
I also want to thank every candidate who stepped up to run this cycle. Running for office is not an easy task, and it requires a lot of commitment and sacrifice.

"Hi friend,
Donald Trump just wrapped up his campaign rally in Muskegon. Trump's here because he's desperately trying to avoid defeat in a state he won by exactly 10,704 votes in 2016.
Right now, all signs show that the outcome of this race will once again be determined by one of the closest margins in the country. That's why we're urgently asking:
Rush a $10 donation or whatever you can before Trump leaves this rally to help Democrats up and down the ballot win in Michigan.
While Trump is willing to put his supporters' health at risk with crowded rallies, we're listening to scientists to guide our campaign. But that does mean we have to work even harder to reach voters through organizing and advertising.
With Michiganders already casting their ballots early, we can't give Trump and his team an opportunity to have the final word as folks make their choice in this election.
Drawing a clear contrast and getting our message out to every Michigan voter right now is vitally important. Pitch in $10 or whatever you can to fight back against Trump's attacks tonight.

Friend, today is our recommended deadline for sending in a mail-in ballot. If you’re planning to vote by mail and you've already received your ballot, we urge you to send it in today to make sure it gets to your clerk’s office in time.
If you plan to vote in person, you can also do that today. Don’t wait until the last minute — this election is too important. Preview your sample ballot, find your clerk’s office, and do your part to elect Michigan Democrats today:
FIND MY CLERK'S OFFICE →
We want to make sure every vote in Michigan is counted. That’s why we’re recommending sending in mail-in ballots by today. Ballots must arrive at your clerk’s office by 8 PM on Election Day, and there’s no sense in risking it. And don’t forget to place your ballot in the secrecy envelope and sign the mailing envelope!
In 2016, Trump’s margin in Michigan was razor thin. Senator Gary Peters is in for a tough fight. And Democrats running for Congress and the State House on down to local office need your help.
More than 1 million Michiganders have already locked in their votes. Will you join them today, whether you’re planning to vote by mail or in-person?

"I'll cut right to the chase, team: the presidential race will come down to a razor-thin margin in Michigan — again. This will be one of the closest battleground states and it could be one of the most expensive, too.
The Trump campaign has already spent millions to keep Michigan on their victory map — and there’s plenty more where that came from. Republicans are looking for any sign of weakness, and we cannot let them think Michigan is a battleground state they have any chance of winning.
But the good news is that we've been preparing for this very moment since Trump was elected. We've built a field operation from the ground up with organizers and volunteers in every county in this state. All of our progress is in no small part thanks to grassroots supporters like you, friend.
Your support now is essential as we finalize our budget for the rest of this election. Will you make an investment of $10 or more in our party before our critical end-of-month deadline? Every contribution will go directly towards electing Democrats at every level.

"NEW: Trump will visit Michigan just a day after Biden.
Rush an emergency donation of $10 to help us prepare for whatever nasty attacks Trump has planned:
$5
$10
$25
We know exactly what will go down at Trump’s rally: more lies, more attacks, and more hate. But with the polls showing Biden and Trump neck and neck in Michigan, we cannot wait until the attacks start to fight back.
So, we need to get ready for the worst-case scenario, especially in a race this close — because if we’re caught off guard, Trump could easily win Michigan again.
Look, Trump thinks he can just swoop into Michigan at the last second and steal this election out from under us, let’s prove him wrong right now:
We’ve set a goal of getting 10,000 people to chip in before Trump steps on stage at his rally in Freeland on Thursday to show that we have 10,000 people in Joe’s corner. Will you be one of 12 supporters we need from Almont?

"Stand with Governor Whitmer and stand up to Trump by supporting our efforts to fight back! >>>
Folks -
As Americans are met daily with new coronavirus developments more dire than the day before, Donald Trump is adding to the anxiety and confusion with attacks, misinformation, and blame for his failure to take charge and protect America from the global crisis we knew was headed to our shores.
Trump's latest target is someone who has worked tirelessly from day one to protect the health and safety of the state and people she serves: Governor Gretchen Whitmer.
Stand with Governor Whitmer and stand up to Trump by supporting our efforts to fight back! >>>
No legitimate leader would waste even the minute it takes to write such trash, but when you're a total failure like Trump you have different priorities. Governor Whitmer has been praised across the country for her leadership during this unprecedented crisis while Trump has lied every step of the way.
While real leaders like Governor Whitmer are working on finding solutions and saving lives, it's up to us to have their back so they can focus on getting the job done.
We're meeting the lies and attacks head on, but we have to take our efforts to another level. We know times are tough, but if you can chip in just $5 or $10 now, you'll help us build the digital war chest we need to take the fight to Trump and Republicans all the way to Election Day!
CHIP IN $5 →
CHIP IN $10 →
CHIP IN $25 →
CHIP IN $50 →
OTHER AMOUNT →
With so much at stake, we can't afford to take a day off from holding Trump accountable--and we won't have to if we continue building the massive digital operation that will help lead Democrats to victory this November.
Bottom line: we can't risk another four years of failed leadership in the White House, and we can't step back from the fight for a minute if we're going to succeed. If we have you with us, we will get it done!
Fighting Forward,
Team MDP

"Hello,
As Trump stood next to Joe Biden last night, spouting lies, stoking fear, and further dividing our country, the choice the American people must make at the ballot box has never been clearer. Now we need to follow up with voters across Michigan — many of whom already have their ballots in hand.
But first, we have to hit our major FEC deadline at midnight tonight. With so much on the line, will you chip in $10 or more right now to help hit our quarterly FEC fundraising goal before midnight? We can win this race, but we cannot do it without you.
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
DONATE $10
DONATE $25

ANOTHER AMOUNT
The fact that Trump won't condemn white supremacists or commit to accepting the election results just goes to show you how terrified he is of losing. Trump will do and say just about anything to keep his grip on power, and to do that he must win Michigan. That's why your donation matters so much today.
We're counting on a groundswell of grassroots support to hit this goal tonight and fund our voter outreach efforts over the final 34 days of this election. Will you rush a donation before our FEC deadline at midnight to ensure we have the resources to defeat Trump for good?
This is a critical moment to show we're ready and prepared to do what it takes in these final weeks before the election to get out the vote and win. But we can't do it without your support, so thanks for all you do.
Now, let's go win this thing.

Today, Donald Trump lands in Michigan for a campaign rally in Freeland. But before we explain what this means for our campaign, we have to ask:

Trump knows what we know: he needs to win Michigan to guarantee a second term in the White House. And if we do nothing to stop him, he just might squeak by with another victory. After all, the Trump campaign is spending more than $7 million to keep Michigan red.
But this team won’t go down without a tough fight. After Trump won our state by exactly 10,704 votes in 2016, we came back with a vengeance in 2018, electing Governor Gretchen Whitmer and Democrats up and down the ballot. That says a lot about the strength of our grassroots movement.
Can we rely on you to make an urgent donation of $10 or more before Trump’s rally tonight? We need your support to fight back against whatever Trump has planned during his visit to Michigan.
We have what it takes to defeat Trump once and for all, but it will require all of us working together. As always, we’re grateful to you for being a part of this fight.
Thank you,

"Voting in November
Did you hear the news, friend?
Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson (D) worked with local clerks to ensure that every registered voter in Michigan was mailed an absentee ballot application for the first time in our state’s history! Michigan’s leadership knows how important it is to give every single voter a safe way to vote this year, and we couldn’t be more grateful.
In fact, our team is stepping up to make calls to voters to ensure that everyone knows they’ve received an absentee ballot application and how to return it. But we can’t reach every Michigander and could sure use your help, friend. Can you join us for a virtual phone bank this weekend for our Weekend of Action to help make sure that voters know how to return their application?
Click here to sign up to make calls this weekend. Each of our phone banks will start with a quick training, and we’ll make sure you have the tools you’ll need for a fun and successful shift.
WHAT: Week of Action Phone Bank
WHEN: Saturday, July 11 - Sunday, July 12
WHERE: Online! Find an event near you.

There's a lot of disinformation out there about voting by mail in Michigan, and it's up to us to ensure everyone has the correct details to cast their ballots from home.
This is the most important election of our lifetimes - we have the opportunity to elect Joe Biden to the White House, send Gary Peters back to the U.S. Senate, flip the Michigan Supreme Court, win the majority in the Michigan State House, and elect Democrats up and down the ballot.

This Valentine's Day, as Republicans focus on putting their love of party and Donald Trump over our country and the interests of the American people, Democrats across the nation are uniting through our shared love of progress and the power of our vote.

"Folks –
I just got off a call with our finance team to go over this month's numbers, and we only have $556 left to hit our May goal with TONIGHT'S MIDNIGHT deadline fast-approaching and just a few hours to go!
Over the past month, we've witnessed armed protests at our Capitol, attacks against our governor and calls for violence from Trump, and now he's trying to DENY YOU and millions of Michiganders the right to vote by mail. Why? Because Trump knows that when the people of Michigan vote, Republicans lose.
Please, we need you with us to continue this fight all the way to Election Day and keep up our momentum across the state. If we are in this together, we will succeed, and all of our voices will be heard!
Can we count on you? Chip in just $15 or any amount you can afford right now to help us finish this month strong and ensure every single Michigan voter is heard this November! >>>

While Donald Trump and Republicans have made it clear their strategy in 2020 is blatant voter suppression, Michigan Dems are fighting back. We're going straight to the people with a massive statewide vote by mail program to raise up every voice and ensure every community is heard loud and clear. Because when people vote, Democrats win—period.
That's why we set a huge goal for May! We absolutely have to invest now to continue connecting with Michigan voters and getting our message out 24/7 between now and Election Day—and we can’t do it without you!
We’re only $1,500 away from our May goal! That’s just 100 grassroots contributions of $15. Will you be one of the 100 to get us over the top?
Our democracy, our country, and our future are at stake in this election. What kind of nation will we become if we keep heading in the direction we're going? It’s on us to do something about it, take a stand, and in one voice, say, “We can do better, and we will, together!”
If you’re with us, chip in $15 or any amount you can afford to help us hit our goal, get out the vote, and put us firmly on the path to victory in 2020 and real progress again for our state and country! >>>

Rush an urgent contribution of $5 or more to help us prepare for whatever attacks Pence has planned:
$5
$10
$25
Tonight, Mike Pence will speak at the Republican National Convention. Then on Friday he'll touch down in Michigan — but before he does, we need to send a very powerful message that we're prepared to defeat Pence and Trump.
Remember, Trump won Michigan by exactly 10,704 votes in 2016. This year’s election could be decided by an even slimmer margin. That means we have to do everything in our power to defeat him at the ballot box.
Everything is riding on our state, and virtually any chance Democrats have at victory — from the White House to the Senate — runs right through Michigan. That's why we're asking:
Will you chip in $10 or more today to help us fight back against the attacks Pence will surely hurl our way? Your contribution would send him a powerful message and give us the resources to prepare for his visit.

In a moment, we're going to ask you to pitch in towards our end-of-month goal, but first we want to take a second to talk about why this deadline matters.
This is our last full fundraising quarter before the election so this deadline is a big test of our campaign’s strength — and it's one we cannot afford to fail. Especially not after Mike Pence paid us a visit and made it clear that Trump intends to win Michigan.
Will you make a donation of any amount before our end-of-month deadline at midnight? We're just $3,598 short of our goal, and your donation could be the one that puts us over the top.

Will you pitch in $10 or more before our major end-of-month deadline tonight at midnight? It’s not just about how much we raise but also the amount of people who have chipped in to help get us there. Every donation counts.
With just two months to go in this race, every decision we make now is one we need to get right. As we finalize our plan to get out the vote, we need to know we'll have the resources to fund it. That's why your donation today is so important.

"Hi there, Congresswoman Haley Stevens here. Today is special for a few reasons. Before I humbly ask for your contribution, let me throw some numbers at you:
We're officially less than 35 days away from Election Day, which means that on this day in five weeks, votes will begin to be counted and voices will be heard in the most important election of our lifetime.
And tonight Joe Biden will debate Donald Trump for the first time. Then tomorrow, the Michigan Democratic Party will face their most important fundraising deadline yet.
What comes next after tonight's debate will depend on you. Everything that this team has worked so hard for is about to be put to the test as Michigan prepares for the biggest influx of absentee ballots in its history.
Voters are already receiving their mail-in ballots. That leaves us very little time to reach undecided voters, so we're going to need all hands on deck in the final weeks. That's why I'm asking:
Will you chip in $10 or more to the Michigan Democratic Party before their critical FEC deadline tomorrow at midnight? Every dollar will we put to work immediately getting out the vote in these final five weeks.
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:

"That's a field margin...
Hi friend,
10,704 votes. That’s the exact number of votes that gave Trump a win in Michigan four years ago. When you break those numbers down, you end up with just two votes per precinct. That’s what we call a field margin -- the number of votes that we can secure if we make enough calls, send enough texts and mobilize enough voters.
Here’s how you can help us make up the difference: we’re hosting virtual organizing meetings across Michigan starting next Wednesday, June 17 to meet supporters and build the team that will send Donald Trump packing, re-elect Senator Gary Peters to flip the US Senate, protect and grow the majority in the US House, take back control of the State House and secure a Democratic majority in the Michigan Supreme Court.
Click here to find a training near you and learn how you can organize folks in your community!

Michigan is the must-win state in 2020. If we lose Michigan, we run the risk of allowing Trump to continue to wreak havoc on our country while Senate Republicans rubber-stamp his dangerous agenda.
That’s why we need you, friend. Can you join us next Wednesday for a virtual organizing meeting? Click here to sign up.
Thanks,

"Hello,
Last week, the Democratic National Convention painted a bright picture of America — filled with diversity, empathy, and hope. Last night, we received a dark vision of what the next four years would look like if Trump were re-elected.
Instead of inspirational Americans like Edward Good, a 95-year-old WWII veteran from Farmington Hills, the Republicans featured a St. Louis couple best known for waving guns at peaceful protestors. And instead of incredible rising stars like Mari Manoogian, the Republicans are highlighting Trump's children.
It shouldn't come as a surprise then, that the Republicans don't have a party platform. No commitment to health care or jobs. No plan to defeat COVID-19 and make Americans' lives better. Just blind loyalty to Trump.
Before Trump speaks again at the Republican convention tonight, will you chip in $10 or more to mobilize Americans around Joe Biden's vision of a better, brighter future?

"Donald Trump: ""Don't call the woman in Michigan.""
Folks -
The White House has failed miserably in its response to the coronavirus pandemic, but America's governors have stepped into the void and led the fight to protect our citizens and contain the deadly spread of COVID-19.
We're proud that Governor Gretchen Whitmer is among those showing strong leadership in the face of this health crisis and demanding support from the federal government that our people desperately need.
But Donald Trump is now twisting requests for help into attacks on him in a bid to distract from his continued failure to lead, telling Mike Pence, ""Don't call the woman in Michigan."" Trump is playing petty games with millions of lives on the line, and the people of Michigan will remember this November--because with your help, we won't let them forget it!
While Gov. Whitmer takes the high road and fights forward for us, we have to fight back for her and the people of our state against the lies and attacks! Chip in $5, $10, $25, or whatever you can afford right now to stand with Gov. Whitmer and help us hold Trump accountable! >>>
CHIP IN $5 →
CHIP IN $10 →
CHIP IN $20.20 →
CHIP IN $50 →
CHIP IN $100 →
YOU DECIDE
Bottom line: Gov. Whitmer isn't asking Trump to help HER. She's asking for help from the federal government on behalf of the people of Michigan. While real leaders are working on finding solutions and saving lives, it's up to us to have their backs so they can focus on getting the job done.
We simply can't afford four more years of division and failed leadership, and we can't step back from the fight for a minute if we're going to succeed. If we have you with us, we will get it done, and America will have the kind of leadership again at the top that we deserve.
STAND WITH WHITMER
Thank you for all you're doing to help us continue fighting forward during these challenging times. Stay strong and stay safe!

"Friend,
The United States Postal Service (USPS) is an essential part of everyday life. Letter carriers deliver mail, news, absentee ballots, and life-saving medications in rain, snow, heat, and the dark of night — and yes, even during a pandemic.
Letter carriers and postal work day in and day out to keep Americans connected, supplied, and safe. But right now the Postal Service needs our help as COVID-19 has stretched their operations thin. If we don't save the Postal Service, it could close as soon as September.
That's why we're collecting thousands of grassroots signatures to demand Trump fully fund the Postal Service before it's too late. We need 12 more people from 48003 to sign the petition.
ADD YOUR NAME →
Trump admitted to intentionally dismantling the Postal Service to make it harder for people to vote. He even hand-picked a new Postmaster General to do his bidding. If he gets his way, it could mean job losses and wage cuts for hundreds of thousands of postal workers, reduced services to rural areas across the country, and a serious threat to our elections.
Michigan Democrats like Senator Gary Peters have been working hard to push for emergency funding to save the USPS. That's why he launched an investigation to get to the bottom of why mail is being delayed in the first place.
Will you add your name to stand with Gary in calling on the Senate to take immediate action to save the USPS?
Thank you,

"This is why we need Gary Peters in the Senate.
Team, last night will be remembered as the culmination of a rushed, illegitimate, and hypocritical process to nab another seat on the Supreme Court against the will of the American people.
Amy Coney Barrett's elevation to the court was a power grab, plain and simple. And it demonstrates exactly why we need to flip the Senate, but we can't do it without re-electing Senator Gary Peters.
Gary understands what's at stake with a case that could overturn the Affordable Care Act just two weeks away from being heard before the Supreme Court. Standing up to this nomination was the right thing to do, but his extreme Republican opponent is already attacking him for his vote. So we need your help to fight back, which is why we're asking:
Will you help us fund get out the vote efforts in this last week of the campaign so we can re-elect Gary Peters and get Democrats up and down the ballot into office?

Will you chip in $10 or whatever you can give today so we can re-elect Gary Peters and help ensure Democrats take back the Senate?
Gary stood up for the American people with his vote against Trump's Supreme Court justice. Now, he needs us to stand up for him.

It's January 20, 2021. Joe Biden has just been sworn in as the 46th President of the United States alongside our nation's first woman Vice President.
Not only has Gary Peters won his re-election, but Democrats have taken back control of the U.S. Senate, the State House, and the State Supreme Court. To top it off, we expanded our U.S. House majority, too!
Now with Democrats in leadership across the state, we can get to work on the issues that matter most to Michiganders. Without the GOP's gridlock, we can lower the cost of prescription drugs, enact gun safety, create good-paying jobs, and fix our crumbling infrastructure.
We want you to hold onto that image for the next 88 days because we need your help to make it a reality. Anything you can give will go a long way to help build a winning organization to defeat Donald Trump and the GOP this year.

Hi friend,
First, Donald Trump came to Michigan for a taxpayer-funded photo-op. And now Mike Pence is coming back to Michigan today in an attempt to drum up support in our must-win state of Michigan.
Why can’t the Trump campaign stay out of Michigan? Because they know that if they lose here, it could be the end of their administration and the end to Mitch McConnell’s hold over the Senate.

"This is serious, friend. The right-wing effort to recall Governor Gretchen Whitmer is ramping up.
They claim they have enough signatures to strip Governor Whitmer of her emergency powers. State House Republicans have already said they want to undo the governor’s statewide mask mandate and workplace safety rules. But they aren’t stopping there. Their stacked Supreme Court is taking it one step further.
We can’t let Republicans get away with this. The only way to stop this partisan power grab is to flip the State House and State Supreme Court, which makes this one of the most important elections of our lifetime.

"Michigan Democrats are fired up like never before and ready to get rid of Donald Trump once and for all!
Friend -
If one thing is certain after our presidential primary yesterday, it's that Michigan Democrats are fired up like never before and ready to get rid of Donald Trump once and for all.
Democratic voters turned out in record numbers to make their voices heard on both whom our presidential nominee will be and critical local issues across the state. In fact, turnout in Michigan exceeded 2016 by 31%!
We have to keep that momentum going! That's why we launched the Mobilize Michigan effort--because winning in November takes investment now and hard work every day, all the way to Election Day.
If you're ready to beat Trump and elect Democrats up and down the ballot in 2020, chip in $5, $10, $25, or any amount you can afford. It all makes a difference and will help us build a blue wave here in Michigan the likes of which the GOP and our country have never seen! >>>

Now, it's time to come together, get to work, and turn the most important election in our lifetimes into the greatest Democratic victory of all time. The Senate, House, and White House--all there for the taking, but only if we do the work and leave nothing on the field. That begins now--and we have November 3rd circled in bright blue on our calendar.
Yesterday, we took a step closer to restoring decency, dignity, and honor to the White House, the hope of equality and prosperity for all Americans, and America's leadership and status in the world. Together, we'll go all the way, and united, we will win for our state, for our country, and for all of us.
This is our time. Let's make history, Michigan Democrats!

"Friend, we only have ten days until Michiganders determine who will represent them at every level of government. I hope you’ll give me a moment to explain everything at stake, and then, if you can, pitch in $10 or more to the Michigan Democratic Party to help us get to victory in November.
At the very heart of it, this election is about what we can do together to restore the soul of this nation. We must come together as a party to replace lies with truth, fear with hope, and division with unity. And it has never been more clear that to do that, Democrats must win at every level.
That means not just winning the White House, but taking back the U.S. Senate, holding the U.S. House, and flipping the State House and State Supreme Court — we simply can't settle for anything less.
We know that winning this election isn’t going to be easy, and Republicans are going to do everything in their power to stop us. But we have something much more powerful on our side: grassroots supporters like you, friend.
Together, we can accomplish anything if we join hands and work to get it done. Will you give $10 or whatever you can to fund the Michigan Democratic Party's get out the vote efforts?

"Folks –
There is nothing more American than when our citizens are standing up for what they believe in and demanding their voices be heard.
While there is no doubt the issues we face as a people are challenging, they are also fundamental to the advancement of us all, and right now, we are truly on the edge of monumental progress.
The only way to capture that spirit for good and set in stone the gains we make together in this moment is with our vote – your vote, my vote, and the votes of everyone we know.
This Fourth of July, as we remember the past, it's more important than ever that we recommit to the road ahead and building a better future for all.
That’s why we’re asking you to join us and pledge to vote in 2020! Each of us must do all we can to ensure every voice is heard – and that starts with YOUR vote! Can we count on you?

TAKE THE PLEDGE →
I am so incredibly proud of all those standing up to be heard – this is how we grow, this is how we make our country a better place for our children, and this is how we move America forward for all of her citizens.

"Folks -
Legacy Dinner is more than an annual event\--it is a celebration of all that we have achieved as Michigan Democrats and a kickoff of the work that we will do together to win in November.
The road to the White House runs through Michigan, and our state is a must-win for Democrats if we are going to defeat Donald Trump.
No one understands that more than our special guest for this year's Legacy Dinner, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi. Speaker Pelosi is fighting to hold Trump accountable and leading the charge for Democrats, and we cannot wait to hear from her as we gear up for the most important election in our lifetimes.
We want you there too, because it's all on the line in 2020, and the only way we win is if we stand together all the way to November. Please join us on Friday, March 20 at the Lansing Center for MDP Legacy Dinner 2020 with special guest Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi!

Legacy Dinner is about connecting our fight for the future with the power of our past. It is also a crossroads between where we have been and the progress that lay before us--if we are united as Democrats.
Join us for this year's Legacy Dinner, and let's make it clear that Michigan Democrats are fighting forward together and building a movement that will make history in 2020 and beyond! >>>

"We only need to flip 4 seats to flip the State House. Just 4.
What a week, team.
Not only are we halfway to our $25,000 goal for the Four to Flip fund, but we also just got word that Joe Biden will be visiting Michigan this Wednesday!
So today, our ask is simple: we're asking for just $4. No, that's not a typo! That's $1 for each seat Democrats need to flip to take back the State House and get our state moving forward again.
Can we count on you to pitch in $4 or more to help us win the four seats we need to Flip the State House this year? We're 52% of the way to our $25,000 goal, and your donation could be the one that puts us over the top.

Think of the possibilities once Governor Whitmer has a Democratic State House majority to work with. Equal access to quality education so everyone has a fair shot at success. An infrastructure investment that will fix the damn roads. And so much more.
But just four seats stand in our way, and the numbers are in our favor. So we're raising $25,000 by midnight tomorrow to help Democrats running in the closest State House races.
Will you make a donation of $4 or more to our Four to Flip Fund? Every dollar will be put to immediate use flipping the State House.
Thank you,

"Friend -
Michigan issues are America's issues. That's why I am honored to be giving tonight's Democratic response to the State of the Union address.
We know Donald Trump will do two things this evening: exaggerate his accomplishments and blame everyone else for his failures. He won't talk about the jobs that left Michigan because of his failed policies or his reckless decision to roll back EPA protections while PFAS poisons our drinking water. He won't mention his attacks on women's reproductive rights, bring up his lawsuit to overturn the ACA, or mention his plans to cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid if he gets a second term.
Stand with Michigan Democrats and hold Trump accountable for his broken promises to working families across Michigan >>>
Tonight, I will be talking about these issues and more, because Democrats in Michigan and across the country are focused on solutions that make a difference in people's lives, like fair wages and equal pay, a clean environment, reproductive rights, and affordable healthcare.
We need a Democrat in charge of the country to move us forward, and since we know the road to the White House runs through Michigan--we have the opportunity to make that happen. It starts by having a strong Michigan Democratic Party with an army of grassroots volunteers and organizers on the ground in every corner of the state all the way to Election Day.
That's why I wanted to ask you something important before I respond to Trump tonight: Can I count on you to join me in supporting the Michigan Democratic Party by making a contribution now toward victory in November?
Michigan Democrats made history up and down the ballot in 2018, and we will do it again in 2020--but only if you're with us all the way. Make an investment in winning Michigan and defeating Trump by chipping in $5, $10, or any amount you can afford today because when we stand together, we win together! >>>

CHIP IN $10 NOW
CHIP IN $25 NOW

It's time for our national conversation to go back to making this country work for everyone, and together, we can replace Trump's empty words and broken promises with action that will make the lives of our people better and America's future one of progress again.
Tonight, I will be responding to Donald Trump for all of us, and if you're with me, this November, he'll get the message.
Fighting Forward,
Gretchen Whitmer
Governor of Michigan

"BREAKING: Eric Trump and Mike Pence are both visiting Michigan this week.
Rush an urgent contribution of $5 or more to help us prepare for whatever attacks they have planned:
$5
$10
$25
It's clear the Trump campaign has made our state a top priority — but that comes as no surprise. After all, Michigan gave Trump and Pence the final electoral votes they needed to win the White House.
It's not just the White House, though — the Michigan GOP has decided to latch on to Trump's hateful, divisive agenda in the hopes of catching a down-ballot boost so their candidates can ride Trump's coattails. That's why they'll continue to attack Governor Gretchen Whitmer because if Democrats lose, Republicans' get to keep their majority intact.
There's no doubt Eric Trump and Mike Pence will raise some BIG money for Republicans while they're here, so we need your help to match their efforts. Which is why today, we're setting a 24-hour emergency goal of $100,000 ahead of our mid-month deadline.
Will you pitch in $10 or more before midnight tomorrow to help us respond to this round of Republican attacks on our candidates?

There's nothing that scares Republicans more than expanded access to the ballot box. That's because they know that their chances of holding majorities and picking up seats across the country are worse off if more people vote.
We're dedicated to fighting back against Republicans' disinformation campaign while running one of the most robust GOTV and voter protection operations our party has ever seen. But our success depends upon the urgent support of Democrats like you.

Friend -
I just want to say thank you. Because of you and our amazing supporters across Michigan, I'm incredibly proud to say that we didn't just hit our April fundraising goal, we smashed right through it.
That tells me people are ready to get to work now on getting rid of Donald Trump and Republicans at every level, and it should tell them their days are numbered. Why? Because Michigan Democrats are mobilized, you're with us, and we're just getting started--that's why.
We have seen a reckless few choose politics over public health, hatred over healing, and the darkness of division over the guiding light of leadership and solidarity. You are proof that hope outshines fear, unity drives out hate, and believing in each other and a better tomorrow is how we will bring an end to this crisis and this so-called president's reign of failure.
We know what it takes to win, and now it's up to us to get the job done. If you're with us--no matter who or what gets in our way--I know we will.
Thank you for your strength, resiliency, and all that you do.

"Over the next few days, we'll be sending information about casting your ballot. Click here to let us know if you've already voted.
Friend, the election is nearing, and we want to make sure you have all the information you need in order to cast your ballot.
Absentee ballots must be received by your city/township clerk by 8 PM on November 3 in order to be counted — postmarked by that date doesn’t work — and you must sign the outside envelope. The only way to ensure your ballot will count this close to the election is to drop it off at your city/township clerk’s office. Many clerks have drop boxes so you don’t have to go inside.
If you’re voting on Election Day, please wear a mask and observe social distancing at your polling place. Polls are open from 7 AM to 8 PM. You can also vote early at your city/township clerk's office until Monday, November 2 at 4 PM. Remember: if you are in line when polls close, stay in line until your vote is counted.
FIND YOUR CLERK & DROP BOX
CONFIRM YOUR POLLING PLACE
If you’re not registered to vote, it’s not too late! You can go into your clerk’s office any time they’re open between now and 8 PM on November 3 and register to vote. Remember to bring proof of residency.
As always, our Voter Protection team is standing by at 833-MI-VOTES (833-648-6837). Please call us anytime for guidance casting your vote from home.
Once you cast your vote, forward this to your friends and neighbors so they know how to vote safely too!

We know you've been hearing a lot about Election Day, but the truth is — this election has already begun. It's happening now, and every day from here until November 3rd. Take a minute to let that sink in.
Voters are receiving ballots in the mail and making decisions that will shape the future of our state and country for years to come. That's why it's so important that we reach voters now before they lock in their decision.
Earning people's votes takes time and resources — we need to be reaching out, person to person, right now, to make sure everyone makes their voice heard. Our window to do that is closing, so will you rush a contribution of $10 or more before our FEC deadline?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
DONATE $10
DONATE $25
DONATE $50
DONATE $100
DONATE $250
ANOTHER AMOUNT
Our job is to make sure every Michigan voter knows how to make their voice heard amid this unprecedented election. So the next two days before our FEC fundraising deadline will decide what kind of investments we can make in grassroots organizing to win big across the state in the final weeks.
We must secure the resources now to turn out as many voters as possible during the final stretch of this race. If you're able, please pitch in $10 or anything you can before our FEC deadline.
We don't have a lot of time left, and we've still got a lot of work to do. That's why we need you to step up — your donation will make the biggest impact right now.
Thank you,
Team MDP

Hello,
It’s not enough for Democrats to win the White House, we also have to win up and down the ballot. Not only do we have the chance to take back the U.S. Senate and expand the U.S. House majority, but we also can flip the State House and State Supreme Court!
That’s why I’m excited to lead a timely conversation with Lieutenant Governor Garlin Gilchrist, Senator Gary Peters, Mayor Mike Duggan, and other Democratic Party leaders and rising stars on our path to victory this November. Here are the details — RSVP now to secure your spot:

"Folks -
Legacy Dinner is more than an annual event\--it is a celebration of all that we have achieved as Michigan Democrats and a kickoff of the work that we will do together to win in November.
The road to the White House runs through Michigan, and our state is a must-win for Democrats if we are going to defeat Donald Trump.
No one understands that more than our special guest for this year's Legacy Dinner, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi. Speaker Pelosi is fighting to hold Trump accountable and leading the charge for Democrats, and we cannot wait to hear from her as we gear up for the most important election in our lifetimes.
We want you there too, because it's all on the line in 2020, and the only way we win is if we stand together all the way to November. Please join us on Friday, March 20 at the Lansing Center for MDP Legacy Dinner 2020 with special guest Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi!

CAN'T MAKE IT? DONATE →
Legacy Dinner is about connecting our fight for the future with the power of our past. It is also a crossroads between where we have been and the progress that lay before us--if we are united as Democrats.
Join us for this year's Legacy Dinner, and let's make it clear that Michigan Democrats are fighting forward together and building a movement that will make history in 2020 and beyond! >>>

Now, it's Kamala Harris' turn to take the debate stage. With the Vice Presidential Debate just hours away, we are working hard to keep up our momentum and ensure the Biden-Harris message continues to reach folks across the state.
Many Michiganders have already received their mail-in ballots, which means folks are casting their votes right now. To get Joe and Kamala's message out (and quickly!), we need to raise $15,000 in the next 24 hours. Chip in right here:

The other is Kamala Harris. Someone who has only ever worked in service to the people, and she will be able to lead our nation on day one.
But before she gets on the debate stage, we want to show Kamala we have her back by reaching our ambitious goal of $15,000 in the next 24 hours. Will you chip in $10 or whatever you can to help us get there?
The more we raise, the more people we can reach, and the more votes we can earn. That's why your donation matters so much — especially today.

"Folks –
Juneteenth is about the freedom of a people. On June 19th, 1865, all those enslaved in America were finally made free.
Every year since, it is celebrated by Black Americans as the day their freedom was finally made official. Which is exactly why Donald Trump tried to make it about him.
The people of Michigan and America deserve so much better!
As a dog-whistle to the racist portion of his dwindling base, Trump planned a campaign rally for June 19th in Tulsa, Oklahoma, where 99 years ago this month, Black residents and businesses were systematically targeted and attacked in the worst incident of racial violence in American history.
Trump’s rally was swiftly called out for what it was – a clear demonstration of hate meant to hurt a race of people and send a message to extremists that Trump is still their champion. In response to national pressure, the Trump campaign moved the rally – by one day.
One day doesn’t make a bit of difference in the face of 400 years worth of genocide and oppression. The American people have had enough, and we’re not backing down – EVER.
Thousands of our supporters in Michigan and across the country who are sick of the hate, tired of the division, and ready to move America forward – equally – for all us, are stepping up like never before, and together, we're taking the fight to Trump and taking back our future.
Chip in $5, $10, $25, or whatever you can afford to help us go on offense against Trump's attempts to divide us and turn his hate into the fuel that will lead Democrats to victory this November! >>>

The world called out his Tulsa rally for the act of desperation and division that it is and that defines Donald Trump. But the demonstration of hate meant to fire up his extremist base only served to unite Americans around a holiday that was previously only celebrated by those it freed.
Now, Juneteenth will be honored by even more of our fellow citizens for the sacred date it is and serve to remind us all that America will rise above and someday reach that mountain top so many could only dream about before.
Donald Trump's blatant act of bigotry backfired, and now we’re going on offense more united than ever to take back the White House and elect Michigan Democrats up and down the ballot! Are you with us?
Fighting Forward,

Folks -
Each month that passes brings us closer to what cannot be overstated is the most important election of our lifetimes. That's why every FEC end-of-month reporting deadline is critical to ensuring we have the resources necessary to fight every day between now and Election Day.
We know what we need to go toe-to-toe with Donald Trump and the right-wing, Republican propaganda machine already working over time to spread lies about Joe Biden, attack Senator Gary Peters, and distract from Trump's failed leadership and disastrous coronavirus response.
We know that standing together is the only path forward and winning Michigan is the way we can remove the main obstruction to our progress and the cause of our country's current suffering.
With just 427 contributions left to hit our April goal, we're reaching out to our top supporters to step up one more time before midnight tonight!
Every dollar counts, and if you can right now, making an investment of just $5, $10, $25, or any amount you can afford will help us continue the march toward Democratic victory this November! >>>

Folks -
Betsy DeVos has spent decades and millions of dollars attacking public education and teachers in Michigan and profiting off of student debt and for profit schools. Now, DeVos is using her position in the Trump administration to undermine education across the country at every level.
From proposing deep cuts to federal funding, making it harder to pay back student loans, and rolling back sexual assault protections on campuses to serving as a shill for the for-profit college industry and helping to defraud student borrowers, DeVos has done incredible harm to education in America and the futures of countless individuals and their families.
No more! She must be stopped before she can do even more damage to public education, our economy, and our children's futures.

Folks -
More than 400,000 Michiganders and over 10 million Americans have lost their jobs due to coronavirus--yet Donald Trump refuses to open the health care marketplace so working families can get the coverage they need during this unprecedented public health crisis.
It's time to make our voices heard, together and louder than ever, to ensure every voter in Michigan knows that this so-called president denied millions of Americans critical health protections in their hour of greatest need.
We're calling on Trump to end his efforts to sabotage the Affordable Care Act and immediately open the health care marketplace for special enrollment as the coronavirus pandemic continues to overwhelm America.

The record is clear: at every turn, Trump has fought to strip health care from 720,000 Michiganders in his relentless war on the ACA.
First, fighting to repeal the life-saving law in Congress and then going to court in hopes that the Supreme Court would strike it down. And now, as hundreds of thousands in Michigan lose their jobs and the health insurance that comes with it, Trump is blocking working families from getting the coverage and care they desperately need right now.
It's flat-out wrong, and if we continue fighting forward together, we'll save lives, our country, and our future when we send Trump packing this November and elect Democrats who will fight for health care!

"Hi friend,
It's hard to believe, but this election is fewer than 100 days away. Already, Trump has launched an eight-figure ad campaign in Michigan, and Trump himself talks about winning in our state every chance he gets.
Trump knows Michigan could decide control of the White House, so he's trying every trick in the book to rally his base here. Whether or not we have the grassroots strength to defeat Trump depends on your response right now.
This latest ad buy is just the tip of the iceberg, and we need to be ready for what comes next. Rush a donation of $10 or more to help us hold strong in Michigan, and stop Trump from winning our state again.

Now that Trump's campaign is preparing to flood the airwaves with millions in attack ads, it's only going to get more expensive to make our message heard. We need to be ready to hit every goal we have now or we'll risk getting drowned out by Trump's MAGA re-election machine.
While the GOP reaches out to its rolodex of right-wing mega-donors, we're relying on the grassroots support of people like you. That's why your donation matters so much right now as we close in on our critical end-of-month deadline.
If you're ready to prepare for this next phase of our campaign, will you chip in $10 or more before our critical end-of-month deadline?

"Friend,
Starting today, folks in Michigan are voting early in person and receiving their ballots by mail, which means we’re now officially in the last stage of the race.
Early voting has started amid a new threat yesterday from Donald Trump: that if he loses, there might not be a peaceful transfer of power. It’s more important now more than ever to not just win — but win big. We need our message to reach every last voter.
The final weeks of any election are tough, but this one will be unprecedented. We need all the help we can get to make sure our voters show up. Will you chip in $10 today to give us a much-needed boost before our critical FEC deadline?

ANOTHER AMOUNT
We all know that Trump can’t win the White House without Michigan, and we only have one shot at defeating him. We’re making every second count, and every contribution you pitch in helps us reach another undecided voter between now and when polls close on Election Night.
But big-money, special interest groups know that now is the time to make their final push in Michigan, so they’re blanketing the airwaves with attack ads against our candidates. Let’s show them we’re ready to fight back and win.
That’s where you come in, team. Can we count on you to chip in $10 today to help us turn out the early vote?
Thank you for all your help in this fight,

"SURVEY RESPONSE REQUESTED
Are you signed up to vote by mail in Michigan's 2020 Primary?
YES — I'm ready to vote!
NO — I'll vote in person early or on Election Day!
Folks,
The countdown to one of the most important elections in our lifetime has officially begun. That means we need to get every Democrat out to vote!
The good news is that it's now easier than ever to vote in Michigan. Thanks to historic election reforms, for the first time, all eligible voters can vote by mail — no excuse needed.
Remember, your city/township clerk must have your ballot in-hand by 8 PM on Tuesday for your vote to be counted. With only three days until the deadline, the best way to ensure your vote is counted is by returning your absentee ballot in person at a secure dropbox or your city/township clerk’s office.
If you haven't yet requested your absentee ballot, you still can do that in person and vote at the same time at your city/township clerk's office until Monday at 4 PM. But why wait? Clerks' offices are required to be open at least 8 hours this weekend.
If you have any other questions, please call MDP’s Voter Protection Hotline: 833-MI-VOTES (833-648-6837).
Our team is standing by to help ensure your vote is cast and counted.
Thanks for being a loyal voter,

"Folks –
Education is under attack by Betsy DeVos – AGAIN – and she’s not letting a pandemic get in the way of her crusade against public schools.
Congress allocated more than $13 billion worth of emergency funding to help America's schools deal with costs related to the coronavirus crisis, but it won't get there if Betsy gets her way.
That's because DeVos wants to reroute critical pandemic relief from public schools to pay for private school tuition and more so she can damage public education and profit from the pandemic at the same time.
Enough is enough! We’re sending Betsy DeVos a message that she won’t get away with stealing from our students and our schools on our watch!
If you believe that education is a right, not a privilege, and strong public schools are critical to America’s future, add your name to condemn Betsy DeVos and her continued attacks on public education!
CONDEMN DEVOS →
CONDEMN DEVOS →
DeVos mistakenly believes she can get away with attacking public schools and profiting from her position as Secretary of Education because her boss and this current so-called president agrees and wants to do the same.
Education in America is not for sale and the morally bankrupt duo of Betsy DeVos and Donald Trump must be stopped. Are you with us?
Make it clear where you stand: [[URL REDACTED]]
In this together,

"Hello,
We know you're about to log off for the weekend so we promise to keep this short!
We just pulled our fundraising numbers, and it looks like we're just a bit behind where we wanted to be for the first week of October. But if enough folks step up, we can get back on track in no time.
Will you pitch in $10 or whatever you can to close the gap on our weekly fundraising? We'll put your dollar to work right away reaching voters across Michigan.

In any other election season, we would have four more weeks to reach voters and prepare them for voting on Election Day. But we know this isn't a normal election season.
Voters throughout Michigan already have their mail-in ballots in hand, and we have to reach them quickly before they return them. Everything we do in these final weeks will be critical for leading Democrats to victory, so right now there is little room for error. That's why we're asking:
Will you chip in an urgent donation to get us back on track to reach our weekly goal? We have to finish these final weeks strong.
Let's bring it home.

"Hello,
FIRST: Trump sent Mike Pence to Michigan to try to shore up support after the Republican National Convention.
THEN: Trump tweeted he was leading in the polls in Michigan, making this a single-digit race.
NOW: We need to mount a major response immediately to fight back and make sure Trump doesn't win Michigan again. But there are only two days left until our end-of-month fundraising deadline, and we're still $7,893 short of our goal.
With election experts predicting Michigan could decide control of the White House, Trump isn't taking any chances. He'll do everything he can to keep his grip on power, so we need to fight back and fast.
Rush an urgent donation to help stop Republicans from flipping Michigan red before our critical end-of-month deadline. Anything you chip in will make a difference in a battleground state like ours.

Folks –
FIRST: Right-wing protesters incited by Donald Trump and organized by Betsy DeVos gathered for an armed demonstration at the Capitol, blocking emergency vehicles and endangering the lives of 10 million Michiganders.
THEN: Militant fringe groups called for violence and another armed rally at the Capitol, with yesterday's extremist demonstration descending into chaos and violence. Fights broke out in a sea of hate symbols and Trump signs with law enforcement officers forced to rush into the dangerous fray.
NOW: It's time for Michigan's silent majority to be heard, including all those who know the only way to end this pandemic is by staying the course and remaining united.
Governor Whitmer cannot win this fight alone. We need to have her back. If you're with us, chip in $5, $10, $25, or any amount, and together, we can defeat the hate, stop the virus, and move Michigan forward for everyone >>>

"Friend, the right-wing effort to recall Governor Gretchen Whitmer is accelerating.
Not only are Republicans trying to kick Governor Whitmer out of office for taking swift action to save lives — they're also wasting $542,000 in taxpayer dollars challenging her executive orders in court.
This is a power grab, plain and simple. And we need your help to stop it. Will you pitch in $10 now to help our candidates beat the GOP incumbents in the State House, who are undermining Governor Whitmer at every turn?

Now, those same right-wing legislators claim they have enough signatures to strip Governor Whitmer of key powers. But because of procedural hurdles, the process could stretch into 2021.
That means if we flip the State House from red to blue this fall, Democrats could stop this shameful power-grab in its tracks. We're just four seats away from taking back the State House majority, but we can't do it without your support.

Our job today is simple: Make sure Joe Biden's closing message cuts through the noise. It is crucial that we respond with a surge of Democratic energy.

Republicans know the easier it is for people to vote, the harder it is for them to hold power. They'll do and spend whatever it takes to disenfranchise Michigan voters, especially those in Black and Brown communities.
We can't fight back without investments from grassroots supporters like you. If each person on this team pitches in, we can all wake up on Election Day knowing that we turned out as many voters as possible by training volunteers and fighting Republican voter suppression tactics.
With our primary less than a week away, we're counting on grassroots supporters to step up and chip in $10 or more toward our Voter Protection programs. We can’t let Trump and his GOP allies suppress voters when so much is on the line.

"Hello,
We knew things were going to heat up in October, but we didn't know exactly how much until today. No question about it — October will be a critical month, and we'll need your support in these final few weeks. Give us a chance to briefly explain why.
We've officially reached the final sprint to Election Day, which is why Joe Biden was in Grand Rapids safely campaigning today. As the state that Trump won by the slimmest margin in 2016, Michigan is at the center of determining who our next president will be.
If you have been waiting for the right moment to get involved, now is the time. This fight will require each and every one of you to win the White House, take back the U.S. Senate, hold the U.S. House, and flip the State House and State Supreme Court.
Will you join this fight right now by chipping in $10 or more? Chip in right here to help fund our get out the vote efforts and win this race:

Every single thing we do in these final weeks will make a difference in the handful of votes that will decide this election. We're working around the clock to reach undecided voters and make sure everyone can cast their ballot.
But that takes resources, which is why we're coming to you: Will you pitch in a few dollars to help us reach undecided voters in these final weeks?
Thanks for pitching in today to start this month off strong.

"Folks, this is big.
Trump’s campaign just reserved $95 million worth of TV ads in key swing states across the country, and that includes Michigan — a state he won by exactly 10,704 votes in 2016!
With Election Day only four months away, we know this onslaught of cash will only ramp up from here on out. Trump’s MAGA re-election machine can have all the money in the world, but the outcome of this race will come down to which team works the hardest — and we sure as heck won’t be outworked.
That’s why we set a goal of raising $10,000 in grassroots donations before our weekly fundraising deadline tomorrow at midnight. As of 2 PM today, it looks like we’re not going to reach our goal.
But if everyone reading this message chips in just $10, we’d get back on track in no time. That’s all it would take.

From Monroe to Marquette, Detroit to Grand Rapids, and everywhere in between, Michigan Democrats are fired up and laser-focused on the road ahead.
Our team is laying the groundwork to win, no matter who or what gets in our way! We're taking on the extremists who spread misinformation and stoke hate, and we're calling out Betsy DeVos and the Republicans who use fear to divide us.
While Donald Trump attacks our democracy with baseless, bizarre claims and outright lies about voting by mail, we're making sure voters in our state can protect their health and still make their voices heard!
Michigan Democrats are united and ready to meet every challenge, continue our momentum, and do whatever it takes to win back the White House and elect our candidates up and down the ballot in 2020!
We're connecting with voters online, growing our grassroots digital army, phone-banking to every county in the state, and holding virtual trainings with our volunteers across Michigan—because we're not backing down, and we're not taking our foot off the gas for one moment.
Thanks to our dedicated and fired up supporters like you, we're headed in the right direction. If we stay united and continue fighting forward, the road ahead will lead us to victory and a better tomorrow for us all!
Thank you for standing with us and all that you do.

* We expect record-breaking early voting numbers as many voters have already cast their ballots.
* Kamala Harris is in town today and Donald Trump will return to Michigan on Tuesday.
* In a few days, we'll close the books on our final fundraising deadline of this election. What we raise these next few days will determine whether or not we have enough resources to ensure Trump doesn't win Michigan again.

"Hello,
We have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to deliver historic Democratic victories up and down the ballot this election, and experts say flipping the White House and the Senate will all come down to winning Michigan.
But winning here won't be easy, it's going to take a big team and we can't do it without you. Will you join Chair Lavora Barnes, Lieutenant Governor Garlin Gilchrist, Senator Gary Peters, Congresswoman Elissa Slotkin, Mayor Mike Duggan, and other Democratic leaders for a virtual fundraiser this Wednesday at 7 PM?

All eyes are going to be on Michigan, and we're counting on your help. Together, we can defeat Donald Trump, end Mitch McConnell's grasp on power, and give Governor Whitmer a State House majority to work with.

"Hello,
I am deeply saddened by the profound loss America experienced last night. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the second woman to ever serve on the U.S. Supreme Court, leaves a country changed because of her life's work of creating opportunity within a legal system that failed to recognize equality for many, including herself.
Despite graduating law school the first in her class, none of the New York City law firms offered her a job. Justice Ginsburg said that there were three strikes against her: she was a woman, she was a mother, and she was a Jew. It was her personal experience with that unequal system that led her to take up the legal charge to advance gender equality, helping pave the way for generations of women to pursue their dreams.
Let’s take the time to mourn and to heal from this loss. But then let’s all rise for the fight of our lifetimes. We have to be laser-focused on what’s at stake here — in more tangible ways than ever before.
The Affordable Care Act and protections for millions of Americans with pre-existing conditions. Safe and legal abortion. The status of Dreamers. These are just a few of the critical things that now hang in the balance.
Within hours of her passing, Mitch McConnell was already plotting to stack the court: ""Trump's nominee will receive a vote on the floor of the United States Senate."" We cannot let that happen. Trust me when I say that the coming weeks will determine the direction of our country, and the soul of our nation, for decades to come.
May Justice Ginsburg's memory be a blessing and an inspiration to carry on her legacy.

"Folks -
The Trump-GOP propaganda machine has turned social media into a minefield of misinformation and hate, using right-wing groups funded by Betsy DeVos and extremists like the Michigan Militia to do their dirty work.
The dangerous demonstrations taking place across the country are the insidious result of a coordinated effort between Republican operatives and far-right fringe groups organized online and hell-bent on spreading lies, attacking Governor Whitmer, and distracting from Trump's failure to lead.
Democrats across Michigan and throughout the country are answering the call and stepping up in numbers like never before. That's why every gift you make right now will be 2X MATCHED to double your impact!
Help us build the MDP Digital War Chest to combat the lies, counter the hate, and stand with Gov. Whitmer as we fight forward together for the health of our people and the future of our state! Are you with us?

Through the scope of their extremist, right-wing agenda, state and national Republicans see Gov. Whitmer's leadership during this health crisis as a threat even greater than the virus itself.
That's because their number one priority is not progress, public health, or serving the people. The top priority for Republicans is staying in power--plain and simple--to make sure their interests always come first.
With more so-called ""protests"" planned in Lansing and elsewhere, we need your help to speak up for the silent majority who are united in doing what it takes to stop coronavirus, save lives, and get our state up and running again for the long-term! >>>

The results from yesterday's primary election are in — now the race to November begins!
Now that the primary is behind us, we're entering one of the most critical periods we will ever have on this campaign. The first mail-in votes of the general election will be cast in just a few weeks. From there, we have only a little more time to reach as many voters as possible. So, we’re turning to you:

At this point in 2016, Democrats were also up in the polls, and we all know how that ended. We can't leave any county or precinct up to chance because we only have one shot to get this right.
That’s why we've spent the past few years building a grassroots movement strong enough to defeat Trump. But scaling a campaign takes significant resources, and grassroots donations are the only way we move this campaign forward.
Will you step up with a grassroots donation of $10 or more? Your support today will help ensure we are able to carry out the plans and programs we’ve worked so hard to build.
We’ve got a lot of work to do, but with the support of this remarkable grassroots team, we can power this campaign to victory for Democrats up and down the ballot.

Folks -
Here are the House Democrats working hard in Congress to get things done for Michigan: Debbie Dingell. Dan Kildee. Brenda Lawrence. Andy Levin. Elissa Slotkin. Haley Stevens. Rashida Tlaib.
Here are just a few of the bills House Democrats have passed that have been BLOCKED by Mitch McConnell:
•The Lower Drug Costs Now Act to provide relief for individuals and families who struggle to afford the cost of life-saving medication.
•The Voting Rights Advancement Act to restore key provisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.
•The SHIELD Act to better protect our elections from foreign interference.
•The Raise the Wage Act to raise the federal minimum wage to $15/hour.
•The American Dream and Promise Act to provide hardworking immigrants a much deserved pathway to citizenship.
•The Equality Act to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.
•The Climate Action Now Act.
•Legislation to reauthorize and expand the Violence Against Women Act, require background checks for all gun sales, and help close the gender pay gap, as well as historic anti-corruption reform.
Mitch McConnell is the one man currently standing in the way of these bills getting a vote in the Senate.
Moscow Mitch proudly calls himself ""the Grim Reaper"" because under his leadership the Senate has become a graveyard for good legislation. Democrats in Congress are doing their jobs, and it's time Mitch McConnell do his instead of continuing to block critical legislation and serving as Trump's agent in the Senate.

[4X MATCH ACTIVATED]
Folks –
Michigan Republicans have turned our legislature into a clearing house of corporate greed and a forum for hate and division. The armed occupation of our Capitol by right-wing extremists was a political stunt allowed by the GOP majority that controls the legislature.
Whether it's dangerous political sideshows or wasting the taxpayers' time and dime on frivolous lawsuits, Michigan Republicans have made it clear they will always put politics and their interests over our state and our future.
If you're as outraged as we are watching Republicans stoke hate and play politics with public health, help Michigan Democrats win the FOUR seats we need to take back the majority and end their extremist agenda!
Every dollar gets us one step closer to a Democratic majority—and for the next 48 HOURS, every contribution will be 4X MATCHED!
Chip in $5, $10, $25, or whatever you can afford today and make FOUR times the difference in our efforts to take back the House in 2020! >>>

Mike Pence is on his way to my hometown of Traverse City right now, and we're reaching out because we need to be ready for any false attacks that are sure to come our way.
My husband Pete and I have had a front row seat to Pence's transition from attacking LGBTQ rights as Indiana's Governor to partnering with Donald Trump to do the same across our country. We need to stop him.
That's why I'm counting on you to rush a contribution of $10 or more to fight back against whatever Pence has planned during his visit to Michigan.

No matter what Pence says today, we know the truth. When our auto workers' backs were against the wall, Trump said: ""You could have let [the industry] go bankrupt.""
When our farmers were bearing the brunt of the Trump-Pence trade war, this administration called them ""whiners.""
When our state still desperately needs federal support to combat this pandemic, Pence has failed in his role as the Chair of the Coronavirus Task Force.
And when the LGBTQ community needs protections against discrimination and expanded access to health care, Pence has tried to restrict it.
If it weren't for President Obama and Vice President Biden, Michigan would have lost hundreds of thousands of good-paying jobs. Michiganders like me will never forget that, but Trump will spend millions to convince voters otherwise and we need your help to fight back.
Chip in an urgent contribution of $10 or more to help us send a strong message to Pence that this grassroots team won't let Republicans win Michigan again.

It's not enough just to fight back--it's time to fight forward.
We have to go on the offensive as Donald Trump and Republicans target Democrats in Michigan with blatant lies and vicious political attacks.
It's up to us to have their backs AND hit back--whether it's the barrage of dishonest and deceptive ads against representatives like Elissa Slotkin and Haley Stevens, the constant flow of misinformation and propaganda coming from organizations like the RNC, or Trump's cowardly and despicable remarks about our current and past members of Congress.
We just can't let them get away with it--especially not if we want to win and get rid of them for good.

Hey, Folks –
I’m Kiara, and I’ve been organizing with the Michigan Democrats in Flint since 2018. It’s my job to recruit volunteers and help get out the vote to elect leaders who will protect our access to health care, create jobs in our state and improve the lives of millions in Michigan and across the country.
Right now, there are dozens of field organizers just like me being trained to do this work here in our must-win battleground state. The path to victory at all levels this year -- from winning the White House to flipping the Senate to protecting our majority in the US House -- runs directly through Michigan.
That’s why I’m reaching out today -- can you sign up to make calls with me and our newest organizers to make sure Michigan goes blue this year? Volunteering with the One Campaign for Michigan is the best way to ensure that we kick Donald Trump out of the White House, re-elect Senator Gary Peters and elect Democrats up and down the ballot -- click here to sign up!
SIGN UP TO VOLUNTEER →
In 2018, Michigan Democrats saw huge victories when we elected Gretchen Whitmer, sent Debbie Stabenow back to the Senate and elected a slate of statewide Democrats to help move Michigan forward -- not to mention securing a Democratic majority in the State House!
Now, the only way to make sure Michigan stays blue in 2020 is to get supporters like you to join our grassroots movement to help contact voters. We’d love to have you on the team! Here’s your link to sign up: [[URL REDACTED]]

"Don't let Michigan families lose their coverage...
Friend –
680,000 people got access to healthcare with the Medicaid expansion. But in 2018, Republicans in the state legislature passed a bill to impose more hoops for people in our communities struggling to get by to jump through. Recently, a judge appointed by President Reagan declared these requirements as inconsistent with Medicaid's purpose of helping the poor. Other cases are still pending.
Unless action is taken, this law will take effect on Monday, March 2nd. Governor Whitmer is working hard to keep Michigan families on their Healthy Michigan Plan and stop the work requirements from taking effect. View the MLive article here.
Use the sample letter below and contact your legislator today: tell them to pass HB 5271 and protect Medicaid for those who need it!
Sample Letter
Dear Legislator,
More than 680,000 Michiganders now have access to quality, affordable health care services with Medicaid expansion through Healthy Michigan. But in 2018, legislators passed a bill imposing work requirements on eligibility for coverage. Without a court order or legislative action, MDHHS will have to send letters beginning on March 10 to an estimated 80,000 people telling them they are at risk of losing their health care coverage.
Recently, a federal judge appointed by President Reagan declared work requirements as inconsistent with Medicaid's purpose of helping the poor. Other cases are still pending.
It is just a matter of time until Michigan’s work requirements are no longer enforceable. Given that, the State would be throwing away taxpayer money to enforce the requirements and causing confusion and concern for thousands upon thousands of Michiganders. I urge you to repeal these work requirements by passing House Bill 5271.
Thank you for helping us fight to protect Michigan families.
Sincerely,
Lavora Barnes

Paul Begala here. I’m thrilled to join Lavora Barnes for a virtual grassroots fundraiser on Tuesday, September 15 at 7 PM — and we’re excited to have the chance to answer your questions directly.
I’ve been working in Democratic politics for a long time now, so if there’s one thing I know, it’s how important Michigan is to the electoral map. We won Michigan in 1992 running President Clinton’s campaign. And we know we have what it takes to win again this November.
RSVP
Our conversation next week is a special opportunity to talk about what’s at stake this November, friend, and how each of us can step up and do our part this election.
Chip in to secure your spot and if you become a host you’ll receive a signed copy of my new book, You're Fired: The Perfect Guide to Beating Donald Trump.

Above all else, the Democratic Party stands for equality in all its forms, but it is no longer enough to simply believe we are all equal when our perception so clearly does not match reality for Black Americans.
If all that makes America great does not apply to all of us then what is the point? The point is that it's on us.
It is our responsibility to speak out and put our ideals into action. It is on to us to stand up for each other whether it directly affects us or not.
It is up to us to speak so loudly that the truth and America’s founding promise – that we are all created equal – finally becomes our reality.
That means YOU! It’s time to show our strength in numbers is only matched by the conviction of our beliefs and the steadfastness of our resolve. The time for silence is over.
We need every Democrat everywhere – here in Michigan and across the country – united, active, and working together. Sign now and pledge to stand with Michigan Democrats to lift up Black voices, combat voter suppression, and turn the struggle before us into a better tomorrow for all! >>>

"Donald Trump outright declared, ""We want to terminate health care under Obamacare.""
Folks –
720,000. That's how many Michiganders rely on the Affordable Care Act for health care, along with millions more who depend on its protections.
But yesterday, in the middle of global pandemic, Donald Trump outright declared, “We want to terminate health care under Obamacare.”
Trump's renewed vow to ""terminate health care"" for working families across our state only confirms what we already know: this so-called president is dead set on eliminating Michigan's critical Medicaid expansion and gutting protections for people with pre-existing conditions.
Michiganders can’t afford four more years of a president who fights every day to strip them of their health care!

"Over the next two days, we'll be sending information about casting your ballot. Click here to let us know if you've already voted.
Have you seen the news, friend? Michiganders are breaking records when it comes to early voter turnout. The entire state is already halfway to surpassing the number of ballots cast in 2016's ENTIRE election cycle. And our early vote period doesn't end until tomorrow at 4 PM!
Are you one of the millions of Michiganders who's already voted? If not, what are you waiting for? Here’s everything you need to know to make your voice heard this election:
If you’re voting early in person, make a plan and follow through with it. Make sure you know where your clerk’s office is and when it closes each day. Early voting ends at 4 PM on November 2.
FIND YOUR CLERK & DROP BOX
If you’re voting by mail, don’t risk mailing it back. Remember, your clerk must have your ballot in-hand by 8 PM on Election Day for your vote to be counted. With just two days until the deadline, the safest way to ensure your vote is counted is by returning it in person at your city/township clerk or drop box.
TRACK YOUR BALLOT STATUS
If you’re voting in person on Election Day, confirm your polling place. Polls open at 7 AM and close at 8 PM on Election Day.
CONFIRM YOUR POLLING PLACE
If you’re not registered to vote, it’s not too late! You can go into your clerk’s office any time they’re open between now and 8 PM on Election Day and register to vote. Remember to bring proof of residency.
If you or anyone you know has questions about voting, call us at our Voter Assistance Hotline: 1-833-MI-VOTES (833-648-6837). Our team is standing by to help ensure your vote is cast and counted.

As we kick off a new month, we wanted to take a moment to express our gratitude for your support in August.
When Mike Pence returned to Michigan, we asked you to step up and rush a contribution so we could counter the GOP's avalanche of outside cash, and you delivered. Big time. But the truth is, our job is far from over.
After Trump announced on Twitter that he was leading in the polls in Michigan, it's no surprise that this week he decided to send his daughter Ivanka to shore up his right-wing base.
We didn't expect to receive another visit from the Trump campaign so soon, which means we need your help to prepare. Rush a donation before Ivanka arrives tomorrow to help us stop Trump's plan to flip Michigan red:

It's clear that the White House is taking Michigan very seriously. Republicans aren't just bringing in the big guns, they're bringing in the big bucks, too. Every time someone from the Trump campaign visits, we see a huge spike in their fundraising numbers.
We can't let Trump gain steam, so we need to collect as many grassroots donations as possible from people like you. Can we rely on you to make an urgent donation of $10 or more before Ivanka touches down in Michigan tomorrow?
We only have 63 days to make our work count, and immediately prepare for whatever the Trump campaign has planned for us, starting with Ivanka's visit this week.

"We all know Donald Trump has to go, but if there is one man who is doing as much harm to our country, it's Senator Mitch McConnell.
Folks -
We all know Donald Trump has to go, but if there is one man who is doing as much harm to our country, it's Senator Mitch McConnell. And just because he's down in Kentucky, does not mean we are immune from the damage he is doing.
The bad news for Moscow Mitch is that Michigan can fight back! That starts with re-electing Senator Gary Peters and putting Democrats in position to take back the majority.
Make no mistake, Republicans are targeting our Senate seat, and it's going to take a strong Michigan Democratic Party to have Gary's back and go toe-to-toe with the GOP all the way to November. Chip in now to help us re-elect Senator Peters, flip the Senate, and send McConnell back to the minority where he belongs!
CHIP IN $5 →
CHIP IN $25 →
CHIP IN $50 →
CHIP IN $100 →
OTHER AMOUNT →
Republican super PACS are already flooding Michigan with aggressive ads and misinformation online about Senator Peters, and we need to have his back all the way.
Even just a few dollars now will help us immediately counter the GOP propaganda and get the facts out about the hard work Senator Peters and Democrats are doing for Michigan.
Chip in $10, $25, or whatever amount you can afford right now to help us get the job done for Senator Peters and get Mitch McConnell out of the way of progress this November >>>
CHIP IN $5 →
CHIP IN $25 →
CHIP IN $50 →
We have an opportunity to make a difference for our state and the entire country on Election Day. Together, let's re-elect Gary Peters and put Democrats in position to flip the Senate and finally ditch Mitch McConnell for good.
Fighting Forward,
Team MDP

"Hello,
In just a moment, I'm going to ask you to make a contribution to the Michigan Democratic Party. I hope you'll give me a chance to explain why it's so important for you to chip in, especially this week.
Every quarter, campaigns like mine and the MDP's have to file our contributions with the Federal Election Commission (FEC), and after that, they go public. Then, everyone — from the media to our opponents — can see just how much money we've raised, and how many people have chipped in to help Democrats win.
How much the MDP raises at this deadline could determine whether they have the resources it takes to reach undecided voters and fund their get out the vote operation.
Look, I believe in the organizing program Michigan Democrats are building, through the One Campaign, to fight back. Their work was a major part of our statewide victories in 2018, and it's how we will win up and down the ballot in November. But we'll need your help.
Will you join me in supporting the Michigan Democratic Party by chipping in $5, $10, or whatever you can afford before their major FEC deadline on Wednesday? Anything you can give will go a long way to help build a winning organization to defeat Donald Trump and the GOP this year. Let's flip Michigan back:

"Folks –
Make no mistake, the future of reproductive rights will be decided in this election.
Just last month, the Supreme Court delivered a massive 5-4 decision striking down a Louisiana abortion law designed by right-wing politicians to limit a woman’s access to reproductive healthcare.
While it was a critical win in the fight to protect Roe v. Wade, the key number is 5-4. That’s one vote.
One vote to determine whether the right to choose remains intact or pro-life extremists get a step closer to taking us back to a time when the line between reproductive healthcare and back-alley abortions was decided by a woman’s income, race, religion, family, or a man.
Will you let someone else make that decision for you? Or will you join us in fighting to elect Democrats who will protect abortion rights and take a stand against Republicans trying to stack the courts under Trump with extremist judges so they can roll back our rights later?
We need everyone with us to finally end the attack on abortion!
Chip in $5, $10, $25, or any amount now to help us take back the White House, flip the Senate, and put Democrats in power to appoint judges who will protect Roe v. Wade and defend women’s reproductive rights!

We, as one people, can decide that future, but only if we are united. If you're with us, we will win this fight together.

"Team — Tonight, Donald Trump will accept the Republican nomination for president. Then tomorrow, Mike Pence will arrive in Michigan.
He's not coming with a plan to contain COVID-19 or to grieve with the families who have lost loved ones. He's not coming to stand with frontline workers and assure them our economy will recover. He's coming to Michigan because we have the potential to determine who wins the presidency again.
That's why we've set a goal of 10,000 grassroots donations before Pence arrives. Will you rush an urgent donation to help us hit this critical goal?

Wherever Trump or Pence goes, dark money follows. There's no doubt this event will bring in a lot of big checks, so we are hoping to counter this flood of outside cash with a surge of grassroots support.
Will you step up with an urgent donation of $10 or more right now? Our state is Democrats' best opportunity to flip the White House, and we cannot let Trump take that away from us.
We have what it takes to win against the GOP money machine. All we ask is that we roll up our sleeves and dig a little deeper before Pence arrives and ahead of our big end-of-month deadline.

"Folks,
Goals matter. Especially during winning time, which is every minute between now and November 3. Next up is our January fundraising goal, and we are so close.
We have Democrats willing to 400% match the next 1OO donations to help build Michigan's 2020 grassroots army! We need all 1OO if we want to beat Trump, re-elect Senator Gary Peters, and pick up even more seats in Congress, the State House, and local offices throughout the state.
If you chip in today, we'll be able to keep fighting for working families and an economy that works for everyone. We'll be able to keep pushing for a better environment and clean air and water for every Michigander. And with your help, we'll generate support for crucial infrastructure investments so that Michigan has the high-quality roads and bridges you deserve.
But folks, we can't do any of it if we fall behind. And we can't do it without EVERYONE on the team, especially YOU.
We need all hands on deck to beat this deadline and reach our goal! Do your part and chip in any amount right now for a limited time 4X MATCH so together, we can build a better Michigan >>>
400% MATCH: $5 NOW →
400% MATCH: $25 NOW →
400% MATCH: $55 NOW →
400% MATCH: $100 NOW →

Step up today to support a better economy, affordable prescription drugs, a cleaner environment, well-built roads and bridges, and above all, winning to get it all done and more. The alternative is a world we don't want to live in, and every day Trump and Republicans are in control, we take one step closer to that reality.
Chip in now for a 400% MATCH! Tomorrow will be too late if we're going to stay on track!
Together, we'll get the job done in November, as long as we do the work now. Thank you for all that you have done and all that you are about to do.
Fighting Forward,

"Folks –
If we want to move our state and country forward, beyond the roots of hate holding us back, Democrats must win everything—and the time is now.
We have a chance to change everything for the better in 2020, and that includes an opportunity to win the TWO seats we need for a progressive majority on Michigan’s State Supreme Court.
Chief Justice Bridget Mary McCormack and Elizabeth Welch are the women who are going to get it done—and we're going to have their backs all the way!
Chief Justice Bridget Mary McCormack is running for re-election to the State Supreme Court. Serving since January 2013, she has earned the support of Michigan voters and the respect of her colleagues, who selected her to lead the court as Chief Justice. Chief Justice McCormack has promoted statewide initiatives devoted to improving the courts’ service to the public, increasing community engagement, and fulfilling the promise that our courts will remain independent, efficient, and accessible.
Elizabeth Welch is seeking her first term on the State Supreme Court. With over 25 years of legal experience fighting for Michigan and her community, Welch has served as Vice President of the East Grand Rapids Public Schools Board of Education, President of the Michigan League of Conservation Voters, and President of the Women Lawyers Association of Michigan–Western Region.
It is more obvious than ever that who we elect to the bench matters. Chief Justice McCormack and Elizabeth Welch bring the skill, experience, passion, and constitutional knowledge needed now more than ever.
That’s why we need everyone helping us get the word out across Michigan: If we want Democrats to take the Supreme Court and our state back, make sure you vote for both Welch and McCormack!
We've made huge strides in just a few years, but we know it’s not enough to hold one office or have the majority in just one chamber. Those who seek to hold us down and take America backward will use every ounce of power at their disposal to maintain the status quo.
That's why we're fighting forward like never before! This election year, we’re going to finish the job so we can stop fighting the evils of the past and finally start building on the promise of a better future.
Our democracy, justice, and real progress for our state depend on it!
Thank you for your strength, commitment, and vigilance during these trying times. We are truly in this together, and if we do our jobs, we're going to win together this November. Click below to learn how you can do your part!
For Justice,

"Folks –
Three words: follow the money. It’s really that simple when it comes to campaigns and Michigan Republicans, and it usually all comes from just one source: Betsy DeVos.
Senator Gary Peters has stood strong for our students and state by fiercely opposing the DeVos anti-public education agenda. DeVos, in response, has already flooded Michigan with more than $1 million worth of misleading ads and baseless political attacks.
Individually, we can’t match Betsy’s billions, but together, we're going toe-to-toe on the ground all the way to Election Day to re-elect Gary Peters and put Democrats back in the majority to stop DeVos for good!
Can we count on you? Chip in $5, $10, $25, or any amount to stand with Gary, stop DeVos, and help us counter the lies and attacks with facts about Senator Peters' strong record of fighting for Michigan! >>>

These next six weeks will go by faster than we realize, and we've still got plenty to do to reach undecided voters before they start casting their ballots. And not only that, but Kamala Harris is in Detroit and Flint today so we need to spread the word about her visit.

Look, it's no coincidence that Ivanka is in Michigan just as the polls start to tighten — and we know it's only a matter of time before Trump himself pays us a visit, too.
Ivanka's visit undoubtedly will give Republicans a boost, and we can't let them walk away with a fundraising edge. Can you add a grassroots donation of whatever you can to counter the GOP's flood of outside cash?
So long as grassroots supporters like you continue pitching in what you can when you can, we'll be able to handle anything the Republicans throw at us in the final two months of this election.

Republicans know the easier it is for people to vote, the harder it is for them to hold power. They'll do and spend whatever it takes to disenfranchise Michigan voters, especially those in Black and Brown communities.
We can't fight back without investments from grassroots supporters like you. If each person on this team pitches in, we can all wake up on Election Day knowing that we turned out as many voters as possible by training volunteers and fighting Republican voter suppression tactics.
With our primary less than a week away, we're counting on grassroots supporters to step up and chip in $10 or more toward our Voter Protection programs. We can’t let Trump and his GOP allies suppress voters when so much is on the line.
Thanks for protecting the right to vote,

"Did you hear the news, team?
Donald Trump announced he wants to hold a big rally in Michigan. Trump has to win Michigan if he wants any shot at a second term — so there’s no doubt in our minds he’ll be paying us a visit.
Rallies are a key part of Trump’s campaign strategy, and he’s willing to endanger lives to save his re-election chances. He’s pulling out all the stops to make sure of it, flooding our state with eight-figure ad buys and millions of dollars in special interest cash. That’s why we’re asking:
Will you rush a donation of $10 or more to help us prepare for a possible Trump visit? If we let our guard down, Trump could squeak by again and win our state.

In 2016, Trump became the first Republican to win Michigan since 1988. He won our state by exactly 10,704 votes — that’s about two votes per precinct, which makes us Trump’s TOP target this year.
That’s why it’s incredibly important that we report the strongest numbers possible.
Rush an urgent donation of $10 or more to build a winning movement in Michigan.
Thank you,

LANSING– The Michigan Democratic Party released the following statement on behalf of Chair Lavora Barnes on proactive, preventative measures the Party is taking to combat the spread of COVID-19.
“Due to public health concerns, I am regretfully announcing the postponement of the Michigan Democratic Party’s annual Legacy Dinner scheduled for March 20th. I will also call an emergency State Central Committee telephonic meeting for tomorrow night to ask the Committee to cancel the Michigan Democratic Party’s March 21st convention.
“While there have been no reports of a COVID-19 infection among potential attendees to either event, the Michigan Democratic Party takes seriously the concerns of public health professionals and Governor Gretchen Whitmer who has declared a state of emergency and advised against such gatherings.”

Did you hear what Michelle Obama said about Michigan, friend?
Trump won Michigan by exactly 10,704 votes — that's two votes per precinct. So last night, Michelle issued an urgent, powerful call of action to get out and vote for Joe Biden like our lives depend on it — because they do.
She's absolutely right, team — with everything that's at stake, no one can sit this election out. We simply can't afford four more years of Trump's failed leadership. We need to keep doing everything we can to elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to unite this nation and lead us forward — that starts with ensuring we have the resources to fight for every last vote.
Will you answer Michelle Obama's call to action? If you're as fired up as we are, show your support by chipping in $10 or more to carry Michigan to victory.

The only way we will win in November is if Democrats turn out in record numbers. We have a plan to reach voters across the state, but that requires a tremendous amount of resources. That's why we're turning to you:
Will you pitch in $10 so that we can spread accurate, reliable information about voting in the era of COVID-19 and help flip Michigan blue?
This is the most important investment we can make to win this election — and it's thanks to grassroots supporters like you pitching in what you can, when you can.
Let's win this thing,

"Anything you give now will go a long way.
Folks — we’re facing one of the most consequential elections of our lifetime, and Michigan is right in the center of it.
Michigan ended up giving Trump the last electoral votes he needed to secure the White House in 2016, and he’s hoping we’ll hand him a second term this year. We must do everything in our power to ensure that doesn’t happen again.
July is an important month for us, as we continue building the resources we need to reach voters across the state. Tomorrow marks 100 days from Election Day, so we’re counting on you to chip in $10 to hit our $100,000 goal.

There’s a lot of pressure on us to succeed because Democrats have virtually no chance of taking back the White House OR the Senate if we lose in Michigan.
Our movement has always been about grassroots strength, but now we have to prove the momentum is still on our side. Everyone from Trump’s campaign to Betsy DeVos’ super PAC and the media is scrutinizing our movement and looking at our fundraising numbers to see if this team has what it takes to flip Michigan blue.
We’ve got a plan to win in Michigan, and the next 100 days are about putting that plan into action — but we’ll need your help to do it.
Let’s show the country that Michigan is strong and ready to fight back. Will you chip in today to be one of the 1,000 donors we need to hit our donation goal by tomorrow at midnight?

All of this is coming at a very busy time. Kamala Harris will be in town tomorrow. We have a major FEC deadline coming up next week. And we expect a historic number of people to vote early in this election, which means control of the White House and Senate could be decided in the next few weeks.
With voting nearly underway, the end of the campaign is in sight — but we need to invest now to make sure we finish strong. This is the final sprint that we've spent years preparing for — and every moment from here on out counts.
With your donation of $10 or more, we can mobilize Democrats across Michigan to get out and vote early. Every dollar counts in these final six weeks.

"Folks –
Words matter. Words can define or divide. Word can damage and words can become action that changes the narrative and the course of history.
Donald Trump’s own words have clearly defined him – HE is a racist – and no reasonable individual would argue any longer that it’s open to debate.
Trump’s words are meant to divide us and distract from the promises HE broke. His words have damaged America’s standing abroad, inflamed tensions here at home, and caused incalculable pain to untold millions – including innocent children – in our name.
If you believe in hope over hate, progress over division, and real change over the unspoken, tolerated status quo, then you are essential to the movement we are building!
As they try to divide, we unite; as they rally for hate, we march peacefully; and as they work to silence us and take us backward, together, we will raise our voices so loud that the strength of our ideals will carry us forward.
The contrast between Donald Trump, Republicans, and the rest of us is clear, and where we stand now will define us for generations to come. Chip in $5, $10, $25, or any amount to ensure this November we bring an end to the Trump era of division and hate once and for all.

If we’re united, refuse to stay silent or back down, and always, ALWAYS, fight forward, together, we will succeed and our best days will once again be yet to come.
In this together,

"Hello,
Tonight, Joe Biden will officially accept the Democratic nomination for President of the United States.
There’s no one more qualified to lead our country than Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. With their combined knowledge and experience, they can tackle the three historic crises we’re facing: the deadliest pandemic in 100 years, the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, and the most powerful calls for racial justice in a generation.
How do we know that? Joe’s done it before. He helped respond to the Ebola crisis, save Michigan’s auto industry, and combat systemic racism. Our country’s future hangs in the balance, and Joe can set this nation on a path to build back better.
Like Joe always says, there’s not a single thing we cannot do if we do it together. Will you chip in $10 or more to restore true leadership to the White House?

Chip in $10 or more to help us build the grassroots movement that will beat Donald Trump and flip Michigan back to blue.
Democrats can accomplish anything when we come together and put in the work. And that includes making this Trump's last year in the White House.

"This week, Donald Trump rushed to Michigan because he's afraid of the threat our party poses to his presidency — as he should be. Here are three things you should know:
1. This was Trump’s ninth visit to Michigan in the last year. We have no doubt he’ll be back again before Election Day, so we have to be on high alert.
2. Michigan is the tipping point state that will decide this election. That’s why Trump has resorted to lying about “saving” our auto industry — even though we’ve lost nearly 20,000 auto jobs since he took office.
3. The Trump campaign is pouring in more than $7 million to keep our state red. That’s not all — they’re sending in reinforcements and we have to be prepared for Don Jr.’s visit this week.
To make matters worse, we aren’t where we need to be this month. With the election this close, we really can’t afford to fall behind. Will you chip in $10 to help us catch up on our September fundraising?

Just a few days ago, Mike Pence came back to Michigan for a campaign rally — and there’s no doubt in our minds that Trump will be next. Trump's taking note of the same polls we’re seeing — showing a tight race that could go either way.
Take a look for yourself, then please make a contribution of $10 or more before tomorrow’s end-of-month deadline. A handful of votes could determine the outcome of this election and our nation’s future. That’s why your donation today is so important.

"There's too much at stake to sit this one out.
Folks -
Wow. What a year we've had--a great year for Michigan Democrats. We started 2019 by swearing in a new Democratic Governor, Attorney General, and Secretary of State. We worked every day in between to strengthen our grassroots efforts and connect with voters throughout the state. And now we're closing out the year determined to uphold the Constitution and hold Donald Trump accountable.
We'll be honest: we kicked off the year with an ambitious goal of raising $1 million from 50,000 donors. But we're still behind and we're calling on our best supporters for help!
Listen, do you have $10 or more to invest to right now to stand with Michigan Democrats? We are running out of time, and need your support to ensure we're prepared for 2020.
There's too much at stake to sit this one out. Republicans are going after our candidates across the state. Together, we need to defend our seats, take back the State House, re-elect Senator Gary Peters, undo the destruction DeVos has had on our schools, and end Trump's disastrous presidency for good!

Each month that passes brings us closer to what cannot be overstated is the most important election of our lifetimes. That's why every FEC end-of-month reporting deadline is critical to ensuring we have the resources necessary to fight every day between now and Election Day.
We know what we need to go toe-to-toe with Donald Trump and the right-wing, Republican propaganda machine already working over time to spread lies about Joe Biden, attack Senator Gary Peters, and distract from Trump's failed leadership and disastrous coronavirus response.
We know that standing together is the only path forward and winning Michigan is the way we can remove the main obstruction to our progress and the cause of our country's current suffering.
With just 427 contributions left to hit our April goal, we're reaching out to our top supporters to step up one more time before midnight tonight!
Every dollar counts, and if you can right now, making an investment of just $5, $10, $25, or any amount you can afford will help us continue the march toward Democratic victory this November! >>>

Black History Month is a time to honor the incredible contributions by Black Americans throughout our nation's history and an opportunity to infuse the new fight for voting rights with the awesome power of our past--and we must seize it together.
We cannot forget the sacrifices made, the blood shed, and the lives stolen during the struggle for the right to vote in America.
Birmingham, Selma, Bloody Sunday, Rosa Parks, John Lewis, and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. And make no mistake--voting is under attack again.
The RNC and the Michigan Republican Party are doing everything they can to block efforts that would make voting easier in Michigan and keep people from going to the polls this November.

"Folks –
127 days are all that remain between now and the most important election of our lives, with the very soul of our nation on the line. That’s not an exaggeration – it’s a fact – and knowing what Donald Trump will do with another term, it’s a battle our country cannot afford Democrats to lose.
It’s clear the Trump administration doesn’t operate in the same reality as the rest of the world, but there’s no debate that the road to the White House and getting America back on track runs right through our state.
With campaigning and traditional electoral politics up in the air thanks to Trump’s complete abandonment of leadership and total failure to prepare for the global health crisis America now faces, we know that winning on the digital battlefield is absolutely essential to Democratic victory in 2020!
Democrats are stepping up all across Michigan, and for the NEXT 48 HOURS all gifts will be 500% MATCHED!
Chip in $5, $10, $25, or any amount by tomorrow at MIDNIGHT to get 5X MATCH on your contribution and help us keep the MDP Digital War Chest stocked full and ready to fight back against Republican attacks and all of Trump's lies, everywhere they arise, all the way to November!

What we do now – together as a team – will make the difference between winning and losing this November and determine the fate of our nation for both decades and generations to come.
Either we come together now – as one – to defeat Donald Trump and the politics of hate, or we will all lose as individuals this November.
Can we count on you? Make it clear where you stand today, and make 5X the impact on the future of our state! >>>
It’s really that simple – because when Democrats are united, nothing can stand in our way, and if we fight forward together, no one can stop us from reaching the better tomorrow all Americans deserve.

"Hello,
If we defeat Trump on November 3 but Republicans still maintain control of the State House, our ability to pass Governor Whitmer's legislative agenda will vanish.
No legislation to tackle PFAS contamination. No increase in state funding for schools. No legislation to fix the damn roads. Nothing.
That's why ending GOP control of the State House is just as important as electing Joe Biden this fall and why today we're announcing our Four to Flip Fund to do it.
We've set an ambitious $25,000 goal, but we're asking for just $4 today to help us flip the FOUR seats we need to win the State House majority. Chip in right here:

Believe it or not, we are just 7 weeks away from Election Day.
That means we only have 7 weeks left to get out the vote and build the resources we need to elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, make gains in Congress, and flip the State House and the State Supreme Court. This election more than ever, every week and every dollar counts.
And that’s why we’re asking you to chip in today with a recurring donation of just $7. That's $7 for 7 weeks left to elect Democrats up and down the ballot in Michigan.

Thanks to grassroots supporters like you, we have been able to contact millions of voters across this state. But there’s a lot more to be done in the next 7 weeks, and truth be told, we're quickly running out of time to get it all done. That's where you can have a significant impact, friend.
By beginning a weekly gift that runs from now through November 3, you'll be making a steady, consistent commitment to ensuring we elect Democrats up and down the ballot.
Can we count on you to chip in $7 a week for the next 7 weeks? Your support would give us a powerful boost when we need it the most.

"Hello,
You have been hearing a lot from us over the past few days about the importance of our end-of-month deadline in just three days. I hope you'll give me a chance to explain why we're counting on you now more than ever.
Our party has canceled in-person fundraisers, so we're relying more and more on emails like this one. Our organizing team has moved everything online, which means we're investing more in technology to reach voters.
And on top of all that, Trump's campaign is booking tens of millions of dollars worth of nasty attack ads in battleground states like ours. Trump knows Michigan is directly in his path to winning the White House, so he will do anything to save his re-election chances — no matter how much it costs.
So I'm asking, will you pitch in $10 or more to our campaign before our end-of-month deadline? We're within striking distance of our goal, and your donation could be the one that put us over the top.

Whether we have the resources to fight back against the GOP depends on how we respond right now. Luckily, this team is used to beating the odds. In 2018, you helped spread a blue wave across Michigan, flipping the executive branch and two congressional seats. But the only way to repeat that success is with you on our team.
Can you donate $10 or more to help us close the gap on our end-of-month fundraising goal? Missing this goal simply isn't an option, so any amount you give will have an impact.
Our Finance Director Emily is going to check back in tomorrow to give you another update on our progress. I hope by then we'll be able to say that we have reached, or are close to reaching, our goal.
For now, I want to thank you for being a part of this team because none of this would be possible without you.

"Hello,
In breaking news, the FBI announced today that they thwarted a domestic terrorist group’s plot to violently overthrow Michigan’s state government and kidnap Governor Gretchen Whitmer.
We’re grateful that Governor Whitmer is safe, thanks to Attorney General Dana Nessel's leadership and law enforcement’s swift actions. The individuals charged should be held accountable and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.
Add your name to send a clear and unmistakable message that we stand with Governor Whitmer against hate.
When Donald Trump tweeted “Liberate Michigan!” he gave safe harbor to right-wing militia groups to storm our capitol. While Trump declared “these are very good people,” State Republicans failed to stand against hate. They’re too scared of the division they have created to put an end to it.
Then last week, when Trump stood on the debate stage and told a hate group to “stand back and stand by,” he issued a rallying cry and a call to action. The words of our leaders matter. They have the power to bring us together in challenging times like these, but they can also drive us apart.
Let’s be clear: Hatred, bigotry, and violence have no place in Michigan. That’s not who we are and that’s not what we stand for. We must stand against hate and stand with Governor Whitmer.
Will you add your name to stand with Governor Whitmer and fight these flames of hatred?
We truly are stronger together, so thank you for standing up against hate.

It feels like just yesterday that we gave a six-month update, and now we are exactly 100 days from Election Day. The stakes are only going to get higher from here on out, which is why we're reaching out today.
Everything we do between now and November 3 will decide control of the White House. It all comes down to this: Michigan is the tipping point state that will end Trump's presidency for good.
With only 100 days to reach undecided voters, we have to make every day count because we only have one shot at defeating Trump. It will take all of us coming together to take back our country this year. But first, we have to close the gap on our 100-day goal of $100,000.
If just two people from 48003 gave $10 or more, we'd be back on track to meet this goal in no time. Will you rush an urgent donation of $10 or more to send a strong message that we're prepared to make Trump a one-term president?

Listen, we're not exaggerating when we say that Trump is dead serious about winning Michigan.
His campaign has already dumped millions of dollars into our state, and if we don't report strong fundraising numbers they'll have every reason to continue spending bucket loads of cash. We cannot afford to be caught off guard in our final sprint towards Election Day.
Our best shot at stopping Trump is if as many grassroots supporters like you give $10 or whatever you can to meet our 100-day goal. We wouldn't ask if it weren't critically important to reaching voters.
In a battleground state like ours, every little thing we do matters so thanks for pitching in what you can along the way.

"We've still got work to do.
Team,
The latest poll numbers show winning in November is within reach, but it is by no means guaranteed. That means the only poll that matters is on Election Day, and we’ve still got work to do.
I may sound like a broken record, but it bears repeating: Trump won Michigan by exactly 10,704 votes in 2016, and he could very well win again if we do nothing to stop him!
In a race this close, nothing is a sure bet, so we need everyone pitching in to make sure we have the resources to reach as many voters as possible before November. Running voter outreach efforts in a battleground state like ours is expensive, so I have to ask:
Can I count on you to step up and demonstrate your commitment to the success of the party with a donation of $10 or more? This weekend marks 100 days until the election, and we need your support now more than ever.
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:

Chip in $25 now

We've spent months building a campaign infrastructure strong enough to defeat Trump, but the urgent support of Democrats like you will determine just how well we can scale up these programs and strategies before November.
That's why a donation of any amount now is critical to sustaining our momentum in the final months before Election Day.
Will you help us scale up our campaigns with a donation of $10 or more? Any amount you give will be put to work right away in the final sprint towards November.
Let's get to work,

"Michigan Democrats are ready to win!
Did you hear the news, team? Last week, Michigan Democrats broke the record for highest turnout in a state primary election in history!
Trump did everything in his power to stop Michiganders from voting by mail — even threatening to withhold federal funding — but it didn’t work. More Michiganders voted by mail than ever before.
It’s clear Michigan Democrats are ready to win and want to make their voices heard again this November. Experts are predicting huge Democratic turnout in November, but in order to make that prediction a reality we’ll need your help.
Will you chip in $10 or whatever you can to ensure we have the resources we need to flip Michigan blue before our pre-filing deadline? Every dollar will be invested in registering voters, running ads, and training volunteers.

Our organizers miss knocking on doors and meeting folks from every corner of our great state. Hopping on video calls just isn’t the same as having a face-to-face conversation, but the way our online community has stepped up since all of this began has been nothing short of incredible.
Even though we had to move our campaign operations online and adapt our strategy to win this election, one thing remains the same: we’re committed to putting in the hard work to flip Michigan blue.
We’re making plans to host virtual campaign events and organize online, but we need to make sure we have the resources to do it. Can you chip in $10 — or whatever you can afford — to help us catch up on our August goal before our pre-filing deadline?
Thank you,

"Friend,
I can't wait for Senator Kamala Harris to make long-overdue history tonight as the first Black and Asian-American woman to accept the vice presidential nomination of a major party.
Kamala has spent her entire career fighting for folks like you and me, who just want their voices to be heard. Her story is our story. No matter what we look like, how we choose to worship, or who we love, we can achieve anything if we work for it.
I didn't understand what that meant until I watched Shirley Chisholm walking out onto that stage at the Democratic National Convention in 1972. Even as a little girl, that was my first realization that a barrier had been broken for me. And, I have no doubt millions of young women will look back at Kamala Harris walking out onto that stage tonight and see that someone who looks like them can lead a nation like ours.
That's why I'm doing everything in my power to elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, but they need all the help they can get. So, I'm asking you: Will you chip in $10 or whatever you can to make history and power this grassroots campaign to victory?

"Hello,
Since Kamala Harris' visit to Detroit and Flint yesterday, the attention on our state has skyrocketed. Like Kamala said: ""So goes Michigan, so goes the rest of the country,"" and everyone's watching to see if we have what it takes to defeat Trump.
This is an important moment for our campaign — early voting starts tomorrow, and we're down to the final days to reach voters before they begin casting their ballots. On top of that, we're exactly one week away from our last full FEC deadline before Election Day.
Will you chip in $10 or more ahead of our final quarterly FEC deadline? Every single dollar we raise will be put to work immediately reaching voters across the state.

We need to stay focused on getting out the vote so we can win this race. Your support helps us do just that. So just know that every time you decide to chip in $3, $5, or $10 it allows us to reach another voter we need to win this race.
But if we don't meet our FEC deadline with the strongest numbers possible, right-wing big-money donors and special interests will think Michigan is up for grabs. Look, in a race this close, we can't afford to lose any ground, which is why we're turning to you.
So what do you say? Will you chip in $10 or whatever you can before the final quarterly FEC deadline before Election Day?
Our work would not be possible without contributions from grassroots supporters like you. Thanks for all you do.

"Friend –
We are facing perilous times in our country amid a perfect storm of catastrophe and crisis that no one is more unequipped to handle than Donald Trump. From the coronavirus and a collapsing economy to a national movement for racial justice and equality, this administration has failed the American people and made things worse at every turn.
Even with all of that, I’m more hopeful and motivated than ever, and that's because of YOU! This week, I had the opportunity to join many of you for the MDP's Virtual Legacy Event, and it’s clear that the passion, commitment, and resolve to win in Michigan is stronger than ever before.
That's why I'm reaching out and calling on you to turn that energy into action. Will you join me and support MDP's efforts to take back the White House and elect Democrats across Michigan?
Michigan was critical to our midterm efforts to take back the House and put a check on Donald Trump. In this election, the people of Michigan have the power to take our country back for those who believe in progress and that America’s best days are still ahead.
Can I count on you to contribute $5, $10, $25, or any amount to ensure Democrats win across Michigan and defeat Trump to put Joe Biden in the White House and our future back in the hands of the people?

It will be because of you that we defeat Trump this November, get rid of Betsy DeVos and his entire unqualified administration, and put America on track to come back better and stronger with the leadership to get us there.
America cannot survive four more years of a president who wants to divide us, works to undermine our democracy, and desires a world where the rule of law no longer exists, science comes second to politics, and the corrupt are the only voices in the room.
Together, we're going to take our country back, save our democracy, and put our future on the path to progress again—and getting it done starts and ends with you. Are you with me? [[URL REDACTED]]

The pursuit of equality is at the heart of what it means to be an American and a Democrat. We believe the potential of our country is greatest when everyone is equal, and there is still so much work left to do.
As we celebrate LGBTQ Pride Month, we are reminded that every cause which seeks equity in our society is connected and must also be our own. As a powerful national movement to end systemic racism against Black Americans grows, we must show that unity is our greatest strength.
If we're united as Democrats, the forces of hate and oppression that seek to divide us will fail once and for all, but we need EVERYONE with us doing their part, including YOU, to get it done!
Join thousands of fellow Michigan Democrats and take a stand as we build our army of activists, volunteers, and supporters who will defeat Donald Trump, stop extremist Republicans, and bring their continued attack on equal rights to end for good! >>>

"Folks -
This is the face of a misogynist. This is the face of a sexist. This is the face of the Republican Party in Michigan--State Senator Pete Lucido.
Lucido recently told a reporter that a group of high school boys he was with ""could have fun with her."" This week, a fellow senator filed a sexual harassment complaint against Lucido for sexist remarks and disgusting behavior she was forced to endure from him.
Republicans like Lucido think they can get away with disrespecting women, trampling their rights, and treating them as second-class citizens. Enough is enough. We have to make it clear together that we will not tolerate it, and we will not go back!
We have to fight forward now to end the toxic culture of misogyny in Michigan once and for all. That means going on the offensive, holding Republicans accountable, and doing the work it takes to win and take back our state.
Are you with us? Can you make a $10 donation now--or any amount you can afford--to help us hold sexists like Lucido accountable and defeat his Republican allies up and down the ballot?

Pete Lucido is considered ""a rising star"" in the Michigan GOP, and you're well-aware of the misogynist in the White House who leads the Republican Party.

"Now more than ever, we need to stand with Debbie and stand up for the values we hold dear >>>
Folks -
Last night at a campaign rally in Battle Creek, Donald Trump didn't address his countless broken promises to Michigan voters. Instead, he repeated his same tired attacks on the media and Democrats over his impeachment, which included lashing out at Congresswoman Debbie Dingell.
But this time, he took it one step further--and too far--by insulting the legacy of her husband and a Michigan hero, the late Congressman John Dingell, in the process.
We are not going to sit back and let Trump get away with attacking our own or insulting the legacy of a man whose name this president is not even worthy of uttering.
That's why we're asking for 500 supporters to step up right now and donate as a way of saying: President Trump, you are not going to get away with bullying or insulting members of our Michigan family.
CHIP IN $5 →
CHIP IN $25 →
CHIP IN $50 →
CHIP IN $100 →
OTHER AMOUNT →
The event was billed as a ""Merry Christmas Rally"" -- but you could have fooled us. Trump spent most of his time attacking the media and members of Congress like Debbie, rather than focusing on the issues that matter to the American people.
Trump knows that the road to his reelection runs through Michigan -- and if his strategy is sowing division and hurling insults, it's not going to work.
Now more than ever, we need to stand with Debbie and stand up for the values we hold dear. Please chip in now so we can show our strength and signal to Donald Trump that his repulsive attacks have us more united than ever.
Thank you for standing with Debbie and fighting back with us! Please share this on Facebook and Twitter!

"Friend,
The GOP’s latest assault on health care has begun. U.S. Supreme Court confirmation hearings for Amy Coney Barrett started today in the Senate.
If Republicans get their way and ram through this nominee before voters can have a say, Barrett will be one of the most extreme right-wing justices in the high court’s history — and a sure vote against reproductive rights and the Affordable Care Act (ACA).
The moment has never been more urgent. Will you rush a $10 donation so we can stop Republicans' assault on our health care?

Here’s the thing, friend: If Trump’s new U.S. Supreme Court nominee is confirmed, she’s expected to provide the decisive 5th vote to overturn the ACA.
Protections for millions of Americans with pre-existing conditions hang in the balance, but Mitch McConnell and Republicans will stop at nothing to fulfill their agenda — especially when it comes to lifetime appointments on the U.S. Supreme Court. That means we cannot allow this seat to be filled without a fight.
We must protect health care access from Trump's right-wing attacks: Rush a donation now to help elect Democrats up and down the ballot.

"Hello,
As we honor working people across our nation this Labor Day, let's take a moment to recognize the progress we must still achieve and remember what this holiday is truly about.
It's about honoring the hardworking Americans who fought tirelessly for the 40-hour work week, overtime, and the minimum wage. But it's also about reaffirming our commitment to building a nation where everyone gets a fair shot, where hard work pays off, and where everyone can earn a decent wage.
It's those values — championed by unions — that built the middle class. Now more than ever, we appreciate those who have kept our economy going during this crisis, working on the front lines and putting their lives at risk each day to stock groceries, treat the sick, and deliver mail and supplies.
We will always fight for our right to organize and live by our commitment to protect workers.

"Michigan Republicans are trying to strip Gov. Whitmer of her ability to protect our state!
[4X MATCH ACTIVATED]
Folks –
There's no debating that Governor Gretchen Whitmer's leadership has saved Michigan lives, and when you look at places like Arizona, Texas, and Florida, it's obvious how lucky we are to have her leading our state.
Then why are Michigan Republicans spending millions to strip Gov. Whitmer of her ability to protect our entire state? Politics, plain and simple, and the legislative Republicans supporting these efforts are playing games with people's lives.
That's why it's so critical for us to have a legislature that works for the people by working with Gov. Whitmer! We need just FOUR more seats in the State House for Democrats to take the majority in 2020, and for the next 48 HOURS, every donation will be 4X MATCHED!
Leadership during this crisis has literally made the difference between life and death. As cases continue to rise across the country, it’s more important than ever that we stand with Gov. Whitmer and fight back against extremist Republicans who put their political survival over saving Michiganders' lives!
Chip in $5, $10, $25, or whatever you can afford today to make FOUR times the difference in our efforts to stand with Gov. Whitmer, protect our people and our state, and take back the House in 2020! >>>

The work begins now to win the four seats we need to take back the House and give both Gov. Whitmer and the people of Michigan a legislature that cares about progress, public health, and getting things done.
We have an opportunity to take our future back in 2020, and it starts right here: [[URL REDACTED]] >>>

Hello,
When we vote this November, it’s not just the presidency and control of Congress that’s on the line: the future makeup of our courts for decades to come is at stake.
Since Trump was elected, the GOP has been packing the courts with right-wing judges who will sit on the bench for lifelong terms. But this year, Michigan and Ohio Democrats have the opportunity to flip the majorities of their state Supreme Courts.
Join us for a conversation on flipping our Supreme Court majorities with special guest, actress Mary McCormack of The West Wing.
WHO: Lavora Barnes, Chair of the Michigan Democrats, David Pepper Chair of the Ohio Democrats, The West Wing actress Mary McCormack, and our MI and OH endorsed Supreme Court candidates.
WHEN: August 10th at 6:30 pm ET.
WHERE: Online! Links will be provided the day prior to the event.

Everyone’s health and well-being is our number one priority.
In these unprecedented times, please do not hesitate to reach out. Team MDP is here for every single Michigander, and we will never stop fighting.
We have posted guidelines from the CDC below. Stay safe and healthy, and we’ll be back in the office and in the community as soon as we can.

"13% of voters are still undecided!
BREAKING FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES:
13% of Michigan voters undecided on Michigan’s Senate race
Early voting is off the charts with over 1.5 MILLION ballots ALREADY returned in Michigan. But with polls showing Gary Peters neck and neck with his far-right opponent, 13% of voters are still undecided!
This election won’t be decided on Nov. 3 – it’s being decided RIGHT NOW. But with Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and the DeVos family funneling TENS of MILLIONS of dollars into Michigan to buy this seat, CNN is calling Gary's Senate seat one of the most likely to FLIP.
That's why we're launching a $250,000 GOTV Emergency Fund to reach undecided voters. And with voting already underway, we don't have much time left to regain the lead, so we're counting on supporters like you to chip in before it's too late.
Please, friend, EVERYTHING depends on what we do right now: Can you make a $3 contribution now every dollar you can spare before 11:59 p.m. – to help Gary get out the vote and win in Michigan, take back the Senate and protect the future of the Supreme Court from Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell?

"Gary Peters was the ONLY Democratic Senator to be outraised last quarter >>
BREAKING from POLITICO: Sen. Gary Peters the ONLY Democratic senator to be outraised last quarter!
URGENT, friend: Thanks to Mitch McConnell and special interests pumping MILLIONS into Michigan to buy this seat, Gary Peters was the ONLY Democratic Senator to be outraised last quarter.
Analysts at CBS News say Democrats have ZERO chance to take back the Senate if we lose Michigan. And with recent polls showing this race TIED – and Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight reporting a Democratic Senate majority hinges on what happens here in Michigan – the GOP is doing everything they can to defeat us. With our opponent outraising us for a FULL YEAR, Michigan flipping red is a very real possibility.
We CANNOT afford to be outraised again. That’s why we've set a rapid-response goal to raise another $50,000 before 11:59 p.m. TONIGHT, but right now, we’re falling WAY short ($4,732!) of what we need to stay on track to win.
Every dollar matters in a razor-thin race like ours, and with the future of the Senate at stake, we are urgently counting on your contribution: Will you give $3 or more now – every dollar you can spare before 11:59 p.m. – to help Gary win in Michigan, take back Senate control and protect the future of the Supreme Court from Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell?

"But we only have hours left to act.
Friend: Gary was outraised by our right-wing, Trump-backed opponent FOUR quarters in a row.
And now, analysts at CBS News are reporting that Michigan's Senate race could decide Senate control for the next two years. That's why the DeVos family and dark money GOP groups are spending more to defeat Gary than any other in-cycle Democratic senator in the entire country.

"Betsy DeVos' family has raised OVER $2 MILLION to defeat Gary here in Michigan.
BREAKING NEWS, friend: Betsy DeVos is threatening to withhold funding from schools that don’t reopen in the fall. And what’s even worse, she refused to say whether schools should listen to CDC guidelines in the middle of a global pandemic.
On top of that, we just learned the DeVos family super PAC has raised OVER $2 MILLION to defeat Gary here in Michigan.
They know it's the best way to buy Michigan's Senate seat and guarantee Mitch McConnell will call the shots in Washington for another two years.
Gary doesn’t have the backing of far-right billionaires like the DeVos family, but he does have something more powerful: you, friend. Will you make an immediate contribution of $5 or more right now to defend Michigan's Democratic Senate seat?
Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight reports the ONLY way Democrats can flip the Senate is by winning in Michigan. But this DeVos spending could tip the scales in this race – and recent polls are showing Gary TIED.
Senate control hangs in the balance here in Michigan. That's why we've set a rapid response goal to raise another $25,000 by midnight, but right now, we're falling WAY short of what we need to win.
In a race this close – with Senate control on the line – every dollar could make the difference between winning and losing. Gary's counting on your immediate contribution to win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats.
Rush $5 or more now – whatever you can by midnight tonight – to defend Michigan's Democratic Senate seat and take back the Senate for Democrats!

"The fight for control of the Senate has NEVER been so important.
Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Friend: We're only 24 days from Election Day -- but with hundreds of thousands of voters all over Michigan already casting their ballots, this election is well underway.
With a vacancy on the Supreme Court, the fight for control of the Senate has NEVER been so important. But CBS News says Democrats will have ZERO shot of taking back the Senate if Gary Peters loses in Michigan – and recent internal polling from our opponent shows this race STATISTICALLY TIED!
It doesn't help that GOP super PACs are spending MILLIONS to buy this seat – all because Trump and McConnell know defeating Gary is essential to keeping their grip on the Senate majority.
So to protect Michigan's Senate seat and take back the Senate from Mitch McConnell, we've set a goal to raise $20,000 TODAY.
Hitting our fundraising goals this close to the election is essential to winning in Michigan and retaking the Senate majority, so we're counting on your immediate contribution: Rush $3 or more right now – whatever you can spare to help Gary fight against Trump and McConnell's attacks – to win in Michigan, take back the Senate and protect the future of the Supreme Court!

Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight reports Democrats have ZERO chance of taking Senate control if we lose in Michigan – but Mitch McConnell's super PAC just announced it will spend ANOTHER $4 MILLION in the crucial final days of this race to buy Michigan's Senate seat.
That brings the total spending against us by Mitch McConnell's groups to nearly $20 MILLION.
Attacks like these can MAJORLY tip the scales, especially with recent polling showing our opponent nearly two points ahead and CNN reporting Michigan is one of the Senate seats MOST likely to flip.

"Friend, Gary’s far-right opponent just attacked him at Donald Trump’s campaign rally in Michigan.
In fact, John James praised the rushed confirmation of Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, calling it “a good day for America” -- even though McConnell and Republicans ignored historical precedent and disregarded the voices of millions of Michigan voters.
It’s clear that John James stands “2000%” with Trump -- and Trump is counting on him to be a rubber stamp for his agenda in the Senate. But with only ONE WEEK left in this race, his Trump rally appearance today could tip the scales into the GOP’s favor.
And with Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight reporting that Democrats have ZERO chance of taking Senate control if we lose in Michigan, we’re setting a goal to raise $50,000 before midnight tonight. Chip in $3 or more -- every dollar you can spare -- to defend Gary’s seat and take Senate control back from Mitch McConnell.

"We have to give Gary one final shot to pull this off.
Team – Dan here (Gary's campaign manager) with some important updates for our top supporters.
I just checked in with our finance team, and despite our strong fundraising push a few weeks ago, we’re facing some big challenges right now: We’re running on empty, our ads might go dark and we simply don’t have enough in the bank to get over the finish line. I am coming to you in the last moment of this race because we need to immediately raise $50,000 to keep our ads on the air.
What's worse, Trump’s betting everything on flipping this seat. In fact, he'll have held FIVE events in Michigan in the last week by the end of today, and those rallies have resulted in massive donation spikes from GOP mega-donors all over the country.
Our team is working around the clock to pull off this victory and reach the MASSIVE number of undecided voters in our race. But we need one final push to keep our ads on the air, persuade and turn out undecided voters and win this seat to take back the Senate.
So I’m turning to you because I know this team can't win without a last-minute infusion of grassroots donations: Can I count on you to rush $3 or more now – every last dollar you can spare – to win in Michigan and help Democrats take back the Senate?

EVERYTHING about the race to control the Senate just changed, friend:
Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight reports Democrats have ZERO chance of taking Senate control if we lose in Michigan – but Mitch McConnell's super PAC just announced it will spend $9 MILLION to buy Michigan's Senate seat.

"But we only have just hours left
Friend: Gary was outraised by our right-wing, Trump-backed opponent for the fourth straight time.
And now, analysts at CBS News are reporting that Michigan's Senate race could decide Senate control for the next two years. That's why the DeVos family and dark money GOP groups are spending more to defeat Gary than any other in-cycle Democratic senator in the entire country.
But just this morning, we got incredible news! After hearing that Gary was outraised, a committed group of donors offered to match every donation made today, dollar for dollar, to hit our $25,000-match goal!
Our opponent has the full force of the right-wing special interests behind him – but we have supporters like you. Can Gary count on you to make a $3 donation today? Your gift will be doubled until midnight.
Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight is reporting the ONLY way Democrats can flip the Senate is by winning in Michigan. With the future of the Senate on the line, we're falling short of our must-hit match goal.
With only hours until this match opportunity expires, Gary's counting on your immediate donation to win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats: Please, will you rush $3 (becomes $6) – whatever you can before midnight – to have your contribution DOUBLED to defend Michigan's Senate seat and take back the Senate for Democrats?

"Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
There’s been a huge update in the race to control the Senate, team:
Mitch McConnell's super PAC just announced a $92 MILLION haul in September alone -- with Gary’s seat as one of its top targets.
Thanks to this MASSIVE influx of support from McConnell’s billionaire allies, Republicans are set to OUTSPEND us on TV in the final days of this election.
This news has us alarmed about Gary’s seat -- especially with a recent poll showing our opponent taking a narrow lead and CNN reporting Michigan is one of the Senate seats MOST likely to flip.
We've set a rapid-response goal to raise $300,000 – there's simply no other option after hearing this news. But right now, we're falling short, and with Michigan voters already casting their ballots, time is running out.

FIRST: Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight reported the ONLY way Democrats can flip the Senate is by winning in Michigan.
THEN: The DeVos family shelled out almost $1 million against Gary and are doing everything in their power to prop up a candidate who supports Trump “2,000%.”
NOW: CBS is reporting Senate control rides on what happens here in Michigan, but right now our fundraising is falling short of what we need to secure Gary’s seat and secure a win for Democrats.

"Take a look at what we’re up against:
BREAKING:  Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight just predicted that Gary’s opponent is  “within striking distance” of winning Michigan’s Senate Race -- after reporting that Democrats have ZERO chance of taking back the Senate if Gary loses.
That’s why GOP billionaires are teaming up  right now to prop up Gary’s opponent. In just the last two weeks:
* Trump gave Gary’s opponent his “total and complete” endorsement.
* The  DeVos family super PAC increased their spending to a total of over  $5 million  in TV ads attacking Gary.
* A Koch family super PAC just endorsed Gary's opponent and plans to flood Michigan with a six-figure ad buy!
This onslaught of GOP ads and endorsements is tipping the scales. After RealClearPolitics moved this race from “Lean Dem” to “Toss Up,” yet ANOTHER poll shows this race within the margin of error.
The GOP is surging in Michigan, and how we respond right now could determine what happens to Gary’s seat AND the Senate majority. We set an 11:59 p.m. deadline to raise another $12,500 -- and we just can’t fall short.  Will you contribute $3 or more now – every dollar you can spare – to fight back against GOP spending in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats, and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

$5 dollars, friend.
A $5 contribution from you today is what it will take for us to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats, and protect the future of the Supreme Court. Let me tell you why:
I was outraised for the FIFTH reporting period in a row. That means that for the past YEAR we’ve been outpaced on fundraising every step of the way – and with a recent poll showing me nearly TWO POINTS BEHIND my far-right opponent, losing in Michigan would make it nearly impossible for Democrats to take back the Senate -- that means two more years of Mitch McConnell calling the shots on the future of our nation's highest court.
On top of all that, the DeVos family and right-wing groups are funneling MILLIONS into super PACs to buy this seat for McConnell and Trump.
After talking with my finance team, we've set a goal to raise another $20,000 by 11:59 p.m. tonight to win in Michigan and keep this seat blue – but right now, we're falling short. Your $5 can make all the difference in getting us there.
You know the stakes, friend. Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight reports Democrats have zero chance at taking back the Senate if we lose in Michigan. It's moments like this – right here, right now – that will determine whether we defend this seat and take back the Senate.
Pitch in $5 now to help us defend Michigan's Senate seat, take back the Senate for Democrats, and protect the future of the Supreme Court.
It’s up to every one of us to make sure we come out victorious on Election Day. Thanks for fighting with me,
Gary

Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Friend -- This election is about more than the names at the top of the ticket. It's about supporting great candidates up and down the ballot -- including Democrats who are fighting to flip the Senate.
That's why I'm excited to announce I'll be hosting a virtual grassroots event tomorrow, October 16 to raise money for some outstanding Democrats in tight Senate races -- and I'm calling on you to join me. All you have to do to secure your spot is make a gift of $3, $6, or whatever fits into your budget.

Our country's future hangs on what we do over the next few weeks. It's up to all of us to join together and elect a whole bunch of Democrats to the Senate who are ready to create change. I'm talking about folks like:
* Sen. Gary Peters (D-MI), an effective leader who's in a tougher re-election fight than just about any Democratic senator. Gary needs our help to hold his pivotal Senate seat.
* Theresa Greenfield (D-IA), a resilient daughter of farmers and a small business leader who Iowans can count on. Theresa's going to protect Social Security and affordable health care, but she needs our help to win.
* MJ Hegar (D-TX), a combat veteran and working mom whose tenacity and compassion will win progress for Texans of all stripes. MJ can flip this seat with our help.
* Jon Ossoff (D-GA), an investigative journalist who is committed to investing in infrastructure, clean energy, and strengthening our civil rights laws. Jon is neck-and-neck in recent polls and could pull ahead with our support.
* Rev. Raphael Warnock (D-GA), a fierce advocate for health care access, voting rights, and the dignity of working people who has dedicated his life to service. Rev. Warnock presides over Dr. King's former pulpit at Ebenezer Baptist Church, and he needs our help to make history as Georgia's first-ever Black senator.
Whether these candidates win or lose depends on what we do now, together, to support them before Election Day. That's why I'm personally asking for your support -- and your attendance at tomorrow's big event.
Please, if you haven't yet, will you chip in $3 to help Democrats flip the Senate? I'll have much more to say at tomorrow's event, but your $3 will make a bigger impact if it's made today.

"Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Friend – as May comes to a close, I want to give you an update on our race in Michigan.
For the last few months, with the help of Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell, my extreme right-wing opponent has outraised us, breaking fundraising records along the way.
With recent polling showing my opponent and me neck and neck, the DeVos family dumped nearly $1 million into Michigan to buy this seat for Mitch McConnell and the GOP.
The hard truth is that according to Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight, Democrats will lose our only chance at taking back the Senate if I lose in Michigan.
Will you make a contribution $3 or more now to defend Michigan's Senate seat and take back the Senate for Democrats?
I've got to tell you, watching Mitch McConnell call the shots in Washington is infuriating. The damage he's doing to our judicial system, including the Supreme Court, will have consequences for generations to come.
So frankly, friend, it's never been more important for Democrats to take back the Senate. And according to CBS News, a Democratic Senate majority will come down to what happens here in Michigan.
That's why we’ve set a goal to raise $65,000 for our end-of-month goal. But right now, we’re falling short of what we need to win.

"Back in 2010, I was a first-term congressman up for reelection during the Republican Tea Party wave - a wave that saw huge GOP gains in the Senate and the beginning of a Republican House majority that would last eight years.
Friend,
Back in 2010, I was a first-term congressman up for reelection during the Republican Tea Party wave – a wave that saw huge GOP gains in the Senate and the beginning of a Republican House majority that would last eight years.
In all honesty, the odds were stacked against me in that race, and national GOP interests were determined to see me lose. But I've never backed down from a tough fight in my entire life. I campaigned hard across my district in Michigan, and I was one of only a handful of freshman Democratic members of Congress who won reelection that year.
I owe a lot of that grit to my parents. Dad was a World War II veteran who poured his heart into teaching in Michigan public schools for three decades. Mom was an SEIU steward who organized the heck out of her workplace – for the betterment of her family and colleagues. They inspired me to work hard so I could put myself through school and join the Navy Reserve.
So you know what comes to mind when I hear that I'm one of the most targeted Democratic senators up for reelection this year? Or that I'm one of the few senators fighting to win in a state Donald Trump carried in 2016? I think of Mom and Dad and how hard they worked, always, for the betterment of others. I think of that House race when the odds seemed impossible, but we won.
That's my motivation, friend, and I'm determined to win and keep fighting for the people of Michigan. For good middle-class jobs, for our environment, for affordable health care and quality public education. But I can't win this thing alone.
Will you rush a contribution of $3 now to help me win? Whatever you chip in will ensure we have the resources to defend Michigan's Senate seat and take back the Senate for Democrats.
I've fought and won tough campaigns before, friend. But this time around, at least TWO right-wing super PACs and a dark money group have funneled big money into attacking me – not to mention that Betsy DeVos' family is dropping nearly $1 million to defeat me.
But do you know what I say to all of them? Go ahead and try. My right-wing opponent can depend on Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump and all the billionaire money he wants. I'm determined to win this thing the right way: by standing up for the people of Michigan and fighting with a grassroots team.
The truth of the matter, however, is this: Our race in Michigan will decide Senate control. Plain and simple. And with polls showing me in a dead heat with my Trump-backed opponent, falling behind our fundraising goals puts us in danger of losing. And after checking in with my finance team, we're $8,100 short of what we need to win.
I'm proud to have you on this team, friend, and I'm proud of everything we've accomplished so far. I know we can win this, but we've got to come together and fight harder than ever. So I'm asking: Will you make a donation of $3 – whatever you can spare to help us defend Michigan's Senate seat – so we can win this reelection and take back the Senate for Democrats?
Thank you very much.

"Despite unprecedented support for our campaign in Michigan, our opponent just announced he outraised us for the FIFTH straight reporting period.
Friend: Despite unprecedented support for our campaign in Michigan, our opponent just outraised us for the FIFTH straight reporting period. This is all thanks to Donald Trump funneling MILLIONS into Michigan to defeat Gary Peters and buy this seat to expand Mitch McConnell’s majority in the Senate.
They know that Democrats have zero chance of taking back the Senate if we lose in Michigan. And now, a recent poll shows Gary two points BEHIND his right-wing opponent.
Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight reports that Democrats can take back the Senate, but we must first win in Michigan. That's why we set a rapid-response goal of raising $10,000 as soon as possible – but right now, we're falling short, and we're running out of time.

"We just got some really bad news, friend: Gary’s seat was just added to Roll Call’s list of MOST vulnerable Senate seats in 2020 -- and we only have THREE weeks left to defend it.
Here's why we're worried, friend:
* Gary’s Trump-backed opponent has outraised us for over a year.
* GOP outside groups are spending over $30 MILLION against Gary.
* A brand-new New York Times poll shows Gary only ONE POINT ahead of his far-right opponent.
With voting in Michigan already underway, we don't have much time to fix this -- and Democrats’ risk of losing the Senate is at an all time high.
Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight and CBS News analysts say the future of the Senate will be decided in Michigan. So with this alarming new announcement, we need all hands on deck ahead of our last FEC filing deadline of the campaign tomorrow night -- but we’re already falling short. Here's the good news: after hearing how close we are in the polls, a group of donors offered to MATCH every donation between now and the deadline -- up to $500,000.
Friend, we’re running out of time before Election Day. Please rush an emergency gift of $3 or more right now -- and have every dollar DOUBLED -- to fight back against GOP spending in Michigan, defend Michigan's Senate seat and take back the Senate for Democrats!

"""Gary, we badly need you back in the U.S. Senate"" - Joe Biden Chip in now to support Gary >>
Friend – Winning in Michigan is so important that Joe Biden is ALL IN to help Gary defeat his Trump-backed opponent.
Joe knows Democrats CANNOT afford to win the White House without flipping the Senate – and CBS News reports that Democrats have ZERO chance at taking back the Senate if Gary loses in Michigan.
But a new poll from the New York Times shows Gary just one point ahead of his right-wing opponent -- within the margin of error -- and RealClearPolitics moved his race from “Leans Dem” to “Toss Up.”
Gary has been outraised by his hard-right opponent four out of the last five quarters – and with McConnell, Trump, the DeVos family and now the Koch family funneling MILLIONS of dollars into Michigan's Senate race to keep their GOP Senate majority, we cannot afford to fall short on our fundraising.
“Winning in November doesn't just mean defeating Donald Trump, it means winning back the United States [[URL REDACTED]]'s why we need to send Gary Peters back to Washington D.C.”
– Joe Biden
We need a MASSIVE grassroots movement to join forces with Joe Biden in protecting Michigan's Senate seat! That's why we set an 11:59 p.m. deadline to raise $20,000 – but we’re still falling $8,207 short, and we're running out of time.
Will you give $3 or more now to win in Michigan, flip the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court from Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump?

"I had to share this note with you, friend.
Friend,
When people say to me there’s no way Trump will win again, I immediately think of this headline from four years ago:
Battleground bloodbath: Clinton leads Trump in 7 swing states
Like so many of us do, I wonder: What might have happened differently on November 8, 2016, if so many powerful voices hadn’t assured Americans that Trump was destined to lose?
Just like when this article went to press, we’re facing two starkly different futures for our country, with just months left until Election Day. A second Trump term and control of the Senate are on the line here in Michigan. Yet my opponent has still managed to outraise us for an entire YEAR.
We can’t take anything for granted. So I’m asking you point-blank: Can you step up right now to help power our campaign so we don’t lose in Michigan again?
The White House, the Senate and the future of the Supreme Court are all on the line in Michigan. I can’t win this reelection fight without you. Can you chip in $3 or more right now to help us reach our $75,000 rapid response goal? We’re falling short.
If you've saved payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Click to donate $3.
Click to donate $25.
Click to donate $50.
Or click here to donate another amount.
When we say all these institutions are on the line, here’s what we’re really talking about: Good middle-class jobs. Access to affordable health care. Quality education in our schools. Action on climate change and protecting the environment. Our futures.
I’m committed to defending and fighting for each of these issues because I know it improves lives in Michigan and across America. My opponent -- who stands with Trump “2000%” -- is not. That’s why I’m determined to win this election.
I’m no stranger to tough fights, but I’ll be honest; this race is different than any other I’ve faced. Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and Betsy DeVos’ family have already funneled millions of dollars into Michigan to defeat me. And now we know that my opponent has outraised us four quarters in a row.
To them, I say: Bring it on. Because here’s what I’ve got that they can never have -- you.
You’re what makes this team incredible, friend: Together we’re creating an unstoppable team that will win this race and help get Washington working for the people again. But I need your help immediately, so I’m asking you now: Will you donate $3 – or whatever you can chip in to defend Michigan’s Senate seat – so we can win this reelection and take back the Senate for Democrats?
I can’t thank you enough for fighting this tough fight that will have an impact on all of us. Together, we can make a difference.
Take care,
Gary

"The most important race happening in 2020 is for control of the Senate.
Friend,
Gary Peters' reelection to the Senate this fall in Michigan will be one of the closest races this November -- and guess who has their thumb on the scale. The DeVos family -- i.e., the family of Betsy DeVos, Secretary of Education -- is hoping they can buy this Senate seat in Michigan by spending almost $1 million to unseat my friend Gary and put in his place their hand-picked choice, John James.
We already know how dangerous the DeVos family has been, and the super PAC ""Better Future Michigan"" wants nothing of the sort: It has 23 donors. Who are they? More than a quarter are members of the DeVos family. What's more,  the super PAC is spending over $6 million on TV ads against us.
Gary is a fighter for Michigan and my progressive ally in the Senate, and he needs our help: Before midnight tonight, we need to raise $10,000 for Gary Peters -- and I'll be honest: I've looked at the map, and I can't see how we take the majority if we lose this seat. Donate $3 or more now to fund the fight to reelect Gary and fight back against the DeVos family's dangerous plans for Michigan.
If you've saved payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Click to donate $3.
Click to donate $25.
Click to donate $50.
Or click here to donate another amount.
Why is the DeVos family so invested in unseating Gary Peters? Well, for one he's taking on Betsy DeVos and her wasteful spending at the Department of Education -- he pressed for answers back in December as to why 72 charter schools in Michigan never opened despite receiving nearly $21 million in federal start-up funds.
Gary believes like I do that students and families come first -- and for all the charter schools that closed or failed to open, communities missed out on more than half a billion dollars in resources that could have benefitted neighborhood schools. Gary knows her leadership is leaving students and families worse off -- and her family wants him out because of it.
They know he's watching and fighting for teachers, students, and families -- and they're scared. That's why their hand-picked choice to unseat Gary, John James, said Betsy DeVos is doing a ""very, very good"" job as Secretary of Education. John James supports Betsy DeVos even as she planned to cut $9 billion in funding for education, including more than $100 million for Michigan's public schools.
After spending millions to gut Michigan's public school programs, and bigger plans to do more, she can't even say if it was worth it. On whether local schools in Michigan have gotten better, she said: ""I don't know. Overall, I -- I can't say overall.""
Republican outside groups including the DeVos family super PAC are dumping over $25 million into this race -- but it'll get even closer, and that's why Gary needs our help: Donate $3 or more now to help us raise $10,000 for Gary Peters before midnight tonight.
Sincerely,
Chuck Schumer

Friend,
If we lose in Michigan, we'll lose our only chance at taking back the Senate for Democrats. That's why tomorrow’s primary election is a turning point we can’t afford to ignore.
Trump’s handpicked candidate officially becomes our opponent tomorrow night -- after outraising us FIVE times in a row over the last year. On top of that, Betsy Devos’ family, Mitch McConnell and national Republicans are funnelling millions into Michigan to flip my Senate seat and protect their majority for at least two more years.
And that money is working. With Senate control hinging on what happens in our race, a recent poll shows me in a STATISTICAL TIE with my extremist opponent -- so it’s never been more urgent that we head into our general election fight prepared to go toe-to-toe with my opponent’s billionaire allies.
Friend, I’m setting a goal to raise another $45,000 in grassroots dollars before polls close tomorrow. And I'm counting on your immediate contribution:

Friend: As this month comes to a close, I want to give you an update on our race.
The bad news: Thanks to Donald Trump and the DeVos family steering MILLIONS of dollars against me, my extreme right-wing opponent outraised me – for the fifth time in a row.
The good news: We are on track to have the best online fundraising month of the campaign, and Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight is reporting that Democrats have an opportunity to take back the Senate!

And now, with analysts at CBS News reporting that Michigan will decide Senate control, we’ve set a goal to raise another $20,000 immediately to win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats.
Friend: In a race this close, with the Senate and the future of the Supreme Court on the line, falling short could very well cost Democrats our chance to take back the Senate.

Friend,
There’s no doubt about it that Michigan will be the state to determine whether Mitch McConnell continues to run the Senate. Both CBS News and Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight are reporting that Democrats can only win back the Senate if we first win in Michigan, so we need to secure this seat to ensure victory in November.
The GOP knows that the road to the Senate runs through Michigan, so they’re pulling out all the stops to try and buy this seat. That means millions of dollars are flooding into our state with the help of Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and Betsy DeVos (among other far-right billionaires), and I’m now the most-attacked Democratic senator up this year.
I don’t scare easily, friend — the Republican Party can throw everything they want at me and I’ll never waver in my fight for Michigan’s working families. But we’re up against some serious money, and recent polls have us statistically tied with our Trump-backed opponent at the end of this month, so every second counts.
Tonight, we'll have to close the books on May, and it’s never been more important for our team of grassroots donors to step up. We’re still hoping to bring in another $11,723 before midnight to hit our end-of-month goal and stay on track to win in Michigan — can I count on you to make a contribution of $3 right now?

With your help, I know we can win here in Michigan and flip the Senate blue. Thanks for being a part of our fight for a better future.

Friend: With the experts at The Washington Post, FiveThirtyEight and CBS News saying the future of the Senate will be decided in Michigan, we need your help.
This endorsement is a BIG moment for our campaign -- but Gary’s far-right opponent has outraised us FIVE times in a row and has the full support of Donald Trump, Betsy DeVos’ family and Mitch McConnell.
On top of that, the latest poll shows Gary statistically TIED in his crucial Senate race. And now, RealClearPolitics moved this race from “Leans Dem” to “Toss Up.”
Team, we’re running out of time before Election Day. Please join Barack Obama and Joe Biden in supporting Gary by rushing an emergency gift of $3 or more NOW to win in Michigan and take back the Senate!

Friend, a surge of grassroots fundraising could make all the difference right now. After being outraised for over a year, recent polls show our race statistically tied, and RealClearPolitics just moved this race from “Leans Dem” to “Toss Up.” We're quickly running out of time to turn this toss-up race to a win.

With Senate control and the future of the Supreme Court on the line, we cannot afford to miss out on this critical match and risk losing this seat.

"It’s Cory Booker. Do you have a second?
Friend,
While we need to flip four U.S. Senate seats from red to blue in order to take back control of the Senate, we also have to protect already blue seats like mine and my friend, Gary Peters'.
Gary has represented the people of Michigan in the Senate since 2015, and he’s been a fighter for working families and the middle class, affordable health care, public schools, and the Great Lakes.
But Gary faces a tough re-election this November in a state that Donald Trump won in 2016 with a razor thin margin of 0.23 percent.
After being outraised by his Republican opponent in four consecutive financial quarters, Gary is currently behind in the polls — and we’re running out of time with early voting ALREADY underway in Michigan.
With control of the Supreme Court and things like the Affordable Care Act, Roe v. Wade, and voting rights now on the line, it’s all the more critical we flip the Senate, and that means defending Gary’s seat.
Will you stand with Gary ahead of the final end-of-quarter FEC deadline tonight by making a contribution to his campaign today? Any donation will support his efforts to keep fighting for you in the Senate:

"Our Supreme Court is on the ballot this year.
Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
I'll be blunt, friend: The future of our country rests on what happens in Michigan. That's because our race will decide if Democrats take back Senate control from Mitch McConnell. This could not be more important.
Trump and McConnell have always known what's at stake and have funneled MILLIONS of dollars into Michigan to buy this seat. Their handpicked GOP opponent has also outraised us every step up of the way all year long – to the point where RealClearPolitics moved this race from “Leans Dem"" to “Toss-Up,” and a new poll has us trailing by nearly 2 points.
When Election Day has come and gone, I don't want to look back and wish we had done more to stop Mitch McConnell from flipping Michigan red and confirming another far-right Supreme Court justice. So with CBS News reporting Democrats have zero chance of winning back the majority if we lose this seat, we've got to give this race everything we've got.
Our Supreme Court is on the ballot this year – and along with it, our entire Democracy. To protect it, we MUST keep Michigan blue and flip the Senate, but we're falling $8,919 short of our $20,000 midnight rapid-response goal with only hours to spare.
So I'm coming to you directly, friend: Will you make a contribution of $3 or more now to win in Michigan, take back the Senate and protect the Supreme Court from Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump?

This very moment, ballots are being cast for November’s election – and every voter should have their voice heard. There should NOT be a Supreme Court nomination until the next presidential term begins in 2021. But McConnell has vowed to force a Senate vote for Donald Trump’s nominee without delay.
I know you’ll put everything you can into this fight and ensure we defeat McConnell and Trump.
Thanks for fighting with me in this pivotal moment,

Friend: Despite unprecedented support for our campaign in Michigan, our opponent outraised us in four of the past five quarters. This is all thanks to Republicans like Donald Trump and Betsy DeVos' family funneling over $30 MILLION into Michigan to defeat Gary Peters and buy this seat to expand Mitch McConnell’s majority in the Senate.
They know that Democrats have ZERO chance of taking back the Senate if we lose in Michigan. And now, a recent poll shows me nearly TWO POINTS BEHIND my right-wing opponent.

"The most important race happening in 2020 is for control of the Senate.
Folks -- Did you see Chuck Schumer’s email?
Betsy DeVos‘ family is spending almost a million dollars just to buy this seat and hold the Senate majority for Mitch McConnell. We need to raise another $3,162 before midnight and I’m hoping I can count on your help, friend. Here’s a link to donate: [[URL REDACTED]]
Thanks for all you do,
Gary
\----Forwarded message----
Friend,
Gary Peters' re-election to the Senate this fall in Michigan will be one of the closest races this November -- and guess who has their thumb on the scale. The DeVos family -- i.e., the family of Betsy DeVos, Secretary of Education -- is hoping they can buy this Senate seat in Michigan by spending more than $800,000 to unseat my friend Gary and put in his place their hand-picked choice, John James.
We already know how dangerous the DeVos family has been, and the Super PAC ""Better Future Michigan"" wants nothing of the sort: It has 14 donors. Who are they? Half of the donors are members of the DeVos family.
Gary is a fighter for Michigan and my progressive ally in the Senate, and he needs our help: Before midnight tonight, we need to raise $10,000 for Gary Peters -- and I'll be honest: I've looked at the map, and I can't see how we take the majority if we lose this seat. Donate $5 or more now to fund the fight to reelect Gary and fight back against the DeVos family's dangerous plans for Michigan.
Click to donate $5.
Click to donate $25.
Click to donate $50.
Or click here to donate another amount.
Why is the DeVos family so invested in unseating Gary Peters? Well, for one he's taking on Betsy DeVos and her wasteful spending at the Department of Education -- he pressed for answers back in December as to why 72 charter schools in Michigan never opened despite receiving nearly $21 million in federal start-up funds.
Gary believes like I do that students and families come first -- and for all the charter schools that closed or failed to open, communities missed out on more than half a billion dollars in resources that could have benefitted neighborhood schools. Gary knows her leadership is leaving students and families worse off -- and her family wants him out because of it.
They know he's watching and fighting for teachers, students, and families -- and they're scared. That's why their hand-picked choice to unseat Gary, John James, said Betsy DeVos is doing a ""very, very good"" job as Secretary of Education. John James supports Betsy DeVos even as she planned to cut $9 billion in funding for education, including more than $100 million for Michigan's public schools.
After spending millions to gut Michigan's public school programs, and bigger plans to do more, she can't even say if it was worth it. On whether local schools in Michigan have gotten better, she said: ""I don't know. Overall, I -- I can't say overall.""
Right-wing Republicans like the DeVos family are dumping nearly a million dollars into this race -- but it'll get even closer, and that's why Gary needs our help: Donate $5 or more now to help us raise $10,000 for Gary Peters before midnight tonight.
Sincerely,
Chuck Schumer

"We just got outraised by my GOP opponent for the FIFTH time in a row.
Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
I have bad news to share with you, friend: We just got outraised by my GOP opponent for the FIFTH time in a row.
This couldn’t have come at a worse time: I was the only Democratic senator to be outraised last quarter, and experts at RealClearPolitics just moved our race from “Lean Democrat” to “Toss Up”. Now, recent polls show I’m in a statistical tie with my Trump- and McConnell-backed opponent.
We have to kick this campaign into high gear right now, because Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight reports that Democrats have ZERO chance to take back the Senate if we lose in Michigan. And with Donald Trump, McConnell and the DeVos family pumping in millions to buy this Senate seat, we can't afford to be outraised again.
Helping Michigan families is the greatest honor I've ever had, and I will NOT let a right-wing extremist take this seat without a fight. So I need you fighting with me, because we won't win in Michigan – or take back the Senate – if we continue to fall behind in fundraising.
That’s why my team set our biggest rapid-response goal of the campaign so far: to raise $80,000 immediately to close this gap. But as I write this, we’re already falling way short.
Our opponent has millions of dollars in GOP special-interest money backing him – but I’ve got grassroots supporters like you. So, I’m asking you now: Before 11:59 p.m., will you rush a gift of $3 or more now to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

"CBS + Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight (before midnight)
Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Friend: Both CBS News and Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight are reporting that Democrats can only win back the Senate if we first win in Michigan, so there's no doubt that Michigan will be the state to determine whether Mitch McConnell continues to run the Senate.
That's why I'm reaching out for your help. And if you'll give me just a moment, I'd like to explain why my race is so important.
The GOP knows that the road to Senate control runs through Michigan, and they’re pulling out all the stops to try and buy this seat. That means millions of dollars are flooding into our state with the help of Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and Betsy DeVos. And thanks to all that money, polls are showing this race statistically tied.
A loss here will throw away Democrats' only chance of taking back the Senate. But, friend, I won't go down without a fight. There is too much at stake, like the future of the Senate and the Supreme Court.
If you care about winning in Michigan and taking back the Senate for Democrats, I'm counting on you to help me raise $9,471 tonight. And thankfully, a group of donors has offered to double all gifts, but ONLY until midnight.
I'm counting on you to take full advantage before it's too late: Please, will you rush $3 right now – anything you can spare before midnight – and have your gift DOUBLED to defend Michigan's Senate seat and take back the Senate for Democrats?
Click to donate $3 (becomes $6).
Click to donate $25 (becomes $50).
Click to donate $50 (becomes $100).
Or click here to donate another amount.

"Our country cannot take two more years of Mitch McConnell's chokehold on the Senate.
Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Friend: Our country cannot take two more years of Mitch McConnell's control over the Senate – but Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight says that's exactly what will happen if we lose in Michigan.
And with new polling showing us nearly TWO POINTS BEHIND our far-right opponent, Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and the DeVos family are pouring millions into Michigan to buy this seat and tighten the GOP's hold on the Senate.
With the future of the Senate and the Supreme Court on the line, we simply CANNOT let Trump and McConnell buy Michigan's Democratic Senate seat.
But right now, we're $6,738 short of our MUST-HIT fundraising number, and we have to hit it by midnight to win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats.
Will you rush $3 or more – whatever you can before midnight – to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

"Friend: Despite an outpouring of support, we’re still $89,158 short of our midnight $500,000 fundraising goal – even with a generous triple match running through midnight. I hate asking again, but I need your immediate help to close this gap.
After being outraised for an entire YEAR, we MUST take advantage of every match we can because analysts at CBS News report Senate control depends on our team winning in Michigan. With a brand-new poll from the New York Times showing me just ONE POINT ahead of my Trump-backed opponent, I’m counting on your support. Are you with me?
With just a few hours left before this match expires, will you rush $3 or more – and make three times the impact in this race – to win in Michigan, take back Senate control and protect the future of the Supreme Court from Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump?
Being outraised again means we could lose this race – and miss out on taking back Senate control for Democrats. Even just $3 (which becomes $9 if you give before midnight) would go a long way to help us win.
Thank you so much for fighting with me,

"Trump and McConnell will stop at nothing to defeat me
Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Friend – Despite unprecedented support for our campaign in Michigan, my extreme right-wing GOP opponent just announced he has broken fundraising records and outraised us for the fourth straight reporting period.
This is thanks to Donald Trump funneling MILLIONS into Michigan to defeat me and buy this seat to expand Mitch McConnell’s majority in the Senate.
I won't mince words: Democrats cannot take back the Senate if we lose in Michigan. Period. That's why the GOP has made it clear they will stop at nothing to defeat me. So truthfully, friend, this news couldn't have come at a better time:
After hearing we were outraised by our opponent, a group of donors just offered to match all donations up to our $25,000 goal – but only today!
I'm counting on supporters like you to take full advantage of this incredible match before it's too late, friend: Please rush $3 or more now – before this match expires at midnight – and have every dollar DOUBLED to defend Michigan's Senate seat and take back the Senate for Democrats.
We can’t afford any more years of a Republican Senate – they’ve already confirmed two extreme right-wing justices to the Supreme Court and threatened to dismantle affordable health care. It's never been more important for Democrats to win back the Senate majority.
Friend, here’s the good news: Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight reports Democrats can take back the Senate. But first we have to win here in Michigan.
Right now, recent polling shows me TIED – and in a race this close, every single dollar matters. If we're going to win and take back the Senate, we cannot fall further behind. This rare match opportunity is only on the table until midnight tonight, so I'm counting on you to take full advantage before it's too late.
What we do right now could be the difference between winning and losing. Please, will you rush $3 or more – whatever you give right now will be DOUBLED, dollar for dollar – to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

“Now they need that money in order to make the post office work so it can take all of these millions and millions of [[URL REDACTED]] if they don’t get those two items that means you can’t have universal mail-in voting...”
Let's be clear -- the President’s newest threats are thinly-veiled attacks on one of the most fundamental rights in our democracy: The right to vote.
I've launched an investigation into nationwide mail delays at the USPS, and I am doing everything in my power to protect voting-by-mail. Stand with me by demanding Congress intervene to save the Postal Service and adding your name next to mine →
These aren’t empty threats from Donald Trump. Trump’s new handpicked postmaster general has already implemented changes that are leading to massive mail delays.
Amid these delays, the Postal Service just told 46 states -- including Michigan \-- they can’t promise ballots will reach their destinations on time.
So please, friend, now is not the time to stay silent. I am doing everything in my power to keep the Postal Service operating – but I need your immediate help:
Can you sign my petition and demand Congress intervene to save the Postal Service? We're still falling 1,147 signatures short with hours to go -- and your name is missing.
In the middle of a pandemic, the Postal Service is more than a lifeline for millions of Americans -- it is critical to our democracy itself.
Thank you for speaking out,
Gary

I have bad news to share with you, friend: New polling shows me nearly two points BEHIND my far-right opponent -- and Politico just reported that our race is so competitive that it ""gives GOP hope of hanging on to the Senate.""
This couldn’t have come at a worse time: I was the only Democratic senator to be outraised this summer, and experts at RealClearPolitics just moved our race from “Lean Democrat” to “Toss Up”. With only 10 days until Election Day and almost two million Michiganders already casting their ballots, we're running out of time to defend this seat.
Helping Michigan families is the greatest honor I've ever had, and I will NOT let a right-wing extremist take this seat without a fight. So I need you fighting with me, because we won't win in Michigan – or take back the Senate – if we continue to fall behind in fundraising.
Our opponent has millions of dollars in GOP special-interest money backing him – but I’ve got grassroots supporters like you. So I’m asking you now: Before 11:59 p.m., will you rush a gift of $3 or more now -- anything you can spare -- to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

Breaking news, team: Donald Trump just announced he’s coming back to Michigan this week.
This will be the Trump team’s 9th visit to Michigan in the last year — and he keeps coming back because he knows if Democrats lose here, we have ZERO chance of taking back the Senate.
The Trumps are bringing in wealthy donors from across the country to funnel money into my far-right opponent’s pockets in an attempt to buy this election. I’ve got one thing to say to them — bring it on.
But I need your help tonight, friend -- we need to raise $10,000 by 11:59 p.m. to stay on track. If we lose in Michigan, Democrats will have two more years of Mitch McConnell calling the shots in Washington.
We need all hands on deck in this pivotal moment. Can you rush an urgent contribution of $3 to help us compete against Trump and the GOP war chest in Michigan?

Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Friend -- with less than 30 days left in this election, I want to give you an update on our race in Michigan.
For the last few months, with the help of Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell, my extreme right-wing opponent has outraised us time and time again, breaking fundraising records along the way.
With recent polling showing my opponent nearly two points ahead, McConnell's super PAC dumped $9 million into Michigan to buy this seat and keep his grip on Senate control.
The hard truth is that according to Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight, Democrats will lose our only chance at taking back the Senate if I lose in Michigan.
Friend, it's never been more urgent to step up: Will you contribute $3 or more right now to defend Michigan's Senate seat and take back the Senate?
I've got to tell you, watching Mitch McConnell call the shots in Washington is infuriating. The impact he's having on our judicial system, including the Supreme Court, will have consequences for generations to come.
So frankly, it's never been more important for Democrats to take back the Senate. And according to CBS News, a Democratic Senate majority will come down to what happens here in Michigan.
That's why we set a goal to raise $50,000 today. But we won't get there without a MAJOR push from grassroots supporters like you.
I wouldn't ask if it weren't critically important: Will you rush $3 or more right now -- every dollar you can -- to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats, and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

"The most important race happening in 2020 is for control of the Senate.
I will not be the first, nor will I be the last to tell you this, friends: The most important race happening in 2020 is for control of the Senate.
I have a front-row seat to the damage Mitch McConnell is causing in the Senate. He is blocking every last attempt at progress that our Democratic colleagues in the House are fighting so hard for – environmental protections, gun safety measures, affordable healthcare. If Joe Biden wins the White House, he MUST have the Senate as well.
That's why I'm reaching out to you about Gary Peters' race in Michigan. Experts from FiveThirtyEight to Roll Call say Democrats can win back the Senate – but only if Gary wins in Michigan.
The thing is that Gary's reelection won't be easy. He's one of two Democratic Senate candidates fighting to win in a state President Trump carried. To top it all off, a brand-new poll shows Gary trailing behind his hard-right opponent, who was handpicked by Trump and McConnell.
So here's the deal: I told Gary I'd help him raise $8,000 to protect Michigan's Democratic Senate seat, and we really need to hit that goal before midnight. Can I count on you to give now and help us take back the Senate majority?
Please, click here to give $3 or more now to help Gary Peters keep Michigan blue, defeat Mitch McConnell and take back the Senate for Democrats.

With our race downgraded from “Leans Democrat” to “Toss Up” and a brand-new poll showing my opponent in the lead, this massive TV ad spending gap could tip the scales in our opponent’s favor.
In fact, Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight reports that Democrats have ZERO chance to take back the Senate if we lose in Michigan, so we have no time to waste. My team just set a rapid-response goal of $25,000 to help fund new TV ads -- but as I write this, we’re already falling way short.

Friend: My extreme opponent has outraised me for a FIFTH consecutive reporting period thanks to Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and Betsy DeVos funneling MILLIONS into Michigan to defeat me.
That’s why I’m asking for your help – but first, I’d like to explain why it’s so important we defend Michigan’s Democratic Senate seat.
If we lose here, Democrats will throw away our only chance of taking back the Senate. That means two more years of Mitch McConnell calling the shots in Washington. That means he and Donald Trump will team up to put more extremist justices like Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court, and you can bet they’ll keep trying to dismantle protections for those with preexisting conditions.
I've won tough elections before, and I'm all in to do it again this time around. But  new polling shows me two points behind my opponent,  and analysts at The Washington Post rank me as one of the most targeted Democratic senators in the country.
The good news is Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight reports Democrats can flip the Senate, but only if we first win in Michigan.
So with the future of the Senate on the line, in a race this close, every dollar could be the difference between winning and losing. We've set a goal to raise another $4,125 before midnight tonight to win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats. I'd appreciate it if you could give now, even just $3, to help us hit this goal and win.

"Every dollar triple-matched today will help decide Senate control
Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Team --
I wanted to make sure you saw my message. We have only hours left to take advantage of this incredible triple-match opportunity, and with just 20 days until Election Day we can't afford to fall short on any fundraising.
I'm asking one last time before our  final FEC filing deadline of the entire campaign: Can you spare $3 or more now -- and have every dollar TRIPLE-MATCHED -- to win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats?
Thank you,
Gary
\----Forwarded message----
This can’t wait, team: We only have 20 days to defend this seat – but my team just let me know that we're falling seriously short of our $500,000 rapid-response match goal to close our fundraising gap.
We’re exactly $175,913 short of our goal, with winning in Michigan and taking back the Senate for Democrats on the line. But with just hours until our midnight deadline, we're not on track to come up with what we need to win.
So a group of committed donors is upping their offer, but ONLY until midnight: I just got the word that every dollar given until midnight tonight will now be TRIPLE-MATCHED to win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats.
Team, we MUST take complete advantage of this rare triple-match opportunity because Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight reports that what happens here in Michigan will determine Senate control for the next two years – and a brand-new poll from the New York Times shows me only ONE POINT ahead of my Trump- and McConnell-backed opponent.
There is too much at stake to sit on the sidelines: Every dollar triple-matched today will help decide Senate control for Democrats, so rush $3 or more now – while every $1 becomes $3 – to defend Michigan's Democratic Senate seat, take back the Senate and protect the future of the Supreme Court!
If you've saved payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Donate $3 (becomes $9 today!)
Donate $25 (becomes $75 today!)
Donate $50 (becomes $150 today!)
Rush another amount
Thanks for making sure we can keep fighting for Michigan families in the Senate.

"Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
I have bad news to share with you, friend: A brand-new poll from the New York Times shows me just ONE point ahead of my far-right opponent -- and Politico just reported that our race is so competitive that it ""gives GOP hope of hanging on to the Senate.""
This couldn’t have come at a worse time: I was the only Democratic senator to be outraised this summer, and experts at RealClearPolitics just moved our race from “Lean Democrat” to “Toss Up”. With only 20 days until Election Day and over a million Michiganders already casting their ballots, we're running out of time to defend this seat.
Helping Michigan families is the greatest honor I've ever had, and I will NOT let a right-wing extremist take this seat without a fight. So I need you fighting with me, because we won't win in Michigan – or take back the Senate – if we continue to fall behind in fundraising.
After hearing how important this race is, a group of donors offered to TRIPLE MATCH every contribution between now and our final FEC filing deadline at midnight tonight -- up to $500,000!
Our opponent has millions of dollars in GOP special-interest money backing him – but I’ve got grassroots supporters like you. So, I’m asking you now: Before 11:59 p.m., will you rush a gift of $3 or more -- and have every dollar TRIPLED -- to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

"It’s up to every one of us to make sure we win in Michigan.
$5 dollars, friend.
A $5 contribution from you today is what it will take for us to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats, and protect the future of the Supreme Court. Let me tell you why:
For the past YEAR we’ve been outpaced on fundraising every step of the way – and with a new poll from the New York Times showing me just ONE POINT ahead of my far-right opponent, losing in Michigan would make it nearly impossible for Democrats to take back the Senate -- that means two more years of Mitch McConnell calling the shots on the future of our nation's highest court.
On top of all that, Republicans including the DeVos family, the Koch family and Mitch McConnell are funneling in OVER $30 MILLION to buy this seat for the GOP.
We've set a rapid-response goal to raise another $20,000 by 11:59 p.m. tonight to win in Michigan and keep this seat blue – but right now, we're falling short. Your $5 can make all the difference in getting us there.
You know the stakes, friend. Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight reports Democrats have zero chance at taking back the Senate if we lose in Michigan. It's moments like this – right here, right now – that will determine whether we defend this seat and take back the Senate.
Pitch in $5 now to help us defend Michigan's Senate seat, take back the Senate for Democrats, and protect the future of the Supreme Court.
It’s up to every one of us to make sure we keep Michigan blue this year. Thanks for fighting with me,

"Our country cannot take two more years of Mitch McConnell controlling the Senate.
Friend: Our country cannot take two more years of Mitch McConnell's control over the Senate – but Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight says that's exactly what will happen if we lose in Michigan.
And with new internal polling from our far-right opponent showing our race STATISTICALLY TIED, Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and the DeVos family are pouring millions into Michigan to buy this seat and tighten the GOP's hold on the Senate.
With the future of the Senate and the Supreme Court on the line, we simply CANNOT let Trump and McConnell buy Michigan's Democratic Senate seat.
But right now, we're $9,681 short of today's MUST-HIT fundraising number, and we have to hit it by midnight to win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats.

"Just the other day, President Trump personally called Gary a ""Do-nothing Democrat.
Hi friend, I wanted to take a moment and reach out to you about my husband Gary.
First of all, from the bottom of my heart, I want to say thank you for being a part of this team to help Gary win in Michigan. It means the world to have you fighting so hard alongside us. I don't need to tell you that this race is one of the biggest in the entire country — even Donald Trump himself is focused on winning in Michigan and defeating Gary.
Just the other day, President Trump personally attacked Gary, calling him a ""Do-nothing Democrat."" Now, the president is known for two things: his nicknames and his lies. But he doesn't know a thing about my husband. I want to tell you exactly who Gary Peters is:
He's the Senator who fights tirelessly for workers and small businesses. He’s the public servant pushing for quality, affordable health care coverage where insurance companies can no longer discriminate because of pre-existing conditions. And as a product of Michigan’s public schools, Gary has always fought for students and has continued to give them the tools they need to reach their full potential.
That's my husband – he's a fighter. For Michigan and our country. But right now, he's in the midst of his toughest election ever.
The stakes of this race have never been higher. Another two years of a Republican-held Senate means two more years of Mitch McConnell calling the shots in Washington. That means he and Donald Trump will team up to put more extremist justices like Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court, and you can bet they’ll keep trying to dismantle protections for those with preexisting conditions.
My husband's been in tough election fights before, and he's all in to do it again. Believe me, Gary's going to fight tooth and nail to defend this Senate seat – but I'm making a personal ask for you to invest in this fight, too.
Gary's up against the likes of Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and nearly $1 million in dark money from the DeVos family, all vying to buy this seat for the GOP. That's why I'm reaching out to you today.
His team told me we need to raise another $7,500 by midnight, but right now, we're not quite there. Please, will you consider making a contribution to reelect my husband Gary, win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats?
Here's the best link to donate – whatever you give will go toward keeping Michigan blue and taking back the Senate for Democrats: [[URL REDACTED]]
From the bottom of my heart, thank you. Now let's go win this thing.

Here's what you need to know about Michigan’s Senate race:
Folks, making sure you saw this.
The GOP is trying to buy this Senate seat -- but we won't let them. Right now we're $2,108 short of what we need to raise by 11:59 tonight. Can you chip in whatever you can to help us reach our goal and make sure we win in Michigan? Click here to donate.
\----Forwarded message----
Take a look at who’s trying to buy Michigan’s Senate seat for the GOP:
* Our Trump-backed opponent  has launched a multi-million dollar  ad blitz in Michigan.
* Mitch McConnell’s  dark money group spent  $4.5 million  on ads alone in August.
* And the  DeVos family super PAC  just announced  over $4 million  in TV ads attacking Gary.
What’s even worse: Gary’s far-right opponent has outraised us five times in a row. And now, RealClearPolitics moved this race from  “Leans Dem”  to “Toss Up.”  With a brand new poll showing Gary TWO POINTS BEHIND, this Senate seat could swing in the Republicans’ favor.
With Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight reporting that Democrats have ZERO chance to take back the Senate if Gary loses, we need your help. We set an 11:59 p.m. deadline to raise another $12,500 – but we’re already falling WAY short of what we need to win.

"Folks: Our nation is grieving. Across the country, our neighbors, our friends, our family, are coming together under this common pain to demand an end to systemic racism and the injustice it feeds.
The Constitution states that we are created equal -- but that cannot be the case when Black men and women are being killed at an alarming rate. It’s why supporting our local chapters of the NAACP is extremely important, now more than ever.
On Saturday, I reached out about giving to the NAACP Detroit Branch and now I’m asking again because we cannot sit silently as our community is aching. So I’m asking, friend -- if you can afford to, please donate to support the critical work of the NAACP Detroit Branch today.

For the past five days, we’ve awoken to more news about the terrible and avoidable tragedy that was the murder of George Floyd.
And across the country -- from Minneapolis to Louisville to Detroit -- the pain and heartbreak are palpable. This senseless and indefensible death has shocked our nation. Simply put, this should never have happened, and George Floyd should still be alive.
We must not forget the names of those whose lives have been needlessly cut short, and we must face the grim reality that our work to make America fulfill her promise of equality and justice for all is far from over.
I’ve dedicated my life in service to Michigan and its people -- and right now, so many Michiganders are in pain. When faced with adversity, our leaders must rise to the occasion. I’m speaking with our community leaders, listening and acknowledging how we must work together to heal as a nation as we grieve with hope.
Our communities are hurting.
Our neighbors are hurting.
Our families are hurting.
No more.
To those of you who are finding the news especially troubling and are scared for what is to come, know that you are not alone. We must take the fear; the anger; the pain and channel it into seeking justice. We must continue to honor their lives and fight to end this violence. We must unite together to encourage understanding and compassion for our fellow Americans.
If you can, please, join me in donating to the NAACP Detroit Branch to help our community. Contribute whatever you can to ensure they have the funds needed to continue their important work.

Yesterday, I emailed you about our final $250,000 donation match of our campaign. Since then, we’ve seen a massive surge in donations from supporters across the country.
But after Donald Trump came to Michigan this past weekend, you can bet my far right opponent also saw a massive uptick of wealthy donors funneling money straight into his pockets.
We cannot take any chances because Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight says Democrats have ZERO chance to take back the Senate if we lose in Michigan.
Here’s the thing: We still have $60,582 left that can be matched right now. That means every dollar you give will be DOUBLED \-- but this offer only lasts until tonight at midnight. And with voting already underway, we don't have much time left to regain the lead.
Please, friend, will you pitch in $3 or more now – every dollar you can spare to have your first gift DOUBLED before midnight – to win in Michigan, take back the Senate and protect the future of the Supreme Court from Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell?

Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
There's no way of sugarcoating this, friend: I was the only Democratic senator to be outraised last quarter – and it also marked a full year of our Trump- and DeVos-backed opponent outraising us. Friend, it couldn't have come at a worse time, with polls showing our race in a statistical tie.
With analysts at CBS News reporting that Michigan’s Senate race will decide Senate control, we’ll have zero chance of taking back the Senate if we lose this seat. It's why right-wing interests from Donald Trump to Mitch McConnell to the DeVos family are funneling in millions to buy this Senate seat.
I’m no stranger to tough fights: Fighting for the people of Michigan is the greatest honor of my life, and I do not plan on ceding this seat to a right-wing extremist.
But if we're going to win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats, we CANNOT afford to keep being outraised. That's why my team set a rapid-response goal to raise $10,000 immediately to make up our shortfall, but right now, we're falling short of what we need to win.
Our opponent has the full force of GOP special interests behind him – but I have you. So I'm asking: Before midnight, can I count on you to contribute $3 or more now – every dollar you can spare – to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

"Team: I’ve been outraised by our right-wing, Trump-backed opponent for over a year now.
That’s because super PACs are spending more to defeat me than any other in-cycle Democratic senator in the nation. They’ve got their sights set on Michigan, and analysts at CBS News are reporting that this could be THE race to determine control of the Senate.
Now, with control of the Senate at risk and our last end-of-quarter deadline just around the corner, we need your help to secure this Senate seat and make sure Democrats win in Michigan.
My opponent is backed by right-wing special interests who are prepared to spend big to try and buy this seat for Mitch McConnell. But we’ve got something better -- grassroots supporters like you, friend. Can I count on you to make a $3 donation today? Everything you contribute will go to helping us win back the Senate for Democrats and protect the Supreme Court.
We’re not the only ones who know you have to win in Michigan to win the Senate -- Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight is reporting that the only way Democrats will take away Mitch McConnell’s majority is if we win here first.
A recent poll has us down by nearly two points of our far-right opponent, and with the future of the Senate on the line, we’re still $124,847 short of our last end-of-quarter goal before the election. And in a race this tight, every dollar counts.
With only days to go until we have to close the books on our LAST quarter, we need a grassroots swell of support right now. Can you rush a gift of $3 (or whatever you can) to help us secure a win in Michigan, make sure Democrats win back the Senate and protect the Supreme Court?

"Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
We’re less than 72 hours away from closing the books on our May fundraising. It’s why our team set a goal to raise $65,000 but we’ve only raised $9,274 since Gary wrote to you.
Can Gary count on you to make sure we don’t fall short? Here’s a link to donate: [[URL REDACTED]]
\----Forwarded message----
Friend – as May comes to a close, I want to give you an update on our race in Michigan.
For the last few months, with the help of Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell, my extreme right-wing opponent has outraised us, breaking fundraising records along the way.
With recent polling showing my opponent and me neck and neck, the DeVos family dumped nearly $1 million into Michigan to buy this seat for Mitch McConnell and the GOP.
The hard truth is that according to Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight, Democrats will lose our only chance at taking back the Senate if I lose in Michigan.
Will you make a contribution $3 or more now to defend Michigan's Senate seat and take back the Senate for Democrats?
I've got to tell you, watching Mitch McConnell call the shots in Washington is infuriating. The damage he's doing to our judicial system, including the Supreme Court, will have consequences for generations to come.
So frankly, friend, it's never been more important for Democrats to take back the Senate. And according to CBS News, a Democratic Senate majority will come down to what happens here in Michigan.
That's why we’ve set a goal to raise $65,000 for our end-of-month goal. But right now, we’re falling short of what we need to win.
I wouldn't ask if it weren't critically important: Will you rush $3 or more right now – every dollar you can – to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

"Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Friend: We have some MAJOR updates on Gary's race in Michigan.
FIRST: Our right-wing opponent outraised Gary for the FOURTH quarter in a row -- making Gary the only Democratic senator to be outraised last quarter.
THEN: The Michigan Senate race rating was DOWNGRADED from Lean Democratic to TOSS UP.
NOW: With Senate control hinging on what happens in Michigan, polls show our race in a statistical TIE.
In a race as close as this, with the future of the Senate and the Supreme Court at stake, falling short is simply not an option. Our team set a rapid-response goal to raise $50,000 immediately but we’re falling too far behind. Help us win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats by donating:

"Every dollar triple-matched today will help decide Senate control
Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
This can’t wait, friend: Thanks to special interests and Mitch McConnell, I was just outraised for the FOURTH quarter in a row – and my team just let me know that we're falling dangerously short of our $75,000 rapid-response goal to close our fundraising gap.
We’re exactly $12,913 short of our goal to win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats. But with just hours until our midnight deadline, we're not on track to come up with what we need to win.
That's why a group of committed donors is upping their offer, but ONLY until midnight: I just got the word that every dollar given until midnight tonight will now be TRIPLE-MATCHED to win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats.
Friend, we MUST take complete advantage of this rare triple-match opportunity because Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight reports that what happens here in Michigan will determine Senate control for the next two years – and a recent poll shows me TIED with my Trump-endorsed opponent.
There is too much at stake to sit on the sidelines: Every dollar triple-matched today will help decide Senate control for Democrats, so rush $3 or more – while every $1 becomes $3 – to defend Michigan's Democratic Senate seat, take back the Senate and protect the future of the Supreme Court!

Team: With voting already underway in Michigan, the latest New York Times/Siena poll has Sen. Gary Peters (D) leading by JUST 1 POINT.
And Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight and CBS News analysts report Democrats have ZERO chance to take back the Senate if we lose in Michigan.

Friend: CBS is reporting that the next two years of Senate control all hinge on what happens in Michigan.
That's why Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump have helped funnel millions to buy Michigan's Senate seat. They know winning in Michigan means tightening the GOP's grip on the Senate and on the Supreme Court.

"Kamala knows Democrats CANNOT afford to win the White House without flipping the Senate
""Please, Michigan, send Gary Peters back to the United States Senate."" -Sen Kamala Harris. Chip in now to support Gary >>
Friend – Winning in Michigan is so important that Sen. Kamala Harris is ALL IN to help Gary defeat his Trump-backed opponent.
Kamala knows Democrats CANNOT afford to win the White House without flipping the Senate – and CBS News reports that Democrats have ZERO chance at taking back the Senate if Gary loses in Michigan.
But recent polling shows Gary nearly TWO POINTS BEHIND his far-right opponent, and RealClearPolitics moved his race from “Leans Dem” to “Toss Up.”
Gary has been outraised by his hard-right opponent FIVE TIMES IN A ROW – and with McConnell, Trump, the DeVos family and now the Koch family funneling MILLIONS of dollars into Michigan's Senate race to keep their GOP Senate majority, we cannot afford to be outraised again.
“I do believe a path toward victory in this election runs straight through Michigan.” – Sen. Kamala Harris
We need a MASSIVE grassroots movement to join forces with Kamala Harris in protecting Michigan's Senate seat! That's why we set an 11:59 p.m. deadline to raise $20,000 – but we’re still falling $6,354 short, and we're running out of time.
Will you give $3 or more now to win in Michigan, flip the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court from Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump?

Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Team, making sure you saw Gary's note: we're still $1,530 short of our $12,500 goal.
Trump and his allies are determined to buy Gary's seat and keep Mitch McConnell's grip on the Senate. And they'll spend any amount to make it happen. This is an urgent moment to step up, friend -- please chip in $3 or whatever you can spare right away.

Friend: With the help of Donald Trump and Betsy DeVos' family, my extreme right-wing opponent has outraised us – for the FOURTH quarter in a row. The GOP has dumped MILLIONS of dollars into the Michigan race to buy this Senate seat, defeat me and guarantee a Senate majority for Mitch McConnell.
Friend, here’s the good news: Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight reports Democrats can take back the Senate! But our only path to Senate control starts with winning here in Michigan, and recent polling has me nearly TWO POINTS BEHIND my Trump-backed opponent.

"The other day, President Trump personally called Gary a ""Do-nothing Democrat.""
Hi friend, I wanted to take a moment and reach out to you about my husband Gary.
First of all, from the bottom of my heart, I want to say thank you for being a part of this team to help Gary win in Michigan. It means the world to have you fighting so hard alongside us. I don't need to tell you that this race is one of the biggest in the entire country — even Donald Trump himself is focused on winning in Michigan and defeating Gary.
The other day, President Trump personally attacked Gary, calling him a ""Do-nothing Democrat."" Now, the president is known for two things: his nicknames and his lies. But he doesn't know a thing about my husband. I want to tell you exactly who Gary Peters is:
He's the Senator who fights tirelessly for workers and small businesses. He’s the public servant pushing for quality, affordable health care coverage where insurance companies can no longer discriminate because of pre-existing conditions. And as a product of Michigan’s public schools, Gary has always fought for students and has continued to give them the tools they need to reach their full potential.
That's my husband – he's a fighter. For Michigan and our country. But right now, he's in the midst of his toughest election ever.
The stakes of this race have never been higher. Another two years of a Republican-held Senate means two more years of Mitch McConnell calling the shots in Washington. That means he and Donald Trump will team up to put more extremist justices like Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court, and you can bet they’ll keep trying to dismantle protections for those with preexisting conditions.
My husband's been in tough election fights before, and he's all in to do it again. Believe me, Gary's going to fight tooth and nail to defend this Senate seat – but I'm making a personal ask for you to invest in this fight, too.
Gary's up against the likes of Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and nearly $1 million in dark money from the DeVos family, all vying to buy this seat for the GOP. That's why I'm reaching out to you today.
His team told me we need to raise another $7,500 by midnight, but right now, we're not quite there. Please, will you consider making a contribution to reelect my husband Gary, win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats?
Here's the best link to donate – whatever you give will go toward keeping Michigan blue and taking back the Senate for Democrats: [[URL REDACTED]]
From the bottom of my heart, thank you. Now let's go win this thing.

"I was the only Democratic senator to be outraised last quarter.
Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
There's no way of sugarcoating this, friend: I was the only Democratic senator to be outraised this summer – and our Trump- and DeVos-backed opponent outraised us five times in a row. Friend, it couldn't have come at a worse time, with a brand-new poll from the New York Times showing me only ONE POINT ahead of my far-right opponent.
With analysts at CBS News reporting that Michigan’s Senate race will decide Senate control, we’ll have zero chance of taking back the Senate if we lose this seat. It's why right-wing interests from Donald Trump to Mitch McConnell to the DeVos family are funneling in over $30 million to buy this Senate seat.
I’m no stranger to tough fights: Fighting for the people of Michigan is the greatest honor of my life, and I do not plan on ceding this seat to a right-wing extremist.
But if we're going to win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats, we CANNOT afford to keep being outraised. That's why my team set a goal to raise $500,000 before our last FEC filing deadline of the campaign at midnight tomorrow to make up our fundraising gap. And after hearing how important this race is, a group of donors offered to MATCH every contribution made between now and the deadline!
Our opponent has the full force of GOP special interests behind him – but I have you. So I'm asking: Before midnight, can I count on you to contribute $3 or more now – every dollar you can spare – and have every dollar DOUBLED to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

"Friend, my opponent just joined Donald Trump on stage in Michigan after attacking me in a final effort to flip this seat and keep the GOP’s hold on the Senate -- and what's more, Trump told his supporters that a vote for my far-right opponent is a ""very important vote.""
My opponent backs Donald Trump “2,000%” which is why Republicans like McConnell and the DeVos family are funneling in over $40 MILLION to buy this seat. And their attacks are working: Recent polling shows me two points behind my far-right opponent.
Friend, Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight says Senate control is on the line in Michigan. If you're ready to defend this seat and take back the Senate AND the White House for Democrats, I need your help to reach every last Michigan voter before the polls close tomorrow.

"We owe it to each other to elect real, courageous leaders to the Senate.
Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Friend,
For years, we’ve looked to our leaders in Washington to protect our communities -- asking them to have the courage to act not only in times of tragedy but in times of peace.
And yet, we’ve seen years of pushback. Mitch McConnell and his Republican-held Senate have ignored our demands for change, offering thoughts and prayers without action. Worse yet, he has actively blocked commonsense gun safety legislation at every turn.
Friend, we owe it to each other to elect leaders with real courage to the Senate, leaders who can’t be scared off from the mission to make our families safer. And it starts with Gary Peters, which is why Giffords PAC is proud to endorse him for Senate.
I'm asking you for your help, friend. We can’t elect a gun safety majority to the Senate without re-electing my friend and one of the Senate’s most effective leaders, Gary Peters. Can you chip in $3 to help keep Michigan blue?

For several years, I had the privilege of working alongside Gary when we both served in the House of Representatives. He has always worked incredibly hard, winning tough races and doing what’s right for Michiganders. But even a leader like Gary can’t weather this election without support.
Donald Trump and his allies have been funneling millions into Michigan in an attempt to prop up Gary's extreme right-wing opponent -- who sides with the NRA over Michiganders -- buy this election and tighten Mitch McConnell's grip on the Senate. They’re the reason Gary’s opponent has outraised him three straight quarters in a row.
Winning against powerful outside forces is never easy -- but one of the most enduring lessons I’ve learned in life is that we overcome our most difficult challenges with the support of others. If we’re going to keep Michigan blue, flip the Senate and finally see real leadership to end our nation’s gun violence crisis, we need to stand together.
So before I go, friend, I want to ask you one last time to join me and the amazing grassroots donors across the country who are stepping up to support Gary Peters today. Are you in?
Winning this battleground state won’t be easy -- but we can do it together. It’s such an honor to be in this fight with you!
All my best,
Gabby Giffords

THIS IS URGENT, team: Mitch McConnell's super PAC just announced a new ad buy of nearly $4 MILLION against Gary Peters. This couldn't come at a worse time, when CNN just named Michigan as one of the Senate seats most likely to flip this year.
This is deeply concerning because CBS News reports Democrats have ZERO chance of taking back the Senate if we lose in Michigan.
With Senate control and the future of the Supreme Court at stake, we can't afford to fall further behind. But Gary has been outraised by his far-right opponent time and time again, and GOP billionaires including the DeVos family and the Koch family are funneling in OVER $30 MILLION to buy Michigan's Senate seat.
That's why we just launched an emergency $20,000 fundraising push to combat this new surge of right-wing spending – but right now we're falling WAY short.
Can we count on you to contribute $3 or more now – every dollar you can spare – to win in Michigan, flip the Senate blue and protect the future of the Supreme Court from Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump?

"We're being outspent on the airwaves.
Take a look at who’s trying to buy Michigan’s Senate seat for the GOP:
* Our Trump-backed opponent  has launched a multi-million dollar  ad blitz in Michigan.
* Mitch McConnell’s  dark money group is spending a new  $9 million  against our campaign.
* And the  DeVos family super PAC  has spent  nearly $6 million  in TV ads attacking Gary.
Thanks to over 20 Republican aligned groups spending big in Michigan to buy Gary’s seat for McConnell, we’re officially being outspent on the airwaves just as Michiganders begin voting. And now, RealClearPolitics moved this race from  “Leans Dem”  to “Toss Up.”  With a recent poll showing Gary nearly TWO POINTS BEHIND, this Senate seat could swing in the Republicans’ favor.
With Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight reporting that Democrats have ZERO chance to take back the Senate if Gary loses, we need your help. We need to raise another $20,000 today to close this spending gap – but we’re already falling WAY short of what we need to win.
Our opponent may have Donald Trump, Betsy DeVos’ family, and Mitch McConnell,  but we have supporters like you,  friend. Will you contribute $3 or more now – every dollar you can spare – to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court from Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump?

"Trump and McConnell will stop at nothing to defeat me
Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Friend – Despite unprecedented support for our campaign in Michigan, my extreme right-wing GOP opponent has broken fundraising records and outraised us for the FIFTH straight reporting period.
This is thanks to Donald Trump funneling MILLIONS into Michigan to defeat me and buy this seat to expand Mitch McConnell’s majority in the Senate.
I won't mince words: Democrats cannot take back the Senate if we lose in Michigan. Period. That's why the GOP has made it clear they will stop at nothing to defeat me.
I'm counting on supporters like you, friend: Please rush $3 or more now to defend Michigan's Senate seat and take back the Senate for Democrats.
We can’t afford any more years of a Republican Senate – they’ve already confirmed two extreme right-wing justices to the Supreme Court and threatened to dismantle affordable health care. It's never been more important for Democrats to win back the Senate majority.
Friend, here’s the good news: Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight reports Democrats can take back the Senate. But first we have to win here in Michigan.
Recent polling shows me TWO POINTS BEHIND my far-right opponent – and in a race this close, every single dollar matters. If we're going to win and take back the Senate, we cannot fall further behind.
What we do right now could be the difference between winning and losing. Please, will you rush $3 or more to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

"I just got off a phone call with my campaign manager, team, and I need to tell you right away what we’re seeing right now in Michigan:
Another poll was released showing me trailing my Trump-backed opponent by nearly two points -- and Mitch McConnell is jumping at the chance to buy my seat, because experts are reporting that if Democrats lose in Michigan, we’ll lose the Senate.
Our finance team did the math, and after flooding Michigan with even more attack ads, McConnell’s groups are now spending a combined $25,000,000 to try to unseat me. This unprecedented surge of GOP spending in Michigan is set to make our race the most expensive in state history -- and we’re set to be OUTSPENT on TV ads in the final days of the race.
I’ll be honest, friend: It’s going to take a lot of grassroots donations to be able to fight back against this final onslaught of attacks. We need to raise at least $50,000 before 11:59 p.m. to be able to fight back. Can you rush an emergency gift of $3 or more now to make sure we win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats?

The bad news: We just found out that we were outraised for the FIFTH time in a row -- right after RealClearPolitics downgraded our race from “Lean Democrat” to “Toss Up.”
The good news: I know together we can protect this seat -- and even the experts at CBS News say we can flip the Senate but only if we win in Michigan.
The big news: With polling showing us tied with my Trump- and DeVos-backed opponent, we’re running out of time to close the fundraising gap.
Where you can help: Yesterday my team set our biggest rapid-response goal of the campaign: an immediate $80,000 in grassroots contributions. Supporters like you started stepping up right away because they know we were the ONLY Democratic Senator to be outraised last quarter -- but we need a surge of grassroots support right now if we’re going to reach this critical goal.

Friend – we’re 50 days away from Election Day, and with Republicans going all out to flip this seat, I need to give you an update on our race in Michigan.
For over a year, Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and the DeVos family have funneled MILLIONS of dollars into Michigan to buy this seat. Every step of the way, my extreme right-wing opponent has outraised me – making me the only Democratic senator outraised last quarter.
And after constant GOP attacks and a massive flow of dark money being spent against me, a new poll now shows me trailing by nearly 2 points – and RealClearPolitics moved our race from “Leans Dem” to “Toss-Up.”
The honest truth is that Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight is right: Democrats have ZERO chance to take back the Senate if we lose here in Michigan. My far-right opponent knows it too – and that's why Trump has come back to Michigan again and again to try and flip this seat.
So I’m asking for your help today: Our team set a goal to raise $50,000 from grassroots supporters by our mid-month deadline, but we’re falling $3,423 short of our daily goal – and I’m counting on your help to close the gap immediately: Will you contribute $3 or more now to help me win in Michigan, take back the Senate and protect the future of the Supreme Court from Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell?

BREAKING: Mitch McConnell to host private megadonor fundraiser for Gary's right-wing opponent TONIGHT.
Analysts at CBS News say Democrats have ZERO chance to win the Senate if we lose in Michigan – and it's clear that Mitch McConnell will do ANYTHING to make that happen.
After funneling millions of dollars into buying this seat, McConnell just told Fox News he's ""very optimistic"" about flipping Michigan red and is calling Gary's seat a key pick-up for the GOP.
With a new poll showing Gary down nearly 2 points, and RealClearPolitics moving this race from ""Leans Dem"" to ""Toss-Up,"" Mitch McConnell's efforts could be the tipping point in this race – unless we fight back NOW.

I'm grateful for everything you've already done to support Gary and keep Michigan blue, and I'd be honored if you joined us at this special event.
Let me be clear: We've got to do everything we can to defend Gary’s seat and make sure Democrats take back the Senate and protect the future of the Supreme Court, because now more than ever, the future of our country is on the line.
The GOP is doing whatever they can to buy Michigan’s Senate seat -- including Betsy DeVos’ family pouring nearly one million dollars into attack ads against Gary -- because they know if they flip Michigan, they’ll hand Mitch McConnell control of the Senate for another two years.
But if we come together, we can make sure Gary gets another six years fighting for Michigan’s working families in the U.S. Senate.
You won’t hear him brag about it, but I will: Gary is a fifth-generation Michigander who’s poured his heart into the fight to protect the Great Lakes, defend protections for people with pre-existing health conditions, lower prescription drug costs and expand quality, affordable health care.
November’s election will determine who will represent Michiganders in the halls of Congress: A proven and effective leader like Gary -- or his extremist far-right opponent who stands with Trump “2000%” including gutting health care protections for 1.7 million Michiganders with pre-existing conditions.
We have a real chance to reelect Gary and flip the Senate this year -- but we can’t afford to leave anything on the field, Friend. So we must come together. And I hope you'll be able to join me and Gary at our virtual grassroots fundraiser.
If you're able to, please make a donation right now to help reelect Gary and see us at our grassroots fundraiser on October 13th.
Thanks for being a part of this,
Elizabeth

Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Did you get Gary’s note, friend?
Our Trump-backed opponent just outraised us for the FOURTH quarter in a row, thanks to Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and Betsy DeVos’ family funneling money into Michigan. We’ve set a rapid-response goal to raise $75,000 immediately to make up our shortfall, but we can’t get it done without your support.
Can you rush $3 or whatever you can afford today?
Thanks,
Peters for Michigan
\----Forwarded message----
Friend: Thanks to special interests and Mitch McConnell, our Trump-backed opponent just outraised us for the FOURTH quarter in a row. That means that for the past YEAR we’ve been outpaced on fundraising every step of the way – and with a recent poll showing this race TIED, losing in Michigan would make it nearly impossible for Democrats to take back the Senate.
That's because Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight reports Democrats have ZERO chance to flip the Senate if we lose in Michigan. And with President Trump, Mitch McConnell and the DeVos family funneling MILLIONS into this race, losing could be a real possibility.
So I’m going to tell it to you straight, friend: We CANNOT afford to keep being outraised. That's why my team set a rapid-response goal to raise $75,000 immediately to make up our shortfall, but right now we're falling short of what we need to win.
In a race this close, with the future of the Senate on the line, I'm counting on your immediate contribution: Will you make a contribution of $3 or more now – every dollar you can spare before midnight – to win in Michigan, take back Senate control and protect the future of the Supreme Court from Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump?

Coming up short isn’t an option. What we do now will determine whether Democrats take control of the Senate or Mitch McConnell gets at least two more years of power.
Senate control depends on you joining this fight, friend. Please, stand with me when I need you most.

I hope you got my wife Colleen's note from the other day. She’s my partner and my closest advisor -- I'm so lucky to have her in my life and for everything she does.

Hi friend, I wanted to take a moment and reach out to you about my husband Gary.
First of all, from the bottom of my heart, I want to say thank you for being a part of this team to help Gary win in Michigan. It means the world to have you fighting so hard alongside us. I don't need to tell you that this race is one of the biggest in the entire country — even Donald Trump himself is focused on winning in Michigan and defeating Gary.
Just the other day, President Trump personally attacked Gary, calling him a ""Do-nothing Democrat."" Now, the president is known for two things: his nicknames and his lies. But he doesn't know a thing about my husband. I want to tell you exactly who Gary Peters is:
He's the Senator who fights tirelessly for workers and small businesses. He’s the public servant pushing for quality, affordable health care coverage where insurance companies can no longer discriminate because of pre-existing conditions. And as a product of Michigan’s public schools, Gary has always fought for students and has continued to give them the tools they need to reach their full potential.
That's my husband – he's a fighter. For Michigan and our country. But right now, he's in the midst of his toughest election ever.
The stakes of this race have never been higher. Another two years of a Republican-held Senate means two more years of Mitch McConnell calling the shots in Washington. That means he and Donald Trump will team up to put more extremist justices like Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court, and you can bet they’ll keep trying to dismantle protections for those with preexisting conditions.
My husband's been in tough election fights before, and he's all in to do it again. Believe me, Gary's going to fight tooth and nail to defend this Senate seat – but I'm making a personal ask for you to invest in this fight, too.
Gary's up against the likes of Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and nearly $1 million in dark money from the DeVos family, all vying to buy this seat for the GOP. That's why I'm reaching out to you today.
His team told me we need to raise another $7,500 by midnight, but right now, we're not quite there. Please, will you consider making a contribution to reelect my husband Gary, win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats?
Here's the best link to donate – whatever you give will go toward keeping Michigan blue and taking back the Senate for Democrats: [[URL REDACTED]]
From the bottom of my heart, thank you. Now let's go win this thing.

Friend: CBS is reporting that the next two years of Senate control all hinge on what happens in Michigan.
That's why Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump have helped funnel millions to buy Michigan's Senate seat. They know winning in Michigan means tightening the GOP's grip on the Senate and on the Supreme Court.
But right now, polling has Gary Peters TWO POINTS BEHIND his Trump-backed extremist opponent -- and CNN is reporting that Gary's seat is one of the most likely to flip.
Democrats CANNOT take back the Senate without winning in Michigan -- but we’ll fall short on resources if we don't raise another $13,692 by 11:59 p.m. TONIGHT.
We can’t win without supporters like you, friend. What you do right now can help decide the fate of Senate control: So please, will you rush $3 or more to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Friend, this is it. Our campaign is facing another huge FEC filing deadline at 11:59 p.m. tonight – and if we don't hit our goal of raising another $7,879 by then, our right-wing, Trump-backed opponent will outraise us for the FIFTH straight reporting period.
With a recent poll showing our race tied and with only hours to spare, we're falling short of what we need to win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats.

With analysts at CBS News reporting that Michigan will decide Senate control, right-wing interests from Donald Trump to Mitch McConnell to Betsy DeVos' ultra-wealthy family have funneled MILLIONS into Michigan to buy this seat for my extremist opponent. They know their Senate majority hinges on what happens here in Michigan.
That's why – with right-wing interests continually outraising us – I won't be able to win in November without your grassroots support now. So please, before our 11:59 p.m. FEC deadline, will you rush a donation to defend Michigan's Democratic Senate seat?
Rush $3 or more now– every dollar you can spare – to help keep our ads on the air, defend Michigan’s Senate seat and flip the Senate for Democrats. Every dollar you give now could be the difference between winning and losing this election.
With your support, I know we have what it takes to win in Michigan and take back Senate control for Democrats – and away from Mitch McConnell. Thanks for making sure we aren’t outraised again.

Here's what you need to know about Michigan’s Senate race:
* John James, a hard-right extremist who says he backs Trump “2,000%,” just won the GOP primary to take on Democrat Sen. Gary Peters.
* James has outraised Gary five times in a row thanks to Donald Trump, Betsy DeVos’ family and Mitch McConnell funneling in MILLIONS to buy this seat for the GOP.
* RealClearPolitics just moved this race from “Lean Dem” to “Toss Up” – and a brand-new poll shows Gary's opponent UP BY TWO POINTS!
Gary is the ONLY Democratic senator who was outraised last quarter, and Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight reports Democrats have ZERO chance to take back the Senate if Gary loses. That’s why we set an 11:59 p.m. deadline to raise $25,000 – but we’re already falling WAY short of what we need to win.
This is the most important election of our lifetimes, and we need your help: Will you contribute $3 or more now – every dollar you can spare – to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court from Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump?

"I'm writing to you with an important update, folks:
John James, the hard-right extremist who has said he backs Trump “2,000%,” won the GOP primary for Michigan's Senate seat.
On top of that, he’s backed by Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and Betsy DeVos’ billionaire family.
CBS News and Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight are reporting that Democrats can only win back the Senate if we first win in Michigan, so we need to secure this seat to ensure victory in November.
Yesterday, we set a rapid-response goal to raise $50,000 immediately, but I just checked in with my team, and we’re falling $26,381 short. Thankfully, a group of fired-up donors is stepping up to personally MATCH every donation to close our budget shortfall, win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats.
Friend – Senate control is on the line here in Michigan: Can I count on you to rush $3 now (becomes $6) to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?
I don’t scare easily, friend – the Republican Party can throw everything they want at me. But I’m now the most-attacked Democratic senator up this year AND the only Democratic senator to be outraised last quarter. We’re up against some serious money and recent polls have us TIED with our Trump-backed opponent.
Democrats MUST win back a Senate majority – and it's possible. This election is our greatest chance yet, but only if we win here in Michigan. So with a group of donors offering to match all donations, I'm asking you to step up too and make an impact that will go twice as far. I wouldn't ask if it weren't critically important:
Will you make a contribution of $3 or more now and have every dollar of it DOUBLED to defend Michigan's Senate seat, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

I'll be blunt, friend: We can't afford to send Joe Biden to the White House without a Democratic Senate majority. But with our party's convention just days away, flipping the Senate will be an uphill climb.
That's because Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight reports Democrats have ZERO chance to take back the Senate if we lose here in Michigan. And after RealClearPolitics just moved this race from “Leans Dem” to “Toss Up,”
brand-new polling shows our race is statistically tied.
We have been outraised five times in a row by my right-wing opponent – and with Trump, McConnell and the DeVos family funneling in millions to buy this Senate seat, we can't afford to take any risks.
If Democrats are going to head into next week's convention ready to defeat Donald Trump and flip the Senate, we MUST immediately close our fundraising gap in Michigan.

Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and the DeVos family are funneling in over $30 MILLION into Michigan to try and buy this seat for the GOP.

With voting already underway, a new poll show Gary trailing his far-right opponent by nearly trailing by two points – and the DeVos family's super PAC just announced they'll spend another ONE MILLION DOLLARS to tip the scales of this razor-thin race!

"Friend, with only a few days left in our fight to defend Gary’s seat and take back the Senate, one of the most important things you can do right now is chip in $5. Let me explain why:
Our final Get Out the Vote budget decisions are being made in the next couple days, and these are our most important. In other words, if fundraising continues to slow down before Election Day, that could translate into trimming down our voter persuasion operation, and even scaling back our ads.
What’s more, our Trump-backed opponent and his allies aren’t slowing down a bit. Gary was outraised for four of the last five quarters -- and to tip the scales in this race, the DeVos family and right-wing groups are funneling in OVER $30 MILLION to buy this seat for McConnell and Trump.
After talking with Gary and the team, we've set a goal to raise another $30,000 by midnight to win in Michigan and keep this seat blue. Your $5 can make all the difference in getting us there. Can you chip in now?

You know the stakes, friend. Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight reports Democrats have zero chance at taking back the Senate if we lose in Michigan. It's moments like this – right here, right now – that will determine whether we defend this seat and take back the Senate.
But 13% of Michigan voters are still undecided, and the New York Times reports that “Michigan stands out as a place where winning the middle could make the difference.”
With less than a week to turn things around, we can’t afford to fall short on resources to reach as many voters as possible right away.
Pitch in $5 now to help us defend Michigan's Senate seat, fight this right-wing spending funneled in by Trump and the DeVos family and take back the Senate for Democrats.
Thanks for stepping up when it matters most,

Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and the DeVos family funneled TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS into Michigan to try and buy this seat for the GOP.
NOW:
With voting already underway, a brand-new poll from the New York Times show Gary Peters just ONE POINT ahead of his Trump-backed opponent!
We urgently need to make up ground if we're going to have any chance at taking back the Senate. After hearing how important this race is, a group of donors offered to match every contribution between now and our final FEC filing deadline tomorrow night -- up to $500,000! Rush $3 or more now -- and have every dollar DOUBLED -- to defend Michigan’s Senate seat, take back the Senate and protect the future of the Supreme Court!

"The most important race happening in 2020 is for control of the Senate.
Friend,
Gary Peters' reelection to the Senate this fall in Michigan will be one of the closest races this November -- and guess who has their thumb on the scale. The DeVos family -- i.e., the family of Betsy DeVos, Secretary of Education -- is hoping they can buy this Senate seat in Michigan by spending almost $1 million to unseat my friend Gary and put in his place their hand-picked choice, John James.
We already know how dangerous the DeVos family has been, and the super PAC ""Better Future Michigan"" has seven donors who are members of the DeVos family. What's more,  the super PAC is spending over $9 million on TV ads against us.
Gary is a fighter for Michigan and my progressive ally in the Senate, and he needs our help: We need to raise $10,000 for Gary Peters right away -- and I'll be honest: I've looked at the map, and I can't see how we take the majority if we lose this seat. Donate $3 or more now to fund the fight to reelect Gary and fight back against the DeVos family's dangerous plans for Michigan.
If you've saved payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Click to donate $3.
Click to donate $25.
Click to donate $50.
Or click here to donate another amount.
Why is the DeVos family so invested in unseating Gary Peters? Well, for one he's taking on Betsy DeVos and her wasteful spending at the Department of Education -- he pressed for answers back in December as to why 72 charter schools in Michigan never opened despite receiving nearly $21 million in federal start-up funds.
Gary believes like I do that students and families come first -- and for all the charter schools that closed or failed to open, communities missed out on more than half a billion dollars in resources that could have benefitted neighborhood schools. Gary knows her leadership is leaving students and families worse off -- and her family wants him out because of it.
They know he's watching and fighting for teachers, students, and families -- and they're scared. That's why their hand-picked choice to unseat Gary, John James, said Betsy DeVos is doing a ""very, very good"" job as Secretary of Education. John James supports Betsy DeVos even as she planned to cut $9 billion in funding for education, including more than $100 million for Michigan's public schools.
After spending millions to gut Michigan's public school programs, and bigger plans to do more, she can't even say if it was worth it. On whether local schools in Michigan have gotten better, she said: ""I don't know. Overall, I -- I can't say overall.""
Republican outside groups including the DeVos family super PAC are dumping over $30 million into this race -- but it'll get even closer, and that's why Gary needs our help: Donate $3 or more now to help us raise $10,000 for Gary Peters.
Sincerely,
Chuck Schumer

"Are you with me?
Here's the deal, friend: Despite an outpouring of support, we've been outraised by my far-right opponent for four out of the last five quarters, thanks to Republicans like Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell, and Betsy DeVos' family funneling over $30 MILLION into Michigan to buy this seat for the GOP.
Analysts at CBS News report Senate control depends on our team winning in Michigan \-- and a recent poll shows me nearly two points BEHIND my far-right opponent. So a group of donors offered to match every contribution up to $250,000, but we still have $74,922 left to go.
We're running out of time to take advantage of this match opportunity, so will you rush $3 or more now – and double your impact in this race – to win in Michigan, take back Senate control and protect the future of the Supreme Court from Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump?
With just 15 days until Election Day, every donation could be the difference between winning and losing. Even just $3 (which becomes $6 if you give now) would go a long way to help us win.

"I was the only Democratic senator to be outraised last quarter.
Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
There's no way of sugarcoating this, friend: I was the only Democratic senator to be outraised last quarter – and this makes it the fifth straight reporting period that our Trump- and DeVos-backed opponent has outraised us. Friend, it couldn't have come at a worse time, with polls showing our race in a statistical tie.
With analysts at CBS News reporting that Michigan’s Senate race will decide Senate control, we’ll have zero chance of taking back the Senate if we lose this seat. It's why right-wing interests from Donald Trump to Mitch McConnell to the DeVos family are funneling in millions to buy this Senate seat.
I’m no stranger to tough fights: Fighting for the people of Michigan is the greatest honor of my life, and I do not plan on ceding this seat to a right-wing extremist.
But if we're going to win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats, we CANNOT afford to keep being outraised. That's why my team set a rapid-response goal to raise the remaining $21,843 before tomorrow at midnight to make up our shortfall, but right now, we're falling short of what we need to win.
Our opponent has the full force of GOP special interests behind him – but I have you. So I'm asking: Before midnight, can I count on you to contribute $3 or more now – every dollar you can spare – to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

In a race this close, fundraising is an important way campaigns can show their strength – and right now, we need to show the GOP that we won’t lose this election by raising the last $21,843 as soon as we can.
Thanks for fighting by my side for working families in Michigan and across the country.

"Take a look at who’s trying to buy Michigan’s Senate seat for the GOP:
* Our Trump-backed opponent  has launched a multi-million dollar  ad blitz in Michigan.
* Mitch McConnell’s  dark money group raised $92 million in September alone -- and Gary's seat is one of their top targets.
* And the  DeVos family super PAC  has spent over $9 million in TV ads attacking Gary.
Over 20 Republican-aligned groups are spending big in Michigan in the crucial final days of this campaign. And now, RealClearPolitics moved this race from  “Leans Dem”  to “Toss Up.”  With recent polling showing Gary TWO POINTS BEHIND his far-right opponent, this Senate seat could swing in the Republicans’ favor.
With Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight reporting that Democrats have ZERO chance to take back the Senate if Gary loses, we need your help -- and we only have FIVE DAYS left to secure this seat and keep Michigan blue.
Our opponent may have Donald Trump, Betsy DeVos’ family, and Mitch McConnell,  but we have supporters like you,  friend.

"The most important race happening in 2020 is for control of the Senate.
I will not be the first, nor will I be the last to tell you this, friends: The most important race happening in 2020 is for control of the Senate.
I have a front-row seat to the damage Mitch McConnell is causing in the Senate. He is blocking every last attempt at progress that our Democratic colleagues in the House are fighting so hard for – environmental protections, gun safety measures, affordable healthcare. If a Democrat wins the White House, they MUST have the Senate as well.
That's why I'm reaching out to you about Gary Peters' race in Michigan. Experts from FiveThirtyEight to Roll Call say Democrats can win back the Senate – but only if Gary wins in Michigan.
The thing is that Gary's reelection won't be easy. He's one of two Democratic Senate candidates fighting to win in a state President Trump carried. To top it all off, Gary is neck-and-neck with his hard-right opponent, handpicked by Trump and McConnell.
So here's the deal: I told Gary I'd help him raise $7,500 to protect Michigan's Democratic Senate seat, and we really need to hit that goal before midnight. Can I count on you to give now and help us take back the Senate majority?

THIS IS URGENT, team: The DeVos family super PAC just announced a new ad buy of over ONE MILLION DOLLARS against Gary Peters -- bring their total spending against Gary to over $8 MILLION!
This is deeply concerning because CBS News reports Democrats have ZERO chance of taking back the Senate if we lose in Michigan.
With Senate control and the future of the Supreme Court at stake, we can't afford to fall further behind. But Gary has been outraised by his far-right opponent four out of the last five quarters, and GOP billionaires including Mitch McConnell and the Koch family are funneling in OVER $30 MILLION to buy Michigan's Senate seat.
That's why we just launched an emergency $20,000 fundraising push to combat this new surge of right-wing spending – but right now we're falling WAY short.
Can we count on you to contribute $3 or more now – every dollar you can spare – to win in Michigan, flip the Senate blue and protect the future of the Supreme Court from Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump?

Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Hi friend, it's Joe, and I’m emailing you directly because I want you to hear this from me:
Democrats can’t take back the Senate from Mitch McConnell unless we defend Gary Peters’ seat in Michigan -- and we can’t defend his seat without supporters like you. So please: Can you split a $3 donation (or whatever you can) between Gary and the Biden-Harris campaign to help Democrats win in November?
The mission of my campaign for the presidency has been clear since day one: Win the battle for the soul of our nation. And I don’t need to tell you that if we’re going to beat Donald Trump come Election Day, we’ve got to make every one of the next 18 days count.
But winning the battle for the soul of the nation is about more than just beating Trump. If we want to create a better future for America that I know is possible, we must flip the Senate and the White House -- and that means reelecting Gary Peters AND defeating Trump in Michigan. Make a donation to our campaigns today →
Gary has always been a champion for American manufacturing and for affordable, quality health care. And as our country faces tough challenges, I know for a fact that Michigan families can continue to count on Gary to put them first.
What I’m less sure of is whether or not Gary’s campaign will be able to hit their grassroots fundraising goal before midnight -- and it’s absolutely critical that they do. Gary’s far-right opponent has outraised him quarter after quarter over the last year thanks to Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell funnelling in MILLIONS to buy his seat. Friend, it’s up to us to stop the GOP from buying Gary’s seat and two more years of Mitch McConnell calling the shots in Washington.
So what do you say? Early voting and vote by mail is already underway in Michigan, so there’s no time to waste: Can I please count on you to split a $3 donation between my campaign and Gary’s today?

Thank you from the bottom of my heart for fighting for Gary.

"We simply cannot let this happen again this year in Michigan.
Friend, in a moment  I’m going to ask you for a donation to defend Michigan’s Senate seat, and here’s why: The future of the Supreme Court is on the ballot, and the stakes couldn’t be higher.
The gravity of this moment is truly hard to grasp, but Americans will feel the consequences right away -- starting with the future of our health care.
Just one week after the election, the Supreme Court is slated to hear arguments in a Trump Administration-led lawsuit to undermine the Affordable Care Act. If the Court rules in their favor, 20 million Americans who have gained coverage from the ACA could lose it – and 1.7 million Michiganders with pre-existing conditions could see their health care protections gutted.
The Supreme Court is the last line of defense for health care protections for pre-existing conditions, for Roe v. Wade and women’s health care, for environmental protections, for voting rights and for ensuring workers interests are put before corporate special interests. Our next Supreme Court Justice will serve a lifetime appointment and they MUST reflect what the American people want.
But instead, Mitch McConnell is attempting to force through Trump’s nominee in the middle of an election, BEFORE the American people have their say.
It’s unconscionable. Here we are in the middle of an election, with ballots going out tomorrow in Michigan – a key battleground state for the presidential race, my U.S. Senate race and likely the Senate majority. Michigan voters must have their voices heard.
The stakes just got higher in our fight to defend my seat, which CBS reports will determine whether or not Democrats take back the Senate majority from Mitch McConnell. That’s why Trump and McConnell are funneling in MILLIONS to buy my seat for their hand-picked candidate, a far-right extremist who has called the ACA a “monstrosity” and says he backs Trump “2000%.”
I need you fighting back with me, friend, because the Supreme Court is on the ballot: Can I count on you to contribute $3 or more now – every dollar you can spare – to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?
There’s never been a more important moment for us to have the full strength of our grassroots supporters behind us. Thank you for stepping up.

"Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
I just got off the phone with our campaign manager, friend, and I have some bad news to share: This week, we were outspent 3:1 on the airwaves by our Trump and DeVos-backed opponent.
With our race downgraded from “Leans Democrat” to “Toss Up” and a brand-new poll showing my opponent two points AHEAD, this massive TV ad spending gap could tip the scales in our opponent’s favor.
In fact, Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight reports that Democrats have ZERO chance to take back the Senate if we lose in Michigan, so we have no time to waste. My team just set a rapid-response goal of $25,000 to help fund new TV ads -- but as I write this, we’re already falling way short.
I’m asking you now: Before 11:59 p.m., will you rush a gift of $3 or more now to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

"Donald Trump and the GOP are still working to dismantle this landmark health care law.
Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Friend,
More than 20 million Americans have gained health insurance since the Affordable Care Act was signed into law 10 years ago. And in just the last few months, nearly half a million Americans have turned to the ACA for coverage when they've lost their jobs.
Access to affordable health care is more important than ever. But that hasn't stopped Donald Trump and the GOP's efforts to dismantle this landmark health care law. In fact, they've doubled down, telling the Supreme Court just this week that the entire ACA “must fall.”
I was proud to vote for health care reform during my time in the House, and I’ll do everything I can to defend it in the Senate. That’s why I’m fighting any and all Republican attempts to weaken or dismantle the law – but I can't do it alone.
I’m looking for 10,000 folks to add your name, immediately: Please, click here to demand Congress protect affordable health care. The number of insured in this country should be going up, not down. If you agree, sign your name now.
The simple truth is that millions of Americans and Michiganders benefit from the ACA, whether it’s through their health insurance plan or protections from discrimination based on a preexisting condition.
But the GOP continues to attack affordable health care from every angle – in the courts, in Congress and through the power of the presidency – so I'm counting on you to join me in speaking out to defend health care for millions of Americans.
Please, add your name now to demand Congress protect affordable health care.
ADD MY NAME

Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
We’re running out of time, friend: With less than 60 days until the most important election in a generation, voters will soon start mailing in the ballots that will decide the future of the Senate, the White House and the Supreme Court.
But President Trump and his Republican allies are trying to suppress vote-by-mail efforts to increase their chances of winning on Election Day. We must fight back before they steal this election and the damage is done.
The cold hard facts – that Republicans deny again and again – are this: Vote-by-mail is the best way to keep voters safe on Election Day. We know it works – we've done it before and we can do it again. It’s of paramount importance we give every voter that opportunity, and that's why I'm reaching out for your help today.
We’re still 1,491 signatures short of our 50,000 goal to demand Congress pass vote-by-mail for every American voter. Early voting starts in just weeks – so it's critical we fight together to overcome the GOP's voter suppression tactics. Please, before 11:59 p.m., will you add your name next to mine to expand vote-by-mail?
SIGN THE PETITION
Donald Trump is sowing fear and division like we’ve never seen. We can’t afford to let him suppress votes and swing this election in his and Mitch McConnell's favor. This team is counting on you to join this fight right now.
Thanks for everything you do,
Gary

"I will not be the first, nor will I be the last to tell you this, friend. The party that wins control of the Senate in 2020 will determine the course of our nation for years to come.
The damage Mitch McConnell and his Republican majority have caused to our democracy is unfathomable and can be felt in every corner of the country. They have blocked progress on issues that affect us all – including key environmental protections, criminal justice reform, common sense gun safety measures, and affordable health care. This fall, Democrats have to win the White House and state legislative races, but they MUST also win the Senate. Our democracy is on the line.
That's why I'm reaching out to you about Gary Peters' race in Michigan. Experts from FiveThirtyEight to Roll Call say Democrats can win back the Senate – but only if Gary wins his race in Michigan.
It's important that we have leaders like Gary -- someone who isn't afraid to speak his mind and will take a comprehensive approach to dealing with the challenges we face as a nation. Gary is one of two Democratic senators fighting to win in a state carried by President Trump in 2016. To top it off, he is tied with his hard-right opponent, handpicked by Trump himself and Mitch McConnell.
So here's the deal: I told Gary I'd help him raise $10,000 to protect Michigan's Democratic Senate seat, and we really need to hit that goal before midnight. Can I count on you to give now and help us take back the Senate majority?
We can’t let Gary get outraised again: Will you donate $5 or more right now, and protect this seat from money pouring in from Betsy DeVos’ family?

"It’s Gretchen Whitmer. Do you have a second?
Friend,
Four years ago, Donald Trump won Michigan by only a few thousand votes -- and immediately, Democrats here got to work. Thanks to a swell of grassroots support, two years later we made massive progress with victories across Michigan.
And now once again, our battleground state of Michigan is in the spotlight as all eyes turn here to re-elect Senator Gary Peters. And this race couldn’t be more important -- analysts at CBS News are reporting that Democrats can’t win the Senate majority if we don’t first win here in Michigan.
Here’s the bad news: far-right billionaires like Betsy DeVos’ family are trying to buy Michigan’s Senate seat, and now Gary’s officially been outraised for four of the last five quarters. That's because the GOP is dumping millions of dollars to try and defeat Gary -- and if they succeed, we can say goodbye to the future of the Supreme Court and hello to at least two more years of Mitch McConnell calling the shots in Washington.
Gary is in the final two weeks before Election Day, so he reached out to ask me if I could help him close the gap on his $20,000 goal for today -- and right now, we’re still falling $13,582 short. Can you chip in $3 (or whatever you can) to make sure Gary doesn’t get outraised again so we can send him back to the Senate?

It’s never been more important for us to elect Democrats like Gary Peters who are going to continue fighting the good fight to move Michigan forward. And with control of the Senate and the future of the Supreme Court on the line, we need a fighter like Gary standing up for Michiganders in Washington.
So I’m asking one more time, friend -- with a recent poll showing Gary down by nearly two points, I’m asking you to donate $3 today to help secure victory for Gary Peters in Michigan to help us win back the Senate.
Sincerely,
Gretchen Whitmer
Governor of Michigan

"Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Folks –
Earlier this week, I wrote to you about our far-right opponent clinching the Republican nomination for this Senate seat.
And with less than three months to go, we're TIED with my Trump-endorsed opponent in a recent poll! That’s not all – a right-wing super PAC has dumped $1 million on ads attacking me in Michigan, and our race was downgraded from ""Lean Dem"" to ""Toss Up.""
Why does this matter? Because Democrats cannot take back the Senate if we lose in Michigan. Period.
But we have amazing news! A group of dedicated donors will match every contribution, up to our $50,000 goal, so we can protect Michigan's Senate seat. The catch: It goes away at midnight tonight.
Folks – this is an incredible opportunity: Can I count on you to rush $3 now (becomes $6) to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?
With Mitch McConnell at the helm, Senate Republicans have already confirmed two extreme right-wing justices to the Supreme Court and threatened to dismantle affordable health care. Honestly, it's never been more important for Democrats to win back the Senate majority.
We can do it. Democrats can take back the Senate, but ONLY if we win here in Michigan. That's why I'm counting on you to take full advantage of this rare match opportunity – whatever you donate will go twice as far to defend Michigan's Democratic Senate seat!
What you do right now is so important: Please, will you rush $3 (becomes $6) right now to have every dollar DOUBLED to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

Friend,
We can take back the Senate this November – but only if we do everything in our power to protect key Democratic incumbent seats.
With Trump and McConnell doing everything they can to protect their Senate majority, it’s going to be an uphill climb. In addition to making Michigan one of their #1 targets, they’re also laser-focused on five of my Senate colleagues: Doug Jones in Alabama, Jeanne Shaheen in New Hampshire, Tina Smith in Minnesota, Mark Warner in Virginia and Cory Booker in New Jersey.
If we lose even one of these seats, the future of the Senate -- and the Supreme Court -- will be put into jeopardy.
Friend, can you chip in $3 or more now – every dollar you can spare – to support Doug Jones, Jeanne Shaheen, Tina Smith, Mark Warner, Cory Booker and me in our reelection fights?
Across the nation, Washington Republicans are spending top dollar to ensure Mitch McConnell stays in charge of the Senate -- where he can continue dismantling health care protections, nominating far-right judges to the federal bench and blocking progress for those who need it most.
Here's the deal: These five colleagues of mine are all tireless champions of workers and families in their states and nationwide. If there's any hope of flipping the Senate, it starts with stepping up to defend these five senators from right-wing attacks.
Chip in $3 or more now to help reelect Doug Jones, Jeanne Shaheen, Tina Smith, Mark Warner, Cory Booker and me to the Senate.

Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and the DeVos family funneled TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS into Michigan to try and buy this seat for the GOP.

Here's the latest on what’s happening in Michigan's Senate race:
FIRST: Gary's far-right opponent outraised him five times in a row thanks to Donald Trump, Betsy DeVos’ family and Mitch McConnell funneling in MILLIONS to buy this seat for the GOP.
THEN: The DeVos family Super PAC announced they’re spending $4 million on ads in Michigan attacking Gary, and Trump gave his ""total and compete endorsement"" to Gary's opponent.
NOW: A Koch family super PAC just endorsed Gary's opponent and plans to flood Michigan with a six-figure ad buy!
It’s time to act. Even the experts across the country – like Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight, The New York Times and The Washington Post – all agree: If we lose this race here in Michigan, Democrats won’t be able to win the Senate majority. We need all hands on deck to hit a $10,000 rapid-response goal by midnight tonight -- but we’re already falling short.
Can Gary count on you to rush $3 or more now – every dollar you can spare – to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

Want to make sure you saw Gary's update, team.
We set a goal to add another 5,000 Founding Donors before we finalize the list at midnight, but we’re still 407 short. This is your last chance: Can you donate $3 or more now to become a Complete Ticket Founding Donor before we close the books?

Friend, today is the last day to become a Complete Ticket Founding Donor to this campaign.
With recent polls showing this race statistically tied and RealClearPolitics moving this race from “Leans Dem” to “Toss Up,” there’s never been a better moment to stake your claim in this campaign.
For more than a year, my Trump- and DeVos-backed opponent has outraised me, and in a race this close, closing this fundraising gap could be the difference between winning Michigan and taking back the Senate.
I’m counting on grassroots donors like you to step up before it’s too late \-- but it looks like you still haven’t chipped in to become a Complete Ticket Founding Donor.
Name: On file

Complete Ticket Founding Donor Status: No, not yet

"We just got some really bad news, friend: Gary’s seat was just added to Roll Call’s list of MOST vulnerable Senate seats in the final stretch of this race.
Here's why:
* Gary’s Trump-backed opponent has outraised us for four out of the last five quarters.
* GOP outside groups are spending over $30 million in our race right now.
* A brand-new poll shows our far-right opponent nearly  two points AHEAD!
With voting in Michigan already underway, we don't have much time to fix this -- and Democrats’ risk of losing the Senate is at an all time high.
Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight and CBS News analysts say the future of the Senate will be decided in Michigan. So with this alarming new announcement, we need all hands on deck -- and with just 15 days until Election Day and over a million Michiganders already casting their ballots, we can't afford to fall short on our fundraising goals.
Friend -- we’re running out of time before Election Day. Please rush an emergency gift of $3 or more right now to fight back against GOP spending in Michigan, defend Michigan's Senate seat and take back the Senate for Democrats!

Folks,
This morning I reached out in hopes of raising an emergency $25,000 before midnight to help fund critically-needed campaign ads -- but we're shy $8,630 of our goal.
Please, I’m asking you to step up right now and help us close the massive 3:1 spending gap we're seeing on the Michigan airwaves. Will you chip in $3 -- every dollar you can spare -- before midnight to help put us over the top?
Thanks,
Gary
\----Forwarded message----
I just got off the phone with our campaign manager, friend, and I have some bad news to share: We’re officially being outspent 3:1 on the airwaves by our Trump and DeVos-backed opponent.
With our race downgraded from “Leans Democrat” to “Toss Up” and recent polls showing this race in a statistical tie, this massive TV ad spending gap could tip the scales in our opponent’s favor.
In fact, Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight reports that Democrats have ZERO chance to take back the Senate if we lose in Michigan, so we have no time to waste. My team just set a rapid-response goal of $25,000 to help fund new TV ads -- but as I write this, we’re already falling way short.
I’m asking you now: Before 11:59 p.m., will you rush a gift of $3 or more now to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

"Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Friend,
This morning I questioned Donald Trump’s handpicked Postmaster General, Louis DeJoy, on the massive mail delays we’re seeing across the country. Here’s what came out of it:
* DeJoy will not bring back any mail sorting machines that have been removed -- even though we have seen delays as they have been removed.
* DeJoy’s decisions have cost Americans their health, their time, their livelihoods and their peace of mind.
* Senate Republicans are lying, stating that the complaint calls coming in about USPS service delays are a coordinated and organized effort by Democrats and not real.
Let me be clear: These mail delays are real concerns, they're not manufactured -- no matter what Senate Republicans say.
As we head into the fall, I want to assure the American public that the Postal Service is fully capable and committed to delivering the nation’s election mail on-time -- but right now, we aren’t.
Now, it’s up to Congress to fix this. Please, add your name next to mine in defending the Postal Service from the undermining we’re seeing from the Trump Administration.
There are still many questions left to be answered but I will continue my investigation into these delays and get the American people the answers they deserve.
Thank you,
Gary

"Hi friend,
My friend Gary just told me that he fell short on his latest fundraising goal. This isn’t what I wanted to hear with just ten days until Election Day -- especially when millions of Michiganders are already casting their ballots.
I’m worried, friend -- because we really need Gary to stay in the Senate to fight for Michiganders. What’s more, experts from CBS and Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight agree that if we lose Gary’s seat we have no hope of regaining Senate control for Democrats.
Michiganders can’t afford to lose Gary’s leadership in the Senate -- and we also can’t afford at least two more years of Mitch McConnell as Senate Majority Leader. We’re running out of time, so can you rush a gift of $3 or more now to help Gary defend his Senate seat?

Mitch McConnell and his groups know that Democrats can’t take back Senate control without Michigan -- that’s why they’re spending $25 million to unseat Gary. It’s also why Donald Trump just announced he’s holding ANOTHER rally here just seven days before Election Day.
I know what it’s like to fight for reelection against John James and his Republican billionaire allies. So take it from me: Reaching Gary’s emergency goal of $250,000 is critical to fueling his outreach to undecided voters in the final days of this election. We simply can’t afford to fall short again -- not with the future of the Senate on the line.
I’m asking you, friend: Can you chip in $3 or more now -- whatever you can spare -- to keep Gary fighting by my side for Michiganders?
Thank you for stepping up,
Debbie

I’ll be honest -- I’ve been incredibly energized by the Senate polls I’ve seen recently. But I’m worried about one.

Senator Peters took a strong stance last week against the politics of Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett, pledging his vote against her nomination to save the Affordable Care Act and reproductive rights.
But that decision was personal for him: Senator Peters, like millions of Americans, has a personal abortion story. When his first wife tragically miscarried their second child, the miscarriage put her life in danger.
Senator Peters knows that abortion is health care, and that health care -- in addition to coverage for pre-existing conditions, Medicaid for millions of Americans, young people on their parent’s insurance -- is at risk with the nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court.
Senator Peters is putting progress over politics to save our health care -- thank him by getting his back when he needs it most.
Gary is just 1% point up from his opponent in Michigan, and if we lose this seat we could lose the chance to take back the Senate: Donate $3 or more now before midnight tonight to support Gary Peters.
Sincerely,

Friend – Winning in Michigan is so important that Sen. Kamala Harris is ALL IN to help Gary defeat his Trump-backed opponent.
Kamala knows Democrats CANNOT afford to win the White House without flipping the Senate – and CBS News reports that Democrats have ZERO chance at taking back the Senate if Gary loses in Michigan.
But recent polling shows Gary TWO POINTS BEHIND his far-right opponent, and RealClearPolitics moved his race from “Leans Dem” to “Toss Up.”
Gary has been outraised by his hard-right opponent FIVE TIMES IN A ROW – and with McConnell, Trump, the DeVos family and now the Koch family funneling MILLIONS of dollars into Michigan's Senate race to keep their GOP Senate majority, we cannot afford to be outraised again.
“I do believe a path toward victory in this election runs straight through Michigan.” – Sen. Kamala Harris
We need a MASSIVE grassroots movement to join forces with Kamala Harris in protecting Michigan's Senate seat! That's why we set an 11:59 p.m. deadline to raise $15,000 – but we’re still falling $9,207 short, and we're running out of time.

"Friend,
There’s no doubt about it that Michigan will be the state to determine whether Mitch McConnell continues to run the Senate. Both CBS News and Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight are reporting that Democrats can only win back the Senate if we first win in Michigan, so we need to secure this seat to ensure victory in November.
The GOP knows that the road to the Senate runs through Michigan, so they’re pulling out all the stops to try and buy this seat. That means millions of dollars are flooding into our state with the help of Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and Betsy DeVos (among other far-right billionaires), and I’m now the most-attacked Democratic senator up this year.
I don’t scare easily, friend — the Republican Party can throw everything they want at me and I’ll never waver in my fight for Michigan’s working families. But we’re up against some serious money, and recent polls have us statistically tied with our Trump-backed opponent at the end of this month, so every second counts.
Tonight, we'll have to close the books on May, and it’s never been more important for our team of grassroots donors to step up. We’re still hoping to bring in another $11,723 before midnight to hit our end-of-month goal and stay on track to win in Michigan — can I count on you to make a contribution of $3 right now?

Team: CBS News reports Democrats have ZERO chance to flip the Senate if we lose in Michigan, and now a brand-new poll shows our hard-right extremist opponent nearly two points AHEAD of Gary.
Gary has been outraised four of the last five quarters because Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and the DeVos family are funneling MILLIONS to buy this seat for the GOP.
And now it's clear the GOP dark-money war chest is making a difference: RealClearPolitics just moved this race from “Leans Dem” to “Toss Up” – and CNN says this seat is one of the MOST LIKELY TO FLIP in November with just TEN DAYS left in this race.
Gary was the ONLY Democratic senator to be outraised last summer, and we can't afford to be outraised again. So we set an emergency goal to raise another $250,000 – but we's already falling short of what we need to win, and with Michiganders already casting their ballots by the thousands there's no time to spare.
This is the biggest election of our lifetimes, and we need your support: Will you contribute $3 or more now – every dollar you can spare – to win in Michigan, take back the Senate and protect the future of the Supreme Court from Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump?

"Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
This can’t wait, friend: Thanks to Republicans like Mitch McConnell and the DeVos family funneling millions into this race, I was outraised four of the last five quarters – and we just fell short of our must-hit fundraising goal for the first time this month.
With only NINE days until Election Day and nearly two million Michiganders already casting their ballots, there's no time to spare.
Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight reports that what happens here in Michigan will determine Senate control for the next two years – and a recent poll shows me TWO POINTS BEHIND my Trump-endorsed opponent.
There is too much at stake to sit on the sidelines: Every dollar chipped in right now will help decide Senate control for Democrats, so rush $3 or more now to defend Michigan's Democratic Senate seat, take back the Senate and protect the future of the Supreme Court!

"Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Did you see Gary’s note, team? Our far-right Trump-backed opponent is now outspending us 3:1 on TV ads.
If we want to catch up, we need to raise $25,000 IMMEDIATELY. Please pitch in $3 or more right now if you can spare it.
DONATE NOW
Thanks,
Team Peters
\----Forwarded message----
I just got off the phone with our campaign manager, friend, and I have some bad news to share: We’re officially being outspent 3:1 on the airwaves by our Trump and DeVos-backed opponent.
With our race downgraded from “Leans Democrat” to “Toss Up” and recent polls showing this race in a statistical tie, this massive TV ad spending gap could tip the scales in our opponent’s favor.
In fact, Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight reports that Democrats have ZERO chance to take back the Senate if we lose in Michigan, so we have no time to waste. My team just set a rapid-response goal of $25,000 to help fund new TV ads -- but as I write this, we’re already falling way short.
I’m asking you now: Before 11:59 p.m., will you rush a gift of $3 or more now to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

"My extreme right-wing opponent has outraised us
Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Friend: With the help of Donald Trump and Betsy DeVos' family, my extreme right-wing opponent has outraised us – for the FOURTH quarter in a row. The GOP has dumped MILLIONS of dollars into the Michigan race to buy this Senate seat, defeat me and guarantee a Senate majority for Mitch McConnell.
Friend, here’s the good news: Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight reports Democrats can take back the Senate! But our only path to Senate control starts with winning here in Michigan, and recent polling has me TWO POINTS BEHIND my Trump-backed opponent.
With analysts at CBS News reporting that Michigan could decide Senate control, we’ve set a goal to raise $12,000 but right now, we’re falling short of what we need to win.
Simply put, in a race this close, with our democracy at stake, falling short could very well cost Democrats our chance to take back the Senate.
Friend – I wouldn't ask if it wasn't important: Will you rush $3 or more right now to help us win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

"I can't do it alone.
Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Just weeks before an election, Mitch McConnell has vowed that Donald Trump's nominee will fill the Supreme Court vacancy and be put on the Senate floor for a vote.
It’s unacceptable, friend. Michiganders have already begun casting their ballots and deserve to have their voices heard.
There’s no time to waste -- I’m looking for you and 58 more supporters from Almont to add your names to our new petition by 11:59 p.m. TONIGHT. Sign our urgent petition to tell Mitch McConnell and the Senate there should NOT be a Supreme Court nomination until the next presidential term begins.
ADD YOUR NAME
With a vacancy on the Supreme Court there’s so much at stake: health care protections for pre-existing conditions, Roe v. Wade and women’s health care, civil rights, voting rights and ensuring we’re putting workers before corporate special interests. I’m counting on you to use your voice now.

"Friend: Take a look at the status of Gary's race in Michigan – Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight reports that a win here is the ONLY way Democrats can take back the Senate, so this news is important:
FIRST: We had a record breaking quarter, but our right-wing opponent outraised Gary for the FOURTH straight time thanks to Trump and McConnell funneling millions into Michigan.
THEN: Betsy DeVos' family dumped nearly $1 MILLION into a super PAC to flip this seat red and tighten McConnell's grip on the Senate.
NOW: With the entire GOP targeting Gary, and Senate control hinging on what happens in Michigan, polling shows Gary TIED with his right-wing opponent!
This is why in a race as close as this, where the future of the Senate and the Supreme Court are at stake, falling short is simply not an option. But right now, we're $35,000 short of what we MUST raise.
Will you rush $3 or more – whatever you can before midnight – to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

"Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Democrats have a chance to take back the Senate this year, friend. But we need to talk about Michigan.
A brand-new poll from the New York Times shows me just one percentage point ahead of my Trump-backed opponent, right when Michigan voters are deciding the race that CBS Analysts say will determine Senate control.
But there’s a clear force at work here-- our fundraising disadvantage. My opponent outraised us FOUR out of the last FIVE quarters while Republican groups are funneling in over $30 MILLION to Michigan to buy this seat – and GOP super PACs are spending more to defeat me than any other Democratic senator up for reelection.
The warning signs are flashing, team, and I hate to say this, but I have to: We could lose this Michigan Senate seat this year -- the way we lost the presidency in Michigan four years ago.
We cannot let that happen. So I’m urging you:

Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
In a moment, I’m going to ask you to make a donation to help keep up our momentum, friend, and here’s why: After being outraised by my far-right opponent for over a year running, our last quarterly haul was LARGER than our opponent’s -- even though Trump, McConnell and Betsy DeVos’ family funnelled in millions to prop up his campaign.
Because of grassroots supporters like you, we brought in:
* The largest quarterly haul of any Senate candidate in Michigan’s history
* The largest quarterly haul of our entire campaign
* Over 300,000 first-time donors!
Now here’s why we can’t afford to slow down even a little bit.
Not only did our opponent outraise us 4 out of the last 5 quarters, GOP outside groups are funneling in over $30 MILLION to attack Gary. And you can bet that this powerful show of grassroots strength from our supporters will only spur Mitch McConnell and his billionaire allies to ratchet up their efforts to buy this seat.
Because the GOP knows what we know: Democrats have ZERO chance of taking back the Senate if we lose in Michigan. So I’ll say it again: We can’t slow down.
With only 19 days left and the latest poll from the New York Times showing our race within the margin of error, friend, will you rush $3 or more right now – every dollar you can – to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

"This race could not be closer.
Hi friend, I wanted to take a moment and reach out to you about my husband Gary.
First of all, from the bottom of my heart, I want to say thank you for being a part of this team to help Gary win in Michigan. It means the world to have you fighting so hard alongside us. I don't need to tell you that this race is one of the biggest in the entire country — even Donald Trump himself is focused on winning in Michigan and defeating Gary.
Earlier this year, President Trump personally attacked Gary, calling him a ""Do-nothing Democrat."" Now, the president is known for two things: his nicknames and his lies. But he doesn't know a thing about my husband. I want to tell you exactly who Gary Peters is:
He's the Senator who fights tirelessly for workers and small businesses. He’s the public servant pushing for quality, affordable health care coverage where insurance companies can no longer discriminate because of pre-existing conditions. And as a product of Michigan’s public schools, Gary has always fought for students and has continued to give them the tools they need to reach their full potential.
That's my husband – he's a fighter. For Michigan and our country. But right now, he's in the midst of his toughest election ever.
The stakes of this race have never been higher. Another two years of a Republican-held Senate means two more years of Mitch McConnell calling the shots in Washington. And with a vacancy on the Supreme Court there’s so much at stake: health care protections for pre-existing conditions, Roe v. Wade and women’s health care, civil rights, voting rights and ensuring we’re putting workers before corporate special interests.
My husband's been in tough election fights before, and he's all in to do it again. Believe me, Gary's going to fight tooth and nail to defend this Senate seat – but I'm making a personal ask for you to invest in this fight, too.
Gary's up against the likes of Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and nearly $6 million in dark money from the DeVos family super PAC, all vying to buy this seat for the GOP. That's why I'm reaching out to you today.
His team told me we need to raise another $30,000 by midnight, but right now, we're not quite there. Please, will you consider making a contribution to reelect my husband Gary, win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats?
Here's the best link to donate – whatever you give will go toward keeping Michigan blue and taking back the Senate for Democrats: [[URL REDACTED]]
From the bottom of my heart, thank you. Now let's go win this thing.

* Our opponent John James, a hard-right extremist who says he backs Trump “2000%” and has Trump's ""total and complete endorsement”, outraised us in four of the last five quarters.
* Not only that, James has Republicans like Donald Trump, Betsy DeVos’ family, Mitch McConnell and now a Koch family PAC funneling in TENS of MILLIONS to buy this seat.
* Our Senate race is set to be the most expensive election in Michigan's history.
I’ll be blunt with you: I was the ONLY Democratic senator who was outraised this summer, and Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight reports Democrats have ZERO chance to take back the Senate if we lose in Michigan. That’s why we set an 11:59 p.m. deadline to raise another $50,000 – but we’re already falling WAY short of what we need to win.

"If we don't step it up before the quarter ends, we're in trouble.
Friends,
Thanks to huge influxes of cash from Donald Trump’s allies and Betsy DeVos' family, Gary’s opponent has outraised him for three quarters running -- and if we don’t step up before the fast-approaching end-of-quarter deadline, Republicans will be boasting about an entire year of outraising Gary.
And that’s not even accounting for the massive $3 million attack ad buy the National Republican Senate Committee (NRSC) has been airing all over Michigan!
Believe me, Gary's going to keep fighting tooth and nail to defend this Senate seat – but I'm making a personal ask for you to invest in this fight, too. We can’t let the GOP buy Gary’s seat.
His team tells me that to stay on track, we need to raise another $7,500 by midnight. Will you consider making a contribution to help Gary keep fighting for Michigan families? It would mean a lot to me.
Losing in Michigan almost certainly means losing the Senate to Republicans. It means two more years of Mitch McConnell putting more extremist justices like Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court, and attacking protections for those with preexisting conditions.
Compare that to Gary, who fights tirelessly for workers and small businesses more than ever in the wake of COVID-19. Who is striving for quality, affordable health care coverage that protects every family. Who always does the right thing for Michigan.
My husband's been in tough election fights before, and he's all in to do it again. But this is the first time Gary's up against the likes of Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and nearly $1 million dollars in dark money from the DeVos family, all vying to buy this seat for the GOP. That's why I'm reaching out to you today.

URGENT 2020 ELECTION UPDATE:
BIDEN SELECTS KAMALA HARRIS FOR VICE PRESIDENT
\-------------
With the Democratic National Convention just days away, it has never been more important to unite as a party and work together to get Donald Trump out of the White House.
That's why we're calling on 10,000 grassroots Democrats to show support for the 2020 ticket before midnight to prove that we will NOT let Trump and his allies divide us – but we're still falling 7,658 signatures short and missing your endorsement.
Will you add your name below to endorse the Democratic ticket and build our momentum against Donald Trump? We simply cannot win in November without grassroots Dems like you speaking out and making your voice heard.
ENDORSE THE 2020 DEMOCRATIC TICKET

"The fight for control of the Senate has NEVER been so important.
Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Friend: In just a few hours, Donald Trump will nominate ANOTHER justice to the Supreme Court, which could spell disaster for affordable health care, voting rights and more.
The fight for control of the Senate has NEVER been so important. But CBS News says Democrats will have ZERO shot of taking back the Senate if Gary Peters loses in Michigan – and recent polling shows Gary losing to his far-right opponent by nearly 2 points!
It doesn't help that GOP super PACs are spending MILLIONS to buy this seat – all because Trump and McConnell know defeating Gary is ESSENTIAL to keeping their grip on the Senate majority.
So to protect Michigan's Senate seat and take back the Senate from Mitch McConnell, we've set our most aggressive rapid-response goal ever: raising $200,000 before our upcoming end-of-quarter deadline.
Hitting this goal before the FINAL quarterly FEC deadline is essential to winning in Michigan and retaking the Senate majority, so we're counting on your immediate contribution: Rush $3 or more right now – whatever you can spare to help Gary fight against Trump and McConnell's attacks – to win in Michigan, take back the Senate and protect the future of the Supreme Court!

"Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell have been doing everything they can to buy this seat.
This could not be more important, team: Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight reports Democrats have ZERO chance to take back the Senate if we lose in Michigan – and brand new polling from Gary's far-right opponent shows this race STATISTICALLY TIED.
Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell have been doing everything they can to buy this seat, including personally campaigning against Gary and funneling MILLIONS of dollars into this race. And it's working: RealClearPolitics moved this race from ""Leans Dem"" to ""Toss-Up"" and the Washington Post listed Michigan as one of the Senate seats most likely to flip in 2020.
We CANNOT afford to get outraised again, which is why we urgently need your help to close the gap and help us meet our $20,000 emergency funding goal before midnight TONIGHT!
Every dollar you give today could be the difference between defending Gary's seat in Michigan and giving Mitch McConnell another two years in the Senate majority:

"just heard from our finance team
I just heard from our finance team, and I have to be honest with you, friend: Our fundraising is just not where it needs to be if we want to stay on track to win. We're currently being outraised and outspent at the worst moment – right when a new poll shows my opponent up by nearly two points.
My far-right opponent, John James, says he backs Donald Trump ""2000%"" – and at his rally in Michigan last night, Trump gave James his ""total and complete"" endorsement.
My opponent has outraised us five times in a row thanks to Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and the DeVos family funneling tens of millions of dollars into Michigan to buy this seat for the GOP. And if we don't close our funding gap, he could pull ahead in the polls for good.
Simply put, friend? We cannot allow that to happen. RealClearPolitics just moved our race from “Leans Dem” to “Toss Up” – and in tight races like this, every single dollar makes a difference. With Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight reporting Democrats have ZERO chance to take back the Senate if we lose in Michigan, what we do in moments like this could decide whether Mitch McConnell keeps his grip on the Senate.
We're beginning a mad dash to the finish line, and we need to show my opponent and his wealthy backers that we're here to win. We need to raise another $4,218 TODAY to stay on track, and I'm counting on your help to make that happen. And for only a few more hours – until midnight tonight – every donation will be MATCHED.
Will you contribute $3 or more now – and have every dollar DOUBLED – to win in Michigan, flip the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court from Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell?

"Gary needs our help.
Friend,
Gary called me today with some troubling news: He fell short of his fundraising goal just 10 days before Election Day.
On top of that, Mitch McConnell-aligned groups are funneling in more than $25 million to buy Gary’s seat because they know whoever wins in Michigan will control the Senate for the next two years.
Simply put? All eyes are on our state.
Gary is in the final stretch of his race, so he asked me to help him raise another $250,000 right away. I’m hoping you can chip in $10 -- that’s just one dollar for every day left in this campaign -- to help us hold Michigan’s Democratic Senate seat.

Thanks to Mitch McConnell and GOP billionaires, Gary’s officially been outraised four of the last five quarters -- and a new poll shows Gary two points behind his far-right opponent. Frankly, we’re running out of time to secure this seat.
Now, the experts at CBS and Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight are all saying the same thing: Democrats can’t take back Senate control without holding Gary’s seat here in Michigan. And with the future of the Supreme Court on the line, the stakes have never been higher.
It’s why I’m asking: Friend, can you chip in $3 or more now to help keep Senator Gary Peters fighting for Michigan?
Thank you for doing everything you can to protect the future of our state and nation.
Sincerely,
Gretchen Whitmer
Governor of Michigan

"Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
I'll be blunt, friend: The future of our country rests on what happens in Michigan. That's because our race will decide if Democrats take back Senate control from Mitch McConnell. This could not be more important.
Trump and McConnell have always known what's at stake and have funneled MILLIONS of dollars into Michigan to buy this seat. Their handpicked GOP opponent has also outraised us time and time again – to the point where RealClearPolitics moved this race from “Leans Dem"" to “Toss-Up” and CNN analysts named Michigan as one of the Senate seats most likely to flip.
When Election Day has come and gone, I don't want to look back and wish we had done more to stop Mitch McConnell from flipping Michigan red and buying himself two more years of Senate control. So with CBS News reporting Democrats have zero chance of winning back the majority if we lose this seat, we've got to give this race everything we've got.
But we're still falling $191,583 short of our $500,000 goal ahead of our final FEC filing deadline at midnight tomorrow -- even though a brand-new New York Times poll show me only ONE POINT ahead of my far-right opponent. The good news is, after hearing how close this race is, a group of donors offered to MATCH every contribution made between now and the deadline -- so I'm counting on you to act now.
So I'm coming to you directly, friend: Will you make a contribution of $3 or more now -- and have every dollar DOUBLED -- to win in Michigan, take back the Senate and protect the Supreme Court from Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump?

THEN: His new hand-picked postmaster general implemented changes that are leading to massive mail delays.
NOW: Trump says he'll continue to block any coronavirus relief package that helps the USPS – and made clear he's doing this to stop vote-by-mail across the country.

We have 21 days left in this race, team. That's just:
* 21 days to win in Michigan
* 21 days to take back the Senate,
* and 21 days to protect the future of the Supreme Court.
But RealClearPolitics just moved this race from ""Leans Dem"" to ""Toss-Up,"" and it's no surprise why: We were outraised five times in a row thanks to Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and the DeVos family funneling millions of dollars into buying this seat.
With CBS News analysts reporting the only path to Senate control goes through Michigan, we’re running out of time – and resources – to take back the Senate.
That’s why this news is so important: A generous group of donors just made the FINAL match offer of this campaign – and it's for up to $500,000!
Right now, every dollar you give before our mid-month deadline will be DOUBLED. I know a $500,000 goal is ambitious, but taking advantage of opportunities like these is our ONLY chance at fighting back against GOP attack ads. And with voting already underway, we don't have much time left to regain the lead.
Please, friend, will you pitch $3 or more now – every dollar you can spare to have your gift DOUBLED before midnight – to win in Michigan, take back the Senate and protect the future of the Supreme Court from Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell?

Friend, Donald Trump just stepped off the stage in Michigan after attacking me in an effort to flip this seat.
It's clear, friend: Our far-right opponent John James stands “2000%” with Trump -- and Trump is counting on him to be in the Senate.
On top of that, while Trump is here rallying wealthy donors to funnel money into my opponent’s pockets, a brand-new poll just dropped showing me behind by almost two points. With only 17 days left in this race, Trump’s rally tonight could tip the scales into the GOP’s favor.
The White House and Senate control are on the line in Michigan, and Trump just showed how badly he wants to defeat me and Joe Biden. If you're ready to take back the Senate AND the White House for Democrats, I need you to step up now.

"Democrats cannot take back the Senate if we lose in Michigan. Period.
Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Friend – Despite unprecedented support for our campaign in Michigan, my extreme right-wing GOP opponent outraised us in four of the last five quarters.
This is thanks to Republicans groups like the DeVos family super PAC funneling over $40 MILLION into Michigan to defeat me and buy this seat to expand Mitch McConnell’s majority in the Senate.
I won't mince words: Democrats cannot take back the Senate if we lose in Michigan. Period. That's why the GOP has made it clear they will stop at nothing to defeat me -- and it's why Donald Trump is holding FIVE rallies in Michigan in the crucial final days of this race.
The stakes have never been higher, and I'm counting on supporters like you to step up before the final monthly fundraising deadline of the 2020 election cycle, friend: Please rush $3 or more now to defend Michigan's Senate seat and take back the Senate for Democrats.
With RealClearPolitics moving this race from ""Leans Dem"" to ""Toss-up"" and recent polls showing my opponent LEADING by nearly two points, every single dollar matters. If we're going to win and take back the Senate, we cannot fall further behind -- not with just THREE DAYS left.
Friend, here’s the good news: Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight reports Democrats can take back the Senate. But first we have to win here in Michigan.
What we do right now could be the difference between winning and losing. Please, will you rush $3 or more before our midnight deadline to win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats?

"Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Friend:
FIRST: Gary reached out asking for your help to protect the future of the U.S. Postal Service (USPS), which has been denied critical funding by the Trump administration.
THEN: Thousands of folks heard the call and added their names to demand immediate Congressional action!
NOW: We’re just missing your response. Can Gary count on you?
Michiganders all across the state rely on the Postal Service for vital goods and services, but the USPS is already warning people to expect delivery delays as they start to cut costs. This is an urgent moment to demand action before the USPS collapses.
Friend, will you sign on to Gary’s petition demanding Congress take immediate action to save the Postal Service? His goal is to add 5,000 signatures before midnight, but we’re falling short!

"My extreme right-wing opponent has outraised us.
Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Friend: With the help of Donald Trump and Betsy DeVos' family, my extreme right-wing opponent has outraised us – for the fifth time in a row. The GOP has dumped MILLIONS of dollars into the Michigan race to buy this Senate seat, defeat me and guarantee a Senate majority for Mitch McConnell.
Friend, here’s the good news: Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight reports Democrats can take back the Senate! But our only path to Senate control starts with winning here in Michigan, and recent polling has me TIED with my Trump-backed opponent.
With analysts at CBS News reporting that Michigan could decide Senate control, we’ve set a goal to raise $100,000 by the end of the month. But right now, we’re falling short of what we need to win.
Simply put, in a race this close, with our democracy at stake, falling short could very well cost Democrats our chance to take back the Senate.
Friend – I wouldn't ask if it wasn't important: Will you rush $3 or more right now – every dollar you can before midnight – to help us win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

"Back in 2010, when I voted for the Affordable Care Act as a first-term congressman, Republicans threatened to end my political career. A decade later, they’re still trying to take me down.
Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Friends,
Back in 2010, when I voted for the Affordable Care Act as a first-term congressman, Republicans threatened to end my political career. A decade later, they’re still trying to take me down. It’s a real ugly part of politics, but do you know why I keep fighting? Because more than 20 million Americans nationwide gained health insurance from the ACA, including 1.2 million Michiganders. It has literally saved lives.
Unfortunately, my opponent has called the Affordable Care Act a “monstrosity” and vowed to end it. He wants to take us back to the days when insurance companies called the shots and could make care unaffordable for those with pre-existing conditions. With Mitch McConnell and President Trump also trying to dismantle the ACA, it’s no wonder my opponent is their handpicked candidate. He said he backs the president “2,000%.”
I don’t back any extreme political agenda. I back Michigan, and I’m determined to keep working hard for Michigan families in the Senate. That’s why I want to hear what’s top of mind for folks. Will you take a moment to take my survey and let me know which issues are most important to you and your family?
Let’s be clear: This will be the toughest reelection campaign I’ve faced. The GOP knows that defeating me in Michigan means Democrats can’t take back the Senate. They’re counting on my opponent to win so they can finally dismantle our health care system that protects those with pre-existing conditions once and for all.
I’ve won tough races before, and I’ve been successful thanks to supporters like you rallying beside me. That’s why it’s so important to get your feedback. Winning takes all of us speaking out and standing up for what matters. So, will you click here and let me know what’s on your mind?
Thank you for sharing your thoughts. I’m so glad to have you on this team.

"Protecting the right to vote has never been more important
Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Friend: Ahead of the most consequential elections of our lifetimes, protecting the right to vote has never been more important.
In 2013, the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and Republican-led states seized this opportunity to attack the right to vote by purging voter rolls, instituting harsh and severe voter ID laws and closing polling places.
That’s why I recently joined my colleagues in reintroducing the bipartisan John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act – because every American should be able to exercise their constitutional right to vote. But Mitch McConnell refuses to even bring this up for a vote in the Senate.
So I’m asking you to immediately sign my petition demanding Congress restore the Voting Rights Act of 1965 – but right now, I’m still 34 signatures short in Almont, and your name is missing.
Please, before 11:59 p.m., will you click here to add your name and demand Congress restore the Voting Rights Act?
SIGN THE PETITION
Friend, time is running out to ensure a free and fair election for every American voter. Thank you for speaking out.

"There's too much at stake...
Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Friend: Donald Trump's third Supreme Court nominee will be announced any moment – and Mitch McConnell has vowed that they will get a vote on the Senate floor.
There's too much at stake: The future of the Supreme Court – and with it, the future of affordable health care, the fight against climate change and reproductive rights – are all on the line.
Forcing this Supreme Court nomination through now will – without question – further divide our country. With voters already casting their ballots in this election, we CANNOT allow Trump and McConnell to get away with this.
With the confirmation of another justice looming, your voice in this fight cannot wait a second longer – which is why Gary's counting on you to add your name to his petition. Sign now to tell Mitch McConnell: Do NOT fill the Supreme Court vacancy until the next presidential term begins!
ADD YOUR NAME
With voting already underway in some states – including Michigan – Trump and McConnell should allow the American people to make their voices heard before forcing this nomination through – for the sake of our democracy and the stability of our country.
It's up to grassroots Americans like you to put a stop to this nomination, so please: Sign the petition now to tell Mitch McConnell NOT to fill the Supreme Court vacancy until the next presidential term begins.

"I need to give you an update on our race in Michigan.
Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Friend – we’re just 25 days away from Election Day, and with Republicans going all out to flip this seat, I need to give you an update on our race in Michigan.
For over a year, Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and the DeVos family have funneled MILLIONS of dollars into Michigan to buy this seat. My extreme right-wing opponent has outraised me time and time again – in fact, I was the only Democratic senator outraised this summer.
And after constant GOP attacks and a massive flow of dark money being spent against me, a new internal poll from my opponent now shows us statistically tied – and RealClearPolitics moved our race from “Leans Dem” to “Toss-Up.”
The honest truth is that Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight is right: Democrats have ZERO chance to take back the Senate if we lose here in Michigan. My far-right opponent knows it too – and that's why Trump has come back to Michigan again and again to try and flip this seat.
So I’m asking for your help today: Our team set a goal to raise $50,000 from grassroots supporters by this weekend, but we’re falling $15,423 short of our daily goal – and I’m counting on your help to close the gap immediately: Will you contribute $3 or more now to help me win in Michigan, take back the Senate and protect the future of the Supreme Court from Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell?

"Take a look at what we’re up against:
BREAKING:  Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight just predicted that Gary’s opponent is  “within striking distance” of winning Michigan’s Senate Race -- after reporting that Democrats have ZERO chance of taking back the Senate if Gary loses.
That’s why GOP billionaires are teaming up  right now to prop up Gary’s opponent. In just the last two weeks:
* The  DeVos family super PAC increased their spending to a total of nearly  $6 million  in TV ads attacking Gary.
* A Koch family super PAC just endorsed Gary's opponent and plans to flood Michigan with a six-figure ad buy!
* Mitch McConnell's super PAC announced plans to spend $9 million against our campaign.
This onslaught of GOP ads and endorsements is tipping the scales. After RealClearPolitics moved this race from “Lean Dem” to “Toss Up,” yet ANOTHER poll shows this race within the margin of error.
The GOP is surging in Michigan, and how we respond right now could determine what happens to Gary’s seat AND the Senate majority. We set an 11:59 p.m. deadline to raise another $15,000 -- and we just can’t fall short.  Will you contribute $3 or more now – every dollar you can spare – to fight back against GOP spending in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats, and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

"It’s Gretchen Whitmer. Do you have a second?
Friend,
Four years ago, Donald Trump won Michigan by only a few thousand votes -- and immediately, Democrats here got to work. Thanks to a swell of grassroots support, two years later we made massive progress with victories across Michigan.
And now once again, our battleground state of Michigan is in the spotlight as all eyes turn here to re-elect Senator Gary Peters. And this race couldn’t be more important -- analysts at CBS News are reporting that Democrats can’t win the Senate majority if we don’t first win here in Michigan.
Here’s the bad news: far-right billionaires like Betsy DeVos’ family are trying to buy Michigan’s Senate seat, and now Gary’s officially been outraised for four of the last five quarters. That's because the GOP is dumping millions of dollars to try and defeat Gary -- and if they succeed, we can count on at least two more years of Mitch McConnell calling the shots in Washington.
Gary is in the final few days before Election Day, so he reached out to ask me if I could help him close the gap on his $50,000 goal for today -- and right now, we’re still falling short. Can you chip in $3 (or whatever you can) to make sure Gary doesn’t get outraised again so we can send him back to the Senate?

Sincerely,
Gretchen Whitmer

"I was the only Democratic senator to be outraised last quarter.
Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
There's no way of sugarcoating this, friend: I was the only Democratic senator to be outraised last quarter – and this makes it the FIFTH straight reporting period that our Trump- and DeVos-backed opponent has outraised us. Friend, it couldn't have come at a worse time, with a recent poll showing me nearly two points behind my far-right opponent and our last FEC quarterly filing deadline of the campaign less than a week away.
With analysts at CBS News reporting that Michigan’s Senate race will decide Senate control, we’ll have zero chance of taking back the Senate if we lose this seat. It's why right-wing interests from Donald Trump to Mitch McConnell to the DeVos family are funneling in millions to buy this Senate seat.
I’m no stranger to tough fights: fighting for the people of Michigan is the greatest honor of my life, and I do not plan on ceding this seat to a right-wing extremist.
But if we're going to win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats, we CANNOT afford to keep being outraised. That's why my team set a rapid-response goal to raise $15,000 TODAY to make up our shortfall, but right now, we're falling short of what we need to win.
Our opponent has the full force of GOP special interests behind him – but I have you. So I'm asking: before midnight, can I count on you to contribute $3 or more now – every dollar you can spare – to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

In a race this close, fundraising is an important way campaigns can show their strength – and right now, we need to show the GOP that we won’t lose this election and we won't let them buy this Senate seat.
Thanks for fighting by my side for working families in Michigan and across the country.

"Friends – HUGE news: John James JUST attacked Gary and is vying for Michigan's Senate seat.
And to make matters worse, James is being bankrolled by a DeVos family super PAC to expand Mitch McConnell’s grip on the Senate.
With Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight and CBS News analysts saying the future of the Senate will be decided in Michigan, this is an important moment in our campaign and how we respond right now matters.
Gary’s not backing down, but he can’t do it alone. How we respond in moments like these could decide whether Mitch McConnell stays in control of the Senate.
With our race tied, and the Senate and the future of the Supreme Court on the line, we’ve set a rapid response goal to raise $10,000 by midnight, but right now, our fundraising is falling short of what we need to win.

Hey team --
Gary is doing everything he can to save the U.S. Postal Service but he needs your support on this. We're in search of 219 more people who live in the 48003 area to add their names next to Gary's before midnight tonight. Can you be the next person to sign?

I WANT TO HELP SAVE THE USPS
\----Forwarded message----
Friend,
This morning I questioned Donald Trump’s handpicked Postmaster General, Louis DeJoy, on the massive mail delays we’re seeing across the country. Here’s what came out of it:
* DeJoy will not bring back any mail sorting machines that have been removed -- even though we have seen delays as they have been removed.
* DeJoy’s decisions have cost Americans their health, their time, their livelihoods and their peace of mind.
* Senate Republicans are lying, stating that the complaint calls coming in about USPS service delays are a coordinated and organized effort by Democrats and not real.
Let me be clear: These mail delays are real concerns, they're not manufactured -- no matter what Senate Republicans say.
As we head into the fall, I want to assure the American public that the Postal Service is fully capable and committed to delivering the nation’s election mail on-time -- but right now, we aren’t.
Now, it’s up to Congress to fix this. Please, add your name next to mine in defending the Postal Service from the undermining we’re seeing from the Trump Administration.
There are still many questions left to be answered but I will continue my investigation into these delays and get the American people the answers they deserve.
Thank you,
Gary

I wanted to make sure you saw this update from my team: We've been added to Roll Call's list of most vulnerable Senate seats. In a race this close, supporters like you will determine whether or not we can defend this seat -- so I'm asking if you can chip in up $3 or more right now to make sure we win in Michigan.
Thanks for being in this fight,
Gary
\----Forwarded message----
We just got some really bad news, friend: Gary’s seat was just added to Roll Call’s list of MOST vulnerable Senate seats in 2020 -- with only FOUR weeks left to go.
Here's why:
* Gary’s Trump-backed opponent has outraised us for over a year.
* GOP outside groups are spending over $25 million in our race right now.
* A new poll shows our far-right opponent in the LEAD!
With voting in Michigan already underway, we don't have much time to fix this -- and Democrats’ risk of losing the Senate is at an all time high.
Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight and CBS News analysts say the future of the Senate will be decided in Michigan. So with this alarming new announcement, we need all hands on deck to raise $30,000 for our rapid response goal -- but we’re already falling short.
Friend -- we’re running out of time before Election Day. Please rush an emergency gift of $3 or more right now to fight back against GOP spending in Michigan, defend Michigan's Senate seat and take back the Senate for Democrats!

I just talked to my team this morning, friend, and they’re saying that last night we fell short of our signature goal by 11,035 names.
With the future of the Supreme Court on the line, I need as many voices as possible joining mine. So I’m re-opening our petition until 11:59 p.m. tonight. Can you add your name next to mine and tell Mitch McConnell NO Supreme Court nomination until the next presidential term begins?
Thank you,

Just weeks before an election, Mitch McConnell has vowed that Donald Trump's nominee will fill the Supreme Court vacancy and be put on the Senate floor for a vote.
It’s unacceptable, friend. Michiganders start casting their ballots this week and deserve to have their voices heard.
There’s no time to waste -- I’m looking for you and 37 more supporters from Almont to add your names to our new petition by 11:59 p.m. TONIGHT. Sign our urgent petition to tell Mitch McConnell and the Senate there should NOT be a Supreme Court nomination until the next presidential term begins.
ADD YOUR NAME
With a vacancy on the Supreme Court there’s so much at stake: health care protections for pre-existing conditions, Roe v. Wade and women’s health care, civil rights, voting rights and ensuring we’re putting workers before corporate special interests. I’m counting on you to use your voice now.

Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
I’ve got some upsetting news, friend: Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight reports Democrats have ZERO chance of taking Senate control if we lose in Michigan. But my Trump-backed opponent has outraised us three times in a row, and recent polls show this race is TIED.
Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and Betsy DeVos’ family are funneling MILLIONS of dollars into Michigan to buy this Senate seat – and GOP super PACs are spending more to defeat me than any other Democratic senator up for reelection.
That's why we're launching new ads to fight back and win – but keeping ads on the air is expensive, and with our fundraising gap growing by the day, we need to raise another $100,000 before our critical EOQ deadline to win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats.
If our fundraising slows down, we might not be able to keep the ads on the air – and with the Senate majority and future of the Supreme Court at stake, we cannot let that happen.

Team, here's the truth: We have 31 days – exactly one month – to win here in Michigan and take back the Senate majority. But this race could not be closer, with recent polling showing my opponent LEADING by a narrow margin.

Friend, I need to speak with you about a looming crisis to a vital American institution: saving the U.S. Postal Service before Donald Trump and his Washington Republican allies allow it to become insolvent by September.
We can no longer count on the Trump administration to lift a finger when it comes to protecting our Postal Service. Unless we act now, prices will increase for everyone when it comes to getting packages and prescriptions delivered – and folks in rural communities in Michigan and across the country could be cut off from vital services like vote-by-mail.
And without intervention by Congress, 600,000 federal Postal Service workers could lose their jobs – including many in 48003, friend.
That’s why I’m doing everything in my power to keep the Postal Service operating, and why I need your immediate help: Will you sign my petition and demand Congress intervene to save the Postal Service? We need 20,000 signatures by 11:59 p.m. tonight, but we’re falling 8,737 signatures short with hours to go – and your name is still missing.

"Back in 2010, I was a first-term congressman up for reelection during the Republican Tea Party wave - a wave that saw huge GOP gains in the Senate and the beginning of a Republican House majority that would last eight years.
Friend,
Back in 2010, I was a first-term congressman up for reelection during the Republican Tea Party wave – a wave that saw huge GOP gains in the Senate and the beginning of a Republican House majority that would last eight years.
In all honesty, the odds were stacked against me in that race, and national GOP interests were determined to see me lose. But I've never backed down from a tough fight in my entire life. I campaigned hard across my district in Michigan, and I was one of only a handful of freshman Democratic members of Congress who won reelection that year.
I owe a lot of that grit to my parents. Dad was a World War II veteran who poured his heart into teaching in Michigan public schools for three decades. Mom was an SEIU steward who organized the heck out of her workplace – for the betterment of her family and colleagues. They inspired me to work hard so I could put myself through school and join the Navy Reserve.
So you know what comes to mind when I hear that I'm one of the most targeted Democratic senators up for reelection this year? Or that I'm one of the few senators fighting to win in a state Donald Trump carried in 2016? I think of Mom and Dad and how hard they worked, always, for the betterment of others. I think of that House race when the odds seemed impossible, but we won.
That's my motivation, friend, and I'm determined to win and keep fighting for the people of Michigan. For good middle-class jobs, for our environment, for affordable health care and quality public education. But I can't win this thing alone.
Will you rush a contribution of $3 now to help me win? Whatever you chip in will ensure we have the resources to defend Michigan's Senate seat and take back the Senate for Democrats.
I've fought and won tough campaigns before, friend. But this time around, at least TWO right-wing super PACs and a dark money group have funneled big money into attacking me – not to mention that Betsy DeVos' family is dropping nearly $1 million to defeat me.
But do you know what I say to all of them? Go ahead and try. My right-wing opponent can depend on Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump and all the billionaire money he wants. I'm determined to win this thing the right way: by standing up for the people of Michigan and fighting with a grassroots team.
The truth of the matter, however, is this: Our race in Michigan will decide Senate control. Plain and simple. And with polls showing me in a dead heat with my Trump-backed opponent, falling behind our fundraising goals puts us in danger of losing. And after checking in with my finance team, we're $8,100 short of what we need to win.
I'm proud to have you on this team, friend, and I'm proud of everything we've accomplished so far. I know we can win this, but we've got to come together and fight harder than ever. So I'm asking: Will you make a donation of $3 – whatever you can spare to help us defend Michigan's Senate seat – so we can win this reelection and take back the Senate for Democrats?
Thank you very much.

"Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
I have bad news to share, friend: Recent polls shows me two points BEHIND my far-right opponent -- and now the New York Times says our race is ""one of the GOP’s few chances to oust an incumbent Democratic senator.""
The warning signs are flashing: Our Trump-backed opponent has outraised us four out of the last five quarters, and experts at RealClearPolitics just moved our race from “Lean Democrat” to “Toss Up”. With only EIGHT days until Election Day and almost two million Michiganders already casting their ballots, we're running out of time to defend this seat.
Helping Michigan families is the greatest honor I've ever had, and I will NOT let a right-wing extremist take this seat without a fight. So I need you fighting with me, because we won't win in Michigan – or take back the Senate – if we continue to fall behind in fundraising.
Our opponent has Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell backing him – but I’ve got grassroots supporters like you. So I’m asking you now: Before 11:59 p.m., will you rush a gift of $3 or more now -- anything you can spare -- to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

"Here's what you need to know about Michigan’s Senate race:
Here's what you need to know about Michigan’s Senate race:
* John James, a hard-right extremist who says he backs Trump “2000%,” just won the GOP primary to take on Democrat Sen. Gary Peters.
* James has outraised Gary five times in a row thanks to Donald Trump, Betsy DeVos’ family and Mitch McConnell funneling in MILLIONS to buy this seat for the GOP.
* RealClearPolitics just moved this race from “Lean Dem” to “Toss Up” – and a new poll shows this race is statistically TIED.
Gary is the ONLY Democratic senator who was outraised last quarter, and Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight reports Democrats have ZERO chance to take back the Senate if Gary loses. That’s why we set an 11:59 p.m. deadline to raise $25,000 – but we’re already falling WAY short of what we need to win.
This is the most important election of our lifetimes, and we need your help: Will you contribute $3 or more now – every dollar you can spare – to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court from Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump?

Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
There's no way of sugarcoating this, friend: I was the only Democratic senator to be outraised last quarter – and this makes it the FIFTH straight reporting period that our Trump- and DeVos-backed opponent has outraised us. Friend, it couldn't have come at a worse time, with polls showing me two points behind my far-right opponent.
With analysts at CBS News reporting that Michigan’s Senate race will decide Senate control, we’ll have zero chance of taking back the Senate if we lose this seat. It's why right-wing interests from Donald Trump to Mitch McConnell to the DeVos family are funneling in millions to buy this Senate seat.
I’m no stranger to tough fights: fighting for the people of Michigan is the greatest honor of my life, and I do not plan on ceding this seat to a right-wing extremist.
But if we're going to win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats, we CANNOT afford to keep being outraised. That's why my team set a rapid-response goal to raise $12,500 TODAY to make up our shortfall, but right now, we're falling short of what we need to win.
Our opponent has the full force of GOP special interests behind him – but I have you. So I'm asking: Before midnight, can I count on you to contribute $3 or more now – every dollar you can spare – to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

"Friend: Republicans like Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and Betsy DeVos are spending nearly $30 MILLION in Michigan to defeat me.
That’s why I’m asking for your help – but first, I’d like to explain why it’s so important we defend Michigan’s Democratic Senate seat.
With a vacancy on the Supreme Court, the stakes have never been higher. If we lose here, Democrats will throw away our only chance of taking back the Senate. That means two more years of Mitch McConnell calling the shots in Washington.
I've won tough elections before, and I'm all in to do it again this time around. But  a new internal poll from my far-right opponent shows us in a statistical tie, and Roll Call just added me to their list of most vulnerable Senators in 2020.
The good news is Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight reports Democrats can flip the Senate, but only if we first win in Michigan.
So with the future of the Senate and the Supreme Court on the line, in a race this close, every dollar could be the difference between winning and losing. We set a goal to raise another $50,000 by the weekend to win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats -- but right now we're still $19,482 short. I'd appreciate it if you could give now, even just $3, to help us hit this goal and win.
Here's the best link to donate – whatever you give will go toward keeping Michigan blue and taking back the Senate for Democrats: [[URL REDACTED]]

"The most important race happening in 2020 is for control of the Senate.
I will not be the first, nor will I be the last to tell you this, friends: The most important race happening in 2020 is for control of the Senate.
I have a front-row seat to the damage Mitch McConnell is causing in the Senate. He is blocking every last attempt at progress that our Democratic colleagues in the House are fighting so hard for – environmental protections, gun safety measures, affordable healthcare. If a Democrat wins the White House, they MUST have the Senate as well.
That's why I'm reaching out to you about Gary Peters' race in Michigan. Experts from FiveThirtyEight to Roll Call say Democrats can win back the Senate – but only if Gary wins in Michigan.
The thing is that Gary's reelection won't be easy. He's one of two Democratic Senate candidates fighting to win in a state President Trump carried. To top it all off, Gary is neck-and-neck with his hard-right opponent, handpicked by Trump and McConnell.
So here's the deal: I told Gary I'd help him raise $6,500 to protect Michigan's Democratic Senate seat, and we really need to hit that goal before midnight. Can I count on you to give now and help us take back the Senate majority?
Please, click here to give $5 or more to help Gary Peters keep Michigan blue, defeat Mitch McConnell and take back the Senate for Democrats.

"It’s Gretchen Whitmer. Do you have a second?
Friend,
Four years ago, Donald Trump won Michigan by only a few thousand votes -- and immediately, Democrats here got to work. Thanks to a swell of grassroots support, two years later we made massive progress with victories across Michigan.
And now once again, our battleground state of Michigan is in the spotlight as all eyes turn here to re-elect Senator Gary Peters. And this race couldn’t be more important -- analysts at CBS News are reporting that Democrats can’t win the Senate majority if we don’t first win here in Michigan.
Here’s the bad news: far-right billionaires like Betsy DeVos’ family are trying to buy Michigan’s Senate seat, and now Gary’s officially been outraised for a full year straight. That’s four quarters in a row of the GOP dumping millions of dollars to try and defeat Gary -- and if they succeed, we can say goodbye to the future of the Supreme Court and hello to at least two more years of Mitch McConnell calling the shots in Washington.
Gary is up against his final quarterly fundraising deadline before Election Day, so he reached out to ask me if I could help him close the gap on his $200,000 goal -- and right now, we’re still falling $104,293 short. Can you chip in $5 (or whatever you can) to make sure Gary doesn’t get outraised again so we can send him back to the Senate?

It’s never been more important for us to elect Democrats like Gary Peters who are going to continue fighting the good fight to move Michigan forward. And with control of the Senate and the future of the Supreme Court on the line, we need a fighter like Gary standing up for Michiganders in Washington.
So I’m asking one more time, friend -- with a recent poll showing Gary down by nearly two points, I’m asking you to donate $5 today to help secure victory for Gary Peters in Michigan to help us win back the Senate.
Sincerely,
Gretchen Whitmer
Governor of Michigan

"this election is underway
Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
This is huge news, team: Ballots were JUST sent out in Michigan today – and this election is officially underway.
But with only weeks left for voters to make their decisions, a recent poll shows me trailing by nearly 2 points. That means we have just 40 days to make sure we defend this seat, take back Senate control from Mitch McConnell and protect the Supreme Court.
The stakes couldn't be any higher: Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight reports Democrats have ZERO chance of flipping the Senate if we lose here in Michigan. But my Trump-backed opponent has outraised me five times in a row – and Trump, McConnell and the DeVos family are funneling MILLIONS of dollars to buy Michigan’s Senate seat.
Our fundraising gap is growing by the day, and we urgently need to raise another $12,978 before 11:59 p.m. tonight to have a chance at catching up to my far-right opponent.
Everything hinges on hitting our goal right now, and we CANNOT afford to come up short now that Michigan voters are receiving their ballots: Please, team, rush $3 or more now – anything you can spare – to win in Michigan, take back the Senate and protect the Supreme Court from Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump!

The bad news: Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and the DeVos family are funneling record amounts of money into Michigan – most recently, $9 million in attack ads from McConnell's super PAC.
The good news: Our grassroots support is surging thanks to folks like you who know what’s at stake in Michigan -- and Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight is reporting that Democrats have a real chance to take back the Senate this year!
The big news: Our only path to Senate control starts with winning here in Michigan. But brand new polling shows my far-right opponent in the LEAD -- and GOP mega-donors won’t stop trying to tip the scales against me until polls close on Election Day.
I’ll be honest with you, friend: We don’t have much time left to defend this seat with Michiganders already casting their ballots. My team set a goal to raise another $50,000 before the weekend -- but we're still $26,483 short.

"Gary is more urgently in need of your help than ever before.
Hi, friend, I’m reaching out to you about my husband, Gary.
First and foremost, thank you. You have been an inspiration to this team and we know that we can’t win in Michigan without your help. With Donald Trump zeroing in on Michigan – and trying to buy this Senate seat for his handpicked candidate – we couldn't be more grateful you're fighting by our side.
But thanks to President Trump and his allies like the DeVos family, Gary’s opponent is both outraising and outspending us. Gary’s being relentlessly attacked with lies every hour of the day, with Mitch McConnell’s dark-money group spending $4.5 million on attack ads alone.
To make matters worse, Gary’s opponent just appeared at the Republican National Convention, which will undoubtedly result in building up his fundraising advantage even more.
The stakes of this race have never been higher. We cannot afford two more years of Mitch McConnell standing in the way of progress for our families. And we simply cannot handle more extremist Supreme Court justices like Brett Kavanaugh – or more attempts to dismantle protections for those with preexisting conditions.
That’s why I'm reaching out to tell you the tough news: Gary is more urgently in need of your help than ever before because a new poll has this race statistically tied.
Gary has always been and continues to be a fighter. He puts working people and small businesses first. He understands working families need someone who advocates for affordable health care, for quality education so students can reach their full potential and for a Postal Service that serves each community in Michigan and across the country.
But Gary’s team just let me know that we’re falling dangerously short of our $7,500 midnight fundraising goal – and we need to make up the difference immediately or risk handing Michigan over to Trump. I know you can help get us back on track to close this gap and win big.
Please, will you make a contribution to reelect my husband Gary, win in Michigan and end Mitch McConnell's hold on the Senate? Here’s the best link to keep Michigan blue and flip the Senate for Democrats: [[URL REDACTED]]
This isn’t just Michigan on the line – it’s the future of the Senate, the Joe Biden presidency and our entire country that rests squarely on our shoulders.
From the bottom of my heart, thank you. Now let's go win this thing.

Friend – Winning in Michigan is so important that Sen. Kamala Harris is ALL IN to help Gary defeat his Trump-backed opponent.
Kamala knows Democrats CANNOT afford to win the White House without flipping the Senate – and CBS News reports that Democrats have ZERO chance at taking back the Senate if Gary loses in Michigan.
But a recent poll shows this race statistically TIED, and RealClearPolitics just moved his race from “Leans Dem” to “Toss Up.”

We need a MASSIVE grassroots movement to join forces with Kamala Harris in protecting Michigan's Senate seat! That's why we set an 11:59 p.m. deadline to get 1,000 Founding Donors – but we’re still falling 287 donors short, and we're running out of time.

"I was the only Democratic senator to be outraised last quarter.
Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
There's no way of sugarcoating this, friend: I was the only Democratic senator to be outraised last quarter – and this makes it the fourth straight reporting period that our Trump- and DeVos-backed opponent has outraised us. Friend, it couldn't have come at a worse time, with polls showing our race in a statistical tie.
With analysts at CBS News reporting that Michigan’s Senate race will decide Senate control, we’ll have zero chance of taking back the Senate if we lose this seat. It's why right-wing interests from Donald Trump to Mitch McConnell to the DeVos family are funneling in millions to buy this Senate seat.
I’m no stranger to tough fights: Fighting for the people of Michigan is the greatest honor of my life, and I do not plan on ceding this seat to a right-wing extremist.
But if we're going to win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats, we CANNOT afford to keep being outraised. That's why my team set a rapid-response goal to raise $50,000 immediately to make up our shortfall, but right now, we're falling short of what we need to win.
Our opponent has the full force of GOP special interests behind him – but I have you. So I'm asking: Before midnight, can I count on you to contribute $3 or more now – every dollar you can spare – to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

In a race this close, fundraising is an important way campaigns can show their strength – and right now, we need to show the GOP that we won’t lose this election by raising $50,000 as soon as we can.
Thanks for fighting by my side for working families in Michigan and across the country.

"Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
We want to give you the latest on what’s happening in Michigan's Senate race:
FIRST: Republicans including Mitch McConnell, Betsy Devos' family, and the Koch family are funneling nearly $30 million into Michigan to buy this seat for the GOP.
THEN: A brand new internal poll from our Trump-backed opponent showed the race statistically TIED.
NOW: The Washington Post named Michigan as one of the  Senate seats MOST likely to flip in 2020.
It’s time to act. Even the experts across the country – like Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight, The New York Times and The Washington Post – all agree: If we lose this race here in Michigan, Democrats won’t be able to win the Senate majority. We need all hands on deck to hit a $20,000 fundraising goal TODAY -- but right now we’re falling $11,582 short, and we need your help.

"More McConnell attack ads
Folks, this is unbelievable.
Mitch McConnell keeps funneling money into Michigan until he takes this seat. But I won’t back down. After he dropped another $1.5 million in attack ads, my team set a rapid response goal to raise $50,000 by midnight tonight and we’re still $16,529 away. Will you chip in whatever you can right now?
Thank you, friend,
Gary
\----Forwarded message----
This changes everything, friend:
The National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) – controlled by Mitch McConnell – is launching a MASSIVE TV buy of $1.5 MILLION for attack ads against Gary Peters.
With Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight and analysts at CBS News saying the future of the Senate will be decided in Michigan, this is one of the biggest and most important moments in our campaign.
That's because attack ads like this can tip the scales majorly, particularly with current polling showing our race neck and neck and with the DeVos family's super PAC propping up Gary's right-wing opponent.
We've set a rapid-response goal to raise $50,000 by midnight tonight. With Senate control – and the future of the Supreme Court – hinging on what happens here in Michigan, Gary is counting on your immediate contribution:
Please rush $3 or more now to fight back against Mitch McConnell's attack ads, defend Michigan's Senate seat and take back the Senate for Democrats!

"I know without a doubt this is the right thing to do
Friend,
I know many supporters have been watching the Supreme Court hearings with a wary eye. That’s why I’m reaching out to you directly to share that I will be voting ""no"" on Trump’s nominee if the nomination reaches the Senate floor.
I know without a doubt this is the right thing to do – but I also know this vote could have massive ramifications for what happens in our Senate race, and the GOP won't hold back in their attacks against me.
Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and the DeVos family are already funneling TENS OF MILLIONS of dollars into Michigan to buy this seat. And because experts say the Senate majority hinges on Michigan, this vote could cause a massive Republican fundraising windfall that tilts this razor-thin election against us and right into the hands of Mitch McConnell.
With a recent New York Times poll showing me only 1 point ahead of my far-right opponent, I’m coming to you because it’s more important than ever: I need your support right away to make sure we have what it takes to win in the final days of this critical election.
Can I count on you to chip in $3 or more now – anything you can spare – to win in Michigan, take back the Senate and protect the future of the Supreme Court?
My vote on this Supreme Court confirmation is not about partisan politics. It’s about fighting for people with preexisting health conditions and quality, affordable health care for Michiganders. It’s about protecting Roe v. Wade and reproductive rights. It’s about protecting voting rights, civil rights and ensuring we’re putting workers ahead of corporate special interests.
But with Michigan voters already casting their ballots, we cannot afford to continue falling behind for even one more second. So I’m challenging this team right now to raise $100,000 before midnight – it’s now or never, team:
Rush a $3 contribution now – anything you can spare before midnight – to win in Michigan, take back the Senate and protect the future of the Supreme Court from Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump.
We have just 15 days to do everything we can to protect the Senate and the future of the Supreme Court. Thanks for making sure we can be first across that finish line in November.

"Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Friend – I want to give you an update on our race in Michigan.
Time and time again, with the help of Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell, my extreme right-wing opponent has outraised us, breaking fundraising records along the way.
A new poll shows me narrowly trailing my Trump-backed opponent -- what's more, the DeVos family super PAC dumped $7 million into Michigan to buy this seat for Mitch McConnell and the GOP.
The hard truth is that according to Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight, Democrats will lose our only chance at taking back the Senate if I lose in Michigan.
Will you make a contribution of $3 or more now to defend Michigan's Senate seat and take back the Senate for Democrats?
I've got to tell you, watching Mitch McConnell call the shots in Washington is infuriating. The damage he's doing to our judicial system, including the Supreme Court, will have consequences for generations to come.
So frankly, friend, it's never been more important for Democrats to take back the Senate. And according to CBS News, a Democratic Senate majority will come down to what happens here in Michigan.
I wouldn't ask if it weren't critically important: Will you rush $3 or more right now – every dollar you can – to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

"Our Senate race is heating up in a way I never could have imagined.
I've got to be honest, friend: Our Senate race is heating up big time – and as a veteran of competitive races, I'm 100% in to win this thing. But I need your help, and I hope you'll let me explain why.
Super PACs and a dark-money group are attacking me – more than any other Democrat in the entire country. And we just learned that the DeVos family's super PAC has committed nearly 1 million dollars to defeat me. You read that right: another $1 million, just like that.
With Senate control hinging on what happens here in Michigan, the stakes have never been higher. That's why I'm reaching out to ask for support ahead of our campaign's most important goal. But first, I want to tell you why – now more than ever – it's so important for Democrats to take back the Senate.
Losing in Michigan doesn't just mean that another rubber stamp for Donald Trump will enter the Senate. It means two more years of Mitch McConnell calling the shots in Washington – putting our Supreme Court, the Affordable Care Act and so much more in jeopardy.
The GOP's game plan is centered around flipping Michigan red, because they know Democrats cannot take back the Senate if I lose.
I'm no stranger to tough elections. I've always fought hard to win, and I'm all in to do it again. But my hard-right opponent outraised us three times in a row, and recent polling shows us statistically tied.
With analysts at The Washington Post ranking me as one of the most targeted Democratic senators in the country, missing our goal again would be another huge blow to this campaign.
Friend, with a Democratic Senate majority only possible if I win in Michigan, our fundraising is falling $8,513 short of where we need to be today.
So with Senate control at stake, your donation could be the difference between winning and losing. Friend, I'm asking: With just hours left until our midnight deadline, will you pitch in? I'd be beyond grateful.

Friend: With the help of Donald Trump and Betsy DeVos' family, my extreme right-wing opponent has outraised us – FOUR quarters in a row. The GOP has dumped MILLIONS of dollars into the Michigan race to buy this Senate seat, defeat me and guarantee a Senate majority for Mitch McConnell.
Here’s the good news: Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight reports Democrats can take back the Senate! But our only path to Senate control starts with winning here in Michigan, and recent polling has me nearly TWO POINTS BEHIND my Trump-backed opponent.
With analysts at CBS News reporting that Michigan could decide Senate control, we’ve set a goal to raise $200,000 before our final FEC quarterly filing deadline. But right now, we’re falling short of what we need to win.

"Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Folks -- Donald Trump just announced that he's coming back to hold a rally in Michigan on Friday. That's the second time this week and only four days before Election Day.
There's more: Bloomberg News just reported that the Trump campaign is now flooding most of its ads into just four states -- including Michigan.  This couldn't come at a worse time, with recent polls showing Gary two points behind his far-right opponent and nearly 2.5 million Michiganders already casting their ballots.
Donald Trump is betting it all on Michigan as a path to the White House AND two more years of a McConnell-controlled Senate. And every time he's back in Michigan, you can bet our far-right opponent sees a massive uptick of wealthy donors funneling money straight into his pockets. In these crucial final days of the race, the GOP isn't slowing down -- and neither can we.
There's no time to waste, friend: Will you pitch in $3, $25, or whatever you can spare now to win in Michigan and take back Senate control from Mitch McConnell?

"The most important race happening in 2020 is for control of the Senate.
I will not be the first, nor will I be the last to tell you this, friends: The most important race happening in 2020 is for control of the Senate.
I have a front-row seat to the damage Mitch McConnell is causing in the Senate. He is blocking every last attempt at progress that our Democratic colleagues in the House are fighting so hard for – environmental protections, gun safety measures, affordable healthcare. If a Democrat wins the White House, they MUST have the Senate as well.
That's why I'm reaching out to you about Gary Peters' race in Michigan. Experts from FiveThirtyEight to Roll Call say Democrats can win back the Senate – but only if Gary wins in Michigan.
The thing is that Gary's reelection won't be easy. He's one of two Democratic Senate candidates fighting to win in a state President Trump carried. To top it all off, Gary is neck-and-neck with his hard-right opponent, handpicked by Trump and McConnell.
So here's the deal: I told Gary I'd help him raise $6,500 to protect Michigan's Democratic Senate seat, and we really need to hit that goal before midnight. Can I count on you to give now and help us take back the Senate majority?
Please, click here to give $5 or more to help Gary Peters keep Michigan blue, defeat Mitch McConnell and take back the Senate for Democrats.

Friend: My extreme opponent outraised me for a FIFTH consecutive reporting period thanks to Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and Betsy DeVos funneling MILLIONS into Michigan to defeat me.
That’s why I’m asking for your help – but first, I’d like to explain why it’s so important we defend Michigan’s Democratic Senate seat.

Mitch McConnell is funneling another $9 million into this race, and with a brand-new poll showing my Trump-endorsed opponent in the lead we can't afford to take anything for granted in Michigan.
I’m calling on you to help. Can you chip in $3 or more right now? The future of the Senate and the Supreme Court could depend on it.
Thanks,

\----Forwarded message----
EVERYTHING about the race to control the Senate just changed, friend:
Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight reports Democrats have ZERO chance of taking Senate control if we lose in Michigan – but Mitch McConnell's super PAC just announced it will spend $9 MILLION to buy Michigan's Senate seat.
That means they can spend nearly $300,000 EVERY SINGLE DAY blanketing the airwaves with attack ads against Gary Peters for the next month.
Attacks like these can MAJORLY tip the scales, especially with current polling showing our opponent taking a narrow lead and CNN reporting Michigan is one of the Senate seats MOST likely to flip.
We've set a rapid-response goal to raise $300,000 – there's simply no other option. But right now, we're falling short, and with Michigan voters already casting their ballots, time is running out if Gary's going to win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats.
Will you rush $3 or more now to help defend Michigan's Senate seat, take back the Senate and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

Here’s why we need Gary in the Senate, friend: He's the Senator who fights tirelessly for workers and small businesses. He’s the public servant pushing for quality, affordable health care coverage where insurance companies can no longer discriminate because of pre-existing conditions. And as a product of Michigan’s public schools, Gary has always fought for students and has continued to give them the tools they need to reach their full potential.
I want to thank you, friend, for being part of this team. It means the world to Gary and me to have you fighting alongside us. But with so much at stake, I have one more thing to ask you: Can you take a moment to confirm your voting plan?
Yes, I’ll confirm my voting plan now →
Friend, Republicans led by Mitch McConnell have been spending ten of millions of dollars to defeat Gary. But I’ll tell you what Gary always says: Billionaires only get one vote -- and so do each of us. It’s Michiganders like us who will decide the outcome of this election.
From the bottom of my heart, thank you. Now let’s go win this thing.
Colleen

"Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
I have bad news to share with you, friend: A brand-new poll shows me nearly two points BEHIND my Trump-backed opponent -- and Politico just reported that our race is so competitive that it ""gives GOP hope of hanging on to the Senate.""
This couldn’t have come at a worse time: I was the only Democratic senator to be outraised this summer, and experts at RealClearPolitics just moved our race from “Lean Democrat” to “Toss Up”. With only 12 days until Election Day and over a million Michiganders already casting their ballots, we're running out of time to defend this seat.
Helping Michigan families is the greatest honor I've ever had, and I will NOT let a right-wing extremist take this seat without a fight. So I need you fighting with me, because we won't win in Michigan – or take back the Senate – if we continue to fall behind in fundraising.
Our opponent has millions of dollars in GOP special-interest money backing him – but I’ve got grassroots supporters like you. So, I’m asking you: will you rush a gift of $3 or more now to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

"Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Team: Donald Trump is holding rallies in Michigan four times in the final week before the most important election of our lifetimes.
Trump and his team keep coming back to Michigan because they know that whoever wins in Michigan will win control of the White House AND the Senate. Here’s the truth: They wouldn’t come back so many times this close to Election Day if they didn’t think they had a real shot at winning here in Michigan.
What’s more, every time Trump visits, his hand-picked Senate candidate sees a huge surge in donations from GOP mega-donors. With Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight saying Democrats have ZERO chance to take back the Senate if we lose this race, Democrats CANNOT afford to ignore Trump’s laser-focus on Michigan leading up to Election Day.
I know Michigan is where we will win or lose the Senate, friend. So I made some calls, and after hearing about Trump’s three upcoming visits, a group of Democratic donors have agreed to an emergency TRIPLE-MATCH -- up to $100,000.
Friend: Will you rush $3 or more immediately -- and have every dollar TRIPLED -- to help us win in Michigan and take back control of the Senate from Mitch McConnell?

"Did you get Gary’s note, friend?
With out-of-state billionaires like the DeVos family funneling in millions against Gary, we’ve launched brand new TV ads. But keeping them up is expensive, so we’ve set out to raise $75,000 to keep them on the air. Can you pitch in $3 or whatever you can afford today?
Thanks,
Peters for Michigan
\----Forwarded message----
I've got some news, friend: CBS News is reporting Senate control will be decided here in Michigan. But my opponent announced he has broken fundraising records and outraised us for the last nine months.
Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and the family of Betsy DeVos are funneling MILLIONS of dollars into Michigan to buy this Senate seat – and GOP super PACs are spending more to defeat me than any other Democratic senator up for reelection. And all that money is moving the needle: A poll now shows this race is TIED.
That's why we're launching new ads to fight back and win – but keeping ads on the air is expensive, and with our fundraising gap growing, we need to raise another $75,000 immediately to win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats.
If our fundraising slows down, we might not be able to keep the ads on the air – and with the Senate majority and future of the Supreme Court at stake, we cannot let that happen. Will you rush $3 right now – anything you can chip in immediately – to help us win in Michigan, flip the Senate for Democrats and protect the Supreme Court from Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump?

"If we can’t make up this budget shortfall, I won’t have much of a choice.
Team: We just closed the books on the final full quarter of this campaign, and I have bad news: My finance team says we fell short of our end-of-quarter goal last night.
I need to be very honest with you about what that means: If we can’t hit our $20,000 emergency funding goal before midnight, I’m considering making some cuts to our October budget.
Budget cuts could mean taking ads off the air right as Michiganders are casting their ballots. Meanwhile, the DeVos family’s super PAC just bumped their attack ads budget to almost $6 million, and my Trump- and McConnell-backed opponent may be on track to outraise us for the SIXTH time in a row.
This shortfall could not be coming at a worse time, team: Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight reports Democrats have ZERO chance to take back the Senate if we lose in Michigan – and new polling shows me BEHIND my extremist opponent.
So I’m asking personally right now: Can you rush $5 or more now to help close the gap on our missed goal so we aren’t forced to scale back our fight to win in Michigan and take back the Senate?

We simply can’t afford to be outraised again by our far-right opponent -- not with just over one month left until the end of election season and CNN reporting that my Senate seat is one of the most likely to flip.
If Trump and McConnell succeed at buying my seat, they’re buying two more years of Mitch McConnell controlling the U.S. Senate -- and the future of the Supreme Court.
Let me be clear: We still have time to fight back and win -- but the stakes couldn’t be higher. Every dollar you give today could be the difference between defending my seat in Michigan and giving Mitch McConnell another two years in the Senate majority.
Will you rush a contribution of $5 or more now – anything you can spare to flip the Senate for Democrats – to win in Michigan, take back the Senate and protect the future of the Supreme Court from Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell?
The future of our country is on the ballot in Michigan’s Senate race. I’m counting on you.

Friend,
Four years ago, Donald Trump won Michigan by only a few thousand votes -- and immediately, Democrats here got to work. Thanks to a swell of grassroots support, two years later we made massive progress with victories across Michigan.
And now once again, our battleground state of Michigan is in the spotlight as all eyes turn here to re-elect Senator Gary Peters. And this race couldn’t be more important -- analysts at CBS News are reporting that Democrats can’t win the Senate majority if we don’t first win here in Michigan.
Here’s the bad news: far-right billionaires like Betsy DeVos’ family are trying to buy Michigan’s Senate seat, and now Gary’s officially been outraised for a full year straight. That’s four quarters in a row of the GOP dumping millions of dollars to try and defeat Gary -- and if they succeed, we can say goodbye to the future of the Supreme Court and hello to at least two more years of Mitch McConnell calling the shots in Washington.
Gary is up against his final quarterly fundraising deadline before Election Day, so he reached out to ask me if I could help him close the gap on his $200,000 goal -- and right now, we’re still falling $104,293 short. Can you chip in $5 (or whatever you can) to make sure Gary doesn’t get outraised again so we can send him back to the Senate?

It’s never been more important for us to elect Democrats like Gary Peters who are going to continue fighting the good fight to move Michigan forward. And with control of the Senate and the future of the Supreme Court on the line, we need a fighter like Gary standing up for Michiganders in Washington.
So I’m asking one more time, friend -- with a recent poll showing Gary down by nearly two points, I’m asking you to donate $5 today to help secure victory for Gary Peters in Michigan to help us win back the Senate.
Sincerely,
Gretchen Whitmer
Governor of Michigan

"We cannot lose here.
Friend --
John James will be a GREAT Senator for Michigan! - Donald Trump
That’s what Donald Trump tweeted, officially endorsing GOP Senate candidate John James, who is trying unseat my colleague Gary Peters.
Big-money Republicans are funneling millions into Michigan, and it’s working: Gary was outraised last quarter, and the Cook Political Report has moved Gary’s race from “Likely” to “Lean Democrat.”
Polls in Michigan have the race as a statistical tie -- and if we don’t defend this Senate seat, we cannot take back the Senate this November. Gary needs our help now: Will you donate $3 or more to re-elect Gary Peters in Michigan, and protect this seat from right-wing Republicans?
If you've saved payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:

The facts are pretty clear here -- and they’re also pretty scary:
* Nate Silver says if Republicans can win in Michigan this year, they can keep control of the Senate.
* CBS agrees -- and says Gary’s seat could be THE race that decides control of the Senate.
* And after Trump won Michigan in 2016, CNBC rated Gary as one of the most vulnerable Democrats up for reelection this year.
My friend and colleague Gary is focused on strengthening our middle class by protecting access to quality, affordable health care, preparing our kids for the jobs of tomorrow, and helping small businesses grow.
This is the leadership Michigan needs, and this is the Democratic leadership America needs -- we need to keep this Senate seat, and we need to flip the Senate. Your donation of $3 or more right now could do exactly that: Will you donate right now to support Gary Peters’ reelection in Michigan?
Sincerely,
Chuck Schumer

"Here's what you need right now to know about my race:
* Our opponent John James, a hard-right extremist who says he backs Trump “2000%” and has Trump's ""total and complete endorsement” has outraised us time and time again.
* Mitch McConnell's super PAC is spending a brand-new $5.6 million to buy this seat for the GOP -- that brings their total spending against me to nearly $15 MILLION!
* It was just reported that our Senate race will be the most expensive election in Michigan's history.
I’ll be blunt with you: I was the ONLY Democratic senator who was outraised this summer, and Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight reports Democrats have ZERO chance to take back the Senate if we lose in Michigan. That’s why we set an 11:59 p.m. deadline to raise another $20,000 – but we’re already falling WAY short of what we need to win.
With voters already casting their ballots, this cannot wait. So I'm asking you directly: Will you contribute $3 or more now – every dollar you can spare – to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court from Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump?

"The most important race happening in 2020 is for control of the Senate.
Friend,
Gary Peters' reelection to the Senate this fall in Michigan will be one of the closest races this November -- and guess who has their thumb on the scale. The DeVos family -- i.e., the family of Betsy DeVos, Secretary of Education -- is hoping they can buy this Senate seat in Michigan by spending almost $1 million to unseat my friend Gary and put in his place their hand-picked choice, John James.
We already know how dangerous the DeVos family has been, and the super PAC ""Better Future Michigan"" wants nothing of the sort: It has 14 donors. Who are they? Half of the donors are members of the DeVos family.
Gary is a fighter for Michigan and my progressive ally in the Senate, and he needs our help: Before midnight tonight, we need to raise $7,500 for Gary Peters -- and I'll be honest: I've looked at the map, and I can't see how we take the majority if we lose this seat. Donate $5 or more now to fund the fight to reelect Gary and fight back against the DeVos family's dangerous plans for Michigan.

Or click here to donate another amount.
Why is the DeVos family so invested in unseating Gary Peters? Well, for one he's taking on Betsy DeVos and her wasteful spending at the Department of Education -- he pressed for answers back in December as to why 72 charter schools in Michigan never opened despite receiving nearly $21 million in federal start-up funds.
Gary believes like I do that students and families come first -- and for all the charter schools that closed or failed to open, communities missed out on more than half a billion dollars in resources that could have benefitted neighborhood schools. Gary knows her leadership is leaving students and families worse off -- and her family wants him out because of it.
They know he's watching and fighting for teachers, students, and families -- and they're scared. That's why their hand-picked choice to unseat Gary, John James, said Betsy DeVos is doing a ""very, very good"" job as Secretary of Education. John James supports Betsy DeVos even as she planned to cut $9 billion in funding for education, including more than $100 million for Michigan's public schools.
After spending millions to gut Michigan's public school programs, and bigger plans to do more, she can't even say if it was worth it. On whether local schools in Michigan have gotten better, she said: ""I don't know. Overall, I -- I can't say overall.""
Right-wing Republicans like the DeVos family are dumping nearly a million dollars into this race -- but it'll get even closer, and that's why Gary needs our help: Donate $5 or more now to help us raise $7,500 for Gary Peters before midnight tonight.
Sincerely,
Chuck Schumer

"Betsy DeVos' family sunk nearly $1 million into a super PAC to defeat me
Friend,
I've fought and won high-stakes races like this before, and I'm ready to do it again. And right now, the good news is that Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight reports Democrats have a path to the Senate majority – but ONLY if we first win here in Michigan.
But after Betsy DeVos' family sunk nearly $1 million into a super PAC to defeat me, polling shows our race tied. So here's the deal, friend: Senate control will be decided by who wins in Michigan. Unfortunately, our Republican opponent – who is funded by outside GOP special-interest money – has outraised us for the third quarter in a row.
With so much on the line, coming up short isn't an option. Losing this seat means Mitch McConnell will control the Senate for another two years – and that's more than enough time to confirm additional extremist Supreme Court justices and repeal the ACA once and for all.
It's never been more important for Democrats to take back the Senate – and for us to win here in Michigan – but we need to close our $8,100 fundraising gap by midnight tonight.
Please, will you make a contribution of $3 before our midnight deadline to defend Michigan's Senate seat and take back the Senate majority for Democrats?
Thank you,
Gary

"Michigan's Senate race is HEATING UP.
Friend – Michigan's Senate race is HEATING UP. Take a look below. This race will decide the future of the Senate and the Supreme Court:
FIRST: Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight reports the ONLY way Democrats can flip the Senate is by winning in Michigan.
THEN: A recent poll shows Gary and his opponent NECK and NECK – and this race will decide Senate control for the next two years.
NOW: The DeVos family dumped NEARLY $1 MILLION to tip the scales in this race and defeat Gary Peters.
Senate control hangs in the balance here in Michigan. That's why we've set a rapid response goal to raise another $25,000 by midnight, but right now, we're falling WAY short of what we need to win.

"Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
I know I’ve reached out before, but it’s important, friend. We’re talking about the very future of the U.S. Postal Service (USPS).
Last week we fell short of our signature goal by just a few names. We’re coming up to the end of our USPS open submissions to hear from people like you. I’m sitting down with my team tonight and I’d like to know what you think. So would you kindly add your name to save the Postal Service?
Thank you,
Gary
\----Forwarded message----
Team, tomorrow, we’re sitting down with Gary to review all of the signatures on his petition demanding Congress take action to save the United States Postal Service. And we're still missing your name.
That means today is your LAST CHANCE to sign -- and we’re still looking for at least 54 more names from 48003. Can you sign on before the petition closes at midnight?
YES, I'LL ADD MY NAME
Unless we act now, prices will increase for everyone when it comes to getting packages and prescriptions delivered – and folks in rural communities in Michigan and across the country could be cut off from vital services like vote-by-mail.
And without intervention by Congress, 600,000 federal Postal Service workers could lose their jobs – including many in 48003, friend.
Before we close the books on this petition, add your name to demand Congress take action to save the Post Office.
It is up to us to end this looming crisis to a vital American institution and save the U.S. Postal Service before Donald Trump and his Washington Republican allies allow it to become insolvent as soon as September.
Thank you,
Team Peters

"this is important.
Friend, sorry to reach out so late, but this is important.
Over 1.5 million ballots have already been returned in Michigan, but 13% of Michiganders are still undecided in this race. With analysts at CBS News reporting Michigan's Senate race could determine Senate control, we simply CANNOT afford to lose this seat.
But our fundraising has slowed down at the worst moment possible, leaving us still $20,560 short of what we need in our GOTV Emergency Fund to reach thousands of undecided voters.
RealClearPolitics moved this race from ""Leans Dem"" to ""Toss-Up,"" so we cannot afford to waste a single day. This is the most important election of our lifetime and we're counting on supporters like you to come through in this critical moment:
Please, will you rush a contribution right now – anything you can spare before 11:59 p.m. to help me win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the Supreme Court from Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump?

Today’s the day. Our end-of-month fundraising ends when the clock strikes midnight.
And I’ll cut right to it: We’re not going to reach our goal without a big final push right away.

\----Forwarded message----
I have worrying news, friend: Analysts at CBS News report Democrats have ZERO chance to take back the Senate if we lose in Michigan. But after my Trump-backed opponent outraised us FIVE times in a row, our race was moved from “Lean Democrat” to “Toss Up” – and a recent poll shows we're in a dead heat.
Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and the DeVos family are funneling in MILLIONS to buy Michigan’s Senate seat. And with less than 100 days to Election Day, they’ll continue doing whatever it takes to ensure they expand Republican control of the Senate.
But if we're going to win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats, we CANNOT afford to keep being outraised. That's why my team set a rapid-response goal to raise another $100,000 this month to close the gap, but right now, we're falling short of what we need to win.
Our opponent has the full force of GOP special interests behind him – but I have you. So I'm asking: Before midnight, can I count on you to contribute $3 or more now – every dollar you can spare – to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

I'll be blunt, friend: We can't afford to send Joe Biden to the White House without a Democratic Senate majority. But with our party's convention just days away, flipping the Senate will be an uphill climb.
That's because Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight reports Democrats have ZERO chance to take back the Senate if we lose here in Michigan. And after RealClearPolitics just moved this race from “Leans Dem” to “Toss Up,” brand-new polling shows our race is statistically tied.
We have been outraised five times in a row by my right-wing opponent – and with Trump, McConnell and the DeVos family funneling in millions to buy this Senate seat, we can't afford to take any risks.
If Democrats are going to head into next week's convention ready to defeat Donald Trump and flip the Senate, we MUST immediately close our fundraising gap in Michigan.
Can I count on you to contribute $3 or more now? Whatever you give will go toward keeping Michigan blue and flipping Senate control for Democrats.

Friend: Despite unprecedented support for our campaign in Michigan, our opponent just announced he has broken fundraising records and outraised us for the FIFTH straight reporting period. This is all thanks to Donald Trump funneling MILLIONS into Michigan to defeat Gary Peters and buy this seat to expand Mitch McConnell’s majority in the Senate.
They know that Democrats have ZERO chance of taking back the Senate if we lose in Michigan. And now, a recent poll shows Gary statistically tied with his right-wing opponent.
Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight reports that Democrats can take back the Senate, but we must first win in Michigan. And with our race moved to a TOSS UP – what happens right now could determine whether we win or lose this race.

Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Friend: As this month comes to a close, I want to give you an update on our race.
The bad news: Thanks to Donald Trump and the DeVos family steering MILLIONS of dollars against me, my extreme right-wing opponent outraised me – for the fifth time in a row.
The good news: We are on track to have the best online fundraising month of the campaign, and Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight is reporting that Democrats have an opportunity to take back the Senate!
The big news: Our only path to Senate control starts with winning here in Michigan. With recent polling showing me TIED, the DeVos family dumped nearly $1 million into Michigan to buy this seat for Mitch McConnell and the GOP.
And now, with analysts at CBS News reporting that Michigan will decide Senate control, we’ve set a goal to raise another $100,000 immediately to win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats.
Friend: In a race this close, with the Senate and the future of the Supreme Court on the line, falling short could very well cost Democrats our chance to take back the Senate.
I wouldn't ask if it wasn't critically important: Friend, will you rush $3 or more right now – every dollar you can – to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

"Trump says John James has his ""total and complete endorsement.""
Friend, on Thursday night Donald Trump and John James were both onstage in Michigan attacking me in an effort to flip this seat.
It's clear, friend: our opponent John James stands “2000%” with Trump -- and Trump is counting on him to be in the Senate.
But here's the deal: after being outraised for over a year, a brand new poll shows our team trailing by almost 2 POINTS. On top of that, RealClearPolitics just moved this race from “Leans Dem” to “Toss-Up.” And Trump’s Michigan rally could make this race closer -- even tipping the scales into the GOP’s favor.
The White House and Senate control are on the line in Michigan, and Trump just showed how badly he wants to defeat me and Joe Biden. If you're ready to take back the Senate AND the White House for Democrats, I need you to step up now. Chip in $3 or whatever you can.

Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Folks, I want to keep you updated on what’s happening with this United States Postal Service (USPS).
Donald Trump’s new handpicked postmaster general is changing procedures that have led to a disastrous problem for our country: Massive mail delays.
These changes threaten the well-being of millions of Americans that rely on the Postal Service for the delivery of Social Security checks, prescription drugs and everyday mail – including mail-in-ballots for our 2020 general election.
It’s why I've launched an investigation into these mail delays. Please join me by adding your name next to mine and stand up to the Trump administration’s disastrous changes.
The bottom line is if management decisions are being made to slow down the mail, impacting everyday citizens and their everyday business as well as slowing down the voting process, that is simply unacceptable.
The Trump administration wants to privatize the Postal Service – slowing down delivery and ultimately impacting mail-in voting here in Michigan and across our country. We can’t let this happen, friend.
YES, I'LL ADD MY NAME

Today's the day, team: Donald Trump is coming back to Michigan TONIGHT.
This will be the Trump team’s ninth visit to Michigan in the last year — and he keeps coming back because he knows if Democrats lose here, we have ZERO chance of taking back the Senate.
The Trumps are bringing in wealthy donors from across the country to funnel money into my far-right opponent’s pockets in an attempt to buy this election. I’ve got one thing to say to them — bring it on.
And I have some incredible news:  a group of donors has offered to match every donation made between now and Trump's visit tonight – up to $50,000.
With only hours until this match opportunity expires, I'm counting on your donation. Can you rush an urgent contribution of $3 – and have every dollar DOUBLED – to help us compete against Trump and defend Michigan's Senate seat?

"If you’re wondering why this $100,000 end-of-quarter fundraising goal is so important, I’ve got one statistic for you: Polling from this month shows that 29% of MI voters are still undecided on their Senate vote.
This race is still up for grabs.
With nearly a third of registered voters still on the fence and shady Republican super PACs spending MILLIONS of dollars to attack Gary, being able to reach these voters with our own ads is absolutely critical to winning Michigan in November.
If we fall short of our EOQ goal, we might not be able to keep the ads on the air – and it won’t be long before those undecided Michigan voters swing out of our reach. If you’re able, rush $3 right now – or whatever you can chip in – to help us win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats.

Republicans like Donald Trump and Betsy DeVos’ family are spending millions to reach those 29% undecided voters because flipping Michigan red is the GOP game plan for keeping their Senate majority.
Both CBS News and Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight report that if Gary loses in Michigan, Democrats will have ZERO chance to take back the Senate. All of our biggest political battles -- from the Supreme Court’s future to protecting affordable health care -- are riding on defending Gary’s seat.
So our $100,000 end-of-quarter fundraising goal isn’t some nice-to-have wish list item. It’s what Gary needs to win his biggest election yet. And we’re only going to reach this goal by midnight Tuesday if individuals like you keep stepping up to the plate.
Our FEC deadline is only two days away, and YOU could help put us over the top. If you’re able, rush a donation of $3 or more right away to help defend Michigan's Senate seat and take back Senate control.
Supporters like you are the fuel that keeps this campaign running. Thank you for being a part of this.
More soon,

"Team, last night, Donald Trump was in Michigan because he knows the White House, Senate control and the future of the Supreme Court all depend on who wins here.
And while Trump was in Michigan drawing nationwide attention – and GOP donors – to this race, we got some bad news: We fell short of our $50,000 midnight match goal by just $6,432.
This is deeply concerning. Trump has already funneled MILLIONS of dollars into this race to buy Michigan's Senate seat, and for the past year,
Gary's been outraised by his far-right opponent every step of the way.
Even more concerning? It's making an impact: CNN is now saying Michigan’s Democratic Senate seat is one of the “most likely to flip"" in November – and a new poll shows Gary trailing by nearly 2 points.
But, team, we have some good news: Yesterday's match donors offered to extend the match to help us hit our goal – but only until midnight tonight. Our chances of winning could hinge on how we respond in moments like these, and with ballots being mailed out in Michigan in just two weeks, we're running out of time:
Will you make a contribution now – and have every dollar DOUBLED – to help win in Michigan, take back the Senate and protect the future of the Supreme Court from Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell?

Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos has consistently failed our nation’s public schools, teachers and students.
Her most recent blunder comes as Americans are already facing so much hardship: A company that manages and collects on student loans for the education department damaged the credit reports of some 5 million borrowers whose payments were automatically suspended under the CARES Act.
The last thing these 5 million folks need to worry about is impacts to their credit score – and yet the company incorrectly reported to credit agencies that borrowers’ accounts were deferred.
Enough is enough. Betsy DeVos has already abused half a billion in taxpayer money to aid sham charter schools that closed or never opened (many of which were here in Michigan). She’s sided with shady, for-profit colleges over students. She’s diverted funds to private schools instead of bolstering our nation’s public school system.
As the son of a lifelong educator, I refuse to stand by and watch Betsy DeVos tear down our education system. That’s why I need you to join me by adding your name condemning Betsy DeVos and demanding a Secretary of Education who will fight for our students. Will you add your name now before my midnight signature deadline?
Sign the Petition
Thanks for speaking out. Secretary DeVos has done far too much damage – and it’s long past time the federal government rights the wrongs she has committed.

Team --
Gary is doing everything he can to save our U.S. Post Office but he needs your support on this. We're in search of 55 more people who live in the 48003 area to add their names next to Gary's by midnight tonight. Can you be the next person to sign?

I WANT TO HELP SAVE THE USPS
\----Forwarded message----
Friend, I need to speak with you about a looming crisis to a vital American institution: saving the U.S. Postal Service before Donald Trump and his Washington Republican allies allow it to become insolvent by September.
We can no longer count on the Trump administration to lift a finger when it comes to protecting our Postal Service. Unless we act now, prices will increase for everyone when it comes to getting packages and prescriptions delivered – and folks in rural communities in Michigan and across the country could be cut off from vital services like vote-by-mail.
And without intervention by Congress, 600,000 federal Postal Service workers could lose their jobs – including many in 48003, friend.
That’s why I’m doing everything in my power to keep the Postal Service operating, and why I need your immediate help: Will you sign my petition and demand Congress intervene to save the Postal Service? We need 20,000 signatures by 11:59 p.m. tonight, but we’re falling 8,737 signatures short with hours to go – and your name is still missing.
SIGN THE PETITION
Thank you,

I wanted to reach out to you and your family directly.
This week, I'll be traveling over 1,000 miles on a Motorcycle Tour across Michigan to talk with families, workers and small business owners about how I’m working to put Michigan first.
I want to make sure I stay connected with you too, friend. That’s why I put together a few questions for you. If you have a minute, I’m looking for another 2,500 folks to take this survey and share what’s top of mind for you and your family.
My team and I are planning to go through the responses when I'm back from the tour. I’m looking forward to hearing from you.
Thank you very much. I hope you and those close to you are staying safe and healthy.

"For the past five days, we’ve awoken to more news about the terrible and avoidable tragedy that was the murder of George Floyd.
And across the country -- from Minneapolis to Louisville to Detroit -- the pain and heartbreak are palpable. This senseless and indefensible death has shocked our nation. Simply put, this should never have happened, and George Floyd should still be alive.
We must not forget the names of those whose lives have been needlessly cut short, and we must face the grim reality that our work to make America fulfill her promise of equality and justice for all is far from over.
I’ve dedicated my life in service to Michigan and its people -- and right now, so many Michiganders are in pain. When faced with adversity, our leaders must rise to the occasion. I’m speaking with our community leaders, listening and acknowledging how we must work together to heal as a nation as we grieve with hope.
Our communities are hurting.
Our neighbors are hurting.
Our families are hurting.
No more.
To those of you who are finding the news especially troubling and are scared for what is to come, know that you are not alone. We must take the fear; the anger; the pain and channel it into seeking justice. We must continue to honor their lives and fight to end this violence. We must unite together to encourage understanding and compassion for our fellow Americans.
If you can, please, join me in donating to the NAACP Detroit Branch to help our community. Contribute whatever you can to ensure they have the funds needed to continue their important work.

Team, I had to update you on this: As Mitch McConnell's dark money group launches a massive $4.5 million ad buy against me, my opponent released a poll showing our race statistically TIED.
There is too much at stake to sit on the sidelines: Will you rush $3 or more now – every dollar you can spare – to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?
Thanks,

BREAKING NEWS, friend: Mitch McConnell’s dark money group just launched $4.5 MILLION in attack ads against Gary Peters – the LARGEST Republican ad buy of this race.
This RECORD-BREAKING right-wing spending comes right after our race was downgraded from “Leans Dem” to “Toss Up” and new polling showed Gary and his Trump-backed opponent in a statistical TIE.
We need to counter these new attacks right away – but Gary doesn’t have far-right special interests on his side, he has people like you. It’s why we’re launching an emergency response fund to raise $45,000.
Will you make an immediate contribution of $3 or more toward our emergency ads fund to defend Michigan's Democratic Senate Seat?

Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Team, making sure you saw Gary's note.
We're only  one month out  from Election Day -- and Michiganders have already begun to cast their ballots. Can you chip in $3 or more now to make sure we keep this Senate seat and protect the future of the Supreme Court? In a race this close, every contribution makes a difference.
\--Team Peters
\----Forwarded message----
This is important, team: Ballots are being cast all over Michigan, which means this election is officially underway.
But with only weeks left to make sure we win in Michigan, a recent poll shows me trailing by nearly 2 points. That means we have just 32 days to defend this seat, take back Senate control from Mitch McConnell and protect the future of the Supreme Court.
The stakes couldn't be any higher: Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight reports Democrats have ZERO chance of flipping the Senate if we lose here in Michigan. But my opponent has outraised me five times in a row – and GOP dark money groups are funneling MILLIONS of dollars to buy Michigan’s Senate seat.
Our fundraising gap is growing by the day, so my team and I set an emergency fundraising goal of $20,000 to have a chance at catching up to my far-right opponent.
Everything hinges on hitting our goal right now, and we CANNOT afford to come up short now that Michigan voters are casting their ballots: Please, team, rush $3 or more now – anything you can spare – to win in Michigan, take back the Senate and protect the Supreme Court from Mitch McConnell!

"Take a look at what we’re up against:
BREAKING:  Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight just predicted that Gary’s opponent is  “within striking distance” of winning Michigan’s Senate Race -- after reporting that Democrats have ZERO chance of taking back the Senate if Gary loses.
That’s why GOP billionaires are teaming up  right now to prop up Gary’s opponent. In just the last few weeks:
* The  DeVos family super PAC increased their spending to a total of over $10 million  in TV ads attacking Gary.
* In total, Republican groups are funneling in over $40 MILLION against Gary -- more than any other in-cycle Democratic Senator.
* Trump is holding his final campaign rally in Michigan TONIGHT -- making a total of FIVE Trump rallies in Michigan in the final week of his campaign.
Donald Trump is spending the eve of the election in Michigan because he thinks Republicans have a real chance of winning up and down the ballot here -- and that means holding their control over the White House AND the Senate. What's more, my opponent joined him onstage tonight to attack me in an effort to flip this seat.
How we respond in these final hours of the race could determine what happens to Gary’s seat AND the Senate majority. Will you contribute $3 or more right away to help us reach every voter and ensure that every vote is counted?

Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Amid policy changes and cutbacks to the Postal Service under Trump’s new handpicked postmaster general, Gary just launched an investigation into the massive mail delays impacting our communities in Michigan and nationwide.
He’s leading the fight to save the Postal Service -- but he can’t do it alone.
Saving the Postal Service is so important that we checked in on the status of our petition, and here's what we found for you:
EMAIL: [[EMAIL_REDACTED]]
SUPPORTER ID: 1128963
SIGNED TO PROTECT THE USPS TODAY? NO
Before this petition closes at 11:59 p.m.: Will you add your name to demand Congress take action and save the Postal Service?
Right now, rural communities, seniors, veterans, small businesses and so many more Michiganders are counting on the USPS more than ever before.
But important mail is already being left unattended in processing centers and post offices – and if we don’t act soon, even mail-in voting in the 2020 election could be at risk.
Gary will not allow the Trump Administration to destroy the Postal Service, but he needs you standing with him as he fights these disastrous changes.
Yes, I’ll add my name next to Gary’s and demand Congress save the Postal Service.

"Here's what you need to know about Michigan’s Senate race:
Here's what you need to know about Michigan’s Senate race:
* John James, a hard-right extremist who says he backs Trump “2000%” and has Trump's ""total and complete endorsement"" won the GOP primary to take on Democrat Sen. Gary Peters.
* James has outraised Gary five times in a row thanks to Donald Trump, Betsy DeVos’ family and Mitch McConnell funneling in MILLIONS to buy this seat for the GOP.
* RealClearPolitics just moved this race from “Lean Dem” to “Toss Up” – and a new poll shows Gary TWO POINTS BEHIND James.
Gary is the ONLY Democratic senator who was outraised last quarter, and Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight reports Democrats have ZERO chance to take back the Senate if Gary loses. That’s why we set an 11:59 p.m. deadline to raise another $14,000 – but we’re already falling WAY short of what we need to win.

The U.S. Postal Service is still in jeopardy, friend – and Congress still hasn't passed legislation to keep the USPS from going insolvent. Without action, the Postal Service could collapse in about 100 days.
I can't tell you enough how devastating this would be for communities across the country. Rural communities in Michigan especially depend on our Postal Service as a vital service for staying connected and getting the goods and services they need.
Look, I know it's difficult to imagine a country without the USPS. It's an institution that's become a part of Americans' everyday lives.

The bad news: Thanks to Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell, and the DeVos family steering MILLIONS of dollars against me, my extreme right-wing opponent outraised me FIVE TIMES in a row.
The good news: We are on track to have the best online fundraising quarter of our campaign, and Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight is reporting that Democrats have an opportunity to take back the Senate!

With analysts at CBS News reporting that Michigan will decide Senate control, we’ve set a goal to raise another $12,000 today -- but right now, we're $4,832 short.
Friend: In a race this close, with the Senate and the future of the Supreme Court on the line, falling short could very well cost Democrats our chance to take back the Senate.

"I am personally making the most urgent ask since our campaign began
Friend, I've fought and won tough races before. Believe me, I know what it takes. But I've never seen anything quite like what's happening in Michigan right now.
The amount of dark money pouring into this election is unnerving. Not only is this now the MOST expensive Senate election in our state's history, but my right-wing opponent has outraised me five times in a row – and Mitch McConnell's super PAC is funneling what amounts to $300,000 into Michigan every day to buy this seat.
At this stage in the game – with everybody from Donald Trump to Betsy DeVos' family funneling in millions of dollars attacking me – fundraising could make the difference between winning and losing in November.
Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight reports that Democrats have ZERO chance of taking back the Senate if we lose in Michigan, so we can't afford to leave a single dollar on the table.
That's why I am personally making the most urgent ask since our campaign began: Will you commit to a weekly donation of $3 or more through Election Day? Recurring donations in these final three weeks will ensure we have the resources to fight against this massive GOP spending until the end so we can protect Michigan's Senate seat and take back the Senate.
I wouldn't make such a big ask of you if it weren't absolutely necessary, friend. But here's where we're at: We were outraised for over a year. We're being outspent on TV by Republicans. And as a result, our race is in a dead heat, and RealClearPolitics now considers it a ""Toss-Up."" With voting already underway, we cannot afford to keep playing catch-up.
Each and every day, we're funding critical ads, voter outreach, mobilization and more – everything it takes to win a race as momentous as this one. But that also means our resources are getting depleted, and quickly. If we can get even 300 supporters to commit to a recurring donation in this final stretch, it would move mountains for our campaign.
So with Donald Trump and all his wealthy GOP allies barreling down on us in Michigan, winning this race comes down to what grassroots supporters like you do in moments like this: Can I count on your weekly donation – that's just three small donations through Election Day – to help me win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats?
Your support means everything to me. Thanks for stepping up in big moments like this.

"period.
Team, this wasn’t the news we were hoping for: Analysts at the Washington Post just named Michigan as one of the Senate seats most likely to flip this November.
Add that to the fact that a new internal poll from our Trump-backed opponent shows the race statistically tied \-- and that Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight says Democrats have ZERO chance to take back the Senate if we lose in Michigan.
Republicans know that Democrats need to win in Michigan. That’s why Trump, McConnell and Republican mega-donors are funneling almost $30 MILLION into this race. And in a race this close, with the stakes this high, we need you to step up and help us fight back against the GOP war chest.
With only 24 days until Election Day and Michiganders already casting their ballots by the thousands, we don’t have any time to spare. Can you chip in $3 or more now - anything you can spare - to help us win in Michigan and take back Senate control from Mitch McConnell?

"Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
We want to give you the latest on what’s happening in Michigan's Senate race:
FIRST: Gary's far-right opponent outraised him five times in a row thanks to Donald Trump, Betsy DeVos’ family and Mitch McConnell funneling in MILLIONS to buy this seat for the GOP.
THEN: A brand new poll shows Gary's Trump-endorsed opponent IN THE LEAD.
NOW: GOP dark money groups have launched a multi-million dollar ad blitz in Michigan -- because they know buying Gary's seat means at least two more years of Republicans controlling the Senate!
It’s time to act. Even the experts across the country – like Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight, The New York Times and The Washington Post – all agree: If we lose this race here in Michigan, Democrats won’t be able to win the Senate majority. We need all hands on deck to hit a $200,000 fundraising goal by our final FEC quarterly filing deadline on Thursday -- but right now we’re falling $70,589 short, and we need your help.
Can Gary count on you to rush $3 or more now – every dollar you can spare – to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Friend: Our country cannot take two more years of Mitch McConnell's control over the Senate – but Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight says that's exactly what will happen if we lose in Michigan.
And with new polling showing us TWO POINTS BEHIND our far-right opponent, Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and the DeVos family are pouring millions into Michigan to buy this seat and tighten the GOP's hold on the Senate.
With the future of the Senate and the Supreme Court on the line, we simply CANNOT let Trump and McConnell buy Michigan's Democratic Senate seat.
But right now, we're $9,380 short of our MUST-HIT fundraising number, and we have to hit it by midnight to win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats.
Will you rush $3 or more – whatever you can before midnight – to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

Team, making sure you saw this: In just two days, Donald Trump will be back in Michigan.
Trump and his allies are determined to buy Gary's seat and keep Mitch McConnell's grip on the Senate. And they'll spend any amount to make it happen. This is an urgent moment, friend, and we're looking for 53 more supporters from 48003 to step up right away -- please chip in $3 or whatever you can spare now.

Breaking news, team: Donald Trump is headed back to Michigan in just TWO DAYS.
Trump’s already funneled MILLIONS of dollars toward buying this seat for my far-right opponent – and now he's holding ANOTHER rally here in the final week of the election because he knows Michigan is the tipping point of Senate control.
Friend, Trump's visit could make all the difference in this razor-thin race. After being outraised for four of the last five quarters, new polling shows me two points BEHIND my far-right opponent, and RealClearPolitics just moved this race from “Leans Dem” to “Toss-Up.”
Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight reports the ONLY way Democrats can take back the Senate is if we win in Michigan -- and with nearly two million Michiganders already casting their ballots, there's no time to spare.
With just NINE days until Election Day, we cannot afford to risk losing this seat. Will you rush a contribution of $3 or more now – whatever you can – to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

"(match extended!)
Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Friend: we fell $9,451 short of our must-hit goal last night.
And the GOP knows that Democrats can't take back the Senate if Gary loses, so they're doing whatever they can to buy Michigan's Senate seat.
Not only did Mitch McConnell’s shady super PAC just spend $3 MILLION on attack ads against Gary, Betsy DeVos' family ALSO dumped nearly $1 MILLION on attack ads. And now, a poll is showing this race TIED.
A GOP win in Michigan will hand Mitch McConnell control of the Senate for another two years. In that time, who knows how many more extremist Supreme Court justices he could confirm.
But, we just got a GREAT update: After hearing we fell short of our match goal, a group of donors offered to EXTEND this incredible match opportunity – but only until midnight tonight:
With Senate control – and the future of the Supreme Court – riding on what happens here in Michigan, we MUST take complete advantage of this incredible opportunity. Can we count on you to rush a donation of $3 – and have every dollar DOUBLED – to defend Michigan's Senate seat and take back the Senate for Democrats?
Donate $3 (becomes $6)
Donate $25 (becomes $50)

Friend: CBS is reporting that the next two years of Senate control all hinge on what happens in Michigan.
That's why Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump have helped funnel millions to buy Michigan's Senate seat. They know winning in Michigan means expanding the GOP's hold on the Senate and on the Supreme Court.
But right now, polling has Gary Peters TIED with his Trump-backed extremist opponent.
Democrats CANNOT take back the Senate without winning in Michigan, but we’re about to fall short of our most important goal yet if we don't raise another $39,638 by TOMORROW at midnight.

"The most important race happening in 2020 is for control of the Senate.
I will not be the first, nor will I be the last to tell you this, friends: The most important race happening in 2020 is for control of the Senate.
I have a front-row seat to the damage Mitch McConnell is causing in the Senate. He is blocking every last attempt at progress that our Democratic colleagues in the House are fighting so hard for – environmental protections, gun safety measures, affordable healthcare. If Joe Biden wins the White House, he MUST have the Senate as well.
That's why I'm reaching out to you about Gary Peters' race in Michigan. Experts from FiveThirtyEight to Roll Call say Democrats can win back the Senate – but only if Gary wins in Michigan.
The thing is that Gary's reelection won't be easy. He's one of two Democratic Senate candidates fighting to win in a state President Trump carried. To top it all off, recent polling shows him nearly two points behind his hard-right opponent, who was handpicked by Trump and McConnell.
So here's the deal: I told Gary I'd help him raise $8,000 to protect Michigan's Democratic Senate seat, and we really need to hit that goal before midnight. Can I count on you to give now and help us take back the Senate majority?
Please, click here to give $3 or more now to help Gary Peters keep Michigan blue, defeat Mitch McConnell and take back the Senate for Democrats.

"I was the only Democratic senator to be outraised last quarter.
Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Team, I'm reaching out one last time before we close the books tonight because frankly, we're falling short of today's fundraising target -- and with only 21 days left to defend this seat, we can't afford to let that happen.
I'll cut right to it: Can you spare $3 or more before we close the books tonight -- and have every dollar MATCHED -- to win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats?
Thank you,
Gary
\----Forwarded message----
There's no way of sugarcoating this, friend: I was the only Democratic senator to be outraised this summer – and our Trump- and DeVos-backed opponent outraised us five times in a row. Friend, it couldn't have come at a worse time, with a brand-new poll from the New York Times showing me only ONE POINT ahead of my far-right opponent.
With analysts at CBS News reporting that Michigan’s Senate race will decide Senate control, we’ll have zero chance of taking back the Senate if we lose this seat. It's why right-wing interests from Donald Trump to Mitch McConnell to the DeVos family are funneling in over $30 million to buy this Senate seat.
I’m no stranger to tough fights: Fighting for the people of Michigan is the greatest honor of my life, and I do not plan on ceding this seat to a right-wing extremist.
But if we're going to win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats, we CANNOT afford to keep being outraised. That's why my team set a goal to raise $500,000 before our last FEC filing deadline of the campaign at midnight tomorrow to make up our fundraising gap. And after hearing how important this race is, a group of donors offered to MATCH every contribution made between now and the deadline!
Our opponent has the full force of GOP special interests behind him – but I have you. So I'm asking: Before midnight, can I count on you to contribute $3 or more now – every dollar you can spare – and have every dollar DOUBLED to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

In a race this close, fundraising is an important way campaigns can show their strength – and right now, we need to show the GOP that we won’t lose this election by hitting our $500,000 target and not backing down an inch until polls close on Election Day.
Thanks for fighting by my side for working families in Michigan and across the country.

Friend, here’s the good news: Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight reports Democrats can take back the Senate! But our only path to Senate control starts with winning here in Michigan, and recent polling has me nearly TWO POINTS BEHIND my Trump-backed opponent.

Friend – Despite unprecedented support for our campaign in Michigan, my extreme right-wing GOP opponent has broken fundraising records, and we were outraised FIVE times in a row.
This is thanks to Donald Trump funneling MILLIONS into Michigan to defeat me and buy this seat to expand Mitch McConnell’s majority in the Senate.

Friend, here’s the good news: Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight reports Democrats can take back the Senate. But first we have to win here in Michigan.
With RealClearPolitics moving this race from ""Leans Dem"" to ""Toss-up"" and a new poll showing my opponent LEADING by .1%, every single dollar matters. If we're going to win and take back the Senate, we cannot fall further behind.

"This country’s postal service is part of our everyday lives. We need to fight to save it.
Folks,
In the coming months, we may be forced to say goodbye to the United States Postal Service.
Yes, friend, you read that right. In a time when millions of Americans are relying on the USPS to deliver supplies during a pandemic or even our right to vote using mail-in ballots, the Post Office could become defunct. It’s all thanks to Donald Trump and Senate Republicans refusing to issue emergency funding to the federal postal service.
If they get their way, the USPS will run out of funding in a matter of months.
It’s hard to imagine losing a beloved institution that’s served Americans since our nation’s founding – but that’s exactly what’s going to happen unless the Trump administration takes action. I've already negotiated a loan so the Postal Service can continue operating – but the only way to get USPS the funding it needs to survive is by having voters like you speak up.
Friend, will you join the thousands who have already signed my petition demanding the Trump administration take action to save the Postal Service? I’m hoping to add at least 5,000 new signatures before midnight tonight.
SIGN THE PETITION
Losing our country’s postal service would be devastating for so many Americans, including our rural communities right here in Michigan. We can’t let the Trump administration get away with this.

"Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
This is urgent, team: We just learned the DeVos family super PAC is dumping another HALF A MILLION dollars into ads attacking Gary -- bringing their total spending to more than $7 million.
They know it's the best way to buy Michigan's Senate seat and guarantee Mitch McConnell will call the shots in Washington for another two years.
Gary doesn’t have the backing of far-right billionaires like the DeVos family, but he does have something more powerful: you. Will you make an immediate contribution of $3 or more right now to defend Michigan's Democratic Senate Seat?
Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight reports the ONLY way Democrats can flip the Senate is by winning in Michigan. But this new DeVos spending could tip the scales in this race – and right now, the polls are showing Gary and his Trump-backed opponent STATISTICALLY TIED.
Senate control hangs in the balance here in Michigan -- but right now, we're still $3,194 short of what we need to raise TODAY to win.
In a race this close – with Senate control on the line – every dollar could make the difference between winning and losing. Gary's counting on your immediate contribution to win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats.
Rush $3 or more now or more now – whatever you can by midnight tonight – to defend Michigan's Democratic Senate seat and take back the Senate for Democrats!

"A brand-new poll shows Gary BEHIND
Team: CBS News reports Democrats have ZERO chance to flip the Senate if we lose in Michigan, but a brand-new poll released today shows our hard-right extremist opponent nearly TWO POINTS AHEAD of Gary.
Gary has been outraised four out of the last five quarters because Republicans like Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and the DeVos family are funneling nearly $30 MILLION into Michigan to buy this seat for the GOP.
And now it's clear the GOP dark-money war chest is making a difference: RealClearPolitics just moved this race from “Leans Dem” to “Toss Up” – and CNN says this seat is one of the MOST LIKELY TO FLIP in November with just over two weeks left in this race.
Gary was the ONLY Democratic senator to be outraised this summer, and we can't afford to be outraised again. So we set a goal to raise another $20,000 by 11:59 p.m. TONIGHT – but we’re already falling short of what we need to win.
This is the biggest election of our lifetimes, and we need your support: Will you contribute rush $3 or more now – every dollar you can spare – to win in Michigan, take back the Senate and protect the future of the Supreme Court from Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump?

Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Folks, you can buy a lot of things with $3 million. Heck, Mitch McConnell is betting on it.
It’s why he’s funneling money into attack ads against me right here in Michigan. He thinks he can buy Michigan voters to hold onto his Senate majority. But team, I'm not scared of Mitch McConnell. In fact, he's made it clear that he’s scared of you and me.
After nationwide Democratic victories in 2018 -- including right here in Michigan -- McConnell knew he was in trouble. That’s why Republicans have made me their number one target and are spending whatever they can to flip this seat. I’m not afraid, team -- especially because I’ve got you by my side.
This morning, a group of donors agreed to match every single donation up to $50,000 to fight back against these attacks. We’re coming down to the last few hours to match a donation and are still $9,174 away. Can you chip in any amount before midnight?

Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
In a moment, I’m going to ask you to make a donation to help keep up our momentum, friend, and here’s why: After being outraised by my far-right opponent for over a year running, our last quarterly haul was LARGER than our opponent’s -- even though Trump, McConnell and Betsy DeVos’ family funnelled in millions to prop up his campaign.
Because of grassroots supporters like you, we brought in:
* The largest quarterly haul of any Senate candidate in Michigan’s history
* The largest quarterly haul of our entire campaign
* Over 300,000 first-time donors!
Now here’s why we can’t afford to slow down even a little bit.
Not only did our opponent outraise us 4 out of the last 5 quarters, GOP outside groups are funneling in over $30 MILLION to attack Gary. And you can bet that this powerful show of grassroots strength from our supporters will only spur Mitch McConnell and his billionaire allies to ratchet up their efforts to buy this seat.
Because the GOP knows what we know: Democrats have ZERO chance of taking back the Senate if we lose in Michigan. So I’ll say it again: We can’t slow down.
With only 11 days left and new polling showing me nearly two points behind my far-right opponent, friend, will you rush $3 or more right now – every dollar you can – to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

IMPORTANT UPDATE, friend: Betsy DeVos' family is trying to buy Michigan's Senate seat for our right-wing Trump-backed opponent:

Her family dumped nearly $1 million into Michigan to buy this seat for Mitch McConnell and the GOP. And that's not all: we just learned the DeVos family super PAC has raised OVER $2 MILLION to defeat Gary here in Michigan.

"just heard from our finance team
I just heard from our finance team, and I have to be honest with you, friend: Our fundraising is just not where it needs to be if we want to stay on track to win. We're up against over $30 MILLION in outside Republican spending – and a brand-new poll shows my opponent up nearly two points.
My far-right opponent, John James, says he backs Donald Trump ""2000%"" – and at his rally in Michigan last night, Trump told his crowd to vote for James and called him an ""outstanding guy.""
My opponent has outraised us four out of the last five quarters thanks to Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and the DeVos family funneling tens of millions of dollars into Michigan to buy this seat for the GOP. And if we don't close our funding gap, he could pull ahead in the polls for good.
Simply put, friend? We cannot allow that to happen. RealClearPolitics just moved our race from “Leans Dem” to “Toss Up” – and in tight races like this, every single dollar makes a difference. With Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight reporting Democrats have ZERO chance to take back the Senate if we lose in Michigan, what we do in moments like this could decide whether Mitch McConnell keeps his grip on the Senate.
We're beginning a mad dash to the finish line, and we need to show my opponent and his wealthy backers that we're here to win. We need to raise another $11,628 TODAY to stay on track, and I'm counting on your help to make that happen. With only 16 days until Election Day and Michiganders already casting their ballots by the thousands, we don't have any time to spare.
Will you contribute $3 or more now – whatever you can spare – to win in Michigan, flip the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court from Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell?

"Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
I know I’ve reached out before, but it’s important, friend. We’re talking about the very future of the U.S. Postal Service (USPS).
We’re coming up to the end of our USPS open submissions to hear from people like you. If we could have 816 more folks sign on, it’d go a long way. So, friend, would you kindly add your name to save the Postal Service?
Thank you,
Gary
\----Forwarded message----
Friend, I want to bring a very important issue to the front of your inbox: The U.S. Postal Service (USPS).
We've seen a significant drop in services, and revenue could plummet by more than 50%. The bottom line is the Postal Service could be insolvent by September of this year.
Without congressional action, there’s a very real chance our federal postal system could cease to exist. This would be devastating for the entire country, but it would hit our rural communities especially hard. For the more rural parts of Michigan, the Postal Service is a vital connection. That’s why I’ll do everything in my power to ensure the USPS remains strong and vibrant.
I've negotiated a loan so the Postal Service could continue operating – but there are bigger challenges ahead that demand action from Congress and the president. I need your help: Friend, will you add your name to my petition demanding Congress take action to save the Postal Service? I’m hoping to get 4,000 signatures before midnight tonight.
SIGN THE PETITION
I really appreciate you speaking out. These times are hard for all of us, but we can’t lose sight of the many facets that make our country great.

"Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Mitch McConnell just upended this race, team. Here’s what’s happening --
FIRST: McConnell said that Trump’s Supreme Court nominee will receive a vote on the Senate floor without delay, BEFORE the American people have their say.
THEN: Gary’s far-right opponent John James came out of hiding and CONFIRMED his support for rushing through a SCOTUS nominee.
NOW: Mitch McConnell returned the favor by having his super PAC dump a jaw-dropping $9 MILLION into this race to buy Michigan's Senate seat. That’s nearly $300,000 EVERY SINGLE DAY blanketing the airwaves with attack ads against Gary Peters for the next month.
The stakes are clear: Step up now to defend Gary’s seat and take back the Senate from McConnell or let Mitch McConnell BUY this seat for his rubber stamp candidate -- who will help rush a THIRD Trump nominee onto the Supreme Court, gut health care protections for people with pre-existing conditions, and more.
And they’ll be nearly impossible to stop -- because Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight and CBS analysts agree: Democrats have ZERO chance to take back the Senate if we lose in Michigan.
We've set a rapid-response goal to raise an emergency $300,000 – there's simply no other option. But right now, we're falling short, and with polls showing Gary falling behind with only 33 days left in the election, time is running out.

We’re less than a week from Election Day. But this election won’t be decided on Tuesday -- it’s being decided RIGHT NOW. In fact, over TWO MILLION Michiganders have already cast their ballots.
But 13% of Michigan voters are still undecided, and the New York Times reports that “Michigan stands out as a place where winning the middle could make the difference.”
Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight reports that  ONLY way Democrats can take back the Senate is by winning in Michigan, and with just SIX DAYS left in this race there’s no time to spare.
With less than a week to turn this around, we need the resources to reach as many voters as possible right away -- and that means we need to reach our Get Out the Vote fundraising goal of $200,000 right away. Please, contribute $3 or more -- whatever you can spare -- to help us reach every voter, keep Michigan blue, and take back the Senate for Democrats.

"Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Folks,
With Donald Trump and his handpicked postmaster general undermining the USPS in plain sight, I launched a full investigation.
And when the outcry of Americans experiencing massive mail delays became so large, I called for an emergency hearing to protect the Postal Service.
But in the midst of all of this, where is Mitch McConnell? Not at work. In fact, he sent the Senate home in the middle of a crisis. And Donald Trump? Golfing.
This is simply unacceptable. I won’t rest until we have real answers and real solutions -- and I need as many people as possible adding their voices to mine.
Sign now and demand Congress take action to save the Postal Service.
It’s part of my job to pay close attention to what people in Michigan are saying -- including what they have to say about the Postal Service and how it’s affecting people’s everyday lives. So when I started hearing from constituents and postal workers alike about massive mail delays, that’s when I knew to take action.
With Election Day nearing, protecting our ability to vote-by-mail is a critical issue for our democracy -- but it’s even broader than that.
Whether it's life-saving medicine or paychecks or their ability to get bills so they pay them on time so they don't have late fees, the Postal Service touches so many aspects of our lives, which makes it even more astonishing that Mitch McConnell isn’t treating this emergency with the seriousness it deserves.
I need you by my side as I continue leading the fight to defend the Postal Service from the Trump Administration’s attacks. Are you in?
Click here to add your name and demand Congress intervene to save the Postal Service.
I’m grateful to have your support.
Don't let up now,
Gary

Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Friend: CBS is reporting that the next two years of Senate control all hinge on what happens in Michigan.
That's why Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump have helped funnel millions to buy Michigan's Senate seat. They know winning in Michigan means expanding the GOP's control over the Senate and on the Supreme Court.
But right now, polling has Gary Peters TWO POINTS BEHIND his Trump-backed extremist opponent.
Democrats CANNOT take back the Senate without winning in Michigan. That's why it's crucial that we hit our mid-month grassroots fundraising goal -- but right now we're falling short by  $36,029.
We can’t win without hitting this goal, friend. What you do right now can help decide the fate of Senate control: So please, will you rush $3 or more to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

This can’t wait, friend: Thanks to special interests and Mitch McConnell, I was outraised FOUR quarters in a row – and my team just let me know that we're falling dangerously short of our final end-of-quarter goal of this race.
We’re exactly $119,352 short of our goal to win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats. But with just days until our final FEC quarterly filing deadline, we're not on track to come up with what we need to win.
Friend, we CANNOT afford to fall short this quarter. Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight reports that what happens here in Michigan will determine Senate control for the next two years – and a recent poll shows me nearly TWO POINTS BEHIND my Trump-endorsed opponent.
There is too much at stake to sit on the sidelines: Every dollar chipped in right now will help decide Senate control for Democrats, so rush $3 or more to defend Michigan's Democratic Senate seat, take back the Senate and protect the future of the Supreme Court!

"Trump says John James has his ""total and complete endorsement.""
I know it’s late but this is extremely important: Donald Trump just gave Gary’s right-wing opponent his “total and complete endorsement” during Trump’s FIFTH MAGA rally in Michigan. With Gary down by nearly two points and the future of the Senate as well as the Supreme Court hanging in the balance, how we respond right now could make the difference between winning and losing.
Will you pitch in $3 or more right now to flip the Senate and protect the future of the Supreme Court? You can use this link: [[URL REDACTED]]
Thank you for coming through when so much is on the line.

Friend, Donald Trump and John James JUST stepped off the stage in Michigan after attacking me in an effort to flip this seat.
It's clear, friend: our opponent John James stands “2000%” with Trump -- and Trump is counting on him to be in the Senate.
But here's the deal, after being outraised for over a year, a brand new poll shows our team trailing by almost 2 POINTS. On top of that, RealClearPolitics just moved this race from “Leans Dem” to “Toss-Up.” And Trump’s rally tonight could make this race closer -- even tipping the scales into the GOP’s favor.
The White House and Senate control are on the line in Michigan, and Trump just showed how badly he wants to defeat me and Joe Biden. If you're ready to take back the Senate AND the White House for Democrats, I need you to step up now. Chip in $3 or whatever you can.

"I need to give you an update on our race in Michigan.
Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Team--
Did you see this update from Gary? The stakes have never been higher -- and with thousands of Michiganders already casting their ballots, this election is well underway.
We're almost out of time and we're still $5,194 short of today's goal. Can you chip in $3 or more right now to help us win in Michigan and take back Senate control from Mitch McConnell?
\----Forwarded message----
Friend – we’re just 25 days away from Election Day, and with Republicans going all out to flip this seat, I need to give you an update on our race in Michigan.
For over a year, Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and the DeVos family have funneled MILLIONS of dollars into Michigan to buy this seat. My extreme right-wing opponent has outraised me time and time again – in fact, I was the only Democratic senator outraised this summer.
And after constant GOP attacks and a massive flow of dark money being spent against me, a new internal poll from my opponent now shows us statistically tied – and RealClearPolitics moved our race from “Leans Dem” to “Toss-Up.”
The honest truth is that Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight is right: Democrats have ZERO chance to take back the Senate if we lose here in Michigan. My far-right opponent knows it too – and that's why Trump has come back to Michigan again and again to try and flip this seat.
So I’m asking for your help today: Our team set a goal to raise $50,000 from grassroots supporters by this weekend, but we’re falling $15,423 short of our daily goal – and I’m counting on your help to close the gap immediately: Will you contribute $3 or more now to help me win in Michigan, take back the Senate and protect the future of the Supreme Court from Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell?

"It’s happening, team: Gary just called for an investigation into allegations that Betsy DeVos misused private data to undermine legal protections for student borrowers.
Gary isn’t afraid to stand up for what’s right. But the DeVos family has already shelled out more than $1 million to prop up Gary’s extreme right-wing opponent -- and now their attacks are definitely going to get worse! Chip in now to help Gary keep standing strong against Betsy DeVos. >>
This is just the latest example of Betsy DeVos showing just how unfit she is to hold the top position in America’s education system. Michigan’s students and teachers deserve better.
And with recent polling showing our race TIED and Nate Silver reporting the only way Democrats can flip the Senate is by winning Michigan -- there is no doubt that she’ll be coming after Gary.
Betsy DeVos is desperate to unseat leaders like Gary who hold her accountable for harming students with her far-right agenda. Can you chip in $3 right now to make sure Betsy DeVos doesn’t buy Gary’s Senate seat out from under him?

Folks –
Earlier this week, I wrote to you about our far-right opponent clinching the Republican nomination for this Senate seat.
And with less than three months to go, we're TIED with my Trump-endorsed opponent in a recent poll! That’s not all – a right-wing super PAC has dumped $1 million on ads attacking me in Michigan, and our race was downgraded from ""Lean Dem"" to ""Toss Up.""
Why does this matter? Because Democrats cannot take back the Senate if we lose in Michigan. Period.
But we have amazing news! A group of dedicated donors will match every contribution, up to our $50,000 goal, so we can protect Michigan's Senate seat. The catch: It goes away at midnight tonight.
Folks – this is an incredible opportunity: Can I count on you to rush $3 now (becomes $6) to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?
With Mitch McConnell at the helm, Senate Republicans have already confirmed two extreme right-wing justices to the Supreme Court and threatened to dismantle affordable health care. Honestly, it's never been more important for Democrats to win back the Senate majority.
We can do it. Democrats can take back the Senate, but ONLY if we win here in Michigan. That's why I'm counting on you to take full advantage of this rare match opportunity – whatever you donate will go twice as far to defend Michigan's Democratic Senate seat!
What you do right now is so important: Please, will you rush $3 (becomes $6) right now to have every dollar DOUBLED to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

"The most important race happening in 2020 is for control of the Senate.
I will not be the first, nor will I be the last to tell you this, friends: The most important race happening in 2020 is for control of the Senate.
I have a front-row seat to the damage Mitch McConnell is causing in the Senate. He is blocking every last attempt at progress that our Democratic colleagues in the House are fighting so hard for – environmental protections, gun safety measures, affordable healthcare. If Joe Biden wins the White House, he MUST have the Senate as well.
That's why I'm reaching out to you about Gary Peters' race in Michigan. Experts from FiveThirtyEight to Roll Call say Democrats can win back the Senate – but only if Gary wins in Michigan.
The thing is that Gary's reelection won't be easy. He's one of two Democratic Senate candidates fighting to win in a state President Trump carried. To top it all off, polls are showing Gary two points behind his hard-right opponent, handpicked by Trump and McConnell.
So here's the deal: I told Gary I'd help him raise $6,000 to protect Michigan's Democratic Senate seat, and we really need to hit that goal before midnight. Can I count on you to give now and help us take back the Senate majority?

Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
There's no way of sugarcoating this, friend: I was the only Democratic senator to be outraised last quarter – and this makes it the FIFTH straight reporting period that our Trump- and DeVos-backed opponent has outraised us. Friend, it couldn't have come at a worse time, with a brand new poll showing our opponent in the lead  for the first time in months.
With analysts at CBS News reporting that Michigan’s Senate race will decide Senate control, we’ll have zero chance of taking back the Senate if we lose this seat. It's why right-wing interests from Donald Trump to Mitch McConnell to the DeVos family are funneling in millions to buy this Senate seat.
I’m no stranger to tough fights: Fighting for the people of Michigan is the greatest honor of my life, and I do not plan on ceding this seat to a right-wing extremist.
But if we're going to win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats, we CANNOT afford to keep being outraised. That's why my team set a rapid-response goal to raise $12,000 immediately to make up our shortfall, but right now, we're falling short of what we need to win.
Our opponent has the full force of GOP special interests behind him – but I have you. So I'm asking: Before midnight, can I count on you to contribute $3 or more now – every dollar you can spare – to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

"Take a look at what we’re up against:
BREAKING:  Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight just predicted that Gary’s opponent is  “within striking distance” of winning Michigan’s Senate Race -- after reporting that Democrats have ZERO chance of taking back the Senate if Gary loses.
That’s why GOP billionaires are teaming up  right now to prop up Gary’s opponent. In just the last few weeks:
* The  DeVos family super PAC increased their spending to a total of  $7 million  in TV ads attacking Gary.
* A Koch family super PAC endorsed Gary's opponent and flooded Michigan with a six-figure ad buy.
* In total, Republican groups are funneling in over $30 MILLION against Gary -- and we learned that our race could be THE MOST EXPENSIVE in Michigan History!
This onslaught of GOP ads and endorsements is tipping the scales. After RealClearPolitics moved this race from “Lean Dem” to “Toss Up,” a new poll from the New York Times shows Gary nearly TWO POINTS BEHIND his far-right opponent.
The GOP is surging in Michigan, and how we respond right now could determine what happens to Gary’s seat AND the Senate majority. We set a goal to raise $20,000 TODAY -- and with just 12 days until Election Day, we just can’t fall short.  Will you contribute $3 or more now – every dollar you can spare – to fight back against GOP spending in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats, and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Just weeks before an election, Mitch McConnell has vowed that Donald Trump's nominee will fill the Supreme Court vacancy and be put on the Senate floor for a vote.
It’s unacceptable, friend. Michiganders start casting their ballots this week and deserve to have their voices heard.
There’s no time to waste -- I’m looking for you and 37 more supporters from Almont to add your names to our new petition by 11:59 p.m. TONIGHT. Sign our urgent petition to tell Mitch McConnell and the Senate there should NOT be a Supreme Court nomination until the next presidential term begins.
ADD YOUR NAME
With a vacancy on the Supreme Court there’s so much at stake: health care protections for pre-existing conditions, Roe v. Wade and women’s health care, civil rights, voting rights and ensuring we’re putting workers before corporate special interests. I’m counting on you to use your voice now.
Thanks,
Gary

"He’s facing a tough reelection -- and he needs our help.
Friend --
When Senator Gary Peters saw images of broken pieces of machinery outside the Grand Rapids Post Office in Michigan, he immediately got to work finding out what was going on.
Just like in states across the country, mail isn’t making it to mailboxes in Michigan, and that dismantled machine was responsible for sorting mail. But Gary has been a champion for the U.S. Postal Service for years, and now that it’s under attack from the Trump Administration, there’s no stronger champion in the U.S. Senate than Gary to protect our mail and postal workers.
That’s who Gary is, and it’s why we need to keep him by my side in the Senate. But he’s facing a tough reelection this fall, with his opponent funded by an infamous family -- the DeVos family. They’re looking to silence him in his quest for truth against the Trump Administration, so we have to show him we have his back.
We set a mid-month goal of raising $6,000 to support Gary Peters’ reelection campaign: Will you donate $5 or more to keep him by my side in the Senate?

"Our Supreme Court is on the ballot this year.
Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
I'll be blunt, friend: The future of our country rests on what happens in Michigan. That's because our race will decide if Democrats take back Senate control from Mitch McConnell. This could not be more important.
Trump and McConnell have always known what's at stake and have funneled MILLIONS of dollars into Michigan to buy this seat. Their handpicked GOP opponent has also outraised us every step up of the way – what's more, RealClearPolitics moved this race from “Leans Dem"" to “Toss-Up,” and a recent poll has us trailing our far-right opponent.
When Election Day has come and gone, I don't want to look back and wish we had done more to stop Mitch McConnell from calling the shots on the future of our nation's highest court. So with CBS News reporting Democrats have zero chance of winning back the majority if we lose this seat, we've got to give this race everything we've got.
Our Supreme Court is on the ballot this year. To protect it, we MUST keep Michigan blue and flip the Senate, but we're still $18,529 short of our $30,000 midnight emergency goal, and we can't afford to fall short.
So I'm coming to you directly, friend: Will you make a contribution of $3 or more now to win in Michigan, take back the Senate and protect the Supreme Court from Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump?

This very moment, ballots are being cast for November’s election – and every voter should have their voice heard. The future of the Supreme Court should NOT be decided before voters have their voices heard, and the outcome of Michigan's Senate race will impact the future of the Supreme Court for generations to come.
I know you’ll put everything you can into this fight and ensure we defeat McConnell and Trump.
Thanks for fighting with me in this pivotal moment,
Gary

My team just sent out the latest updates on our race (see below) including some really bad news: recent polling shows me TIED with my GOP opponent.
So here's the deal, team: Senate control will be decided by who wins in Michigan, and our fundraising just isn’t where it needs to be. But if you chip in $3 now, you could help move us within range our $25,000 goal for today. Can I count on your help, friend?

Here's what you need to know about Michigan’s Senate race:
* John James, a hard-right extremist who says he backs Trump “2000%,” just won the GOP primary to take on Democrat Sen. Gary Peters.
* James has outraised Gary five times in a row thanks to Donald Trump, Betsy DeVos’ family and Mitch McConnell funneling in MILLIONS to buy this seat for the GOP.
* RealClearPolitics just moved this race from “Lean Dem” to “Toss Up” – and a new poll shows this race is statistically TIED.
Gary is the ONLY Democratic senator who was outraised last quarter, and Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight reports Democrats have ZERO chance to take back the Senate if Gary loses. That’s why we set an 11:59 p.m. deadline to raise $25,000 – but we’re already falling WAY short of what we need to win.
This is the most important election of our lifetimes, and we need your help: Will you contribute $3 or more now – every dollar you can spare – to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court from Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump?

That's all thanks to Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and the DeVos family funneling record amounts of money into Michigan - most recently, $9 million in attack ads from McConnell's super PAC.
With Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight reporting Democrats cannot take back the Senate if we lose in Michigan, it's no wonder the GOP has zeroed in on buying this seat.
After being outraised five times in a row, my Trump-backed opponent's massive war chest could decide the outcome of this election - especially with recent polling now showing me trailing by just .1%.
With voters already casting their ballots, we urgently need the resources to go toe-to-toe with the GOP and defend this seat.

Just the other day, President Trump personally attacked Gary, calling him a ""Do-nothing Democrat."" Now, the president is known for two things: his nicknames and his lies. But he doesn't know a thing about my husband. I want to tell you exactly who Gary Peters is:
He's the Senator who fights tirelessly for workers and small businesses. He’s the public servant pushing for quality, affordable health care coverage where insurance companies can no longer discriminate because of pre-existing conditions. And as a product of Michigan’s public schools, Gary has always fought for students and has continued to give them the tools they need to reach their full potential.
That's my husband – he's a fighter. For Michigan and our country. But right now, he's in the midst of his toughest election ever.
The stakes of this race have never been higher. Another two years of a Republican-held Senate means two more years of Mitch McConnell calling the shots in Washington. That means he and Donald Trump will team up to put more extremist justices like Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court, and you can bet they’ll keep trying to dismantle protections for those with pre-existing conditions.
My husband's been in tough election fights before, and he's all in to do it again. Believe me, Gary's going to fight tooth and nail to defend this Senate seat – but I'm making a personal ask for you to invest in this fight, too.
Gary's up against the likes of Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and nearly $1 million in dark money from the DeVos family, all vying to buy this seat for the GOP. That's why I'm reaching out to you today.
His team told me we need to raise another $7,500 by midnight, but right now, we're not quite there. Please, will you consider making a contribution to reelect my husband Gary, win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats?
Here's the best link to donate – whatever you give will go toward keeping Michigan blue and taking back the Senate for Democrats: [[URL REDACTED]]
From the bottom of my heart, thank you. Now let's go win this thing.

"As Trump gears up to head back to Michigan, our fundraising is falling short.
Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Friend – with Donald Trump gearing up for more MAGA rallies, he's certainly going to find his way back to Michigan for the FIFTH time to campaign against Gary Peters.
Last time he was here, Trump attacked Gary and praised our Republican opponent. He and Mitch McConnell NEED a victory here in Michigan to secure the GOP's hold on the Senate for another two years.
Now, analysts at CBS News are reporting Senate control depends on what happens here in Michigan, and after Betsy DeVos' family dumped nearly $1 MILLION in attack ads against Gary Peters, polls are showing this race TIED.
As Trump gears up to head back to Michigan, our fundraising is falling short. And in a race as close as this, with the future of the Senate on the line, every dollar could make the difference between winning and losing.
With just a few hours until midnight, we need to raise another $9,478 to win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats: Please, will you rush $3 – or whatever you can spare before midnight – to win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats?

"I can't do it alone.
Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Friend, I have an important update on the USPS that you need to see.
After hearing from thousands of Michiganders harmed by postal delays, I launched an investigation into changes directed by Trump’s new handpicked postmaster general -- and now the results are in.
My investigation found that on-time mail delivery dropped abruptly throughout the U.S., following Postmaster General DeJoy’s directives in July.  By the second week of August, there were approximately  85 MILLION  more late deliveries in that single week than would have otherwise occurred.
This is unacceptable, friend. For families, rural communities and veterans who count on the Postal Service to deliver vital goods and services including medication, mail delays can be a matter of life or death. And the Postal Service is still suffering problems under DeJoy’s changes, meaning mail-in voting in November is at risk for Michiganders and voters nationwide.
I’m grateful to each and every supporter who’s signed our previous petitions demanding Congressional action to protect the Postal Service.  But now that my investigation has revealed the true extent of the Trump administration's attempts to sabotage the USPS, I’m calling on every supporter who’s ready to protect the USPS to stand up NOW.
Will you sign my petition and demand Congress intervene to save the Postal Service? I’m counting on you to help us reach 15,000 signatures by 11:59 p.m. tonight.
SIGN THE PETITION
Thank you for speaking out,
Gary

"Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Friend,
Donald Trump is coming to Michigan TOMORROW -- so we just set a rapid response goal to raise $100,000 before he takes the stage. Here are three things you need to know before he arrives:
Gary's right-wing opponent supports the president ""2,000%"" -- and Republicans like Trump and Mitch McConnell have helped funnel over $30 MILLION into Michigan to defeat Gary and flip this seat red.
Senate control hinges on what happens here in Michigan, and right now, recent polling shows Gary two points BEHIND his extremist opponent!
Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight reports the ONLY way Democrats CAN take back the Senate is if we win in Michigan.
In a race this close, Gary is counting on your immediate contribution to win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrat -- and with just EIGHT DAYS until Election Day, we're running out of time:
Please, will you rush $3 or more now to help raise $100,000 before Trump's visit and ensure we can win in Michigan?

"Friend, this is important.
Nearly 2.5 million ballots have already been returned in Michigan, but 13% of Michiganders are still undecided in this race. With analysts at CBS News reporting Michigan's Senate race could determine Senate control, we simply CANNOT afford to lose this seat.
But our fundraising has slowed down at the worst moment possible, leaving us still $6,295 short of what we need to raise by 11:59 p.m. tonight.
RealClearPolitics moved this race from ""Leans Dem"" to ""Toss-Up,"" so we cannot afford to waste any time. This is the most important election of our lifetimes, so we're counting on supporters like you to come through in this critical moment:

"I need to give you an update on our race in Michigan.
Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Friend – we’re 38 days away from Election Day, and with Republicans going all out to flip this seat, I need to give you an update on our race in Michigan.
For over a year, Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and the DeVos family have funneled MILLIONS of dollars into Michigan to buy this seat. Every step of the way, my extreme right-wing opponent has outraised me – making me the only Democratic senator outraised last quarter.
And after constant GOP attacks and a massive flow of dark money being spent against me, a new poll now shows me trailing by nearly 2 points – and RealClearPolitics moved our race from “Leans Dem” to “Toss-Up.”
The honest truth is that Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight is right: Democrats have ZERO chance to take back the Senate if we lose here in Michigan. My far-right opponent knows it too – and that's why Trump has come back to Michigan again and again to try and flip this seat.
So I’m asking for your help today: Our team set a goal to raise $200,000 from grassroots supporters before our final FEC quarterly filing deadline. But we’re falling $8,294 short of our daily goal, and I’m counting on your help to close the gap immediately: Will you contribute $3 or more now to help me win in Michigan, take back the Senate and protect the future of the Supreme Court from Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell?

"It’s up to every one of us to make sure we win in Michigan.
$5 dollars, friend.
A $5 contribution from you today is what it will take for us to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats, and protect the future of the Supreme Court. Let me tell you why:
For the past YEAR we’ve been outpaced on fundraising every step of the way – and with a recent poll showing me nearly TWO POINTS BEHIND my far-right opponent, losing in Michigan would make it nearly impossible for Democrats to take back the Senate -- that means two more years of Mitch McConnell calling the shots on the future of our nation's highest court.
On top of all that, Republicans including the DeVos family, the Koch family and Mitch McConnell are funneling in OVER $25 MILLION to buy this seat for the GOP.
After McConnell's super PAC just announced it will be spending a new $9 MILLION to buy this seat, we've set a rapid-response goal to raise another $30,000 by 11:59 p.m. tonight to win in Michigan and keep this seat blue – but right now, we're falling short. Your $5 can make all the difference in getting us there.
You know the stakes, friend. Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight reports Democrats have zero chance at taking back the Senate if we lose in Michigan. It's moments like this – right here, right now – that will determine whether we defend this seat and take back the Senate.
Pitch in $5 now to help us defend Michigan's Senate seat, take back the Senate for Democrats, and protect the future of the Supreme Court.
It’s up to every one of us to make sure we keep Michigan blue this year. Thanks for fighting with me,
Gary

Friend, Trump's visit tomorrow could make all the difference in this razor-thin race. After being outraised for four of the last five quarters, a new New York Times poll shows me just one point ahead of my far-right opponent, and RealClearPolitics just moved this race from “Leans Dem” to “Toss-Up.”
Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight reports the ONLY way Democrats can take back the Senate is if we win in Michigan, so we need to raise $25,000 by 11:59 p.m. to stay on track to win.

It's official, friend: John James, the hard-right extremist who has said he backs Trump “2,000%,” just won the GOP primary for Michigan's Senate seat.
Here's why this is concerning: James has outraised our campaign five times in a row. Because of him, we were the ONLY Democratic senator outraised by a challenger last quarter. And he's got the support of Donald Trump, Betsy DeVos’ family and Mitch McConnell – who have been funneling in millions of dollars to buy this seat.
With analysts at CBS News reporting that Michigan’s Senate race will decide Senate control, we’ll have zero chance of taking back the Senate if we lose this seat. And right now that's a real possibility: RealClearPolitics just moved our race from “Lean Dem” to “Toss Up,” and a new poll shows this race is statistically TIED.
I've won tough elections before – but if we're going to win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats, we CANNOT afford to let John James and his GOP billionaire allies continue to outraise us, especially as we enter the general election.
So my team set a rapid-response goal to raise $50,000 immediately to make up our fundraising gap, but right now, we're falling short of what we need to win.

Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Friend: As the last full financial quarter of this election comes to a close, I want to give you an update on our race.
The bad news: Thanks to Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and the DeVos family steering MILLIONS of dollars against me, my extreme right-wing opponent has outraised me five times in a row.
The good news: We're on track to have the best online fundraising quarter of the campaign, and Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight is reporting that Democrats have an opportunity to take back the Senate!
The big news: Our only path to Senate control starts with winning here in Michigan. But brand new polling shows me nearly TWO POINTS BEHIND after the DeVos family super PAC dumped nearly $6 million into TV ads in Michigan to buy this seat for Mitch McConnell and the GOP.
And now, with analysts at CBS News reporting that Michigan will decide Senate control, we set a goal to raise another $200,000 by the end of the quarter tonight to win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats -- but we're still $39,692 short.
Friend: In a race this close, with the Senate and the future of the Supreme Court on the line, falling short could very well cost Democrats our chance to take back the Senate.
I wouldn't ask if it wasn't critically important: Friend, will you rush $3 or more right now – every dollar you can – to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

Friend, the stakes could not be higher.
With a vacancy on the Supreme Court, health care protections for pre-existing conditions, Roe v. Wade and women’s health care, civil rights, voting rights, and workers’ rights are on the line. Michiganders start casting their ballots this week and deserve to have their voices heard. There should NOT be a Supreme Court nomination until the next presidential term begins.
But just weeks before an election, Mitch McConnell has vowed that Donald Trump's nominee will fill the Supreme Court vacancy and be put on the Senate floor for a vote.
The Supreme Court is on the ballot this November, friend. And with analysts at CBS News reporting that Michigan’s Senate race will decide Senate control, we’ll have ZERO chance of taking back the Senate from McConnell and protecting the Supreme Court if we lose this seat.
That’s why Trump, McConnell and their Republican-allies are funnelling TENS of MILLIONS of dollars to buy this seat -- and after weeks of nonstop GOP attacks against me, a recent poll shows my Trump- and McConnell-backed opponent in the lead by TWO POINTS.
Keeping Michigan blue and flipping the Senate has never been more important, that’s why my team and I have set a $20,000 emergency goal by 11:59 p.m. TONIGHT. Friend, I’m personally asking: Can I count on you to contribute $3 or more now to win in Michigan, take back the Senate and protect the Supreme Court from Mitch McConnell?

Friend, we’re now exactly seven weeks away from Election Day, and with Senate control on the line in Michigan,  we’re counting on you to pitch in toward our $50,000 mid-month grassroots goal today. Here’s why:
Michiganders will begin casting their ballots in just nine days, friend -- and the tens of millions of dollars being spent against Gary by GOP dark money groups could be enough to tip the scales in this race.
For over a year, Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and the DeVos family have funneled MILLIONS of dollars into Michigan to buy this seat.  And after constant GOP attacks and a massive flow of dark money being spent against us, a new poll now shows Gary trailing by nearly 2 points.
Seven weeks isn’t a lot of time, friend.  If you’re ready to stop Trump and his allies from flipping Michigan red, the time to step up is right now.
Mid-month grassroots goal: $50,000
Progress to goal: 23%
Money left to raise: $38,496
Your contribution to our mid-month goal:  Nothing yet!
Will you contribute $3 or more now to help Gary win in Michigan, take back the Senate and protect the future of the Supreme Court from Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell?

I know I’ve reached out before, but it’s important, friend. We’re talking about the very future of the U.S. Postal Service (USPS).
We’re coming up to the end of our USPS open submissions to hear from people like you. If we could have 816 more folks sign on, it’d go a long way. So, friend, would you kindly add your name to save the Postal Service?
Thank you,

\----Forwarded message----
Friend, I want to bring a very important issue to the front of your inbox: The U.S. Postal Service (USPS).
We've seen a significant drop in services, and revenue could plummet by more than 50%. The bottom line is the Postal Service could be insolvent by September of this year.
Without congressional action, there’s a very real chance our federal postal system could cease to exist. This would be devastating for the entire country, but it would hit our rural communities especially hard. For the more rural parts of Michigan, the Postal Service is a vital connection. That’s why I’ll do everything in my power to ensure the USPS remains strong and vibrant.
I've negotiated a loan so the Postal Service could continue operating – but there are bigger challenges ahead that demand action from Congress and the president. I need your help: Friend, will you add your name to my petition demanding Congress take action to save the Postal Service? I’m hoping to get 4,000 signatures before midnight tonight.
SIGN THE PETITION
I really appreciate you speaking out. These times are hard for all of us, but we can’t lose sight of the many facets that make our country great.

"An ONSLAUGHT of right-wing money is flooding into Michigan.
URGENT NEWS, team: An ONSLAUGHT of right-wing money is flooding into Michigan to buy Gary's Senate seat for the GOP – and that's because Donald Trump just gave his ""total and complete endorsement"" to Gary's far-right opponent.
Trump, McConnell, the DeVos family and all their allies have spent MILLIONS to defeat Gary, and this endorsement couldn't come at a worse time: After being outraised for an entire year, recent polling now shows Gary trailing by nearly 2 points.
Right now, we're falling $7,912 short of our midnight fundraising goal. With Trump weighing in to tip the scales of this toss-up race, we cannot afford to fall short – not with Senate control and the Supreme Court on the line.

Team, tomorrow, we’re sitting down with Gary to review all of the signatures on his petition demanding Congress take action to save the United States Postal Service. And we're still missing your name.
That means today is your LAST CHANCE to sign -- and we’re still looking for at least 37 more names from 48003. Can you sign on before the petition closes at midnight?
YES, I'LL ADD MY NAME
Unless we act now, prices will increase for everyone when it comes to getting packages and prescriptions delivered – and folks in rural communities in Michigan and across the country could be cut off from vital services like vote-by-mail.
And without intervention by Congress, 600,000 federal Postal Service workers could lose their jobs – including many in 48003, friend.
Before we close the books on this petition, add your name to demand Congress take action to save the Post Office.
It is up to us to end this looming crisis to a vital American institution and save the U.S. Postal Service before Donald Trump and his Washington Republican allies allow it to become insolvent as soon as September.

Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
We have a real chance to flip the United States Senate this year, friend.
And Michigan will be one of our most important battleground states, according to some of the top experts.
That's why I’m reaching out to you on behalf of my friend, Gary Peters. He’s running for re-election to the Senate so he can keep fighting for working families in Michigan and across the country. If making a donation would make sense for you right now, please chip in to help keep Gary Peters in the fight.
Chip in to help re-elect Gary!
Gary Peters is a fifth-generation Michigander and lifelong public servant. In the Senate, we know we can count on his effective leadership.
But the GOP is dumping money into Michigan to try to buy this seat. If they succeed, Michigan will lose a champion for workers and small businesses -- and we’d all lose with two more years of Mitch McConnell’s failed Senate leadership.
If we fight side by side, we can win one of the most important elections of our lifetimes. So friend, can you join me in helping to re-elect Gary Peters? If you can, please chip in $3 or whatever makes sense to you to ensure we hold onto this seat and flip the Senate this November.
Look, I don’t need to tell you that Washington is home to some big egos. But there are also some leaders who break the mold -- like my friend Gary.
We've worked together for years, and he fights from the heart to serve the people of Michigan. It's why he's worked so hard to protect the Great Lakes, and defend protections for preexisting conditions at all costs.
Michiganders don’t deserve to lose a real, effective leader like Gary. But Donald Trump’s allies and Betsy Devos’ family are spending MILLIONS to defeat him and hold onto Senate control. We’ll need an outpouring of grassroots support to win in November.
I’m fired up about this race, friend. And I’d be grateful if you could pitch in $3, or whatever you can, to support Gary Peters.
Thanks for being a part of this,
Elizabeth Warren

"Mitch McConnell and his Washington Republican allies just launched ANOTHER entirely false attack
Friend,
We’ve said it before and we’ll say it again: this is the most important election of our lifetimes.
And now, CNN is reporting the Michigan Senate seat is one of the most likely to flip. On top of that, a recent poll shows Gary nearly TWO POINTS behind his Trump-backed opponent.
Simply put, the fate of the Senate and future of the Supreme Court could be determined by this race. Team, we can’t afford to have Mitch McConnell controlling the Senate for two more years.
That’s why we’re committed to expanding voter outreach and protections across Michigan to ensure Democrats flip the Senate, send Joe Biden to the White House and restore order to the nation.

$5 dollars, friend.
A $5 contribution from you today is what it will take for us to win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats. Let me tell you why:
I was just outraised for the FOURTH quarter in a row. That means that for the past YEAR we’ve been outpaced on fundraising every step of the way – and with a recent poll showing my opponent in the lead, losing in Michigan would make it nearly impossible for Democrats to take back the Senate.
And to tip the scales in this race, the DeVos family and right-wing groups are funneling millions into super PACs to buy this seat for McConnell and Trump.
After talking with my finance team, we've set a goal to raise another $15,000 by midnight to win in Michigan and keep this seat blue. Your $5 can make all the difference in getting us there.
You know the stakes, friend. Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight reports Democrats have zero chance at taking back the Senate if we lose in Michigan. It's moments like this – right here, right now – that will determine whether we defend this seat and take back the Senate.
Pitch in $5 now to help us defend Michigan's Senate seat, fight this right-wing spending from Trump and the DeVos family and take back the Senate for Democrats.
It’s up to every one of us to make sure we come out victorious on Election Day. Thanks for fighting with me,

Team -- After we found out that a New York Times poll had us only one point ahead of our Trump-endorsed opponent, supporters in Michigan and across the nation leapt into action. In fact, we OUTRAISED my opponent in the first half of October!
Together, we showed Mitch McConnell and his GOP billionaire allies that Michigan’s Senate seat is NOT for sale \-- and voters across the nation are ready for a Democratic Senate majority.
But I’ll cut straight to it: We just fell short of our fundraising goal for the first time this month, and our Trump-backed opponent still has a major cash-on-hand advantage. In fact, he's launching new ads right as Michiganders are casting their ballots. There's still so much left to be done, and with Republicans doing everything they can to tip the scales against us, we cannot afford to slow down in Michigan -- not even a little bit.
With analysts at CBS News reporting that Michigan will decide Senate control, we’ve set an emergency goal to raise $250,000 -- but we’re still falling short, and with nearly two million Michiganders already casting their ballots there's no time to spare.

Getting Donald Trump out of the White House is a top priority for voters across Michigan and all over the country.
I want to know more -- so I’ve requested a survey that’s all about the Trump administration and its effect on American families. And I’ve asked my team to make sure at least 5,000 people respond before Monday.
I'm eager to hear what's on your mind. If you have a minute or so, will you be one of the 5,000 to fill out my survey on Donald Trump?
People in communities across Michigan and the country are rightfully angry about the failures of this presidency – and I want to make sure my campaign reflects your thoughts about the state of the country right now, friend.
TAKE THE SURVEY
My team and I have already scheduled some time next week to review these responses. Your perspective is key to everything we do in this campaign.
Take care,

Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
We want to give you the latest on what’s happening in Michigan's Senate race:
FIRST: Gary's far-right opponent outraised him four out of the last five quarters thanks to Donald Trump, Betsy DeVos’ family and Mitch McConnell funneling in MILLIONS to buy this seat for the GOP.
THEN: New polling shows Gary's opponent two points AHEAD with less than a week left in this race.
NOW: Donald Trump just held ANOTHER campaign rally in Michigan -- and he called Gary's far-right opponent ""the next U.S. Senator from the great state of Michigan.""

"We simply cannot let this happen again this year in Michigan.
Friend – I've seen a lot of tough elections in my time, but nothing has surprised me more than the political upset we saw in the Midwest in 2016.
People assumed states like Michigan and Wisconsin were safely blue. But after Election Day, when all was said and done, Trump carried the Midwest and won the presidency, and Republicans held onto their Wisconsin Senate seat – and the Senate majority.
We simply cannot let this happen again this year in Michigan. If we're going to win this seat and take back the Senate for Democrats, we CANNOT afford to let our Trump-backed opponent continue to outraise us – especially with a new poll showing us down by nearly 2 points.
Can I count on you to contribute $3 or more now – every dollar you can spare to help me hit my rapid-response goal of $50,000 by midnight – to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?
Here's the truth, friend: The only chance we have at protecting affordable health care, fixing our climate crisis and helping small businesses get back on their feet is if Democrats win back the Senate majority. But Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight says Democrats have ZERO chance of taking back the Senate if we lose in Michigan.
And right now, after being outraised all cycle long, we're up against an onslaught of attack ads thanks to Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and the DeVos family funneling in millions of dollars to buy this seat for the GOP.
RealClearPolitics just moved this race from ""Leans Dem"" to ""Toss-Up"" – and CNN just said Michigan is one of the TOP seats most likely to flip parties in November.
What we do in moments like this will decide whether we become victim to another political upset like in 2016, or whether we're the race that wins back the Senate majority. I know which side of history I'm determined to be on. What about you, friend?
If you're with me, I have a simple request: Pitch in a donation of $3 or more now – whatever you can spare – to help me hit my rapid-response goal of $50,000 by midnight tonight. Every single dollar will help us fight back against these right-wing attacks, win in Michigan to take back the Senate and protect the future of the Supreme Court. Can you give right now?
Thanks for being on this team. Together, I'm confident we can protect Michigan's Senate seat and win back the Senate majority.

"just heard from our finance team
I just heard from our finance team, and I have to be honest with you, friend: Our fundraising is just not where it needs to be if we want to stay on track to win. We're currently being outraised and outspent at the worst moment – right when a brand-new poll shows my opponent up by nearly 2 points.
That's because after my hard-right opponent, John James – who says he backs Trump “2000%” – recently won his August primary, Republicans gave him a prime-time spot at the RNC, allowing him to fundraise on the national stage.
He's already outraised us five times in a row thanks to Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and the DeVos family funneling tens of millions of dollars into Michigan to buy this seat for the GOP. And if we don't close our August funding gap, he could pull ahead in the polls for good.
Simply put, friend? We cannot allow that to happen. RealClearPolitics just moved our race from “Leans Dem” to “Toss Up” – and in tight races like this, every single dollar makes a difference. With Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight reporting Democrats have ZERO chance to take back the Senate if we lose in Michigan, what we do in moments like this could decide whether Mitch McConnell keeps his grip on the Senate.
We're beginning a mad dash to the finish line, and we need to show my opponent – and his wealthy backers – that we're here to win. So ahead of the most important fundraising deadline of our campaign so far, we need to raise another $6,500 before 11:59 p.m. tonight, and I'm counting on your help to make that happen.
Will you contribute $3 or more now – anything you can spare – to win in Michigan, flip the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court from Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell?

"Friend: Analysts at CBS News are reporting that Michigan's Senate race could decide Senate control for the next two years.
That's why the DeVos family and dark money GOP groups are spending more to defeat Gary than any other in-cycle Democratic senator in the entire country -- nearly $30 MILLION! And it's working, friend: A BRAND-NEW POLL from the New York Times shows Gary only ONE POINT AHEAD of his far-right opponent.
But just this morning, we got incredible news! After hearing that analysts at CNN named Gary's seat one of the ""most likely to flip,"" a committed group of donors offered to match every donation made up until Wednesday's deadline, dollar for dollar, to hit our $500,000-match goal!
Our opponent has the full force of the right-wing special interests behind him – but we have supporters like you. Can Gary count on you to make a donation of $3 or more now and have every dollar DOUBLED?
Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight is reporting the ONLY way Democrats can flip the Senate is by winning in Michigan. With the future of the Senate on the line, we're falling short of our must-hit match goal.
We're running out of time until this match opportunity expires, so Gary's counting on your immediate donation to win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats: Please, will you rush $3 (becomes $6) now – whatever you can spare – and have your contribution DOUBLED to defend Michigan's Senate seat and take back the Senate for Democrats?

"Friend, Donald Trump just left the stage in Michigan. It’s his second of FIVE rallies in Michigan during the final week of the most important election of our lifetimes.
Trump and his team keep coming back to Michigan because they know that whoever wins in Michigan will win control of the White House AND the Senate. Here’s the truth: They wouldn’t come back so many times this close to Election Day if they didn’t think they had a real shot at winning here in Michigan.
And I’ll cut right to it: With only DAYS left in this race, Trump’s rally today could tip the scales into the GOP’s favor. A brand-new poll shows me behind by nearly two points -- and on top of that, every time Trump rallies here, GOP mega-donors line up to funnel more money into my far-right opponent’s pockets.
Trump just showed how badly he wants to defeat me and Joe Biden. We’re almost out of time to make sure we win in Michigan, friend. And right now, a group of donors is TRIPLE-MATCHING every contribution up to $100,000! Rush $3 or more -- every dollar you can spare -- and have every dollar TRIPLED to keep Michigan blue and take Senate control back from Mitch McConnell.

Team: We’re just THREE days from Election Day -- and with MILLIONS of ballots already cast by voters all over Michigan, this election is well underway.
CBS News and Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight agree: We can’t take back control of the Senate from Mitch McConnell if we lose in Michigan. Republicans know this too -- that's why they're spending over $40 MILLION to buy this seat.
Here’s the thing: Their efforts are paying off. Recent polling shows Gary nearly two points BEHIND his Trump-endorsed opponent, and CNN named Michigan one of the Senate seats most likely to flip.

"Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
I just got off the phone with my team, friend, and I have some bad news to share: Politico is reporting that new spending in Michigan from Mitch McConnell's super PAC ""will give the GOP the edge over the airwaves in the final days of the election.""
With our race downgraded from “Leans Democrat” to “Toss Up” and recent polls showing me two points behind my Trump-backed opponent, this surge of GOP spending could tip the scales in our far-right opponent’s favor -- right in the final days of this race.
In fact, Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight reports that Democrats have ZERO chance to take back the Senate if we lose in Michigan, so we have no time to waste. Our final end-of-month fundraising deadline is tonight -- but we’re still falling short of our goal.

EVERYTHING about the race to control the Senate just changed, friend:
Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight reports Democrats have ZERO chance of taking Senate control if we lose in Michigan – but Mitch McConnell's super PAC just announced it will spend $9 MILLION to buy Michigan's Senate seat.
That means they can spend nearly $300,000 EVERY SINGLE DAY blanketing the airwaves with attack ads against Gary Peters for the next month.
Attacks like these can MAJORLY tip the scales, especially with current polling showing our opponent taking a narrow lead and CNN reporting Michigan is one of the Senate seats MOST likely to flip.

"The most important race happening in 2020 is for control of the Senate.
Friend,
Gary Peters' re-election to the Senate this fall in Michigan will be one of the closest races this November -- and guess who has their thumb on the scale. The DeVos family -- i.e., the family of Betsy DeVos, Secretary of Education -- is hoping they can buy this Senate seat in Michigan by spending more than $800,000 to unseat my friend Gary and put in his place their hand-picked choice, John James.
We already know how dangerous the DeVos family has been, and the Super PAC ""Better Future Michigan"" wants nothing of the sort: It has 14 donors. Who are they? Half of the donors are members of the DeVos family.
Gary is a fighter for Michigan and my progressive ally in the Senate, and he needs our help: Before midnight tonight, we need to raise $10,000 for Gary Peters -- and I'll be honest: I've looked at the map, and I can't see how we take the majority if we lose this seat. Donate $5 or more now to fund the fight to reelect Gary and fight back against the DeVos family's dangerous plans for Michigan.
Click to donate $5.
Click to donate $25.
Click to donate $50.
Or click here to donate another amount.
Why is the DeVos family so invested in unseating Gary Peters? Well, for one he's taking on Betsy DeVos and her wasteful spending at the Department of Education -- he pressed for answers back in December as to why 72 charter schools in Michigan never opened despite receiving nearly $21 million in federal start-up funds.
Gary believes like I do that students and families come first -- and for all the charter schools that closed or failed to open, communities missed out on more than half a billion dollars in resources that could have benefitted neighborhood schools. Gary knows her leadership is leaving students and families worse off -- and her family wants him out because of it.
They know he's watching and fighting for teachers, students, and families -- and they're scared. That's why their hand-picked choice to unseat Gary, John James, said Betsy DeVos is doing a ""very, very good"" job as Secretary of Education. John James supports Betsy DeVos even as she planned to cut $9 billion in funding for education, including more than $100 million for Michigan's public schools.
After spending millions to gut Michigan's public school programs, and bigger plans to do more, she can't even say if it was worth it. On whether local schools in Michigan have gotten better, she said: ""I don't know. Overall, I -- I can't say overall.""
Right-wing Republicans like the DeVos family are dumping nearly a million dollars into this race -- but it'll get even closer, and that's why Gary needs our help: Donate $5 or more now to help us raise $10,000 for Gary Peters before midnight tonight.
Sincerely,
Chuck Schumer

team: We're only days away from the last FEC filing deadline of this entire campaign. And right now Republicans including Trump, McConnell, and Betsy DeVos' family are funneling NEARLY $30 MILLION towards buying this seat because they know Michigan is the tipping point of Senate control.
Friend, a surge of grassroots fundraising could make all the difference right now. After being outraised for over a year, recent polls show our race statistically tied, and RealClearPolitics just moved this race from “Leans Dem” to “Toss Up.” We're quickly running out of time to turn this toss-up race to a win.
But we have BIG news: Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight reports the ONLY way Democrats can take back the Senate is if we win in Michigan, so a group of donors has offered to DOUBLE every dollar we raise leading up to Wednesday's fundraising deadline – up to $500,000!
With Senate control and the future of the Supreme Court on the line, we cannot afford to miss out on this critical match and risk losing this seat.

Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
My team just sent out the latest updates on our race (see below) including some really bad news: a new poll shows me narrowly trailing my Trump-backed opponent.
I'll cut right to it: According to CBS, Senate control will be decided by who wins in Michigan, and our fundraising just isn’t where it needs to be. Can you chip in $3 or more now to win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats?
Thank you,
Gary
\----Forwarded message----
Friend: CBS is reporting that the next two years of Senate control all hinge on what happens in Michigan.
That's why Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump have helped funnel millions to buy Michigan's Senate seat. They know winning in Michigan means tightening the GOP's grip on the Senate and on the Supreme Court.
But right now, polling has Gary Peters trailing his Trump-backed extremist opponent by a narrow margin – and CNN is reporting that Gary's seat is one of the most likely to flip.
Democrats CANNOT take back the Senate without winning in Michigan – but we’ll fall short on resources if we don't raise another $13,692 by 11:59 p.m. TONIGHT.
We can’t win without supporters like you, friend. What you do right now can help decide the fate of Senate control: So please, will you rush $3 or more to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

"I want to know your thoughts on Trump’s presidency.
friend,
I'm grateful to the thousands of supporters who responded to my survey earlier this week. It’s so valuable for me to know what issues matter most to you as I keep leading this campaign.
One thing’s already clear from our survey results: getting Donald Trump out of the White House is a top priority for voters across Michigan and all over the country.
I want to know more -- so I’ve requested a new survey that’s all about the Trump administration and its effect on American families. And I’ve asked my team to make sure at least 5,000 people respond before Monday.
I'm eager to hear what's on your mind. So, If you have a minute or so, will you be one of the 5,000 to fill out my quick new survey on Donald Trump?
People in communities across Michigan and the country are rightfully angry about the failures of this presidency – and I want to make sure my campaign reflects your thoughts about the state of the country right now, friend.
TAKE THE SURVEY
My team and I have already scheduled some time for tomorrow to review these responses. Your perspective is key to everything we do in this campaign.
Take care,
Gary

Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Breaking news, team: Donald Trump is headed back to Michigan TOMORROW -- and it's his second visit to Michigan this week!
Trump’s already funneled MILLIONS of dollars toward buying this seat for my far-right opponent – and now his team is returning to Michigan every day this week because they KNOW Michigan is the tipping point of Senate control.
Friend, Trump's visit tomorrow could make all the difference in this razor-thin race. After being outraised for over a year, recent polling shows me trailing my far-right opponent by two points, and RealClearPolitics just moved this race from “Leans Dem” to “Toss-Up.”
Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight reports the ONLY way Democrats can take back the Senate is if we win in Michigan, so we need all hands on deck to meet our $500,000 Get Out the Vote goal and reach every voter in Michigan in the crucial final days of this campaign.
With just FIVE days until Election Day and Senate control on the line, we cannot afford to risk losing this seat. Will you rush a contribution of $3 or more now -- whatever you can spare -- to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

"Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Team: Donald Trump just left Michigan after holding his final rally of this campaign.
Trump held FIVE rallies in Michigan in the crucial last week of this race because he knows how important winning in Michigan is for Democrats to take back control of the White House AND the Senate.
And in this final day of the race, the GOP has the edge on the airwaves thanks to Mitch McConnell's groups spending nearly $30 million to unseat Gary.
With just hours left, the most important thing we can do to win this election is reach every last Michigan voter and make sure every vote is counted. Please, will you rush $3 or more now -- whatever you can spare -- to help us reach every voter before the polls close?

"Friend --
I’ll be honest -- I’ve been incredibly energized by the Senate polls I’ve seen recently. But I’m worried about one.
Michigan Senator Gary Peters is neck-and-neck with his Trump-backed opponent, and with so few opportunities to pick up seats this fall, Mitch McConnell is going all in: He’s pouring in $5.6 million to flip this seat, for a total of $14.6 million invested total.
Senate GOP smells blood in the water. If Gary loses, we may lose our ability to take back the Senate -- there’s too much at stake to fall short.
Before midnight, we need to raise $10,000 for Gary Peters: Donate $3 or more right now to fight back against Mitch McConnell’s last-minute flood of money to flip this seat in Michigan.

Senator Peters took a strong stance last week against the politics of Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett, and last night he voted ""No"" on her nomination to save the Affordable Care Act and reproductive rights.
And that decision was personal for him: Senator Peters, like millions of Americans, has a personal abortion story. When his first wife tragically miscarried their second child, the miscarriage put her life in danger.
Senator Peters knows that abortion is health care, and that health care -- in addition to coverage for pre-existing conditions, Medicaid for millions of Americans, young people on their parent’s insurance -- is at risk with the addition of Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court.
Senator Peters is putting progress over politics to save our health care -- thank him by getting his back when he needs it most.
Gary is just 1% point up from his opponent in Michigan, and if we lose this seat we could lose the chance to take back the Senate: Donate $3 or more now before midnight tonight to support Gary Peters.
Sincerely,
Chuck Schumer

"Here we are...
Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Friend, if you had told me one year ago that the outcome of this election – and Senate control – could come down to raising $155,321 dollars in the next few hours, I wouldn't have believed you.
Yet here we are: A New York Times poll has me up by a razor-thin margin of just 1 point, with far too many undecided Michigan voters for comfort. And right now, keeping our final ads on the air for the next five days could change the entire outcome of this race.
Because if we have to go dark, my far-right opponent – with the help of Trump, McConnell and the DeVos family – will have the airwaves to himself to run millions of dollars' worth of attack ads. And we won't stand a chance of winning.
With Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight saying Democrats have ZERO chance to take back the Senate if we lose in Michigan, we can't afford to just cross our fingers – we're counting on every member of this team to step up and chip in immediately.
It's now or never, friend, so I'm asking you to dig deep and give what you can to make sure we hit this critical, must-hit goal: Will you make a $3 contribution before 11:59 p.m. – every dollar you can spare – to win in Michigan and take back the Senate?

With fired-up supporters like you fighting in my corner, I know we've got what it takes to win. In these final days of the campaign, thank you for everything,

"My extreme right-wing opponent has outraised us
Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Friend: With the help of Donald Trump and Betsy DeVos' family, my extreme right-wing opponent has outraised us – for the third quarter in a row. The GOP has dumped MILLIONS of dollars into the Michigan race to buy this Senate seat, defeat me and guarantee a Senate majority for Mitch McConnell.
Friend, here’s the good news: Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight reports Democrats can take back the Senate! But our only path to Senate control starts with winning here in Michigan, and recent polling has me TIED with my Trump-backed opponent.
With analysts at CBS News reporting that Michigan could decide Senate control, we’ve set a goal to raise $50,000 but right now, we’re falling short of what we need to win.
Simply put, in a race this close, with our democracy at stake, falling short could very well cost Democrats our chance to take back the Senate.

"Democrats cannot take back the Senate if we lose in Michigan. Period.
Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Friend – Despite unprecedented support for our campaign in Michigan, my extreme right-wing GOP opponent outraised us in four of the last five quarters.
This is thanks to Republicans like the DeVos family funneling MILLIONS into Michigan to defeat me and buy this seat to expand Mitch McConnell’s majority in the Senate.
What's more, we just learned that my Trump-backed opponent expanded his cash-on-hand advantage and is now spending on new TV ads -- just as Michiganders are casting their ballots.
I won't mince words: Democrats cannot take back the Senate if we lose in Michigan. Period. That's why the GOP has made it clear they will stop at nothing to defeat me.
I'm counting on supporters like you, friend: Please rush $3 or more now to defend Michigan's Senate seat and take back the Senate for Democrats.
We can’t afford two more years of a Republican Senate – especially with a vacancy on the Supreme Court, protections for preexisting health conditions, Roe v. Wade and women’s health care, civil rights, voting rights, and workers’ rights on the line. It's never been more important for Democrats to win back the Senate majority.
Friend, here’s the good news: Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight reports Democrats can take back the Senate. But first we have to win here in Michigan.
With RealClearPolitics moving this race from ""Leans Dem"" to ""Toss-up"" and a new poll showing my opponent LEADING by nearly two points, every single dollar matters. If we're going to win and take back the Senate, we cannot fall further behind.
What we do right now could be the difference between winning and losing. Please, will you rush $3 or more right now to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and Betsy DeVos’ family are funneling MILLIONS of dollars into Michigan to buy this Senate seat – and GOP super PACs are spending more to defeat me than any other Democratic senator up for reelection.
That's why we're launching new ads to fight back and win – but keeping ads on the air is expensive, and with our fundraising gap growing by the day, we need to raise another $100,000 before our critical EOQ deadline to win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats.

"this election is underway
Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
This is huge news, team: Over 350,000 ballots have already been cast by Michigan voters – and this election is officially underway.
But with only weeks left for voters to make their decisions, a new internal poll from my opponent shows us in a statistical tie. That means we have just 25 days to make sure we defend this seat, take back Senate control from Mitch McConnell and protect the Supreme Court.
The stakes couldn't be any higher: Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight reports Democrats have ZERO chance of flipping the Senate if we lose here in Michigan. But my Trump-backed opponent has outraised me time and time again – and Trump, McConnell and the DeVos family are funneling MILLIONS of dollars to buy Michigan’s Senate seat.
Our fundraising gap is growing by the day, and we urgently need to raise another $11,827 before 11:59 p.m. tonight to have a chance at catching up to my far-right opponent.
Everything hinges on hitting our goal right now, and we CANNOT afford to come up short now that Michigan voters are casting their ballots: Please, team, rush $3 or more now – anything you can spare – to win in Michigan, take back the Senate and protect the Supreme Court from Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump!

"just heard from our finance team
I just heard from our finance team, and I have to be honest with you, friend: Our fundraising is just not where it needs to be if we want to stay on track to win. We're currently being outraised at the worst moment – right when a brand-new poll shows me trailing BEHIND my far-right opponent.
My opponent – who says he backs Donald Trump “2000%” – has outraised us five times in a row thanks to Trump, McConnell and the DeVos family funneling tens of millions of dollars into Michigan to buy this seat for the GOP. And if we don't close our funding gap before our last FEC quarterly filing deadline, he could pull ahead in the polls for good.
Simply put, friend? We cannot allow that to happen. RealClearPolitics moved our race from “Leans Dem” to “Toss Up” – and in tight races like this, every single dollar makes a difference. With Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight reporting Democrats have ZERO chance to take back the Senate if we lose in Michigan, what we do in moments like this could decide whether Mitch McConnell keeps his grip on the Senate.
We're beginning a mad dash to the finish line, and we need to show my opponent – and his wealthy backers – that we're here to win. So ahead of the most important fundraising deadline of our campaign so far, we set a goal to raise $200,000 – but right now we're falling $78,418 short, and I'm counting on you to help us catch up.
Will you contribute $3 or more now – anything you can spare – to win in Michigan, flip the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court from Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell?

"Despite unprecedented support for our campaign in Michigan, our opponent just announced he has broken fundraising records and outraised us for the third straight reporting period.
Friend: Despite unprecedented support for our campaign in Michigan, our opponent broke fundraising records and outraised us for the FIFTH straight reporting period. This is all thanks to Donald Trump funneling MILLIONS into Michigan to defeat Gary Peters and buy this seat to expand Mitch McConnell’s majority in the Senate.
They know that Democrats have ZERO chance of taking back the Senate if we lose in Michigan. And now, a recent poll shows me nearly TWO POINTS BEHIND my right-wing opponent.
Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight reports that Democrats can take back the Senate, but we must first win in Michigan. That's why we set a goal of raising $12,500 TODAY – but right now, we're falling $5,762 short, and we're running out of time.
Friend, in a race this close, whether or not we hit this goal could determine Senate control, so we're counting on your immediate contribution:
Will you rush $3 right now – every dollar you can before midnight – to help us win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

"It’s up to every one of us to make sure we come out victorious on Election Day.
$5 dollars, friend.
A $5 contribution from you today is what it will take for us to win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats. Let me tell you why:
I was just outraised for the FOURTH quarter in a row. That means that for the past YEAR we’ve been outpaced on fundraising every step of the way – and with a recent poll showing this race TIED, losing in Michigan would make it nearly impossible for Democrats to take back the Senate.
And to tip the scales in this race, the DeVos family and right-wing groups are funneling millions into super PACs to buy this seat for McConnell and Trump.
After talking with my finance team, we've set a goal to raise another $50,000 by midnight to win in Michigan and keep this seat blue. Your $5 can make all the difference in getting us there.
You know the stakes, friend. Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight reports Democrats have zero chance at taking back the Senate if we lose in Michigan. It's moments like this – right here, right now – that will determine whether we defend this seat and take back the Senate.
Pitch in $5 now to help us defend Michigan's Senate seat, fight this right-wing spending from Trump and the DeVos family and take back the Senate for Democrats.
It’s up to every one of us to make sure we come out victorious on Election Day. Thanks for fighting with me,
Gary

Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Friend: As this month comes to a close, I want to give you an update on our race.
The bad news: Thanks to Donald Trump and the DeVos family steering MILLIONS of dollars against me, my extreme right-wing opponent outraised me – for the third time in a row.
The good news: We are on track to have the best online fundraising month of the campaign, and Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight is reporting that Democrats have an opportunity to take back the Senate!
The big news: Our only path to Senate control starts with winning here in Michigan. With recent polling showing me TIED, the DeVos family dumped nearly $1 million into Michigan to buy this seat for Mitch McConnell and the GOP.
And now, with analysts at CBS News reporting that Michigan will decide Senate control, we’ve set a goal to raise another $100,000 immediately to win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats.
Friend: In a race this close, with the Senate and the future of the Supreme Court on the line, falling short could very well cost Democrats our chance to take back the Senate.
I wouldn't ask if it wasn't critically important: Friend, will you rush $3 or more right now – every dollar you can – to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

"The most important race happening in 2020 is for control of the Senate.
I will not be the first, nor will I be the last to tell you this, friends: The most important race happening in 2020 is for control of the Senate.
I have a front-row seat to the damage Mitch McConnell is causing in the Senate. He is blocking every last attempt at progress that our Democratic colleagues in the House are fighting so hard for – environmental protections, gun safety measures, affordable healthcare. If Joe Biden wins the White House, he MUST have the Senate as well.
That's why I'm reaching out to you about Gary Peters' race in Michigan. Experts from FiveThirtyEight to Roll Call say Democrats can win back the Senate – but only if Gary wins in Michigan.
The thing is that Gary's reelection won't be easy. He's one of two Democratic Senate candidates fighting to win in a state President Trump carried. To top it all off, a brand-new New York Times poll shows Gary just one point ahead of his hard-right opponent, who was handpicked by Trump and McConnell.
So here's the deal: I told Gary I'd help him raise $12,500 to protect Michigan's Democratic Senate seat, and we really need to hit that goal before midnight. Can I count on you to give now and help us take back the Senate majority?
Please, click here to give $3 or more now to help Gary Peters keep Michigan blue, defeat Mitch McConnell and take back the Senate for Democrats.

"I was the only Democratic senator to be outraised last quarter.
Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
There's no way of sugarcoating this, friend: I was the only Democratic senator to be outraised last quarter – and our Trump- and DeVos-backed opponent has outraised us for more than a full year. Friend, it couldn't have come at a worse time, with polls showing our race in a statistical tie.
With analysts at CBS News reporting that Michigan’s Senate race will decide Senate control, we’ll have zero chance of taking back the Senate if we lose this seat. It's why right-wing interests from Donald Trump to Mitch McConnell to the DeVos family are funneling in millions to buy this Senate seat.
I’m no stranger to tough fights: Fighting for the people of Michigan is the greatest honor of my life, and I do not plan on ceding this seat to a right-wing extremist.
But if we're going to win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats, we CANNOT afford to keep being outraised. That's why my team set a rapid-response goal to raise $20,000 immediately to make up our shortfall, but right now, we're falling short of what we need to win.
Our opponent has the full force of GOP special interests behind him – but I have you. So I'm asking: Before midnight, can I count on you to contribute $3 or more now – every dollar you can spare – to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

"Here's what you need right now to know about my race:
* Our opponent John James, a hard-right extremist who says he backs Trump “2000%” and has Trump's ""total and complete endorsement”, outraised us for four of the last five quarters.
* Not only that, James has Republicans like Donald Trump, Betsy DeVos’ family, Mitch McConnell and now a Koch family PAC funneling in over $30 MILLION to buy this seat.
* Donald Trump is set to visit Michigan FOUR TIMES in the crucial final week of this race because he knows how important winning in Michigan is to taking back control of the White House and the Senate.

"Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Democrats have a chance to take back the Senate this year, friend. But we need to talk about Michigan.
Recent polling shows me two percentage points behind my Trump-backed opponent -- with just two days left in this race.
And there’s a clear force at work here -- our fundraising disadvantage. My opponent outraised us FOUR out of the last FIVE quarters while Republican groups are funneling in over $40 MILLION to Michigan to buy this seat -- and GOP super PACs are spending more to defeat me than any other Democratic senator up for reelection.
The warning signs are flashing, team, and I hate to say this, but I have to: We could lose this Michigan Senate seat this year -- the way we lost the presidency in Michigan four years ago.
We cannot let that happen. So I’m urging you:
Rush $3 or more right now -- anything you can chip in immediately -- to help us fight back against GOP spending, win in Michigan, and flip the Senate for Democrats.

Team: CBS News reports Democrats have ZERO chance to flip the Senate if we lose in Michigan, and right now a brand-new poll shows Gary Peters trailing by nearly two points against his hard-right extremist opponent.
Gary has been outraised for over a year because Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and the DeVos family are funneling MILLIONS to buy this seat for the GOP.
And now it's clear the GOP dark-money war chest is making a difference: RealClearPolitics just moved this race from “Leans Dem” to “Toss Up” – and CNN just said Michigan is one of the TOP seats most likely to flip parties in November.
Gary was the ONLY Democratic senator to be outraised last quarter, so with exactly two months left in this race, we set an 11:59 p.m. deadline to raise another $25,000 – but we’re falling $2,149 short of what we need to stay on track to win.
This is the biggest election of our lifetimes, and we need your support: Will you contribute $3 or more now – every dollar you can spare – to win in Michigan, take back the Senate and protect the future of the Supreme Court from Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump?

"As this month comes to a close, I want to give you an update on our race.
Friend,
There’s no doubt about it that Michigan will be the state to determine whether Mitch McConnell continues to run the Senate. Both CBS News and Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight are reporting that Democrats can only win back the Senate if we first win in Michigan, so we need to secure this seat to ensure victory in November.
The GOP knows that the road to the Senate runs through Michigan, so they’re pulling out all the stops to try and buy this seat. That means millions of dollars are flooding into our state with the help of Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and Betsy DeVos (among other far-right billionaires), and I’m now the most-attacked Democratic senator up this year.
I don’t scare easily, friend — the Republican Party can throw everything they want at me and I’ll never waver in my fight for Michigan’s working families. But we’re up against some serious money, and recent polls have us statistically tied with our Trump-backed opponent at the end of this month, so every second counts.
Tonight, we'll have to close the books on our second quarter, and it’s never been more important for our team of grassroots donors to step up. We’re still hoping to bring in another $12,723 before midnight to hit our end-of-quarter goal and stay on track to win in Michigan — can I count on you to make a contribution of $3 right now?

"Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Gary’s Trump-backed opponent outraised us for the FIFTH time in a row, thanks to special interests and Mitch McConnell funneling money into Michigan. Thankfully, we're getting closer to our goal, but the deadline is midnight tomorrow -- and with the future of the Senate on the line, we can't afford to fall short.
Can you rush $3 or whatever you can afford today? Anything you can chip in will make a huge difference.
Thanks,
Peters for Michigan
\----Forwarded message----
Friend: Thanks to special interests and Mitch McConnell, our Trump-backed opponent just outraised us for the FIFTH time in a row. That means that for the past YEAR we’ve been outpaced on fundraising every step of the way – and with a recent poll showing this race TIED, losing in Michigan would make it nearly impossible for Democrats to take back the Senate.
That's because Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight reports Democrats have ZERO chance to flip the Senate if we lose in Michigan. And with President Trump, Mitch McConnell and the DeVos family funneling MILLIONS into this race, losing could be a real possibility.
So I’m going to tell it to you straight, friend: We CANNOT afford to keep being outraised. That's why my team set a goal to raise $100,000 before our end-of-month deadline at midnight tomorrow to make up our shortfall -- but right now we're still short of what we need to win.
In a race this close, with the future of the Senate on the line, I'm counting on your immediate contribution: Will you make a contribution of $3 or more now – every dollar you can spare before midnight – to win in Michigan, take back Senate control and protect the future of the Supreme Court from Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump?

Coming up short isn’t an option. What we do now will determine whether Democrats take control of the Senate or Mitch McConnell gets at least two more years of power.
Senate control depends on you joining this fight, friend. Please, stand with me when I need you most.

"The most important race happening in 2020 is for control of the Senate.
I will not be the first, nor will I be the last to tell you this, friends: The most important race happening in 2020 is for control of the Senate.
I have a front-row seat to the damage Mitch McConnell is causing in the Senate. He is blocking every last attempt at progress that our Democratic colleagues in the House are fighting so hard for – environmental protections, gun safety measures, affordable healthcare. If a Democrat wins the White House, they MUST have the Senate as well.
That's why I'm reaching out to you about Gary Peters' race in Michigan. Experts from FiveThirtyEight to Roll Call say Democrats can win back the Senate – but only if Gary wins in Michigan.
The thing is that Gary's reelection won't be easy. He's one of two Democratic Senate candidates fighting to win in a state President Trump carried. To top it all off, Gary is neck-and-neck with his hard-right opponent, handpicked by Trump and McConnell.
So here's the deal: I told Gary I'd help him raise $6,500 to protect Michigan's Democratic Senate seat, and we really need to hit that goal before midnight. Can I count on you to give now and help us take back the Senate majority?
Please, click here to give $5 or more to help Gary Peters keep Michigan blue, defeat Mitch McConnell and take back the Senate for Democrats.

"Just the other day, President Trump personally called Gary a ""Do-nothing Democrat.
Hi friend, I wanted to take a moment and reach out to you about my husband Gary.
First of all, from the bottom of my heart, I want to say thank you for being a part of this team to help Gary win in Michigan. It means the world to have you fighting so hard alongside us. I don't need to tell you that this race is one of the biggest in the entire country — even Donald Trump himself is focused on winning in Michigan and defeating Gary.
The other day, President Trump personally attacked Gary, calling him a ""Do-nothing Democrat."" Now, the president is known for two things: his nicknames and his lies. But he doesn't know a thing about my husband. I want to tell you exactly who Gary Peters is:
He's the Senator who fights tirelessly for workers and small businesses. He’s the public servant pushing for quality, affordable health care coverage where insurance companies can no longer discriminate because of pre-existing conditions. And as a product of Michigan’s public schools, Gary has always fought for students and has continued to give them the tools they need to reach their full potential.
That's my husband – he's a fighter. For Michigan and our country. But right now, he's in the midst of his toughest election ever.
The stakes of this race have never been higher. Another two years of a Republican-held Senate means two more years of Mitch McConnell calling the shots in Washington. That means he and Donald Trump will team up to put more extremist justices like Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court, and you can bet they’ll keep trying to dismantle protections for those with preexisting conditions.
My husband's been in tough election fights before, and he's all in to do it again. Believe me, Gary's going to fight tooth and nail to defend this Senate seat – but I'm making a personal ask for you to invest in this fight, too.
Gary's up against the likes of Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and nearly $1 million in dark money from the DeVos family, all vying to buy this seat for the GOP. That's why I'm reaching out to you today.
His team told me we need to raise another $7,500 by midnight, but right now, we're not quite there. Please, will you consider making a contribution to reelect my husband Gary, win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats?
Here's the best link to donate – whatever you give will go toward keeping Michigan blue and taking back the Senate for Democrats: [[URL REDACTED]]
From the bottom of my heart, thank you. Now let's go win this thing.

"Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Friend,
I just got back from my Motorcycle Tour, where I rode over 1,000 miles to meet with Michiganders all across the state.
And here’s what I couldn’t stop thinking about on the road: The future of every Michigander and every American will be affected if the GOP succeeds in buying this seat.
According to CBS News, Democrats can’t take back the Senate if we lose in Michigan -- and losing the Senate means at least two more years of new extremist judges, climate inaction and attacks on affordable health care, thanks to Mitch McConnell at the helm.
We simply can’t afford to lose this seat. And with poll after poll showing this race is a toss up and Republicans spending over $25 million to defeat me, the outcome comes down to supporters like you stepping up in the 59 days we’ve got left.
Friend, here’s what would help the most in this moment: Can you chip in $3 or whatever you can spare to help us reach today’s $15,000 rapid response goal?

"Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
We want to give you the latest on what’s happening in Michigan:
First: Our opponent John James, a hard-right extremist who says he backs Trump “2000%” and has Trump's ""total and complete endorsement,” outraised us four quarters in a row.
Then: Mitch McConnell and his GOP billionaire allies have been funneling in MILLIONS of dollars to prop up my opponent and buy this seat.
Now: Trump just announced his nominee to fill the Supreme Court vacancy – and McConnell said that she will receive a vote on the Senate floor without delay, BEFORE the American people have their say.
It’s time to act. Even experts across the country – like Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight, The New York Times and The Washington Post – all agree: If we lose this race here in Michigan, Democrats won’t be able to win the Senate majority OR protect the future of the Supreme Court.  We need all hands on deck to hit a $200,000 rapid-response goal by our final FEC quarterly filing deadline next week – but right now we’re falling short.

Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Friend: Despite unprecedented support for our campaign in Michigan, a brand-new poll shows my extreme right-wing GOP opponent with a two-point lead -- after outraising us five times in a row.
This is thanks to Donald Trump funneling MILLIONS into Michigan to defeat me and buy this seat to expand Mitch McConnell’s majority in the Senate.
I won't mince words: Democrats cannot take back the Senate if we lose in Michigan. Period. That's why the GOP has made it clear they will stop at nothing to defeat me. I'm counting on supporters like you to step up and help defend this seat before it's too late, friend:
Please rush $3 or more now – whatever you can spare before midnight – to defend Michigan's Senate seat and take back the Senate for Democrats.
We can’t afford any more years of a Republican Senate – they’ve already confirmed two extreme right-wing justices to the Supreme Court and threatened to dismantle affordable health care. It's never been more important for Democrats to win back the Senate majority.
Friend, here’s the good news: Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight reports Democrats can take back the Senate. But first we have to win here in Michigan.
In a race this close, every single dollar matters. If we're going to win and take back the Senate, we cannot fall further behind. But we're still $3,205 behind where we need to be by midnight tonight.
What we do right now could be the difference between winning and losing. Please, will you rush $3 or more to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Friend, I have an important update on the Postal Service that could swing the 2020 election for Donald Trump. You need to read this.
Trump’s new handpicked postmaster general is changing procedures that have led to a disastrous problem for our country: Massive mail delays that may have a significant impact on mail-in voting in November.
Important mail is already being left unattended in processing centers and post offices – and if we don’t act soon, mail-in voting could be at risk in Almont. That’s because the Trump administration wants to privatize the Postal Service – slowing down delivery and ultimately impacting mail-in voting here in Michigan and across our country.
Saving the Postal Service is so important that I had my team check in on the status of our petition, and here's what we found for you:
EMAIL: [[EMAIL_REDACTED]]
SUPPORTER ID: 1128963
SIGNED TO PROTECT THE USPS TODAY? NO
Before this petition closes at 11:59 p.m.: Will you add your name to demand Congress take action and save the Postal Service?
Friend, the Postal Service works hard every day to make sure mail gets to where it needs to go – something this country has relied on for over 240 years. That’s why we need 23 more names from Almont to sign our petition to save the Postal Service before 11:59 p.m. – because Donald Trump will not and can not be allowed to destroy it. Please, friend, will you join us in demanding Congress save the Postal Service?
YES, I'LL ADD MY NAME

"It's Pete Buttigieg -- got a minute, friend?
Hi friend,
This past year, running for president was an extraordinary experience. I met people from all walks of life across the country and heard their stories. There were stories of hope, stories of hardship; and many stories that helped to remind me why our campaign had begun in the first place.
I ran because our country is running out of time - we must defeat Donald Trump in November and change the course of America. But the fact of the matter is that can only happen if we win in Michigan and help reelect Gary Peters to the Senate. It’s why I’m reaching out today.
We need Gary’s continued fight in the Senate defending Michiganders and rebuilding our middle class. As a senator from a midwestern state, Gary understands how to support the needs of rural and urban areas alike. From the cherry growers of Grand Traverse County to the auto workers in Detroit: Gary has their backs and puts the needs of Michiganders first.
Can you join me in supporting Gary Peters for reelection? Donate whatever you can now to make sure we keep him in the Senate.

In a time where our country has become more toxic and divisive than ever before, we need leaders we can trust working to ensure a brighter future for us all. But his race won’t be easy.
I’ll be honest: Michigan won’t be a shoo-in for Democrats come November. It’s why Republicans are funneling millions of dollars into the state and even worse, into Gary’s Trump-picked Republican opponent.
Losing the midwest isn’t an option if we want to elect Joe Biden to the White House, reelect Gary Peters and flip the Senate. It won’t be simple, and we’ll need your help to do it.
So, before I sign off and you go back to the rest of your day, I’m asking one more time: Will you donate to make sure we reelect Gary Peters?
Thanks for all you do, and wishing you and loved ones well,
Pete

"Here's what you need to know about Michigan’s Senate race:
My team just sent out the latest updates on our race (see below) including some really bad news: recent polling shows me TIED with my GOP opponent.
So here's the deal, team: Senate control will be decided by who wins in Michigan, and our fundraising just isn’t where it needs to be. But if you chip in $3 now, you could help move us within range our $25,000 goal for today. Can I count on your help, friend?

Here's what you need to know about Michigan’s Senate race:
* John James, a hard-right extremist who says he backs Trump “2000%,” just won the GOP primary to take on Democrat Sen. Gary Peters.
* James has outraised Gary five times in a row thanks to Donald Trump, Betsy DeVos’ family and Mitch McConnell funneling in MILLIONS to buy this seat for the GOP.
* RealClearPolitics just moved this race from “Lean Dem” to “Toss Up” – and a new poll shows this race is statistically TIED.
Gary is the ONLY Democratic senator who was outraised last quarter, and Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight reports Democrats have ZERO chance to take back the Senate if Gary loses. That’s why we set an 11:59 p.m. deadline to raise $25,000 – but we’re already falling WAY short of what we need to win.
This is the most important election of our lifetimes, and we need your help: Will you contribute $3 or more now – every dollar you can spare – to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court from Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump?

"Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Friend: With the help of Donald Trump and Betsy DeVos' family, my extreme right-wing opponent outraised us four of the last five quarters. Republican mega-donors have dumped MILLIONS of dollars into the Michigan race to buy this Senate seat, defeat me and guarantee a Senate majority for Mitch McConnell -- and thanks to them, the GOP has the edge on the airwaves in the crucial final hours of this race.
Friend, here’s the good news: Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight reports Democrats can take back the Senate! But our only path to Senate control starts with winning here in Michigan, and recent polling has me two points BEHIND my Trump-backed opponent.
Simply put, in a race this close, with our democracy at stake, the single most important thing we can do is reach every last voter and ensure that every vote is counted.
Friend -- I wouldn't ask if it wasn't important: Will you rush $3, $6 or whatever you can spare right now to help us reach every voter before the polls close and make sure that every last vote is counted?

Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Friend: Despite unprecedented support for our campaign in Michigan, Gary has been outraised three straight times. That's NOT good.
And now, analysts at CBS News are reporting that Michigan's Senate race will decide Senate control for the next two years. That's why Mitch McConnell's NRSC is launching a MASSIVE TV buy of nearly $3 MILLION in attack ads.
According to Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight, Democrats have ZERO chance of taking back the Senate if Gary loses in Michigan. But attack ads like these could tip the scales, and with polls showing this race TIED, how we respond right now could make the difference between winning and losing.
That's why we've set a goal to raise another $20,000 by midnight, but as of this morning, we're falling $7,908 short of what we need to win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats.
Please, will you rush $3 or more – every dollar you can before midnight – to win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats?

"CNN just said Michigan is one of the TOP seats most likely to flip parties in November.
Team: CBS News reports Democrats have ZERO chance to flip the Senate if we lose in Michigan, and now a brand-new poll released today shows our hard-right extremist opponent AHEAD of Gary.
Gary has been outraised for over a year because Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and the DeVos family are funneling MILLIONS to buy this seat for the GOP.
And now it's clear the GOP dark-money war chest is making a difference: RealClearPolitics just moved this race from “Leans Dem” to “Toss Up” – and CNN says this seat is one of the MOST LIKELY TO FLIP in November with just over five weeks left in this race.
Gary was the ONLY Democratic senator to be outraised last quarter, and we can't afford to be outraised again. So we set a goal to raise another $200,000 by our final quarterly filing deadline – but we’re falling $99,725 short of what we need to win.
This is the biggest election of our lifetimes, and we need your support: Will you contribute $3 or more now – every dollar you can spare – to win in Michigan, take back the Senate and protect the future of the Supreme Court from Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump?

"I just heard from our finance team, and I have to be honest with you, friend: Republicans are now set to outspend us on ads in the crucial last days of this campaign. This couldn't come at a worse time, right when a brand-new poll shows me nearly two points BEHIND my far-right opponent.
My opponent – who says he backs Donald Trump “2000%” – outraised us four of the last five quarters thanks to Trump, McConnell and the DeVos family funneling tens of millions of dollars into Michigan to buy this seat for the GOP. And if we don't close our funding gap now, with Michiganders already casting their ballots, he could pull ahead in the polls for good.
Simply put, friend? We cannot allow that to happen. RealClearPolitics moved our race from “Leans Dem” to “Toss Up” – and in tight races like this, every single dollar makes a difference. With Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight reporting Democrats have ZERO chance to take back the Senate if we lose in Michigan, what we do in moments like this could decide whether Mitch McConnell keeps his grip on the Senate.
We're beginning a mad dash to the finish line, and we need to show my opponent – and his wealthy backers – that we're here to win. So with only 12 days until the election, we set a goal to raise $20,000 – but right now we're falling $14,583 short, and I'm counting on you to help us catch up.

Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
I have worrying news, friend: Analysts at CBS News report Democrats have ZERO chance to take back the Senate if we lose in Michigan. But after my Trump-backed opponent outraised us FIVE times in a row, our race was moved from “Lean Democrat” to “Toss Up” – and a recent poll shows we're in a dead heat.
Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and the DeVos family are funneling in MILLIONS to buy Michigan’s Senate seat. And with less than 100 days to Election Day, they’ll continue doing whatever it takes to ensure they expand Republican control of the Senate.
But if we're going to win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats, we CANNOT afford to keep being outraised. That's why my team set a rapid-response goal to raise another $100,000 this month to close the gap, but right now, we're falling short of what we need to win.
Our opponent has the full force of GOP special interests behind him – but I have you. So I'm asking: Before midnight, can I count on you to contribute $3 or more now – every dollar you can spare – to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

Friend: CBS is reporting that the next two years of Senate control all hinge on what happens in Michigan.

"Hey there,
It’s Elissa Slotkin. I want to tell you why I’m so proud to serve alongside Gary in Congress.
But first, let me remind you of the stakes Gary and I are both facing this year: Michigan is the rare battleground state to feature both a Senate race and competitive House races like mine. That means when you contribute to our campaigns, you’re helping Democrats win in Michigan up and down the ballot.
Can you pitch in $5 or more today to help Gary and me win these crucial races in November?

Or click here to donate another amount.
I’m a proud supporter of Gary because he and I both fight for the issues that matter most to Michigan’s working families -- lowering the cost of prescription drugs, protecting our lakes and streams and boosting Michigan’s middle class.
But there’s also who Gary is as a friend.
Back in 2018, I was part of a wave of Democratic women who flipped Republican-held seats. My district voted for Donald Trump and was represented by a Republican in Congress for nearly two decades -- but I fought hard and won by 13,000 votes.
When I was first thinking about running for office, I met Gary for the first time. Back in those early days, no one thought I could flip this seat. But Gary and his amazing wife Colleen jumped into action. Colleen co-hosted one of my “friend-raisers,” and Gary showed up as a special guest to our office opening. They were there for me and believed in the dynamism and passion of the Michiganders in our district. I will not soon forget that. Fast forward to today, and Gary and I are both on the ballot in what is arguably the most important election of our lives.
It’s why I’m asking for your help today, friend. Gary and I are both on the ballot in what is arguably the most important election of our lifetimes. Donate $5 or more today to help ensure we can keep fighting for Michigan’s working families.
Winning in Michigan is key to sending Joe Biden to the White House, building a Senate majority and keeping the House. Gary and I can’t do this without you!

"Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
BREAKING NEWS: My extreme right-wing opponent appeared at the Republican Convention last night.
Our opponent appeared in the same broadcast as Trump with a national audience practically guaranteeing a MASSIVE fundraising spike from GOP mega-donors -- when his campaign is already outspending us 3:1 on TV ads and raking in support from billionaires like the DeVos family. And what’s worse: He’s already outraised us for over a year.
It isn’t an exaggeration to say this: With recent polls showing this race TIED, continuing to be outraised and outspent in the critical weeks ahead could mean losing in Michigan and the chance to flip control of the Senate.
We simply cannot let our fundraising gap widen right now, friend, so I’m setting a rapid-response goal of $10,000 in online gifts before midnight. Can I count on you to contribute $3 or more now – every dollar you can spare – to help defend this seat and flip the Senate?

"Friend -- I’ll cut to the chase. We need to raise an emergency $45,000 before the polls close on our primary election tomorrow night.
Why? Because my Republican opponent will be raking in millions of dollars from the likes of Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and Betsy DeVos’ family after he becomes their handpicked nominee.
Here’s the truth: Republican spending is tilting the playing field in Michigan as I write this. After my campaign was outraised for the FIFTH time in a row a few weeks ago, a poll came out showing me and my extremist opponent in a statistical TIE.
Control of the Senate comes down to what happens in our race -- and folks like you chipping in $3 at a time are the only way I defend this seat, protect the future of the Supreme Court and remove Mitch McConnell as Senate Majority Leader. Experts across the country – like Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight, The New York Times and The Washington Post – all agree: If I lose this race here in Michigan, Democrats won’t be able to win the Senate majority.
So, I’m asking you: Will you rush $3 right now – every dollar you can before midnight – to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

"A new victory for Trump
It's official, friend: John James, the hard-right extremist who has said he backs Trump “2,000%,” just won the GOP primary for Michigan's Senate seat.
Here's why this is concerning: James has outraised our campaign five times in a row. Because of him, we were the ONLY Democratic senator outraised by a challenger last quarter. And he's got the support of Donald Trump, Betsy DeVos’ family and Mitch McConnell – who have been funneling in millions of dollars to buy this seat.
With analysts at CBS News reporting that Michigan’s Senate race will decide Senate control, we’ll have zero chance of taking back the Senate if we lose this seat. And right now that's a real possibility: RealClearPolitics just moved our race from “Lean Dem” to “Toss Up,” and a new poll shows this race is statistically TIED.
I've won tough elections before – but if we're going to win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats, we CANNOT afford to let John James and his GOP billionaire allies continue to outraise us, especially as we enter the general election.
So my team set a rapid-response goal to raise $50,000 immediately to make up our fundraising gap, but right now, we're falling short of what we need to win.
There is too much at stake to sit on the sidelines: Can I count on you to contribute $3 or more now – every dollar you can spare – to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Friend: CBS is reporting that the next two years of Senate control all hinge on what happens in Michigan.
That's why Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump have helped funnel millions to buy Michigan's Senate seat. They know winning in Michigan means expanding the GOP's control over the Senate and on the Supreme Court.
But right now, polling has Gary Peters TWO POINTS BEHIND his Trump-backed extremist opponent.
Democrats CANNOT take back the Senate without winning in Michigan, but we’re about to fall short of our most important goal yet if we don't raise another $14,697 by 11:59 p.m. tonight.
We can’t win without hitting this goal, friend. What you do right now can help decide the fate of Senate control: So please, will you rush $3 or more to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

"The most important race happening in 2020 is for control of the Senate.
Friend,
Gary Peters' re-election to the Senate this fall in Michigan will be one of the closest races this November -- and guess who has their thumb on the scale. The DeVos family -- i.e., the family of Betsy DeVos, Secretary of Education -- is hoping they can buy this Senate seat in Michigan by spending more than $800,000 to unseat my friend Gary and put in his place their hand-picked choice, John James.
We already know how dangerous the DeVos family has been, and the Super PAC ""Better Future Michigan"" wants nothing of the sort: It has 14 donors. Who are they? Half of the donors are members of the DeVos family.
Gary is a fighter for Michigan and my progressive ally in the Senate, and he needs our help: Before the end-of-quarter deadline tomorrow night at midnight, we need to raise another $50,000 for Gary Peters -- and I'll be honest: I've looked at the map, and I can't see how we take the majority if we lose this seat. Donate $5 or more now to fund the fight to reelect Gary and fight back against the DeVos family's dangerous plans for Michigan.
Click to donate $5.
Click to donate $25.
Click to donate $50.
Or click here to donate another amount.
Why is the DeVos family so invested in unseating Gary Peters? Well, for one he's taking on Betsy DeVos and her wasteful spending at the Department of Education -- he pressed for answers back in December as to why 72 charter schools in Michigan never opened despite receiving nearly $21 million in federal start-up funds.
Gary believes like I do that students and families come first -- and for all the charter schools that closed or failed to open, communities missed out on more than half a billion dollars in resources that could have benefitted neighborhood schools. Gary knows her leadership is leaving students and families worse off -- and her family wants him out because of it.
They know he's watching and fighting for teachers, students, and families -- and they're scared. That's why their hand-picked choice to unseat Gary, John James, said Betsy DeVos is doing a ""very, very good"" job as Secretary of Education. John James supports Betsy DeVos even as she planned to cut $9 billion in funding for education, including more than $100 million for Michigan's public schools.
After spending millions to gut Michigan's public school programs, and bigger plans to do more, she can't even say if it was worth it. On whether local schools in Michigan have gotten better, she said: ""I don't know. Overall, I -- I can't say overall.""
Right-wing Republicans like the DeVos family are dumping nearly a million dollars into this race -- but it'll get even closer, and that's why Gary needs our help: Donate $5 or more now to help us raise $50,000 for Gary Peters by the end-of-quarter deadline.
Sincerely,
Chuck Schumer

"I was the only Democratic senator to be outraised last quarter.
Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
There's no way of sugarcoating this, friend: I was the only Democratic senator to be outraised last quarter – and our Trump- and DeVos-backed opponent has outraised us for more than a full year. And friend, it's starting to tilt the scales in this race: A poll released just hours ago shows my opponent with a two-point lead.
With analysts at CBS News reporting that Michigan’s Senate race will decide Senate control, we’ll have zero chance of taking back the Senate if we lose this seat. It's why right-wing interests from Donald Trump to Mitch McConnell to the DeVos family are funneling in millions to buy this Senate seat.
I’m no stranger to tough fights: Fighting for the people of Michigan is the greatest honor of my life, and I do not plan on ceding this seat to a right-wing extremist.
But if we're going to win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats, we CANNOT afford to keep being outraised. That's why my team set a rapid-response goal to raise $25,000 immediately to make up our shortfall, but right now, we're falling short of what we need to win.
Our opponent has the full force of GOP special interests behind him – but I have you. So I'm asking: Before midnight, can I count on you to contribute $3 or more now – every dollar you can spare – to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

In a race this close, fundraising is an important way campaigns can show their strength – and right now, we need to show the GOP that we won’t lose this election by raising $25,000 as soon as we can.
Thanks for fighting by my side for working families in Michigan and across the country.

"A lot is going on, friend.
Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Friend: As this month comes to a close, I want to give you an update on our race.
The bad news: Thanks to Donald Trump and the DeVos family steering MILLIONS of dollars against me, we're getting attacked left and right.
The good news: With Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight reporting that Democrats have an opportunity to take back the Senate, we've launched new TV ads!
The big news: Our only path to Senate control starts with winning here in Michigan. With recent polling showing me TIED, the DeVos family dumped nearly $1 million into Michigan to buy this seat for Mitch McConnell and the GOP.
And now, with analysts at CBS News reporting that Michigan will decide Senate control, we’ve set a goal to raise another $75,000 immediately to win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats.
Friend: In a race this close, with the Senate and the future of the Supreme Court on the line, falling short could very well cost Democrats our chance to take back the Senate.
I wouldn't ask if it wasn't critically important: Friend, will you rush $3 or more right now – every dollar you can – to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

"This race could not be closer.
Team, The New York Times just called Gary Peters ""one of the most endangered Democratic incumbents"" -- and here’s why:
We have 31 days left to win here in Michigan and take back the Senate majority. But this race could not be closer, with recent polling showing Gary’s far-right opponent LEADING by a narrow margin.
And now, Mitch McConnell’s super PAC is funneling $9 million into Michigan -- that’s $300,000 a day! \-- because the GOP knows Senate control hinges on defeating Gary.
We cannot afford to come up short just before the finish line. That's why we're launching an Official Team Peters Membership that ensures every dollar you give now will protect this seat in Michigan when we need it most.

\---------- Forwarded message ----------
Friend: Despite unprecedented support for our campaign in Michigan, our opponent just announced he has broken fundraising records and outraised us for the fourth straight reporting period. This is all thanks to Donald Trump funneling MILLIONS into Michigan to defeat Gary Peters and buy this seat to expand Mitch McConnell’s majority in the Senate.
They know that Democrats have ZERO chance of taking back the Senate if we lose in Michigan. And now, a recent poll shows Gary statistically tied with his right-wing opponent.
Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight reports that Democrats can take back the Senate, but we must first win in Michigan. That's why we set a rapid-response goal of raising $75,000 immediately – but right now, we're falling short, and we're running out of time.
Friend, in a race this close whether or not we hit this goal could determine Senate control, so we're counting on your immediate contribution:
Will you rush $3 right now – every dollar you can before midnight – to help us win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

"This couldn't have come at a worse moment...
Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
I have some bad news to share with you, friend: After being outraised by my far-right opponent five times in a row – and missing our end-of-quarter goal earlier this week – we are still falling short of our $20,000 emergency funding goal to close this gap.
This couldn't have come at a worse moment: A brand-new poll shows my far-right opponent narrowly taking the lead, and Michiganders are already casting their ballots, so time's running out to turn this around.
CBS analysts say Democrats have ZERO chance of taking back the Senate if we lose in Michigan. So it's no wonder my opponent is being funneled TENS OF MILLIONS of dollars from Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and the DeVos family, who are trying to buy this seat from Michiganders.
I've fought in a lot of tough elections before, so I'm just going to tell it to you straight: Falling behind on fundraising at this stage could mean losing this seat to my Trump-backed opponent.
We have to raise another $2,346 right now to hit our emergency funding goal before midnight. Our opponent has the full backing of the GOP special interests funding him – but I've got you, friend.
So I'm asking you now: Will you contribute $3 or more now – anything you can spare before midnight – to win in Michigan, flip the Senate for Democrats and protect the Supreme Court?

Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Friend: It happened again.
Gary Peters was just outraised by his extremist, Trump-backed opponent for the third time. And on top of that, the GOP is funneling millions into Michigan in an attempt to prop up Gary's opponent, buy this election and tighten Mitch McConnell's grip on the Senate.
Yesterday, a group of donors stepped up and offered to match all donations to hit our $50,000 goal.
This is why we need you to step up now: Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight reports Senate control is riding on what happens in Michigan, so with polls showing Gary TIED – every dollar could make the difference between winning and losing.
If we're going to win here and take back the Senate, we must take full advantage of this rare opportunity – Gary's counting on your immediate contribution before it's too late:
Rush $3 or more right now – and have every dollar DOUBLED – to defend Michigan's Senate seat, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court.
Donate $3 (becomes $6)
Donate $25 (becomes $50)
Donate $50 (becomes $100)

"It’s up to every one of us to make sure we win in Michigan.
$15 dollars, friend.
A $15 contribution from you today is what it will take for us to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats, and protect the future of the Supreme Court. Let me tell you why:
We’ve been outpaced on fundraising for four out of the last five quarters – and with a new poll showing me nearly TWO POINTS BEHIND my far-right opponent, losing in Michigan would make it nearly impossible for Democrats to take back the Senate -- that means two more years of Mitch McConnell calling the shots on the future of our nation's highest court.
On top of all that, Republicans including the DeVos family, the Koch family and Mitch McConnell are funneling in OVER $30 MILLION to buy this seat for the GOP.
We've set a rapid-response goal to raise another $20,000 by 11:59 p.m. tonight to win in Michigan and keep this seat blue – but right now, we're falling short. Your $15 can make all the difference in getting us there.
You know the stakes, friend. Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight reports Democrats have zero chance at taking back the Senate if we lose in Michigan. It's moments like this – right here, right now – that will determine whether we defend this seat and take back the Senate.
Pitch in $15 now to help us defend Michigan's Senate seat, take back the Senate for Democrats, and protect the future of the Supreme Court.
It’s up to every one of us to make sure we keep Michigan blue this year. Thanks for fighting with me,

"The USPS needs our help
Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Friend, I need to speak with you about a looming crisis to a vital American institution: saving the U.S. Postal Service before Donald Trump and his Washington Republican allies allow it to become insolvent by September.
We can no longer count on the Trump administration to lift a finger when it comes to protecting our Postal Service. Unless we act now, prices will increase for everyone when it comes to getting packages and prescriptions delivered – and folks in rural communities in Michigan and across the country could be cut off from vital services like vote-by-mail.
And without intervention by Congress, 600,000 federal Postal Service workers could lose their jobs – including many in 48003, friend.
That’s why I’m doing everything in my power to keep the Postal Service operating, and why I need your immediate help: Will you sign my petition and demand Congress intervene to save the Postal Service? We need 20,000 signatures by 11:59 p.m. tonight, but we’re falling 8,737 signatures short with hours to go – and your name is still missing.
SIGN THE PETITION
Thank you,

"just heard from our finance team
I just heard from our finance team, and I have to be honest with you, friend: Our fundraising is just not where it needs to be if we want to stay on track to win. We're currently being outraised and outspent at the worst moment – right when polling shows my opponent up by nearly two points.
My far-right opponent, John James, says he backs Donald Trump ""2000%"" – and at his rally in Michigan last week, Trump gave James his ""total and complete"" endorsement.
My opponent has outraised us five times in a row thanks to Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and the DeVos family funneling tens of millions of dollars into Michigan to buy this seat for the GOP. And if we don't close our funding gap, he could pull ahead in the polls for good.
Simply put, friend? We cannot allow that to happen. RealClearPolitics moved our race from “Leans Dem” to “Toss Up” – and in tight races like this, every single dollar makes a difference. With Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight reporting Democrats have ZERO chance to take back the Senate if we lose in Michigan, what we do in moments like this could decide whether Mitch McConnell keeps his grip on the Senate.
We're beginning a mad dash to the finish line, and we need to show my opponent and his wealthy backers that we're here to win. We need to raise another $15,000 TODAY to stay on track, and I'm counting on your help to make that happen.
Will you contribute $3 or more now to win in Michigan, flip the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court from Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell?

* John James -- a hard-right extremist who says he backs Trump “2000%” and has Trump's ""total and complete endorsement"" -- outraised us four out of the last five quarters.

I’ll be blunt with you: Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight reports Democrats have ZERO chance to take back the Senate if we lose in Michigan. That’s why it's so important that we meet our fundraising goals -- but we're still $8,519 short of what we need to raise today to stay on track to win.
This is the most important election of our lifetimes, and I need your help: Will you contribute $3 or more now – every dollar you can spare – to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court from Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump?

Today's the day, team: Donald Trump is coming back to Michigan TONIGHT.
This will be the Trump team’s ninth visit to Michigan in the last year — and he keeps coming back because he knows if Democrats lose here, we have ZERO chance of taking back the Senate.
The Trumps are bringing in wealthy donors from across the country to funnel money into my far-right opponent’s pockets in an attempt to buy this election. I’ve got one thing to say to them — bring it on.
And I have some incredible news:  a group of donors has offered to match every donation made between now and Trump's visit tonight – up to $50,000.
With only hours until this match opportunity expires, I'm counting on your donation. Can you rush an urgent contribution of $3 – and have every dollar DOUBLED – to help us compete against Trump and defend Michigan's Senate seat?

"Despite unprecedented support for our campaign in Michigan, our opponent just announced he has broken fundraising records and outraised us for the fourth straight reporting period.
Friend: Despite unprecedented support for our campaign in Michigan, our opponent just announced he has broken fundraising records and outraised us for the fourth straight reporting period. This is all thanks to Donald Trump funneling MILLIONS into Michigan to defeat Gary Peters and buy this seat to expand Mitch McConnell’s majority in the Senate.
They know that Democrats have ZERO chance of taking back the Senate if we lose in Michigan. And now, a recent poll shows Gary statistically tied with his right-wing opponent.
Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight reports that Democrats can take back the Senate, but we must first win in Michigan. That's why we set a rapid-response goal of raising $75,000 immediately – but right now, we're falling short, and we're running out of time.
Friend, in a race this close whether or not we hit this goal could determine Senate control, so we're counting on your immediate contribution:
Will you rush $3 right now – every dollar you can before midnight – to help us win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

"CNN just said Michigan is one of the TOP seats most likely to flip parties in November.
Team: CBS News reports Democrats have ZERO chance to flip the Senate if we lose in Michigan, and right now a new poll shows Gary Peters trailing nearly TWO POINTS BEHIND his hard-right extremist opponent.
Gary has been outraised for over a year because Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and the DeVos family are funneling MILLIONS to buy this seat for the GOP.
And now it's clear the GOP dark-money war chest is making a difference: RealClearPolitics just moved this race from “Leans Dem” to “Toss Up” – and CNN just said Michigan is one of the TOP seats most likely to flip parties in November.
Gary was the ONLY Democratic senator to be outraised last quarter, so with less than six weeks left in this race, we set an 11:59 p.m. deadline to raise another $12,000 – but we’re falling $8,057 short of what we need to stay on track to win.
This is the biggest election of our lifetimes, and we need your support: Will you contribute $3 or more now – every dollar you can spare – to win in Michigan, take back the Senate and protect the future of the Supreme Court from Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump?

"For the past YEAR we’ve been outpaced on fundraising every step of the way.
Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Friend: Thanks to special interests and Mitch McConnell, our Trump-backed opponent has outraised us FOUR QUARTERS in a row. That means that for the past YEAR we’ve been outpaced on fundraising every step of the way – and with a recent poll showing this race TIED, losing in Michigan would make it nearly impossible for Democrats to take back the Senate.
That's because Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight reports Democrats have ZERO chance to flip the Senate if we lose in Michigan. And with President Trump, Mitch McConnell and the DeVos family funneling MILLIONS into this race, losing could be a real possibility.
So I’m going to tell it to you straight, friend: We CANNOT afford to keep being outraised. That's why my team set a rapid-response goal to raise $15,000 immediately to make up our shortfall, but right now we're falling short of what we need to win.
In a race this close, with the future of the Senate on the line, I'm counting on your immediate contribution: Will you make a contribution of $3 or more now – every dollar you can spare before midnight – to win in Michigan, take back Senate control and protect the future of the Supreme Court from Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump?

"I can't do it alone.
Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Friend, Americans have been able to count on the Postal Service for hundreds of years – but in just a few months, Donald Trump's handpicked postmaster general has undermined one of our nation’s most trusted institutions.
The Postal Service is a lifeline for millions of Americans – whether delivering prescription drugs, serving veterans and rural communities, helping small businesses, and more. And in an election year when vote-by-mail is more important than ever, people MUST be able to count on reliable and timely mail delivery.
That's why I'm leading the fight to save the Postal Service. I launched an investigation into recent mail delays and will continue asking the questions we need answered to increase transparency and fix what's broken.
But I can't do it alone. I will NOT allow the Trump administration to destroy the Postal Service, but I need you standing with me and speaking out now.
Will you sign my new petition to save the Postal Service before our midnight deadline? We're still 2,649 signatures short of tonight's goal and missing your name.
This is one of the most pressing issues our nation is facing, and your voice is critical in this conversation.
Thank you,
Gary

Friend, we’re just THREE DAYS away from Election Day, and with Republicans going all out to flip this seat, I need to give you an update on our race in Michigan.
Republicans like Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and the DeVos family have funneled over $40 MILLION into Michigan to buy this seat. My extreme right-wing opponent outraised me four of the last five quarters.
And after constant GOP attacks and a massive flow of dark money being spent against me, recent polls show me two points behind my Trump-backed opponent -- and RealClearPolitics moved our race from “Leans Dem” to “Toss-Up.”
The honest truth is that Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight is right: Democrats have ZERO chance to take back the Senate if we lose here in Michigan. My far-right opponent knows it too – and that's why Trump is holding FIVE rallies in Michigan in the final week of this campaign.
So I’m asking for your help today: Our team set a goal to raise $50,000 from grassroots supporters by our FINAL end-of-month deadline at midnight tonight -- and I’m counting on your help to get there: Will you contribute $3, $25 or whatever you can spare now to help me win in Michigan and take back Senate control from Mitch McConnell?

FIRST: Gary's far-right opponent outraised him five times in a row thanks to Betsy DeVos’ family, Mitch McConnell and other GOP dark money groups funneling in MILLIONS to buy this seat for the GOP.
THEN: A recent poll showed our opponent taking a narrow lead and CNN reported Michigan is one of the Senate seats MOST likely to flip.
NOW: Mitch McConnell's super PAC just announced that it will spend $9 million to buy this seat for Gary's opponent.
It’s time to act. The experts across the country – like Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight, The New York Times and The Washington Post – all agree: If we lose this race here in Michigan, Democrats won’t be able to win the Senate majority.  We need all hands on deck to hit a $20,000 emergency funding goal -- but we’re already falling short.

Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Friend,
I grew up going to Michigan’s public schools. And as the son of a hardworking public school teacher, I know just how important education is. That’s why I’ve been so troubled with Betsy DeVos' job as secretary of education.
Since becoming our country’s education secretary, Betsy DeVos has done nothing but cater to wealthy interests, putting greedy corporations above our students and teachers.
And just yesterday, Betsy DeVos threatened to withhold funding from schools that don’t reopen in the fall. On top of that, she refused to say whether schools should listen to CDC guidelines in the middle of a global pandemic.
We need to be guided by public health, science and facts on the ground — not politics. This is about the safety of our kids, teachers, school staff and families. Join me in calling for an education secretary who actually puts our students first.
Friend, if you agree, add your name now to denounce Betsy DeVos and demand a better education secretary for our students.
Sign the Petition
Thank you so much, friend, for standing with me for what’s right.

"I can't do it alone.
Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Friend, I have an important update on the USPS that you need to see.
After hearing from thousands of Michiganders harmed by postal delays, I launched an investigation into changes directed by Trump’s new handpicked postmaster general -- and now the results are in.
My investigation found that on-time mail delivery dropped abruptly throughout the U.S., following Postmaster General DeJoy’s directives in July.  By the second week of August, there were approximately  85 MILLION  more late deliveries in that single week than would have otherwise occurred.
This is unacceptable, friend. For families, rural communities and veterans who count on the Postal Service to deliver vital goods and services including medication, mail delays can be a matter of life or death. And the Postal Service is still suffering problems under DeJoy’s changes, meaning mail-in voting in November is at risk for Michiganders and voters nationwide.
I’m grateful to each and every supporter who’s signed our previous petitions demanding Congressional action to protect the Postal Service.  But now that my investigation has revealed the true extent of the Trump administration's attempts to sabotage the USPS, I’m calling on every supporter who’s ready to protect the USPS to stand up NOW.
Will you sign my petition and demand Congress intervene to save the Postal Service? I’m counting on you to help us reach 15,000 signatures by 11:59 p.m. tonight.

"Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
I have bad news to share with you, friend: We've been outraised by my GOP opponent FIVE times in a row.
There's more: I was the only Democratic senator to be outraised last quarter, and RealClearPolitics moved our race from “Lean Democrat” to “Toss Up”. Now, recent polls show I’m in a statistical tie with my Trump- and McConnell-backed opponent.
We have to kick this campaign into high gear right now, because Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight reports that Democrats have ZERO chance to take back the Senate if we lose in Michigan. And with Donald Trump, McConnell and the DeVos family pumping in millions to buy this Senate seat, we can't afford to be outraised again.
Helping Michigan families is the greatest honor I've ever had, and I will NOT let a right-wing extremist take this seat without a fight. So I need you fighting with me, because we won't win in Michigan – or take back the Senate – if we continue to fall behind in fundraising.
That’s why my team set a rapid-response goal to help make sure we're not outraised again: another $11,692 before midnight tonight. But as I write this, we’re already falling way short.
Our opponent has millions of dollars in GOP special-interest money backing him – but I’ve got grassroots supporters like you. So, I’m asking you now: Before 11:59 p.m., will you rush a gift of $3 or more now to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

"Here's what you need to know about Michigan’s Senate race:
* Our opponent John James, a hard-right extremist who says he backs Trump “2000%” and has Trump's ""total and complete endorsement”, has outraised us four quarters in a row -- and counting.
* Not only that, James has Donald Trump, Betsy DeVos’ family, Mitch McConnell and a Koch family super PAC funneling in MILLIONS  to buy this seat for the GOP -- including a new  $9 million  from Mitch McConnell's super PAC.
* RealClearPolitics just moved this race from “Lean Dem” to “Toss Up” – and a new poll shows us trailing nearly TWO POINTS BEHIND James.
I’ll be blunt with you: I was the ONLY Democratic senator who was outraised this summer, and Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight reports Democrats have ZERO chance to take back the Senate if we lose in Michigan. That’s why we set a goal to raise another $12,500 today – but we’re still $8,604 short of what we need to win.
This is the most important election of our lifetimes, and I need your help: Will you contribute $3 or more now – every dollar you can spare – to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court from Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump?

Team --
After tonight's vote to confirm Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee, it's never been more clear that we must take back Senate control for Democrats \-- but to do that, we have to win in Michigan.
The stakes have never been higher, friend, so we need your support right away -- please rush a contribution of $3 or more now to help us keep Michigan blue and take back Senate control from Mitch McConnell.
Thank you,
Gary
\----Forwarded message----
I’ve got some upsetting news, friend: Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight reports Democrats have ZERO chance of taking Senate control if we lose in Michigan. But my Trump-backed opponent outraised us four of the last five quarters, and new polling shows me TWO POINTS behind.
Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and Betsy DeVos’ family are funneling MILLIONS of dollars into Michigan to buy this Senate seat – and GOP super PACs are spending more to defeat me than any other Democratic senator up for reelection.
With nearly two million Michiganders already casting their ballots, it's never been more important to keep our fundraising on track to win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats.
The Senate majority and future of the Supreme Court are at stake, so we cannot let our fundraising slow down. Rush $3 or more right now – anything you can chip in – to help us win in Michigan, flip the Senate for Democrats and protect the Supreme Court from Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump!

Take a look at who’s trying to buy Michigan’s Senate seat for the GOP:
* Our Trump-backed opponent  has launched a multi-million dollar  ad blitz in Michigan.
* Mitch McConnell’s  dark money group spent  $4.5 million  on ads alone in August.
* And the  DeVos family super PAC  has spent  over $5 million  in TV ads attacking Gary.

"It’s up to every one of us to make sure we come out victorious tomorrow.
$5, friend.
A contribution of $5 from you today is what it will take for us to reach every voter before the polls close tomorrow.
We’ve been outpaced on fundraising for four out of the last five quarters. And with recent polling showing me TWO POINTS BEHIND my far-right opponent, losing in Michigan would make it nearly impossible for Democrats to take back the Senate \-- that means two more years of Mitch McConnell calling the shots on the future of our nation's highest court.
On top of all that, Republicans including the DeVos family, the Koch family and Mitch McConnell are funneling in OVER $40 MILLION to buy this seat for the GOP \-- and Donald Trump is holding TWO campaign rallies in Michigan today, for a total of FIVE rallies here in the final week of his campaign.
In the crucial final hours of this race, we need all hands on deck to make sure every Michigander's vote is counted. Your $5 can make all the difference in getting us there.
You know the stakes, friend. Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight reports Democrats have zero chance at taking back the Senate if we lose in Michigan. It's moments like this -- right here, right now \-- that will determine whether we defend this seat and take back the Senate.
We're in the final stretch of this race, so can you pitch in $5 now to help us reach every voter before the polls close?
It’s up to every one of us to make sure we come out victorious tomorrow. Thanks for fighting with me,

"Friend: Take a look at the status of Gary's race in Michigan – Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight reports that a win here is the ONLY way Democrats can take back the Senate, so this news is important:
FIRST: Trump and McConnell funneled millions into Michigan, helping our right-wing opponent outraise Gary for the third straight time.
THEN: Betsy DeVos' family dumped nearly $1 MILLION into a super PAC to flip this seat red and tighten McConnell's grip on the Senate.
NOW: With the entire GOP targeting Gary, and Senate control hinging on what happens in Michigan, polling shows Gary TIED with his right-wing opponent!
This is why in a race as close as this, where the future of the Senate and the Supreme Court are at stake, falling short is simply not an option. But right now, we're $5,271 short of what we need to raise by midnight.

"Take a look at what we’re up against:
BREAKING:  Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight just predicted that Gary’s opponent is  “within striking distance” of winning Michigan’s Senate Race -- after reporting that Democrats have ZERO chance of taking back the Senate if Gary loses.
That’s why GOP billionaires are teaming up  right now to prop up Gary’s opponent. In just the last few weeks:
* Trump gave Gary’s opponent his “total and complete” endorsement.
* The  DeVos family super PAC increased their spending to a total of nearly  $6 million  in TV ads attacking Gary.
* A Koch family super PAC just endorsed Gary's opponent and plans to flood Michigan with a six-figure ad buy!
This onslaught of GOP ads and endorsements is tipping the scales. After RealClearPolitics moved this race from “Lean Dem” to “Toss Up,” a brand-new poll shows our Trump-endorsed opponent AHEAD.
The GOP is surging in Michigan, and how we respond right now could determine what happens to Gary’s seat AND the Senate majority. We set a goal to raise another $200,000 before our final FEC quarterly filing deadline \-- and we just can’t fall short.  Will you contribute $3 or more now – every dollar you can spare – to fight back against GOP spending in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats, and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
BREAKING NEWS, team: Trump’s Supreme Court nominee was just moved forward by the GOP-controlled Judiciary Committee, and Mitch McConnell wants to bring her nomination to the floor as soon as possible.
They’re proceeding without regard for the millions of Americans who are casting ballots right now and deserve to have their voices heard.
It’s unacceptable, friend. That’s why Gary Peters has pledged to vote against this nomination to protect the Affordable Care Act and reproductive rights -- even though he’s one of only two Democratic senators up for re-election in a state Trump won in 2016 and Gary’s far-right opponent has Trump and McConnell funnelling millions into Michigan.
No matter what, Gary has our backs. Now, with 12 days until the election and Senate control hinging on what happens in this race, we need to have his. Chip in $3 or more now to keep Michigan blue, flip the Senate and protect the future of the Supreme Court >>

"I need to give you an update on our race in Michigan.
Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Friend – we’re 50 days away from Election Day, and with Republicans going all out to flip this seat, I need to give you an update on our race in Michigan.
For over a year, Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and the DeVos family have funneled MILLIONS of dollars into Michigan to buy this seat. Every step of the way, my extreme right-wing opponent has outraised me – making me the only Democratic senator outraised last quarter.
And after constant GOP attacks and a massive flow of dark money being spent against me, a new poll now shows me trailing by nearly 2 points – and RealClearPolitics moved our race from “Leans Dem” to “Toss-Up.”
The honest truth is that Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight is right: Democrats have ZERO chance to take back the Senate if we lose here in Michigan. My far-right opponent knows it too – and that's why Trump has come back to Michigan again and again to try and flip this seat.
So I’m asking for your help today: Our team set a goal to raise $50,000 from grassroots supporters by our mid-month deadline, but we’re falling $3,423 short of our daily goal – and I’m counting on your help to close the gap immediately: Will you contribute $3 or more now to help me win in Michigan, take back the Senate and protect the future of the Supreme Court from Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell?

"Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Hey folks,
By now, you’ve probably seen an email asking you to chip in this weekend because my far-right opponent has outraised us three times in a row. In fact, it’s why I’m writing to you tonight. Here’s why it matters:
If we lose Michigan, we lose our chance to flip the Senate.
2020 will be the most consequential election in our lifetimes. We have a real shot at replacing Donald Trump in the White House, flipping the Senate to Democratic control and keeping the House blue. If you’re ready for real, effective leadership in Washington -- from the White House to the House of Representatives -- chip in before midnight tonight.
We’ve got a group of donors matching gifts for the next few hours up to $13,612. Friend, will you chip in?
Enjoy your night,
Gary

"It’s up to every one of us to make sure we come out victorious on Election Day.
$5 dollars, friend.
A $5 contribution from you today is what it will take for us to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats, and protect the future of the Supreme Court. Let me tell you why:
I was outraised for the FIFTH reporting period in a row. That means that for the past YEAR we’ve been outpaced on fundraising every step of the way – and with a recent poll showing me nearly TWO POINTS BEHIND my far-right opponent, losing in Michigan would make it nearly impossible for Democrats to take back the Senate -- that means two more years of Mitch McConnell calling the shots on the future of our nation's highest court.
On top of all that, the DeVos family, the Koch family and Mitch McConnell are funneling MILLIONS into super PACs to buy this seat for McConnell and Trump.
After McConnell's super PAC just announced it will be spending $9 MILLION to buy this seat, we've set a rapid-response goal to raise another $300,000 by 11:59 p.m. tonight to win in Michigan and keep this seat blue – but right now, we're falling short. Your $5 can make all the difference in getting us there.
You know the stakes, friend. Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight reports Democrats have zero chance at taking back the Senate if we lose in Michigan. It's moments like this – right here, right now – that will determine whether we defend this seat and take back the Senate.
Pitch in $5 now to help us defend Michigan's Senate seat, take back the Senate for Democrats, and protect the future of the Supreme Court.
It’s up to every one of us to make sure we come out victorious on Election Day. Thanks for fighting with me,
Gary

"As this month comes to a close, I want to give you an update on our race.
Friend,
There’s no doubt about it that Michigan will be the state to determine whether Mitch McConnell continues to run the Senate. Both CBS News and Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight are reporting that Democrats can only win back the Senate if we first win in Michigan, so we need to secure this seat to ensure victory in November.
The GOP knows that the road to the Senate runs through Michigan, so they’re pulling out all the stops to try and buy this seat. That means millions of dollars are flooding into our state with the help of Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and Betsy DeVos (among other far-right billionaires), and I’m now the most-attacked Democratic senator up this year.
I don’t scare easily, friend — the Republican Party can throw everything they want at me and I’ll never waver in my fight for Michigan’s working families. But we’re up against some serious money, and a brand new poll has us two points behind our Trump-backed opponent at the end of this month -- so every second counts.
Tomorrow night, we'll have to close the books on August, and it’s never been more important for our team of grassroots donors to step up. We’re still hoping to bring in another $11,739 before midnight to hit our end-of-month goal and stay on track to win in Michigan — can I count on you to make a contribution of $3 right now?

"Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
We want to give you the latest on what’s happening in Michigan's Senate race:
FIRST: Gary's far-right opponent outraised him five times in a row thanks to Donald Trump, Betsy DeVos’ family and Mitch McConnell funneling in MILLIONS to buy this seat for the GOP.
THEN: A brand new poll shows Gary's opponent IN THE LEAD for the first time in months.
NOW: GOP dark money groups -- including the DeVos family super PAC -- are launching a multi-million dollar ad blitz in Michigan -- because they know buying Gary's seat means at least two more years of Republicans controlling the Senate!
It’s time to act. Even the experts across the country – like Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight, The New York Times and The Washington Post – all agree: If we lose this race here in Michigan, Democrats won’t be able to win the Senate majority. We need all hands on deck to hit a $10,000 rapid-response goal by midnight tonight -- but we’re already falling short.

Friend: Our country cannot take two more years of Mitch McConnell's control over the Senate – but Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight says that's exactly what will happen if we lose in Michigan.
And with new internal polling from our far-right opponent showing our race STATISTICALLY TIED, Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and the DeVos family are pouring millions into Michigan to buy this seat and tighten the GOP's hold on the Senate.
With the future of the Senate and the Supreme Court on the line, we simply CANNOT let Trump and McConnell buy Michigan's Democratic Senate seat.
But right now, we're $9,681 short of today's MUST-HIT fundraising number, and we have to hit it by midnight to win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats.
Will you rush $3 or more now – every dollar you can spare – to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court from Mitch McConnell?

"The most important race happening in 2020 is for control of the Senate.
Friend,
Gary Peters' reelection to the Senate this fall in Michigan will be one of the closest races this November -- and guess who has their thumb on the scale. The DeVos family -- i.e., the family of Betsy DeVos, Secretary of Education -- is hoping they can buy this Senate seat in Michigan by spending almost $1 million to unseat my friend Gary and put in his place their hand-picked choice, John James.
We already know how dangerous the DeVos family has been, and the super PAC ""Better Future Michigan"" wants nothing of the sort: It has 14 donors. Who are they? Half of the donors are members of the DeVos family.
Gary is a fighter for Michigan and my progressive ally in the Senate, and he needs our help: Before midnight tonight, we need to raise $7,500 for Gary Peters -- and I'll be honest: I've looked at the map, and I can't see how we take the majority if we lose this seat. Donate $5 or more now to fund the fight to reelect Gary and fight back against the DeVos family's dangerous plans for Michigan.
If you've saved payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Click to donate $5.
Click to donate $25.
Click to donate $50.
Or click here to donate another amount.
Why is the DeVos family so invested in unseating Gary Peters? Well, for one he's taking on Betsy DeVos and her wasteful spending at the Department of Education -- he pressed for answers back in December as to why 72 charter schools in Michigan never opened despite receiving nearly $21 million in federal start-up funds.
Gary believes like I do that students and families come first -- and for all the charter schools that closed or failed to open, communities missed out on more than half a billion dollars in resources that could have benefitted neighborhood schools. Gary knows her leadership is leaving students and families worse off -- and her family wants him out because of it.
They know he's watching and fighting for teachers, students, and families -- and they're scared. That's why their hand-picked choice to unseat Gary, John James, said Betsy DeVos is doing a ""very, very good"" job as Secretary of Education. John James supports Betsy DeVos even as she planned to cut $9 billion in funding for education, including more than $100 million for Michigan's public schools.
After spending millions to gut Michigan's public school programs, and bigger plans to do more, she can't even say if it was worth it. On whether local schools in Michigan have gotten better, she said: ""I don't know. Overall, I -- I can't say overall.""
Right-wing Republicans like the DeVos family are dumping nearly a million dollars into this race -- but it'll get even closer, and that's why Gary needs our help: Donate $5 or more now to help us raise $7,500 for Gary Peters before midnight tonight.
Sincerely,
Chuck Schumer

Today's the day, team: Donald Trump is coming back to Michigan.
Trump is holding another rally to Michigan in the final week of this race because he knows if Democrats lose here, we have ZERO chance of taking back the Senate.
He's bringing in GOP mega-donors from across the country to funnel money into my far-right opponent’s pockets in an attempt to buy this election. I’ve got one thing to say to the Trump team: Bring it on.

We've fallen far behind in our fundraising for this month. And on top of that, a new poll released yesterday shows our opponent up by nearly 2 points! Please, help us close our financial gap by chipping in whatever you can before midnight by clicking this link: [[URL REDACTED]]
\----Forwarded message----
I just heard from our finance team, and I have to be honest with you, friend: Our fundraising is just not where it needs to be if we want to stay on track to win. We're currently being outraised and outspent at the worst moment – right when a brand-new poll shows my opponent up by nearly 2 points.
That's because after my hard-right opponent, John James – who says he backs Trump “2000%” – recently won his August primary, Republicans gave him a prime-time spot at the RNC, allowing him to fundraise on the national stage.
He's already outraised us five times in a row thanks to Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and the DeVos family funneling tens of millions of dollars into Michigan to buy this seat for the GOP. And if we don't close our August funding gap, he could pull ahead in the polls for good.
Simply put, friend? We cannot allow that to happen. RealClearPolitics just moved our race from “Leans Dem” to “Toss Up” – and in tight races like this, every single dollar makes a difference. With Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight reporting Democrats have ZERO chance to take back the Senate if we lose in Michigan, what we do in moments like this could decide whether Mitch McConnell keeps his grip on the Senate.
We're beginning a mad dash to the finish line, and we need to show my opponent – and his wealthy backers – that we're here to win. So ahead of the most important fundraising deadline of our campaign so far, we need to raise another $6,500 before 11:59 p.m. tonight, and I'm counting on your help to make that happen.

"Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
We want to give you the latest on what’s happening in Michigan:
First: Our opponent John James, a hard-right extremist who says he backs Trump “2000%” and has Trump's ""total and complete endorsement,” outraised us four quarters in a row.
Then: With the news of a Supreme Court vacancy, Trump and McConnell announced that their nominee would receive a vote on the Senate floor without delay.
Now: Mitch McConnell and his GOP billionaire allies are funneling in MILLIONS of dollars to prop up my opponent and buy this seat.
It’s time to act. Even experts across the country – like Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight, The New York Times and The Washington Post – all agree: If we lose this race here in Michigan, Democrats won’t be able to win the Senate majority OR protect the future of the Supreme Court. We need all hands on deck to hit a $15,000 rapid-response goal by 11:59 p.m. tonight – but right now we’re falling short.
Can Gary count on you to rush $3 or more now – every dollar you can spare – to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

"Friend,
I don't think it's hyperbolic to say that the future of our democracy depends on Democrats winning a majority in the Senate this year.
With just six days until Election Day, I wanted to reach out to you personally to ask if you’ll chip in $3 to help Senator Gary Peters defend his Senate seat and be part of a wave that puts Democrats in charge.
Mitch McConnell and his band of fall-in-line Senate Republicans are out of tune and out of touch with the country. Their priority is filling Justice Ginsburg’s Supreme Court seat in an election year (the very thing they refused to do in 2016 when it was President Obama’s nominee.)
Meanwhile, a bill for medical and economic relief for workers and families (passed by the House five months ago) languishes on McConnell’s desk along with more than 400 other bills.
Mitch and his Senate Republicans seem to think their only job is to confirm judges.
Gary Peters is pawing the ground to be a workhorse for you and your family as part of a Democratic Senate majority.
If you want the Senate to do its job, please join me in this fight and pitch in whatever you can afford to make SURE that Gary Peters wins re-election!

But, friend, it's not just about flipping the Senate. Senator Gary Peters is worthy of your support. With Democrats in charge, he'll work with his colleagues to protect your health care and so many other things you care about!
The thing is, his campaign tells me that they need to raise $30,000 before midnight tonight to help Senator Peters keep his seat.
Can I count on you to donate right now??
Contribute Now
I know these are challenging times. If you and your family are struggling with economic or personal loss, my heart goes out to you. I wouldn’t reach out if it weren’t so important. Even a few dollars will help.
Thank you so much for doing whatever you can to support Gary Peters and ensure a Democratic victory up and down the ballot.

"We're still falling short.
Friend:
It’s clearer by the day that we need strong leaders at every level of government — leaders who will act with integrity and prioritize the needs of our country, not just their political party.
That’s why across the country, I’m joined by fellow veterans who are running for the U.S. Senate: Mark Kelly in Arizona, MJ Hegar in Texas, Amy McGrath in Kentucky and Cal Cunningham in North Carolina.
I know all five of us share a commitment to restoring accountability to the Senate and doing right by our service members, veterans and military families. We’re all pushing for progress on health care, education and other key issues. We all know what it means to serve our country.
But here’s another thing we have in common: competitive races that will require significant resources to win in November.
If we want to flip the Senate, we MUST elect all five of us in November. Our goal today is to raise as much money as we can to help make sure together we can reach voters, spread our messages and fight back against attacks from Mitch McConnell and Washington Republicans. The future of the Senate—and our democracy—depends on it.
Friend, can you chip in $3 or more now – every dollar you can spare – to support Mark Kelly, MJ Hegar, Amy McGrath, Cal Cunningham and me in our election fights?

Making sure you saw the news, team: Donald Trump will be in Michigan TONIGHT. Even worse, he'll be drawing nationwide attention -- and wealthy GOP donors -- to Gary’s far-right opponent, who's already outraised us for over a year.
Thankfully, a group of committed donors has offered to  match up to $50,000 of donations,  but ONLY until TONIGHT: every dollar given between now and Trump's visit tonight will now be DOUBLED to win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats.

Today's the day, team: Donald Trump is coming back to Michigan TONIGHT.
This will be the Trump team’s ninth visit to Michigan in the last year — and he keeps coming back because he knows if Democrats lose here, we have ZERO chance of taking back the Senate.
The Trumps are bringing in wealthy donors from across the country to funnel money into my far-right opponent’s pockets in an attempt to buy this election. I’ve got one thing to say to them — bring it on.
And I have some incredible news:  a group of donors has offered to match every donation made between now and Trump's visit tonight – up to $50,000.
With only hours until this match opportunity expires, I'm counting on your donation. Can you rush an urgent contribution of $3 – and have every dollar DOUBLED – to help us compete against Trump and defend Michigan's Senate seat?

Hey team –
Making sure you got Gary's note on this.
He's doing everything he can to save our U.S. Post Office but Gary needs your support on this. We're in search of another 1,274 people to add their names next to Gary's. Will you be one of them, friend?

The U.S. Postal Service is still in jeopardy, friend – and Congress still hasn't passed legislation to keep the USPS from going insolvent. Without action, the Postal Service could collapse in about 100 days.
I can't tell you enough how devastating this would be for communities across the country. Rural communities in Michigan especially depend on our Postal Service as a vital service for staying connected and getting the goods and services they need.
Look, I know it's difficult to imagine a country without the USPS. It's an institution that's become a part of Americans' everyday lives. But this institution is in real danger of disappearing, and that's why I'm reaching out for your help. Will you add your name to my petition demanding Congress take action to save the Postal Service? I’m hoping another 4,000 folks will sign before midnight tonight.

"Here's what you need to know about Michigan’s Senate race:
* John James, a hard-right extremist who says he backs Trump “2000%” and has Trump's ""total and complete endorsement"" won the GOP primary to take on Democrat Sen. Gary Peters.
* James has outraised Gary five times in a row thanks to Donald Trump, Betsy DeVos’ family and Mitch McConnell funneling in MILLIONS to buy this seat for the GOP.
* RealClearPolitics just moved this race from “Lean Dem” to “Toss Up” – and a new poll shows Gary nearly TWO POINTS BEHIND James.
Gary is the ONLY Democratic senator who was outraised last quarter, and Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight reports Democrats have ZERO chance to take back the Senate if Gary loses. That’s why we set a goal to raise $200,000 by our final FEC quarterly filing deadline next week – but right now we're not on track to make it, and we can't afford to fall short.
This is the most important election of our lifetimes, and we need your help: Will you contribute $3 or more now – every dollar you can spare – to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court from Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump?

"Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Friend --
Michigan Senator Gary Peters is being outraised -- and he needs our help.
His GOP opponent John James is one of the best online fundraisers of any Republican running this year -- challenger or incumbent -- and he’s outraised Gary quarter after quarter after quarter. That’s particularly scary because he’s supporting Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos' plan to reopen schools this fall, no matter the risk to students, teachers, or their families.
It’s not just that: There’s a super PAC that's already diving in against Gary that’s funded by the DeVos family -- that’s why we need to act now.
Elections like these have incredible consequences -- if Gary Peters loses in Michigan, Betsy DeVos will have one more enabler in the Senate to support her and her family’s attack on students and teachers.
We can’t let Gary get outraised again: Will you donate $3 or more right now, and protect this seat from Betsy DeVos and her family?

"Team: Despite unprecedented support for our campaign in Michigan, our far-right opponent has broken fundraising records and outraised us for the fifth straight reporting period. On top of that, he won the GOP primary for Michigan's Senate seat JUST this week!
This is all thanks to Donald Trump funneling MILLIONS into Michigan to defeat Gary Peters and buy this seat to expand Mitch McConnell’s majority in the Senate.
They know that Democrats have ZERO chance of taking back the Senate if we lose in Michigan. And now, a recent poll shows Gary statistically tied with his right-wing opponent.
Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight reports that Democrats can take back the Senate, but we must first win in Michigan. That's why a group of donors is matching all donations up to $50,000 – but this only lasts until midnight tomorrow.

That’s because over 20 Republican aligned groups are spending big in Michigan to buy Gary’s seat for McConnell. And now, we’re officially being outspent on the airwaves just as Michiganders begin voting.
With our race downgraded from “Leans Democrat” to “Toss Up” and recent polls showing our opponent narrowly leading, this massive spending gap could tip the scales in our opponent’s favor.
In fact, Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight reports that Democrats have ZERO chance to take back the Senate if we lose in Michigan, so we have no time to waste. We’re setting a rapid-response goal of $15,000 to help close the gap -- but we’re already falling way behind.

"Friend,
If we lose in Michigan, we'll lose our only chance at taking back the Senate for Democrats. That's why tomorrow’s primary election is a turning point we can’t afford to ignore.
Trump’s handpicked candidate officially becomes our opponent tomorrow night -- after outraising us FIVE times in a row over the last year. On top of that, Betsy Devos’ family, Mitch McConnell and national Republicans are funnelling millions into Michigan to flip my Senate seat and protect their majority for at least two more years.
And that money is working. With Senate control hinging on what happens in our race, a recent poll shows me in a STATISTICAL TIE with my extremist opponent -- so it’s never been more urgent that we head into our general election fight prepared to go toe-to-toe with my opponent’s billionaire allies.
Friend, I’m setting a goal to raise another $45,000 in grassroots dollars before polls close tomorrow. And I'm counting on your immediate contribution:
Will you rush $3 right now – every dollar you can before midnight – to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

"Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
If we lose in Michigan, we'll lose our only chance at taking back the Senate for Democrats. That's why this news is so troubling:
Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and national Republicans are funneling in millions to defeat me, hell-bent on buying Michigan’s Senate seat. And now, a brand-new poll from the New York Times shows me only ONE POINT ahead of my far-right opponent.
Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight reports that Democrats can take back the Senate, but we must first win in Michigan. But my far-right opponent has outraised me time and time again, and Michiganders are already casting their ballots by the thousands.
Friends, our last FEC filing deadline is on Wednesday night, and with Senate control on the line, we cannot be outraised again. Here's the big news: a group of donors has offered to MATCH every donation between now and our deadline up to $500,000. So I'm counting on your immediate contribution:
Will you rush $3 or more right now – and have every dollar DOUBLED – to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

Joe Biden winning the White House with a Democratic Senate majority by his side depends on one major contingency: Gary Peters winning in Michigan.
That’s why Republicans like Trump, Mitch McConnell and the DeVos family are funneling TENS OF MILLIONS of dollars into Michigan to defeat Joe and Gary – because recent polls show Joe AND Gary within the margin of error in Michigan.
With voters already casting ballots, we urgently need to hit our $50,000 emergency fundraising goal by midnight to turn out Democratic voters, win this critical Senate race and help send Joe to the White House with a Senate majority.
We need EVERY supporter to chip in $3 or more right now – anything you can spare – to raise the remaining $25,345 toward our midnight goal and stay on track to win BIG on Election Day:

"Every dollar triple-matched today will help decide Senate control
Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
This can’t wait, team: We only have 20 days to defend this seat – but my team just let me know that we're falling seriously short of our $500,000 rapid-response match goal to close our fundraising gap.
We’re exactly $175,913 short of our goal, with winning in Michigan and taking back the Senate for Democrats on the line. But with just hours until our midnight deadline, we're not on track to come up with what we need to win.
So a group of committed donors is upping their offer, but ONLY until midnight: I just got the word that every dollar given until midnight tonight will now be TRIPLE-MATCHED to win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats.
Team, we MUST take complete advantage of this rare triple-match opportunity because Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight reports that what happens here in Michigan will determine Senate control for the next two years – and a brand-new poll from the New York Times shows me only ONE POINT ahead of my Trump- and McConnell-backed opponent.
There is too much at stake to sit on the sidelines: Every dollar triple-matched today will help decide Senate control for Democrats, so rush $3 or more now – while every $1 becomes $3 – to defend Michigan's Democratic Senate seat, take back the Senate and protect the future of the Supreme Court!

"We're on the list of ""most vulnerable Senate seats""
Team: CBS News reports Democrats have ZERO chance to flip the Senate if we lose in Michigan, and right now a new poll shows us nearly TWO POINTS BEHIND our far-right opponent.
Gary has been outraised four of the last five quarters because Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and the DeVos family are funneling MILLIONS to buy this seat for the GOP.
And now it's clear the GOP dark-money war chest is making a difference: RealClearPolitics just moved this race from “Leans Dem” to “Toss Up” – and we were just added to Roll Call's list of most vulnerable Senate seats.
Gary was the ONLY Democratic senator to be outraised last summer, so with less than TWO WEEKS left in this race, we set an 11:59 p.m. deadline to raise another $50,000 – but we’re falling $33,683 short of what we need to stay on track to win.
This is the biggest election of our lifetimes, and we need your support: Will you contribute $5 or more now – every dollar you can spare – to win in Michigan, take back the Senate and protect the future of the Supreme Court from Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump?

"Betsy DeVos' family is trying to buy Michigan's Senate seat for our right-wing, Trump-backed opponent.
IMPORTANT UPDATE, friend: Betsy DeVos' family is trying to buy Michigan's Senate seat for our right-wing Trump-backed opponent:
The DeVos family has donated $78,900 to Gary's opponent, Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump's hand-picked candidate!
And that's not all: Out-of-state, conservative billionaires have spent millions, all to help buy Michigan’s Senate seat for a candidate who supports Trump “2,000%.”
And guess what? It's working. A recent poll shows Gary TIED with his extremist opponent.
With CBS reporting Senate control is riding on what happens here in Michigan, our fundraising is falling short. We're only 74.8% of the way to our $15,000 goal – and we need to get there by midnight tonight.

Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
We have exactly four weeks to make sure Democrats take back the Senate. But we can’t do it if we don't reelect Gary Peters.
Remember: Donald Trump won Michigan by 10,704 votes last time -- that’s just two votes per precinct. And he and Republicans think they can turn Michigan red AGAIN.
Which is why the GOP will spend ANY AMOUNT to eke out another win -- especially because Mitch McConnell is guaranteed two more years of Senate control if he can buy Gary’s seat, per Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight and CBS News.
With Republicans now outspending us and funneling in more than $25 million dollars to Michigan, Gary can ONLY win if grassroots supporters like you fight with him. We have four weeks left to take back the Senate -- so our goal today is to raise $50,000 before midnight.
Please, team, we only have four weeks left to win in Michigan. Rush $3 or more now – anything you can spare – to take back the Senate and protect the Supreme Court from Mitch McConnell >>

"It’s up to every one of us to make sure we come out victorious on Election Day.
$5, friend.
A contribution of $5 from you today is what it will take for us to win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats. Let me tell you why:
We’ve been outpaced on fundraising for four out of the last five quarters – and with recent polling showing me TWO POINTS BEHIND my far-right opponent, losing in Michigan would make it nearly impossible for Democrats to take back the Senate -- that means two more years of Mitch McConnell calling the shots on the future of our nation's highest court.
On top of all that, Republicans including the DeVos family, the Koch family and Mitch McConnell are funneling in OVER $30 MILLION to buy this seat for the GOP -- and the Trump team is visiting Michigan every day this week.
We've set an ambitious Get Out the Vote goal of $500,000 to reach every voter in Michigan and keep this seat blue -- and we need all hands on deck to get there. Your $5 can make all the difference in getting us there.
You know the stakes, friend. Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight reports Democrats have zero chance at taking back the Senate if we lose in Michigan. It's moments like this – right here, right now – that will determine whether we defend this seat and take back the Senate.
We're in the last 5 days of this race, so can you pitch in $5 now to help us defend Michigan's Senate seat and take back the Senate for Democrats?
It’s up to every one of us to make sure we come out victorious on Election Day. Thanks for fighting with me,
Gary

Friend – Despite unprecedented support for our campaign in Michigan, my extreme right-wing GOP opponent has broken fundraising records and outraised us for the FIFTH straight reporting period.
This is thanks to Donald Trump funneling MILLIONS into Michigan to defeat me and buy this seat to expand Mitch McConnell’s majority in the Senate.
I won't mince words: Democrats cannot take back the Senate if we lose in Michigan. Period. That's why the GOP has made it clear they will stop at nothing to defeat me.
I'm counting on supporters like you, friend: Please rush $3 or more now to defend Michigan's Senate seat and take back the Senate for Democrats.
We can’t afford any more years of a Republican Senate – they’ve already confirmed two extreme right-wing justices to the Supreme Court and threatened to dismantle affordable health care. It's never been more important for Democrats to win back the Senate majority.
Friend, here’s the good news: Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight reports Democrats can take back the Senate. But first we have to win here in Michigan.
Recent polling shows me TWO POINTS BEHIND my far-right opponent – and in a race this close, every single dollar matters. If we're going to win and take back the Senate, we cannot fall further behind.
What we do right now could be the difference between winning and losing. Please, will you rush $3 or more to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

This is really bad news friend: The Michigan Senate race rating just downgraded from Lean Democratic to TOSS UP.
This is one of the most alarming developments in our campaign yet -- and could risk our chance to flip the Senate.
On top of that, Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight and CBS News analysts say the future of the Senate will be decided in Michigan.
What’s worse: John James has OUTRAISED Gary Peters four quarters in a row and his growing fundraising edge is now putting us at risk of LOSING this race and taking back the Senate for Democrats.
And with polls showing us TIED, we need all hands on deck to hit a $30,000 rapid-response goal by midnight tonight -- but we’re already falling short.
Friend -- we’re running out of time before Election Day. Please rush an emergency gift of $5 or more right now to fight back against GOP spending in Michigan, defend Michigan's Senate seat and take back the Senate for Democrats!

Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Friend: As this month comes to a close, I want to give you an update on our race.
The bad news: Thanks to Donald Trump and the DeVos family steering MILLIONS of dollars against me, my extreme right-wing opponent outraised me – for the third time in a row.
The good news: We are on track to have the best online fundraising month of the campaign, and Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight is reporting that Democrats have an opportunity to take back the Senate!
The big news: Our only path to Senate control starts with winning here in Michigan. With recent polling showing me TIED, the DeVos family dumped nearly $1 million into Michigan to buy this seat for Mitch McConnell and the GOP.
And now, with analysts at CBS News reporting that Michigan will decide Senate control, we’ve set a goal to raise another $65,000 immediately to win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats.
Friend: In a race this close, with the Senate and the future of the Supreme Court on the line, falling short could very well cost Democrats our chance to take back the Senate.
I wouldn't ask if it wasn't critically important: Friend, will you rush $3 or more right now – every dollar you can – to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

"It’s one of the most important days of my campaign.
Friend,
Today’s the day -- it's primary day in Michigan. That means our emergency fundraising goal ends when the polls close at 8 p.m. tonight.
And I’ll cut right to it: We’re not going to reach our $45,000 goal without a big final push right away.
I’m coming directly to you on one of the most important days of our campaign. Without supporters like you, we can’t win in Michigan and we can’t take back the Senate from Mitch McConnell. Will you step up now?

And now, with analysts at CBS News reporting that Michigan will decide Senate control, we’ve counting on supporters like you to help raise the last $14,873 toward our emergency goal to win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats.
It’s contributions like yours that power this campaign from one day to the next. I won’t be able to win in November without your support.
Rush a donation of $3 or more now – or whatever you can spare – to defend Michigan's Senate seat and take back the Senate for Democrats. We only have hours left until the deadline.
Together, I know we have what it takes to win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats. Thank you for helping hit this goal.

"It’s up to every one of us to make sure we come out victorious on Election Day.
$5 dollars, friend.
A $5 contribution from you today is what it will take for us to win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats. Let me tell you why:
I was just outraised for the FIFTH time in a row. That means that for the past YEAR we’ve been outpaced on fundraising every step of the way – and with a recent poll showing this race TIED, losing in Michigan would make it nearly impossible for Democrats to take back the Senate.
And to tip the scales in this race, the DeVos family and right-wing groups are funneling millions into super PACs to buy this seat for McConnell and Trump.
After talking with my finance team, we've set a goal to raise another $4,713 by midnight to win in Michigan and keep this seat blue. Your $5 can make all the difference in getting us there.
You know the stakes, friend. Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight reports Democrats have zero chance at taking back the Senate if we lose in Michigan. It's moments like this – right here, right now – that will determine whether we defend this seat and take back the Senate.
Pitch in $5 now to help us defend Michigan's Senate seat, fight this right-wing spending from Trump and the DeVos family and take back the Senate for Democrats.
It’s up to every one of us to make sure we come out victorious on Election Day. Thanks for fighting with me,
Gary

"just heard from our finance team
I just heard from our finance team, and I have to be honest with you, friend: Our fundraising is just not where it needs to be if we want to stay on track to win. We're currently being outraised and outspent at the worst moment – right when a brand-new poll shows my opponent up by nearly 2 points.
That's because after my hard-right opponent, John James – who says he backs Trump “2000%” – recently won his primary, Republicans gave him a prime-time spot at the RNC, allowing him to fundraise on the national stage.
He's already outraised us five times in a row thanks to Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and the DeVos family funneling tens of millions of dollars into Michigan to buy this seat for the GOP. And if we don't close this funding gap, he could pull ahead in the polls for good.
Simply put, friend? We cannot allow that to happen. RealClearPolitics just moved our race from “Leans Dem” to “Toss Up” – and in tight races like this, every single dollar makes a difference. With Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight reporting Democrats have ZERO chance to take back the Senate if we lose in Michigan, what we do in moments like this could decide whether Mitch McConnell keeps his grip on the Senate.
We're beginning a mad dash to the finish line, and we need to show my opponent – and his wealthy backers – that we're here to win. We need to raise another $6,500 before 11:59 p.m. tonight, and I'm counting on your help to make that happen.
Will you contribute $3 or more now – anything you can spare – to win in Michigan, flip the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court from Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell?

Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
There's no way of sugarcoating this, friend: I was the only Democratic senator to be outraised last quarter – and this makes it the FIFTH straight reporting period that our Trump- and DeVos-backed opponent has outraised us. Friend, it couldn't have come at a worse time, with polls showing me two points behind my far-right opponent.
With analysts at CBS News reporting that Michigan’s Senate race will decide Senate control, we’ll have zero chance of taking back the Senate if we lose this seat. It's why right-wing interests from Donald Trump to Mitch McConnell to the DeVos family are funneling in millions to buy this Senate seat.
I’m no stranger to tough fights: fighting for the people of Michigan is the greatest honor of my life, and I do not plan on ceding this seat to a right-wing extremist.
But if we're going to win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats, we CANNOT afford to keep being outraised. That's why my team set a rapid-response goal to raise $6,200 immediately to make up our shortfall, but right now, we're falling short of what we need to win.
Our opponent has the full force of GOP special interests behind him – but I have you. So I'm asking: before midnight, can I count on you to contribute $3 or more now – every dollar you can spare – to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

Friend: We fell $3,407 short of our midnight match goal in a moment that could make or break our entire campaign.
Our right-wing opponent has already outraised us THREE TIMES IN A ROW, and Mitch McConnell’s shady super PAC just spent $3 MILLION on a TV ad buy attacking me.
With a recent poll showing our race TIED, there’s no other way to say it: If we continue to fall behind in our fundraising goals, we could lose – and Democrats would have ZERO chance at taking back the Senate.
We cannot hand Mitch McConnell two more years of the power to confirm extremist Supreme Court justices.
That’s why, in this pivotal moment, I wanted to make sure you heard the great news: After falling short of our match goal, a group of generous donors EXTENDED this rare match until midnight tonight – but we’re still $3,407 short with hours left to spare.
I wouldn’t ask if it weren’t important: Will you rush $3 or more – every dollar you can spare will be DOUBLED – to defend Michigan’s Senate seat, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

"Here's what you need to know about Michigan’s Senate race:
* John James, a hard-right extremist who says he backs Trump “2000%” and has Trump's ""total and complete endorsement"" won the GOP primary to take on Democrat Sen. Gary Peters.
* Republicans like Donald Trump, Betsy DeVos’ family and Mitch McConnell are funneling in MILLIONS to buy this seat for the GOP.
* RealClearPolitics just moved this race from “Lean Dem” to “Toss Up” – and a new internal poll from our opponent shows this race as STATISTICALLY TIED.
Gary is the ONLY Democratic senator who was outraised this summer, and Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight reports Democrats have ZERO chance to take back the Senate if Gary loses. That’s why we set a goal to raise $50,000 by the weekend – but right now we're not on track to make it, and we can't afford to fall short.

"It’s Cory Booker. Do you have a minute?
This year we have the chance to take back the White House, flip the United States Senate and renew our sense of hope for our country’s future.
But in order to do so, we have to flip the Senate – and we’ll need your help in order to accomplish a victory in November.
Winning an election is no easy task. It takes an entire community to build around one voice – one person at a time. It’s why I’m reaching out to you on behalf of my friend, Gary Peters.
He’s running for reelection in Michigan – a key battleground state Democrats lost in 2016. If we lose his seat, we won’t flip the Senate and we’ll have more of Mitch McConnell’s destructive partisanship in Washington.
This is the most important election of our lifetimes, and together we can make sure it's a triumphant one for Democrats. It’s why I’m asking you to join me in supporting Gary Peters as he runs for reelection in Michigan. Can you chip in $3 to ensure we keep Michigan blue and flip the Senate this November?

Gary is running against a Donald Trump-backed Republican opponent who’s said he stands with Trump “2,000%,” ensuring dark-money groups and special interests will flood Michigan in attack ads filled with malicious lies and harmful rhetoric.
In fact, a super PAC has already spent almost $3 million against Gary – and it’s only July!
This race won’t be easy, and with the fight for the Senate on the line, we’ll need an outpouring of grassroots support to guarantee a win in November.
Friend, I’m asking one last time. Support Gary Peters and help flip the Senate in November by donating today.
Thank you,
Cory Booker

"I just talked to my team this morning, friend, and they’re saying that we're only 21% of the way toward our $500,000 mid-month match goal -- even as Senate Republicans began confirmation hearings TODAY to rush Trump's nominee onto the Supreme Court.
With the future of the Supreme Court on the line, it's never been more urgent to take away Mitch McConnell's Senate control -- and that means we need to win in Michigan. Can you chip in $3 or more now to win in Michigan, take back the Senate and protect the Supreme Court from Mitch McConnell?
Thank you,
Gary
\----Forwarded message----
Friend, the stakes could not be higher.
With a vacancy on the Supreme Court, health care protections for people with pre-existing conditions, Roe v. Wade and women’s health care, civil rights, voting rights, and workers’ rights are on the line. Michiganders have already begun casting their ballots and deserve to have their voices heard. There should NOT be a Supreme Court nomination until the next presidential term begins.
But in the midst of an election, Mitch McConnell has vowed that Donald Trump's nominee will fill the Supreme Court vacancy -- and her Senate confirmation hearings begin THIS WEEK.
The Supreme Court is on the ballot this November, friend. And with analysts at CBS News reporting that Michigan’s Senate race will decide Senate control, we’ll have ZERO chance of taking back the Senate from McConnell and protecting the Supreme Court if we lose this seat.
That’s why Trump, McConnell and their Republican-allies are funnelling TENS of MILLIONS of dollars to buy this seat -- and after weeks of nonstop GOP attacks against me, a recent internal poll from my Trump- and McConnell-backed opponent shows us STATISTICALLY TIED.
Keeping Michigan blue and flipping the Senate has never been more important, that’s why my team and I have set a $20,000 emergency goal by 11:59 p.m. TONIGHT. Friend, I’m personally asking: Can I count on you to contribute $3 or more now to win in Michigan, take back the Senate and protect the Supreme Court from Mitch McConnell?

"Friend, Donald Trump just stepped off the stage in Michigan after attacking me in an effort to flip this seat.
Even worse, Trump’s holding TWO more rallies in Michigan tomorrow on the final day of his 2020 campaign. Friend, Trump is zeroing in on Michigan right before Election Day because he thinks he has a real shot at winning here -- AND saving the GOP’s Senate majority by attacking me and propping up our far-right opponent.
With only TWO DAYS left in this race, Trump’s rally today could tip the scales into the GOP’s favor unless we see a serious surge of grassroots support to help us defend this seat. The White House and Senate control are on the line in Michigan, so I’m setting an emergency goal of raising $100,000 before he comes back tomorrow.
Before Trump takes the stage tomorrow, can you chip in $3 or more -- every dollar you can spare -- to help us finish this race strong and defeat Trump and his hand-picked opponent?

"Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Friend,
We're in a mad dash to the finish line of the campaign. And I’ll cut right to it: Senate control will be decided here in Michigan.
Republican groups are spending over $40 million against me because they know that Democrats can't take back the Senate without winning in Michigan. And now, CNN is reporting that Michigan is one of the Senate seats MOST likely to flip.
After hearing how important this race is, a group of donors agreed to triple-match every donation up to $100,000. And this close to Election Day, we can't afford not to take advantage of this offer.
I’m coming directly to you with just days left in our campaign. Without supporters like you, we can’t win in Michigan and take back Senate control from Mitch McConnell. Will you step up now?

Massive amounts of Michiganders are making their voting decisions right now, friend -- and the tens of millions of dollars being spent against Gary by GOP dark money groups could be enough to tip the scales in this race.

Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
The most important race happening in 2020 is not the presidential race, friend: It is the race for control of the Senate.
If Democrats lose here in Michigan, we'll miss our only chance of taking back the Senate.
That means two more years of Mitch McConnell calling the shots in Washington. That means he and Donald Trump will team up to put more extremist justices like Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court, and you can bet they’ll keep trying to dismantle protections for those with preexisting conditions.
The good news is that experts from Roll Call to FiveThirtyEight report Democrats can take back the Senate, but only if Gary Peters first wins in Michigan.
Gary's Trump-backed opponent has outraised him three times now, and on top of that, Gary is the most attacked incumbent Democratic senator in the entire country.
This race will decide Senate control, and right now, polling shows this race statistically TIED. So we've set an emergency goal to raise $12,500 by midnight tonight. But right now, we're falling $8,804 short of what we need to win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats.
Please rush $3 or more – every dollar you can by midnight – to help Gary Peters win in Michigan, defeat McConnell and Trump and take back the Senate for Democrats!

"Back in 2010, I was a first-term congressman up for reelection during the Republican Tea Party wave - a wave that saw huge GOP gains in the Senate and the beginning of a Republican House majority that would last eight years.
Friend,
Back in 2010, I was a first-term congressman up for reelection during the Republican Tea Party wave – a wave that saw huge GOP gains in the Senate and the beginning of a Republican House majority that would last eight years.
In all honesty, the odds were stacked against me in that race, and national GOP interests were determined to see me lose. But I've never backed down from a tough fight in my entire life. I campaigned hard across my district in Michigan, and I was one of only a handful of freshman Democratic members of Congress who won reelection that year.
I owe a lot of that grit to my parents. Dad was a World War II veteran who poured his heart into teaching in Michigan public schools for three decades. Mom was an SEIU steward who organized the heck out of her workplace – for the betterment of her family and colleagues. They inspired me to work hard so I could put myself through school and join the Navy Reserve.
So you know what comes to mind when I hear that I'm one of the most targeted Democratic senators up for reelection this year? Or that I'm one of the few senators fighting to win in a state Donald Trump carried in 2016? I think of Mom and Dad and how hard they worked, always, for the betterment of others. I think of that House race when the odds seemed impossible, but we won.
That's my motivation, friend, and I'm determined to win and keep fighting for the people of Michigan. For good middle-class jobs, for our environment, for affordable health care and quality public education. But I can't win this thing alone.
Will you rush a contribution of $3 now to help me win? Whatever you chip in will ensure we have the resources to defend Michigan's Senate seat and take back the Senate for Democrats.
I've fought and won tough campaigns before, friend. But this time around, at least TWO right-wing super PACs and a dark money group have funneled big money into attacking me – not to mention that Betsy DeVos' family is dropping nearly $1 million to defeat me.
But do you know what I say to all of them? Go ahead and try. My right-wing opponent can depend on Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump and all the billionaire money he wants. I'm determined to win this thing the right way: by standing up for the people of Michigan and fighting with a grassroots team.
The truth of the matter, however, is this: Our race in Michigan will decide Senate control. Plain and simple. And with a new poll showing me trailing two points behind my Trump-backed opponent, falling behind our fundraising goals puts us in danger of losing. And after checking in with my finance team, we're $8,100 short of what we need to win.
I'm proud to have you on this team, friend, and I'm proud of everything we've accomplished so far. I know we can win this, but we've got to come together and fight harder than ever. So I'm asking: Will you make a donation of $3 – whatever you can spare to help us defend Michigan's Senate seat – so we can win this reelection and take back the Senate for Democrats?
Thank you very much.
Gary

Friend: Despite unprecedented support for our campaign in Michigan, our opponent just announced he has outraised us for the FIFTH straight reporting period.

"I just voted No.
Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Friend, I just voted No on Trump's Supreme Court nominee, and I know without a doubt it was the right thing to do.
But I'm a little worried about what comes next. Trump, McConnell and the DeVos family are already funneling in TENS OF MILLIONS of dollars to buy this seat, and right now the polls are showing a dead heat – every moment left in this race is make-or-break.
Democrats can't take back the Senate without Michigan, so I have a big ask of you now: Will you help us raise $500,000 before 11:59 p.m. to get the resources we need to defend this seat from my far-right opponent and his billionaire allies?
Chip in $5, $25 – anything you can spare – to win in Michigan, take back the Senate and fight to protect the future of the Supreme Court.
The gravity of this moment cannot be understated. In just a few days, Justice Amy Coney Barrett could begin hearing critical cases – including one that could kick millions off their health insurance and remove health care protections for more than 130 million people with preexisting conditions – including 1.7 million Michiganders.
This Supreme Court nomination is also a threat to Roe v. Wade, civil rights, voting rights and ensuring workers' rights are put before corporate interests.
So taking back the Senate – and protecting the future of the Supreme Court – could NOT be more important, team, and it all hinges on Michigan.
Please, will you rush a $5 contribution now – every dollar you can spare before midnight – to win in Michigan, take back the Senate and protect the future of the Supreme Court?
I know a lot of people in this country are worried right now, but I also know that if Democrats take back the Senate, we can fight to protect the rights of every American. But we have just 8 days to do everything we can to make that happen.
Here's that link to give one more time: [[URL REDACTED]]
Thank you for everything you've done. I know we're going to be victorious, because you're fighting by my side.

"The most important race happening in 2020 is for control of the Senate.
Friend,
Gary Peters' reelection to the Senate this fall in Michigan will be one of the closest races this November -- and guess who has their thumb on the scale. The DeVos family -- i.e., the family of Betsy DeVos, Secretary of Education -- is hoping they can buy this Senate seat in Michigan by spending almost $1 million to unseat my friend Gary and put in his place their hand-picked choice, John James.
We already know how dangerous the DeVos family has been, and the super PAC ""Better Future Michigan"" wants nothing of the sort: It has 14 donors. Who are they? Half of the donors are members of the DeVos family. What's more,  the super PAC is spending $4 million on TV ads this month.
Gary is a fighter for Michigan and my progressive ally in the Senate, and he needs our help: Before midnight tonight, we need to raise $8,500 for Gary Peters -- and I'll be honest: I've looked at the map, and I can't see how we take the majority if we lose this seat. Donate $5 or more now to fund the fight to reelect Gary and fight back against the DeVos family's dangerous plans for Michigan.

Why is the DeVos family so invested in unseating Gary Peters? Well, for one he's taking on Betsy DeVos and her wasteful spending at the Department of Education -- he pressed for answers back in December as to why 72 charter schools in Michigan never opened despite receiving nearly $21 million in federal start-up funds.
Gary believes like I do that students and families come first -- and for all the charter schools that closed or failed to open, communities missed out on more than half a billion dollars in resources that could have benefitted neighborhood schools. Gary knows her leadership is leaving students and families worse off -- and her family wants him out because of it.
They know he's watching and fighting for teachers, students, and families -- and they're scared. That's why their hand-picked choice to unseat Gary, John James, said Betsy DeVos is doing a ""very, very good"" job as Secretary of Education. John James supports Betsy DeVos even as she planned to cut $9 billion in funding for education, including more than $100 million for Michigan's public schools.
After spending millions to gut Michigan's public school programs, and bigger plans to do more, she can't even say if it was worth it. On whether local schools in Michigan have gotten better, she said: ""I don't know. Overall, I -- I can't say overall.""
Right-wing Republicans like the DeVos family are dumping nearly a million dollars into this race -- but it'll get even closer, and that's why Gary needs our help: Donate $5 or more now to help us raise $8,500 for Gary Peters before midnight tonight.
Sincerely,
Chuck Schumer

"The most important race happening in 2020 is for control of the Senate.
I will not be the first, nor will I be the last to tell you this, friends: The most important race happening in 2020 is for control of the Senate.
I have a front-row seat to the damage Mitch McConnell is causing in the Senate. He is blocking every last attempt at progress that our Democratic colleagues in the House are fighting so hard for – environmental protections, gun safety measures, affordable healthcare. If a Democrat wins the White House, they MUST have the Senate as well.
That's why I'm reaching out to you about Gary Peters' race in Michigan. Experts from FiveThirtyEight to Roll Call say Democrats can win back the Senate – but only if Gary wins in Michigan.
The thing is that Gary's reelection won't be easy. He's one of two Democratic Senate candidates fighting to win in a state President Trump carried. To top it all off, Gary is neck-and-neck with his hard-right opponent, handpicked by Trump and McConnell.
So here's the deal: I told Gary I'd help him raise $8,500 to protect Michigan's Democratic Senate seat, and we really need to hit that goal before midnight. Can I count on you to give now and help us take back the Senate majority?
Please, click here to give $5 or more to help Gary Peters keep Michigan blue, defeat Mitch McConnell and take back the Senate for Democrats.

"Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
I’ve got some upsetting news, friend: Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight reports Democrats have ZERO chance of taking Senate control if we lose in Michigan. But my Trump-backed opponent outraised us four of the last five quarters, and new polling shows me TWO POINTS behind.
Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and Betsy DeVos’ family are funneling MILLIONS of dollars into Michigan to buy this Senate seat – and GOP super PACs are spending more to defeat me than any other Democratic senator up for reelection.

"More McConnell attack ads
This changes everything, friend:
The National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) – controlled by Mitch McConnell – is launching a MASSIVE TV buy of $1.5 MILLION for attack ads against Gary Peters.
With Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight and analysts at CBS News saying the future of the Senate will be decided in Michigan, this is one of the biggest and most important moments in our campaign.
That's because attack ads like this can tip the scales majorly, particularly with current polling showing our race neck and neck and with the DeVos family's super PAC propping up Gary's right-wing opponent.
We've set a rapid-response goal to raise $50,000 by midnight tonight. With Senate control – and the future of the Supreme Court – hinging on what happens here in Michigan, Gary is counting on your immediate contribution:
Please rush $3 or more now to fight back against Mitch McConnell's attack ads, defend Michigan's Senate seat and take back the Senate for Democrats!

"It’s up to every one of us to make sure we come out victorious on Election Day.
$5 dollars, friend.
A $5 contribution from you today is what it will take for us to win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats. Let me tell you why:
I was just outraised for the FOURTH quarter in a row. That means that for the past YEAR we’ve been outpaced on fundraising every step of the way – and with a recent poll showing this race TIED, losing in Michigan would make it nearly impossible for Democrats to take back the Senate.
And to tip the scales in this race, the DeVos family and right-wing groups are funneling millions into super PACs to buy this seat for McConnell and Trump.
After talking with my finance team, we've set a goal to raise another $50,000 by midnight to win in Michigan and keep this seat blue. Your $5 can make all the difference in getting us there.
You know the stakes, friend. Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight reports Democrats have zero chance at taking back the Senate if we lose in Michigan. It's moments like this – right here, right now – that will determine whether we defend this seat and take back the Senate.
Pitch in $5 now to help us defend Michigan's Senate seat, fight this right-wing spending from Trump and the DeVos family and take back the Senate for Democrats.
It’s up to every one of us to make sure we come out victorious on Election Day. Thanks for fighting with me,

I WANT TO HELP SAVE THE USPS
\----Forwarded message----
Folks, I want to keep you updated on what’s happening with this United States Postal Service (USPS).
Donald Trump’s new handpicked postmaster general is changing procedures that have led to a disastrous problem for our country: Massive mail delays.
These changes threaten the well-being of millions of Americans that rely on the Postal Service for the delivery of Social Security checks, prescription drugs and everyday mail – including mail-in-ballots for our 2020 general election.
It’s why I've launched an investigation into these mail delays. Please join me by adding your name next to mine and stand up to the Trump administration’s disastrous changes.
The bottom line is if management decisions are being made to slow down the mail, impacting everyday citizens and their everyday business as well as slowing down the voting process, that is simply unacceptable.
The Trump administration wants to privatize the Postal Service – slowing down delivery and ultimately impacting mail-in voting here in Michigan and across our country. We can’t let this happen, friend.
YES, I'LL ADD MY NAME
Thank you,
Gary

"I was the only Democratic senator to be outraised last quarter.
Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
There's no way of sugarcoating this, friend: I was the only Democratic senator to be outraised last quarter – and this makes it the fifth straight reporting period that our Trump- and DeVos-backed opponent has outraised us. Friend, it couldn't have come at a worse time, with polls showing me BEHIND my far-right opponent.
With analysts at CBS News reporting that Michigan’s Senate race will decide Senate control, we’ll have zero chance of taking back the Senate if we lose this seat. It's why right-wing interests from Donald Trump to Mitch McConnell to the DeVos family are funneling in millions to buy this Senate seat.
I’m no stranger to tough fights: Fighting for the people of Michigan is the greatest honor of my life, and I do not plan on ceding this seat to a right-wing extremist.
But if we're going to win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats, we CANNOT afford to keep being outraised. That's why my team set a rapid-response goal to raise $200,000 before our final FEC quarterly filing deadline tonight to make up our shortfall, but right now, we're falling short of what we need to win.
Our opponent has the full force of GOP special interests behind him – but I have you. So I'm asking: Before midnight, can I count on you to contribute $3 or more now – every dollar you can spare – to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

"THIS IS URGENT, team: Mitch McConnell's super PAC just announced that they're spending another $9 MILLION against Gary Peters. This couldn't come at a worse time, when a new poll shows Gary trailing BEHIND his Trump-backed opponent.
This is deeply concerning because CBS News reports Democrats have ZERO chance of taking back the Senate if we lose in Michigan.
With Senate control and the future of the Supreme Court at stake, we can't afford to fall further behind. But Gary has been outraised by his far-right opponent five times in a row, and GOP billionaires including the DeVos family and the Koch family are funneling in TENS of MILLIONS to buy Michigan's Senate seat.
That's why we just launched an emergency $300,000 fundraising push to combat this new surge of right-wing spending – but right now we're falling WAY short.

"I can't do it alone.
Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Friend, Americans have been able to count on the Postal Service for hundreds of years – but in just a few months, Donald Trump's handpicked postmaster general has undermined one of our nation’s most trusted institutions.
The Postal Service is a lifeline for millions of Americans – whether delivering prescription drugs, serving veterans and rural communities, helping small businesses, and more. And in an election year when vote-by-mail is more important than ever, people MUST be able to count on reliable and timely mail delivery.
That's why I'm leading the fight to save the Postal Service. I launched an investigation into recent mail delays and will continue asking the questions we need answered to increase transparency and fix what's broken.
But I can't do it alone. I will NOT allow the Trump administration to destroy the Postal Service, but I need you standing with me and speaking out now.
Will you sign my new petition to save the Postal Service before our midnight deadline? We're still 3,617 signatures short of tonight's goal and missing your name.
This is one of the most pressing issues our nation is facing, and your voice is critical in this conversation.
Thank you,

"The most important race happening in 2020 is for control of the Senate.
I will not be the first, nor will I be the last to tell you this, friends: The most important race happening in 2020 is for control of the Senate.
I have a front-row seat to the damage Mitch McConnell is causing in the Senate. He is blocking every last attempt at progress that our Democratic colleagues in the House are fighting so hard for – environmental protections, gun safety measures, affordable healthcare. If Joe Biden wins the White House, he MUST have the Senate as well.
That's why I'm reaching out to you about Gary Peters' race in Michigan. Experts from FiveThirtyEight to Roll Call say Democrats can win back the Senate – but only if Gary wins in Michigan.
The thing is that Gary's reelection won't be easy. He's one of two Democratic Senate candidates fighting to win in a state President Trump carried. To top it all off, a brand-new poll shows Gary trailing behind his hard-right opponent, who was handpicked by Trump and McConnell.
So here's the deal: I told Gary I'd help him raise $10,000 to protect Michigan's Democratic Senate seat, and we really need to hit that goal before midnight. Can I count on you to give now and help us take back the Senate majority?
Please, click here to give $5 or more to help Gary Peters keep Michigan blue, defeat Mitch McConnell and take back the Senate for Democrats.

Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
In a moment, I’m going to ask you to make a donation to help us reach our last end-of-month fundraising goal, friend. Here's why I know I can count on you: After being outraised by my far-right opponent for over a year running, our last quarterly haul was LARGER than our opponent’s -- even though Trump, McConnell and Betsy DeVos’ family funnelled in tens of millions to prop up his campaign.
Because of grassroots supporters like you, last quarter we brought in:
* The largest quarterly haul of any Senate candidate in Michigan’s history
* The largest quarterly haul of our entire campaign
* Over 300,000 first-time donors!
Now here’s why we can’t afford to slow down even a little bit.
Not only did my opponent outraise us 4 out of the last 5 quarters, GOP outside groups are funneling in over $40 MILLION to attack me. And you can bet that this powerful show of grassroots strength from our supporters will only spur Mitch McConnell and his billionaire allies to ratchet up their efforts to buy this seat.
Because the GOP knows what we know: Democrats have ZERO chance of taking back the Senate if we lose in Michigan. So I’ll say it again: We can’t slow down -- especially with our final end-of-month fundraising deadline TONIGHT.
With only THREE days left and recent polls showing our race within the margin of error, friend, will you rush $3 or more right now -- every dollar you can -- to win in Michigan and take back Senate control for Democrats?

This is important, team: Ballots are being cast all over Michigan, which means this election is officially underway.
But with only weeks left to make sure we win in Michigan, a recent poll shows me trailing by nearly 2 points. That means we have just 32 days to defend this seat, take back Senate control from Mitch McConnell and protect the future of the Supreme Court.

"Friend,
Four. That’s how many times in the history of this country we’ve faced a Supreme Court vacancy within four months of a presidential election.
Zero. That’s how many times these vacancies were filled before Election Day.
But Donald Trump and Senate Republicans are recklessly disregarding this precedent. Instead they’re laser-focused on rushing through a nominee for a lifetime appointment, instead of addressing the urgent issues Michigan working families are facing.
Friend, we’re just eight days from Election Day, and already over two million Michiganders have voted – with many more voting in the days ahead. It’s simply unacceptable that Michiganders aren’t getting a say in who nominates and confirms the next Justice to our nation’s highest court.
Today I will vote No on Trump’s Supreme Court nomination. And it’s never been more clear that we MUST take back the Senate from Mitch McConnell and Republicans in eight days’ time – but we can’t do it without Michigan. So I’m asking today: Will you help us reach our emergency goal of $500,000 before 11:59 p.m. to get the resources we need to defend this seat from my Trump- and McConnell-backed opponent?

The fact that Michiganders are being denied the opportunity to have their voices heard is simply unacceptable, friend. We all deserve better, and our country’s future is at stake in Michigan this election year.
Senate Republicans are denying Michiganders the opportunity to have their voices heard, and I won’t stand for it. We all deserve better, and our country’s future is at stake in Michigan this election year.
Thank you for standing with me in this fight,
Gary

"Here's what you need right now to know about my race:
* Our opponent John James, a hard-right extremist who says he backs Trump “2000%” and has Trump's ""total and complete endorsement”, outraised us four of the last five quarters.
* Not only that, James has Republicans including Donald Trump, the DeVos family, Mitch McConnell, and a Koch family PAC funneling in OVER $40 MILLION to buy this seat for the GOP.
* Donald Trump is holding FIVE campaign rallies in Michigan in the last week of this race because he knows that whoever wins in Michigan will win control of the Senate -- and the White House.
I’ll be blunt with you: I was the ONLY Democratic senator who was outraised this summer, and Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight reports Democrats have ZERO chance to take back the Senate if we lose in Michigan.
With just two days left in this race, the stakes have never been higher. So I'm asking you directly: Will you contribute $3 or more now -- whatever you can spare -- to win in Michigan and take back Senate control from Mitch McConnell?

Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Friend: CBS is reporting that the next two years of Senate control all hinge on what happens in Michigan.
That's why Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump have helped funnel millions to buy Michigan's Senate seat. They know winning in Michigan means expanding the GOP's hold on the Senate and on the Supreme Court.
But right now, polling has Gary Peters TIED with his Trump-backed extremist opponent.
Democrats CANNOT take back the Senate without winning in Michigan, but we’re already falling short of what we MUST raise before our end-of-quarter deadline.
We can’t win if we miss our fundraising goal, friend. What you do right now can help decide the fate of Senate control: So please, will you rush $3 or more to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

"Winning the Senate majority hinges on winning Michigan.
Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
This is it, friend. These next few days won't just decide who wins Michigan's Senate seat: They'll decide who controls the Senate for years to come – and we CANNOT afford to let Mitch McConnell keep his majority.
So we just made our last HUGE ad buy of this race. But right now, we're running out of funding to keep these ads on the air during this pivotal GOTV weekend, and we urgently need another $500,000 to keep them going.
With a recent New York Times poll showing a massive amount of undecided Michigan voters and Trump, McConnell and the DeVos family funneling in TENS OF MILLIONS to buy this seat, the ONLY way to ensure we can win this neck-and-neck race is to close our fundraising gap ASAP.
Winning the Senate majority hinges on winning Michigan, and we've only got DAYS left to make that happen. Your donation right now could make the difference, so please, will you rush $3 to win in Michigan and take back the Senate?

Hey team,

Can we count on you to chip in for the first time? Here’s a link: [[URL REDACTED]]

Breaking news, team: Donald Trump is headed back to Michigan TOMORROW.
Trump’s already funneled MILLIONS of dollars toward buying this seat for my far-right opponent – and now his team is returning for their ninth campaign visit because he KNOWS Michigan is the tipping point of Senate control.
Friend, Trump's visit tomorrow could make all the difference in this razor-thin race. After being outraised for over a year, a new poll shows our team trailing by 2 points, and RealClearPolitics just moved this race from “Leans Dem” to “Toss-Up.”
Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight reports the ONLY way Democrats can take back the Senate is if we win in Michigan, so a group of donors has offered to DOUBLE every dollar we raise leading up to Trump’s visit tomorrow – up to $50,000.
With just 55 days until Election Day and Senate control on the line, we cannot afford to miss out on this critical match and risk losing this seat. Will you rush a contribution of $3 or more now – and have every dollar DOUBLED – to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

We can win in Michigan – but only if supporters like you take advantage of critical moments like these to double your impact in this race.

"It's not all good news.
Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Team, this is record-breaking: Over 1.5 million Michiganders have already cast their ballots.
But it's not all good news: A recent New York Times poll shows me leading my Trump-backed opponent by just 1 point – with 13% of voters still undecided!
Nate's Silver's FiveThirtyEight says Democrats have ZERO chance to take back the Senate if we lose in Michigan. But Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and the DeVos family are funneling in tens of millions of dollars to buy this seat.
With less than two weeks to turn this around, my team has launched a GOTV Emergency Fund to raise $250,000 to accelerate our voter mobilization efforts and reach undecided voters.
It's an ambitious goal, but after my far-right opponent outraised us four out of the last five quarters, we don't have any other options. We're still falling $86,312 short of what we need before 11:59 p.m. to stay on track to win, so I'm asking you personally:
Please, friend, will you contribute $3 or more right now to help us defeat my Trump-backed opponent, flip the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

"My extreme opponent just announced he broke fundraising records
Friend: My extreme opponent outraised me for a FIFTH consecutive reporting period thanks to Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and Betsy DeVos funneling MILLIONS into Michigan to defeat me.
That’s why I’m asking for your help – but first, I’d like to explain why it’s so important we defend Michigan’s Democratic Senate seat.
With a vacancy on the Supreme Court, the stakes have never been higher. If we lose here, Democrats will throw away our only chance of taking back the Senate. That means two more years of Mitch McConnell calling the shots in Washington.
I've won tough elections before, and I'm all in to do it again this time around. But  a brand-new poll shows me behind my far-right opponent, and analysts at The Washington Post rank me as one of the most targeted Democratic senators in the country.
The good news is Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight reports Democrats can flip the Senate, but only if we first win in Michigan.
So with the future of the Senate and the Supreme Court on the line, in a race this close, every dollar could be the difference between winning and losing. We set a goal to raise another $200,000 before our final FEC quarterly filing deadline to win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats -- but right now we're still $91,351 short. I'd appreciate it if you could give now, even just $3, to help us hit this goal and win.
Here's the best link to donate – whatever you give will go toward keeping Michigan blue and taking back the Senate for Democrats: [[URL REDACTED]]

"just heard from our finance team
I just heard from our finance team, and I have to be honest with you, friend: Our fundraising is just not where it needs to be if we want to stay on track to win. We're currently being outspent at the worst moment – right when a brand-new poll shows me statistically TIED with my far-right opponent.
My opponent – who says he backs Donald Trump “2000%” – outraised us five times in a row thanks to Trump, McConnell and the DeVos family funneling tens of millions of dollars into Michigan to buy this seat for the GOP. And if we don't close our funding gap now, with Michiganders already casting their ballots, he could pull ahead in the polls for good.
Simply put, friend? We cannot allow that to happen. RealClearPolitics moved our race from “Leans Dem” to “Toss Up” – and in tight races like this, every single dollar makes a difference. With Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight reporting Democrats have ZERO chance to take back the Senate if we lose in Michigan, what we do in moments like this could decide whether Mitch McConnell keeps his grip on the Senate.
We're beginning a mad dash to the finish line, and we need to show my opponent – and his wealthy backers – that we're here to win. So with only 27 days until the election, we set a goal to raise $20,000 – but right now we're falling $13,720 short, and I'm counting on you to help us catch up.
Will you contribute $3 or more now – anything you can spare – to win in Michigan, flip the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court from Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell?

"Friend, the stakes could not be higher.
With a vacancy on the Supreme Court, health care protections for pre-existing conditions, Roe v. Wade and women’s health care, civil rights, voting rights, and workers’ rights are on the line. Michiganders started casting their ballots last week and deserve to have their voices heard. There should NOT be a Supreme Court appointment until the next presidential term begins.
But just weeks before an election, Donald Trump announced his nominee to fill the vacancy. Now, Mitch McConnell said that she will receive a vote on the Senate floor in the weeks ahead, BEFORE the American people have their say.
The Supreme Court is on the ballot this November, friend. And with analysts at CBS News reporting that Michigan’s Senate race will decide Senate control, we’ll have ZERO chance of taking back the Senate from McConnell and protecting the Supreme Court if we lose this seat.
That’s why Trump, McConnell and their Republican allies are funnelling TENS of MILLIONS of dollars to buy this seat -- and after weeks of nonstop GOP attacks against me, a recent poll shows my Trump- and McConnell-backed opponent in the lead by TWO POINTS.
Keeping Michigan blue and flipping the Senate has never been more important -- that’s why my team and I have set a $200,000 rapid-response goal by our final FEC quarterly filing deadline next week.

"CBS is reporting that the next two years of Senate control all hinge on what happens in Michigan.
Friend: CBS is reporting that the next two years of Senate control all hinge on what happens in Michigan.
That's why Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump have helped funnel millions to buy Michigan's Senate seat. They know winning in Michigan means expanding the GOP's control over the Senate and on the Supreme Court.
But right now, polling has Gary Peters nearly TWO POINTS BEHIND his Trump-backed extremist opponent.
Democrats CANNOT take back the Senate without winning in Michigan. That's why it's crucial that we hit every fundraising target between now and Election Day -- but right now we're falling short of what we need to raise today.
We can’t win without hitting this goal, friend. What you do right now can help decide the fate of Senate control: So please, will you rush $3 or more to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

"Take a look at what we’re up against:
BREAKING:  Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight just predicted that Gary’s opponent is  “within striking distance” of winning Michigan’s Senate Race -- after reporting that Democrats have ZERO chance of taking back the Senate if Gary loses.
That’s why GOP billionaires are teaming up  right now to prop up Gary’s opponent. In just the last two weeks:
* The  DeVos family super PAC increased their spending to a total of over  $6 million  in TV ads attacking Gary.
* A Koch family super PAC just endorsed Gary's opponent and flooded Michigan with a six-figure ad buy!
* Mitch McConnell's super PAC announced plans to funnel  $9 million  into the Michigan senate race.
This onslaught of GOP ads and endorsements is tipping the scales. After RealClearPolitics moved this race from “Lean Dem” to “Toss Up,” a brand-new internal poll from our opponent shows this race STATISTICALLY TIED.
The GOP is surging in Michigan, and how we respond right now could determine what happens to Gary’s seat AND the Senate majority. We set a goal to raise $50,000 by the weekend -- and we just can’t fall short.  Will you contribute $3 or more now – every dollar you can spare – to fight back against GOP spending in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats, and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

Friend: Our country cannot take two more years of Mitch McConnell's control over the Senate – but Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight says that's exactly what will happen if we lose in Michigan.
And with recent polls showing Gary nearly TWO POINTS behind his far-right opponent, Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and the DeVos family are funneling over $40 million into Michigan to buy this seat and tighten the GOP's hold on the Senate.
With control of the Senate on the line, we simply CANNOT let Trump and McConnell buy Michigan's Democratic Senate seat.

"We urgently need to hold Betsy DeVos accountable.
Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Friend,
I grew up going to Michigan’s public schools. And as the son of a hardworking public school teacher, I know just how important education is. That’s why I’ve been so troubled with Betsy DeVos' job as secretary of education.
Since becoming our country’s education secretary, Betsy DeVos has done nothing but cater to wealthy interests, putting greedy corporations above our students and teachers.
And on top of that, Betsy DeVos threatened to withhold funding from schools that don’t reopen. She even refused to say whether schools should listen to CDC guidelines in the middle of a global pandemic.
We need to be guided by public health, science and facts on the ground — not politics. This is about the safety of our kids, teachers, school staff and families. Join me in calling for an education secretary who actually puts our students first.
Friend, if you agree, add your name now to denounce Betsy DeVos and demand a better education secretary for our students.
Sign the Petition
Thank you so much, friend, for standing with me for what’s right.
Gary

"The most important race happening in 2020 is for control of the Senate.
Friend,
Gary Peters' reelection to the Senate this fall in Michigan will be one of the closest races this November -- and guess who has their thumb on the scale. The DeVos family -- i.e., the family of Betsy DeVos, Secretary of Education -- is hoping they can buy this Senate seat in Michigan by spending almost $1 million to unseat my friend Gary and put in his place their hand-picked choice, John James.
We already know how dangerous the DeVos family has been, and the super PAC ""Better Future Michigan"" wants nothing of the sort: It has 23 donors. Who are they? More than a quarter are members of the DeVos family. What's more,  the super PAC is spending over $7 million on TV ads against us.
Gary is a fighter for Michigan and my progressive ally in the Senate, and he needs our help: Before midnight tonight, we need to raise $7,500 for Gary Peters -- and I'll be honest: I've looked at the map, and I can't see how we take the majority if we lose this seat. Donate $3 or more now to fund the fight to reelect Gary and fight back against the DeVos family's dangerous plans for Michigan.

Why is the DeVos family so invested in unseating Gary Peters? Well, for one he's taking on Betsy DeVos and her wasteful spending at the Department of Education -- he pressed for answers back in December as to why 72 charter schools in Michigan never opened despite receiving nearly $21 million in federal start-up funds.
Gary believes like I do that students and families come first -- and for all the charter schools that closed or failed to open, communities missed out on more than half a billion dollars in resources that could have benefitted neighborhood schools. Gary knows her leadership is leaving students and families worse off -- and her family wants him out because of it.
They know he's watching and fighting for teachers, students, and families -- and they're scared. That's why their hand-picked choice to unseat Gary, John James, said Betsy DeVos is doing a ""very, very good"" job as Secretary of Education. John James supports Betsy DeVos even as she planned to cut $9 billion in funding for education, including more than $100 million for Michigan's public schools.
After spending millions to gut Michigan's public school programs, and bigger plans to do more, she can't even say if it was worth it. On whether local schools in Michigan have gotten better, she said: ""I don't know. Overall, I -- I can't say overall.""
Republican outside groups including the DeVos family super PAC are dumping nearly $30 million into this race -- but it'll get even closer, and that's why Gary needs our help: Donate $3 or more now to help us raise $10,000 for Gary Peters before midnight tonight.
Sincerely,
Chuck Schumer

"Friend,
There’s no doubt that Michigan will be the state to determine whether Mitch McConnell continues to run the Senate. Both CBS News and Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight are reporting that Democrats can only win back the Senate if we first win in Michigan, so we need to secure this seat to ensure victory in November.
The GOP knows that the road to the Senate runs through Michigan, so they’re pulling out all the stops to try and buy this seat. That means millions of dollars are flooding into our state with the help of Donald Trump, Betsy DeVos' family and the Koch brothers (among other far-right billionaires), and I’m now the most-attacked Democratic senator up this year. Even worse, Mitch McConnell's super PAC just announced it will be spending $9 MILLION in Michigan.
I don’t scare easily, friend — the Republican Party can throw everything they want at me and I’ll never waver in my fight for Michigan’s working families. But we’re up against some serious money, and recent polls have me behind my Trump-backed opponent.
It’s never been more important for our team of grassroots donors to step up. We’re still falling short of our $300,000 emergency-response goal — can I count on you to make a contribution of $3 or more right now?

"Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
BREAKING NEWS, friend: Mitch McConnell’s dark money group just launched $4.5 MILLION in attack ads against Gary Peters – the LARGEST Republican ad buy of this race.
This RECORD-BREAKING right-wing spending comes right after our race was downgraded from “Leans Dem” to “Toss Up” and new polling showed Gary and his Trump-backed opponent in a statistical TIE.
We need to counter these new attacks right away – but Gary doesn’t have far-right special interests on his side, he has people like you. It’s why we’re launching an emergency response fund to raise $45,000.

This is really bad news friend: The Michigan Senate race rating just downgraded from Lean Democratic to TOSS UP.
This is one of the most alarming developments in our campaign yet -- and could risk our chance to flip the Senate.
On top of that, Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight and CBS News analysts say the future of the Senate will be decided in Michigan.
What’s worse: John James has OUTRAISED Gary Peters four quarters in a row and his growing fundraising edge is now putting us at risk of LOSING this race and taking back the Senate for Democrats.
And with recent polls showing us TWO POINTS BEHIND, we need all hands on deck to hit a $15,000 rapid-response goal by midnight tonight -- but we’re already falling short.
Friend -- we’re running out of time before Election Day. Please rush an emergency gift of $5 or more right now to fight back against GOP spending in Michigan, defend Michigan's Senate seat and take back the Senate for Democrats!

"With just over a month left in this race, we’re in the final stretch to make up ground on the cash disadvantage we have compared to our far-right opponent.
In fact, Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight reports Democrats have ZERO chance to take back the Senate if we lose in Michigan. So the time to act is now: We only have 32 days left to ensure Democrats remove Mitch McConnell as Majority Leader -- and with the Supreme Court on the line, we have no time to waste. Rush $5 or more now to help win in Michigan and take back the Senate.
The truth is, after falling short of our final end-of-quarter goal, we’re considering making unexpected cuts to our campaign budget -- right at the tipping point of this election.
We always knew it would be tough going up against GOP billionaires like Betsy DeVos’ family -- but with TENS of MILLIONS of dollars being poured into ads attacking Gary and polls now showing Gary’s opponent in the lead, this is the worst time to be scaling back our efforts.
Gary was the ONLY Democratic Senator to be outraised this summer -- and if we don’t make up ground right now, the consequence could be two more years of Mitch McConnell controlling the U.S. Senate and the future of the Supreme Court.
So we’re turning to our top supporters during this urgent moment:
We can’t flip the Senate without winning in Michigan, and we can’t win in Michigan without YOU.  Will you rush a contribution of $5 or more now -- anything you can spare -- to flip the Senate for Democrats?

"Friends: My extreme opponent has outraised me AGAIN thanks to Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and Betsy DeVos funneling MILLIONS into Michigan to defeat me.
That’s why I’m asking for your help – but first, I’d like to explain why it’s so important we defend Michigan’s Democratic Senate seat.
If we lose here, Democrats will throw away our only chance of taking back the Senate. That means two more years of Mitch McConnell calling the shots in Washington. That means he and Donald Trump will team up to put more extremist justices like Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court, and you can bet they’ll keep trying to dismantle protections for those with preexisting conditions.
I've won tough elections before, and I'm all in to do it again this time around. But polling shows me statistically tied with my opponent, and analysts at The Washington Post rank me as one of the most targeted Democratic senators in the country.
The good news is Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight reports Democrats can flip the Senate, but only if we first win in Michigan.
So with the future of the Senate on the line, in a race this close, every dollar could be the difference between winning and losing. We've set a goal to raise another $7,500 before midnight tonight to win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats. I'd appreciate it if you could give now, even just $3, to help us hit this goal and win.

Team: CBS News reports Democrats have ZERO chance to flip the Senate if we lose in Michigan, and right now a recent poll shows Gary Peters trailing by nearly two points against his hard-right extremist opponent.
Gary has been outraised for over a year because Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and the DeVos family are funneling MILLIONS to buy this seat for the GOP.
And now it's clear the GOP dark-money war chest is making a difference: RealClearPolitics just moved this race from “Leans Dem” to “Toss Up” – and CNN just said Michigan is one of the TOP seats most likely to flip parties in November.
Gary was the ONLY Democratic senator to be outraised last quarter, so  with under seven weeks left in this race, we need to raise another $8,530 today to stay on track to win – but right now we’re falling short.

Friend --
John James will be a GREAT Senator for Michigan! - Donald Trump
That’s what Donald Trump tweeted, officially endorsing GOP Senate candidate John James, who is trying unseat my colleague Gary Peters.
Big-money Republicans are funneling millions into Michigan, and it’s working: Gary was outraised last quarter, and the Cook Political Report has moved Gary’s race from “Likely” to “Lean Democrat.”
Polls in Michigan have the race as a statistical tie -- and if we don’t defend this Senate seat, we cannot take back the Senate this November. Gary needs our help now: Will you donate $3 or more to re-elect Gary Peters in Michigan, and protect this seat from right-wing Republicans?
If you've saved payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Donate $3
Donate $25
Donate $50
Rush another amount
The facts are pretty clear here -- and they’re also pretty scary:
* Nate Silver says if Republicans can win in Michigan this year, they can keep control of the Senate.
* CBS agrees -- and says Gary’s seat could be THE race that decides control of the Senate.
* And after Trump won Michigan in 2016, CNBC rated Gary as one of the most vulnerable Democrats up for reelection this year.
My friend and colleague Gary is focused on strengthening our middle class by protecting access to quality, affordable health care, preparing our kids for the jobs of tomorrow, and helping small businesses grow.
This is the leadership Michigan needs, and this is the Democratic leadership America needs -- we need to keep this Senate seat, and we need to flip the Senate. Your donation of $3 or more right now could do exactly that: Will you donate right now to support Gary Peters’ reelection in Michigan?
Sincerely,
Chuck Schumer

"This is really bad news friend: The Michigan Senate race rating just downgraded from Lean Democratic to TOSS UP.
This is one of the most alarming developments in our campaign yet -- and could risk our chance to flip the Senate.
On top of that, Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight and CBS News analysts say the future of the Senate will be decided in Michigan.
What’s worse: John James has OUTRAISED Gary Peters four quarters in a row and his growing fundraising edge is now putting us at risk of LOSING this race and taking back the Senate for Democrats.
And with polls showing us TIED, we need all hands on deck to hit a $30,000 rapid-response goal by midnight tonight -- but we’re already falling short.
Friend -- we’re running out of time before Election Day. Please rush an emergency gift of $5 or more right now to fight back against GOP spending in Michigan, defend Michigan's Senate seat and take back the Senate for Democrats!

Team – we need you to read this:
First: Trump and his allies funneled MILLIONS of dollars toward buying Gary’s seat to keep their hold on the Senate.
Then: The DeVos family Super PAC announced they’re funneling $1.6 million worth of ads into Michigan to help our far-right opponent.
Now: A brand new poll shows Gary BEHIND his right-wing opponent by nearly  TWO POINTS  – AND Trump is coming to Michigan TOMORROW to double down and flip this seat.
Trump's visit tomorrow could make all the difference in this razor-thin race. After being outraised for over a year and RealClearPolitics moving this race from “Leans Dem” to “Toss-Up”,  we simply can’t afford to miss out on today’s critical match opportunity.
Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight reports the ONLY way Democrats can take back the Senate is if we win in Michigan, so a group of donors has offered to DOUBLE every dollar donated today:  Will you rush a contribution of $3 or more now – and have every dollar DOUBLED – to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

FIRST: Thanks to Trump and McConnell-aligned forces funneling money into Michigan, our right-wing opponent outraised Gary -- for the third quarter in a row!

Friend: With the help of Donald Trump and Betsy DeVos' family, my extreme right-wing opponent has outraised us – for the FIFTH reporting period in a row. The GOP has dumped MILLIONS of dollars into the Michigan race to buy this Senate seat, defeat me and guarantee a Senate majority for Mitch McConnell.
Friend, here’s the good news: Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight reports Democrats can take back the Senate! But our only path to Senate control starts with winning here in Michigan, and recent polling has me TWO POINTS BEHIND my Trump-backed opponent.
With analysts at CBS News reporting that Michigan could decide Senate control, we’ve set a goal to raise $14,000 but right now, we’re falling short of what we need to win.
Simply put, in a race this close, with our democracy at stake, falling short could very well cost Democrats our chance to take back the Senate.

Friend: CBS is reporting that the next two years of Senate control all hinge on what happens in Michigan.
That's why Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump have helped funnel millions to buy Michigan's Senate seat. They know winning in Michigan means tightening the GOP's grip on the Senate and on the Supreme Court.
But right now, polling has Gary Peters TWO POINTS BEHIND his Trump-backed extremist opponent -- and CNN is reporting that Gary's seat is one of the most likely to flip.
Democrats CANNOT take back the Senate without winning in Michigan -- but we’ll fall short on resources if we don't raise another $13,692 by 11:59 p.m. TONIGHT.
We can’t win without supporters like you, friend. What you do right now can help decide the fate of Senate control: So please, will you rush $3 or more to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

"Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Folks--
After Donald Trump came to Michigan this weekend, you can bet wealthy donors were ready to funnel money straight into my opponent’s pockets.
That’s not all: With just 15 days to go, a brand new poll shows us trailing by TWO points behind our Trump-backed opponent.
And this close to Election Day, we cannot take any chances because Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight says Democrats have ZERO chance to take back the Senate if we lose in Michigan.
That’s why a generous group of donors just stepped up to match all donations – up to $250,000! But here’s the catch: It’s the FINAL match of our campaign.
Right now, every dollar you give will be DOUBLED -- but this is your last chance to have a donation matched. And with voting already underway, we don't have much time left to regain the lead.
Please, friend, will you pitch in $3 or more now – every dollar you can spare – and have your first gift DOUBLED to win in Michigan, take back the Senate and protect the future of the Supreme Court from Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell?
If you've saved payment info with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:

Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
I have bad news to share with you, friend: We just got outraised by my GOP opponent for the FIFTH time in a row.
This couldn’t have come at a worse time: I was the only Democratic senator to be outraised last quarter, and our race just moved from “Lean Democrat” to “Toss Up”. And a brand new poll from today shows I’m in a statistical tie with my Trump- and McConnell-backed opponent.
We have to kick this campaign into high gear right now, because Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight reports that Democrats have ZERO chance to take back the Senate if we lose in Michigan. And with Donald Trump, McConnell and the DeVos family pumping in millions to buy this Senate seat, we can't afford to be outraised again.
Helping Michigan families is the greatest honor I've ever had, and I will NOT let a right-wing extremist take this seat without a fight. So I need you fighting with me, because we won't win in Michigan – or take back the Senate – if we continue to fall behind in fundraising.
That’s why my team set our biggest end-of-month goal of the campaign so far: to raise $100,000 immediately to close this gap. But as I write this, we’re already falling way short.
Our opponent has millions of dollars in GOP special-interest money backing him – but I’ve got grassroots supporters like you. So, I’m asking you now: Before 11:59 p.m., will you rush a gift of $3 or more now to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

"My extreme opponent just announced he broke fundraising records
Friend: My extreme opponent has outraised me AGAIN thanks to Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and Betsy DeVos funneling MILLIONS into Michigan to defeat me.
That’s why I’m asking for your help – but first, I’d like to explain why it’s so important we defend Michigan’s Democratic Senate seat.
If we lose here, Democrats will throw away our only chance of taking back the Senate. That means two more years of Mitch McConnell calling the shots in Washington. That means he and Donald Trump will team up to put more extremist justices like Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court, and you can bet they’ll keep trying to dismantle protections for those with preexisting conditions.
I've won tough elections before, and I'm all in to do it again this time around. But  new polling shows me two points behind my opponent,  and analysts at The Washington Post rank me as one of the most targeted Democratic senators in the country.
The good news is Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight reports Democrats can flip the Senate, but only if we first win in Michigan.
So with the future of the Senate on the line, in a race this close, every dollar could be the difference between winning and losing. We've set a goal to raise another $8,260 before midnight tonight to win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats. I'd appreciate it if you could give now, even just $3, to help us hit this goal and win.

* Our opponent John James, a hard-right extremist who says he backs Trump “2000%” and has Trump's ""total and complete endorsement”, has now outraised us four quarters in a row -- and counting.
* Not only that, James has Donald Trump, Betsy DeVos’ family, Mitch McConnell and now a Koch family PAC funneling in MILLIONS  to buy this seat for the GOP.
* RealClearPolitics just moved this race from “Lean Dem” to “Toss Up” – and a new poll shows us trailing TWO POINTS BEHIND James.

"Here’s an update on the Michigan senate race by the numbers:
* Our race is projected to spend over $100 million.
* McConnell, Trump and DeVos family aligned groups are spending nearly $30 million.
* This is shaping up to be the most expensive Senate race in Michigan history.
GOP mega-donors are spending millions on this race because they know the same thing we do: Democrats can’t regain control of the Senate without winning in Michigan.
All eyes are on our race because experts at CBS and Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight agree that Michigan will decide Senate control in this election.
That’s why we set an emergency goal to raise $50,000 before midnight to help close this spending gap -- and we can’t afford to fall short, especially as Michiganders are already casting their ballots and new polling shows Gary statistically tied with his far-right opponent.

This couldn’t have come at a worse time: I was the only Democratic senator to be outraised this summer, and experts at RealClearPolitics have moved our race from “Lean Democrat” to “Toss Up”. Now, recent polls show I’m in a statistical tie with my Trump- and McConnell-backed opponent.
We have to kick this campaign into high gear right now, because Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight reports that Democrats have ZERO chance to take back the Senate if we lose in Michigan. And with Donald Trump, McConnell and the DeVos family pumping in millions to buy this Senate seat, we can't afford to be outraised again.
Helping Michigan families is the greatest honor I've ever had, and I will NOT let a right-wing extremist take this seat without a fight. So I need you fighting with me, because we won't win in Michigan – or take back the Senate – if we continue to fall behind in fundraising.
That’s why my team set an emergency goal to raise $20,000 immediately to close this gap. But as I write this, we’re already falling way short.
Our opponent has millions of dollars in GOP special-interest money backing him – but I’ve got grassroots supporters like you. So, I’m asking you now: Before 11:59 p.m., will you rush a gift of $3 or more now to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

"Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Friend: Right now is one of the best times for you to chip in for the first time to Gary’s campaign. Will you let us explain?
Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight and CBS News analysts say the future of the Senate will be decided in Michigan. But the Michigan Senate race rating was recently downgraded from Lean Democratic to TOSS UP \-- putting our chance to flip the Senate this year at risk.
On top of that, our opponent has OUTRAISED us FIVE TIMES in a row \-- and he could do it again for the last quarter of this race.
It’s why we MUST hit our $100,000 end-of-month grassroots goal. With the future of the Senate and the Supreme Court on the line, we really need supporters like you to chip in for the first time right now.
Friend -- we’re running out of time. Please rush an emergency gift of $3 or more right now to fight back against GOP spending in Michigan, defend Michigan's Senate seat and take back the Senate for Democrats!

"Here's what you need right now to know about my race:
* Our opponent John James, a hard-right extremist who says he backs Trump “2000%” and has Trump's ""total and complete endorsement”, has now outraised us four quarters in a row -- and counting.
* Not only that, James has Donald Trump, Betsy DeVos’ family, Mitch McConnell and now a Koch family PAC funneling in TENS of MILLIONS to buy this seat for the GOP.
* It was just reported that our Senate race will be the most expensive election in Michigan's history.
I’ll be blunt with you: I was the ONLY Democratic senator who was outraised this summer, and Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight reports Democrats have ZERO chance to take back the Senate if we lose in Michigan. That’s why we set an 11:59 p.m. deadline to raise another $50,000 – but we’re already falling WAY short of what we need to win.
With voters already casting their ballots, this cannot wait. So I'm asking you directly: Will you contribute $3 or more now – every dollar you can spare – to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court from Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump?

"Team: With over TWO MILLION Michiganders already casting their ballots, recent polling shows Gary Peters nearly two points BEHIND his Trump-backed opponent.
Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight and CBS News analysts report Democrats have ZERO chance to take back the Senate if we lose in Michigan.
That's why Trump, McConnell and the DeVos family are funneling over $30 MILLION into Michigan to buy this seat for Mitch McConnell and Senate Republicans.
What's more, Trump is coming back to Michigan TOMORROW -- in the crucial FINAL WEEK of this race. Simply put, how we respond now could decide the future of the Senate and the Supreme Court.

"DeVos is abusing our taxpayer money, and we urgently need to hold her accountable.
Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Friend,
I grew up going to Michigan’s public schools. And as the son of a hardworking public school teacher, I know just how important education is. That’s why I’ve been so troubled with Betsy DeVos' job as secretary of education.
Since becoming our country’s education secretary, Betsy DeVos has done nothing but cater to wealthy interests, putting greedy corporations above our students and teachers.
She’s even drained over half a BILLION dollars of taxpayer money into sham charter schools that closed or never opened – many of which were right here in Michigan.
DeVos is abusing our taxpayer money, and we urgently need to hold her accountable. That’s why I need another 694 supporters like you to stand with me against Betsy DeVos’ misconduct – so join me in calling for an education secretary who actually puts our students first.
Friend, if you care about the quality of our students' education, add your name now to denounce Betsy DeVos and demand a better education secretary for our students.
Sign the Petition
Michigan’s students need a leader who will advocate for their success – and Betsy DeVos is robbing them of their chances at a world-class education. Thank you so much, friend, for standing with me for what’s right.

"I was the only Democratic senator to be outraised last quarter.
Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Folks -- I want to make sure you got my note yesterday. Last quarter, I was the only Democratic senator to be outraised -- and even worse? It was by over $1 million.
We’ve set a goal to raise $50,000 but we’re falling behind. Can you chip in any amount right now to make sure I’m not outraised again?
Thank you,
Gary
\----Forwarded message----
There's no way of sugarcoating this, friend: I was the only Democratic senator to be outraised last quarter – and this makes it the fourth straight reporting period that our Trump- and DeVos-backed opponent has outraised us. Friend, it couldn't have come at a worse time, with polls showing our race in a statistical tie.
With analysts at CBS News reporting that Michigan’s Senate race will decide Senate control, we’ll have zero chance of taking back the Senate if we lose this seat. It's why right-wing interests from Donald Trump to Mitch McConnell to the DeVos family are funneling in millions to buy this Senate seat.
I’m no stranger to tough fights: Fighting for the people of Michigan is the greatest honor of my life, and I do not plan on ceding this seat to a right-wing extremist.
But if we're going to win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats, we CANNOT afford to keep being outraised. That's why my team set a rapid-response goal to raise $50,000 immediately to make up our shortfall, but right now, we're falling short of what we need to win.
Our opponent has the full force of GOP special interests behind him – but I have you. So I'm asking: Before midnight, can I count on you to contribute $3 or more now – every dollar you can spare – to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

\----Forwarded message----
Team, last night, Donald Trump was in Michigan because he knows the White House, Senate control and the future of the Supreme Court all depend on who wins here.
And while Trump was in Michigan drawing nationwide attention – and GOP donors – to this race, we got some bad news: We fell short of our $50,000 midnight match goal by just $6,432.
This is deeply concerning. Trump has already funneled MILLIONS of dollars into this race to buy Michigan's Senate seat, and for the past year,
Gary's been outraised by his far-right opponent every step of the way.
Even more concerning? It's making an impact: CNN is now saying Michigan’s Democratic Senate seat is one of the “most likely to flip"" in November – and a new poll shows Gary trailing by nearly 2 points.
But, team, we have some good news: Yesterday's match donors offered to extend the match to help us hit our goal – but only until midnight tonight. Our chances of winning could hinge on how we respond in moments like these, and with ballots being mailed out in Michigan in just two weeks, we're running out of time:
Will you make a contribution now – and have every dollar DOUBLED – to help win in Michigan, take back the Senate and protect the future of the Supreme Court from Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell?

"13% of Michigan voters are still undecided.
BREAKING FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES:
13% of Michigan voters undecided on Michigan’s Senate race
Early voting is off the charts with over TWO MILLION ballots already returned in Michigan. But with polls showing Gary Peters two points BEHIND with his far-right opponent, 13% of voters are still undecided!
This election won’t be decided on Nov. 3 – it’s being decided RIGHT NOW. But with Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and the DeVos family funneling TENS of MILLIONS of dollars into Michigan to buy this seat, CNN is calling Gary's Senate seat one of the most likely to FLIP.
With voting already underway and only ONE WEEK left in this race, we don't have much time left to regain the lead, so we're counting on supporters like you to chip in before it's too late.
Please, friend, EVERYTHING depends on what we do right now: Can you make a $3 contribution now -- every dollar you can spare before 11:59 p.m. -- to help Gary get out the vote and win in Michigan, take back the Senate and protect the future of the Supreme Court from Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell?

"period.
Friend: Despite unprecedented support for our campaign in Michigan, my opponent has outraised us four out of the last five quarters. This is all thanks to Donald Trump funneling MILLIONS into Michigan to defeat me and buy this seat to expand Mitch McConnell’s majority in the Senate.
They know that Democrats have ZERO chance of taking back the Senate if we lose in Michigan. And now, a new poll from the New York Times shows me just ONE POINT ahead of my Trump-backed opponent.
Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight reports that Democrats can take back the Senate, but we must first win in Michigan. That's why we set a goal of raising $20,000 TODAY – and with Michiganders already casting their ballots by the thousands, we can't afford to fall short.
Friend, in a race this close, whether or not we hit this goal could determine Senate control, so we're counting on your immediate contribution:

First: Trump and his allies funneled MILLIONS of dollars toward buying Gary’s seat to keep their grip on the Senate.
Then: The DeVos family Super PAC announced they’re spending $4 million  on ads in Michigan attacking Gary.
Now: Trump gave Gary's opponent his ""total and compete endorsement"" and now, polling shows Gary behind his right-wing opponent by nearly  TWO POINTS.

* John James, a hard-right extremist who says he backs Trump “2000%” and has Trump's ""total and complete endorsement"" won the GOP primary to take on Democrat Sen. Gary Peters.

Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Do you have plans on October 13th, friend?
I’d like to invite you to spend the evening with me and Senator Gary Peters for a conversation about how we win Michigan, flip the Senate and more.
Gary and I are hosting a virtual grassroots fundraiser on October 13th, at 7:30 p.m. ET. Chip in any amount (even his average online gift of just $24), and you can tune in. Can I count on your RSVP?

I'm grateful for everything you've already done to support Gary and keep Michigan blue, and I'd be honored if you joined us at this special event.
Let me be clear: We've got to do everything we can to defend Gary’s seat and make sure Democrats take back the Senate and protect the future of the Supreme Court, because now more than ever, the future of our country is on the line.
The GOP is doing whatever they can to buy Michigan’s Senate seat -- including Betsy DeVos’ family pouring nearly one million dollars into attack ads against Gary -- because they know if they flip Michigan, they’ll hand Mitch McConnell control of the Senate for another two years.
But if we come together, we can make sure Gary gets another six years fighting for Michigan’s working families in the U.S. Senate.
You won’t hear him brag about it, but I will: Gary is a fifth-generation Michigander who’s poured his heart into the fight to protect the Great Lakes, defend protections for people with pre-existing health conditions, lower prescription drug costs and expand quality, affordable health care.
November’s election will determine who will represent Michiganders in the halls of Congress: A proven and effective leader like Gary -- or his extremist far-right opponent who stands with Trump “2000%” including gutting health care protections for 1.7 million Michiganders with pre-existing conditions.
We have a real chance to reelect Gary and flip the Senate this year -- but we can’t afford to leave anything on the field, Friend. So we must come together. And I hope you'll be able to join me and Gary at our virtual grassroots fundraiser.
If you're able to, please make a donation right now to help reelect Gary and see us at our grassroots fundraiser on October 13th.
Thanks for being a part of this,
Elizabeth

"It’s up to every one of us to make sure we come out victorious on Election Day.
$5 dollars, friend.
A $5 contribution from you today is what it will take for us to win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats. Let me tell you why:
I was just outraised for the FOURTH quarter in a row. That means that for the past YEAR we’ve been outpaced on fundraising every step of the way – and with a recent poll showing this race TIED, losing in Michigan would make it nearly impossible for Democrats to take back the Senate.
And to tip the scales in this race, the DeVos family and right-wing groups are funneling millions into super PACs to buy this seat for McConnell and Trump.
After talking with my finance team, we've set a goal to raise another $15,000 by midnight to win in Michigan and keep this seat blue. Your $5 can make all the difference in getting us there.
You know the stakes, friend. Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight reports Democrats have zero chance at taking back the Senate if we lose in Michigan. It's moments like this – right here, right now – that will determine whether we defend this seat and take back the Senate.
Pitch in $5 now to help us defend Michigan's Senate seat, fight this right-wing spending from Trump and the DeVos family and take back the Senate for Democrats.
It’s up to every one of us to make sure we come out victorious on Election Day. Thanks for fighting with me,
Gary

And I’ll cut right to it: We’re not going to reach our goal without a big final push right away.
I’m coming directly to you on one of the most important days of our campaign. Without supporters like you, we can’t win in Michigan and we can’t take back the Senate from Mitch McConnell. Will you step up now?

It’s contributions like yours that power this campaign from one day to the next. I won’t be able to win in November without your support.
Rush a donation of $3 or more now – or whatever you can spare – to defend Michigan's Senate seat and take back the Senate for Democrats. We only have hours left until the deadline.

"Here's what you need to know about Michigan’s Senate race:
* Our opponent John James, a hard-right extremist who says he backs Trump “2000%” and has Trump's ""total and complete endorsement”, has now outraised us four quarters in a row -- and counting.
* Not only that, James has Donald Trump, Betsy DeVos’ family, Mitch McConnell and now a Koch family PAC funneling in MILLIONS  to buy this seat for the GOP.
* RealClearPolitics just moved this race from “Lean Dem” to “Toss Up” – and a new poll shows us trailing TWO POINTS BEHIND James.
I’ll be blunt with you: I was the ONLY Democratic senator who was outraised last quarter, and Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight reports Democrats have ZERO chance to take back the Senate if we lose in Michigan. That’s why we set an 11:59 p.m. deadline to raise another $15,000 – but we’re already falling WAY short of what we need to win.
This is the most important election of our lifetimes, and I need your help: Will you contribute $3 or more now – every dollar you can spare – to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court from Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump?

"The most important race happening in 2020 is for control of the Senate.
I will not be the first, nor will I be the last to tell you this, friends: The most important race happening in 2020 is for control of the Senate.
I have a front-row seat to the damage Mitch McConnell is causing in the Senate. He is blocking every last attempt at progress that our Democratic colleagues in the House are fighting so hard for – environmental protections, gun safety measures, affordable healthcare. If a Democrat wins the White House, they MUST have the Senate as well.
That's why I'm reaching out to you about Gary Peters' race in Michigan. Experts from FiveThirtyEight to Roll Call say Democrats can win back the Senate – but only if Gary wins in Michigan.
The thing is that Gary's reelection won't be easy. He's one of two Democratic Senate candidates fighting to win in a state President Trump carried. To top it all off, Gary is neck-and-neck with his hard-right opponent, handpicked by Trump and McConnell.
So here's the deal: I told Gary I'd help him raise $6,500 to protect Michigan's Democratic Senate seat, and we really need to hit that goal before midnight. Can I count on you to give now and help us take back the Senate majority?
Please, click here to give $5 or more to help Gary Peters keep Michigan blue, defeat Mitch McConnell and take back the Senate for Democrats.

"With polls as close as they are...
Things were looking tough, team: We were outraised by my far-right GOP opponent five times in a row, and polling tightened dramatically as my opponent took a .1% lead.
And then, with Trump, McConnell and the DeVos family funneling millions of dollars into Michigan to buy this seat, our race will be the MOST expensive election in Michigan's history.
Even though supporters like you have stepped up to help us fight back, we're still $20,845 short of what we need this morning to stay on track – and with Michigan voters already casting ballots, we cannot afford to fall further behind. Can you chip in right now to help us fight back against the Trump, McConnell and DeVos aligned attack ads so we can defend Michigan's Democratic Senate seat?
The truth is that Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight says Democrats have ZERO chance to take back the Senate if we lose in Michigan. And with polls as close as they are, falling short now could be the difference between winning and losing in just 25 days.
So I'm asking you to chip in every dollar you can spare before midnight: Friend, will you rush $3 or more right this moment to help defend Michigan's Senate seat, take back the Senate and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

"We just got some really bad news, friend: Gary’s seat was just added to Roll Call’s list of MOST vulnerable Senate seats in 2020 -- with only TEN DAYS left to go.
Here's why:
* Gary’s Trump-backed opponent has outraised us four out of the last five quarters.
* GOP outside groups are spending over $30 MILLION in our race right now.
* Recent polling shows our far-right opponent in the LEAD!
With voting in Michigan already underway, we don't have much time to fix this -- and Democrats’ risk of losing the Senate is at an all time high.
Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight and CBS News analysts say the future of the Senate will be decided in Michigan. So with this alarming new announcement, we need all hands on deck to reach our $250,000 emergency goal -- but we’re already falling short.
Friend -- we’re running out of time before Election Day. Please rush an emergency gift of $3 or more right now to fight back against GOP spending in Michigan, defend Michigan's Senate seat and take back the Senate for Democrats!

"We MUST hit our $500,000 match goal before our mid-month deadline.
Friend, did you see our time-sensitive TRIPLE-MATCH announcement?
After being OUTRAISED by his far-right opponent FIVE TIMES, polling showed Gary Peters LOSING by just 0.1%. With Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell funneling in millions to try to buy this seat for the GOP, we MUST hit our $500,000 match goal before our mid-month deadline – or we could LOSE on Election Day by a razor-thin margin.
Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight says Democrats have ZERO chance to take back the Senate if we lose in Michigan, but Mitch McConnell’s super PAC just launched a HUGE $9 million smear campaign against Gary Peters to sway this election and maintain control of the Senate.
Friend, we thought supporters like you would turn out big to take advantage of this $500,000 triple match, but we’re still falling $176,211 short of our goal! Gary could LOSE – and Mitch McConnell could remain in power for years to come – if we don’t get the resources we need to turn this around immediately:

"period.
Team, this wasn’t the news we were hoping for: Analysts at the Washington Post just named Michigan as one of the Senate seats most likely to flip this November.
Add that to the fact that recent polling shows Gary nearly two points BEHIND his far-right opponent -- and that Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight says Democrats have ZERO chance to take back the Senate if we lose in Michigan.
Republicans know that Democrats need to win in Michigan. That’s why Trump, McConnell and Republican mega-donors are funneling over $30 MILLION into this race. And in a race this close, with the stakes this high, we need you to step up and help us fight back against the GOP war chest.
With only 11 days until Election Day and over one million Michiganders already casting their ballots, we don’t have any time to spare. Can you chip in $3 or more now - anything you can spare - to help us win in Michigan and take back Senate control from Mitch McConnell?

It's clear, friend: Our far-right opponent John James stands “2000%” with Trump -- and Trump is counting on him to be in the Senate.
On top of that, while Trump is here rallying wealthy donors to funnel money into my opponent’s pockets, a brand-new poll just dropped showing me behind by almost two points. With only 17 days left in this race, Trump’s rally tonight could tip the scales into the GOP’s favor.

"Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Team -- After we found out yesterday that a New York Times poll has us only one point ahead of our Trump-endorsed opponent, supporters in Michigan and across the nation leapt into action. In fact, we had the best day of grassroots fundraising of our ENTIRE campaign.
Together, we showed Mitch McConnell and his GOP billionaire allies that Michigan’s Senate seat is NOT for sale \-- and voters across the nation are ready for a Democratic Senate majority.
But I’ll cut straight to it: We have exactly THREE WEEKS to reach Michiganders, persuade undecided voters and mobilize supporters to cast their ballots. There's still so much left to be done, and with Republicans doing everything they can to tip the scales against us, we cannot afford to slow down in Michigan -- not even a little bit.
With analysts at CBS News reporting that Michigan will decide Senate control, we’ve set a goal to raise $500,000 by our final FEC fundraising deadline at midnight tomorrow -- but we’re still $206,195 short. And after hearing how important this race is, a group of donors offered to MATCH every contribution made between now and the deadline!
I wouldn't ask if it wasn't critically important: Friend, will you rush $3 or more right now – every dollar you can – and have your gift DOUBLED to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?
If you've saved payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:

Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and Betsy DeVos’ family are funneling MILLIONS of dollars into Michigan to buy this Senate seat – and GOP super PACs are spending more to defeat me than any other Democratic senator up for reelection.
With our fundraising gap growing by the day, we need to raise another $25,000 by tonight if we want to stay on track to win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats.
The Senate majority and future of the Supreme Court are at stake, so we cannot let our fundraising slow down. Rush $3 or more right now– anything you can chip in immediately – to help us win in Michigan, flip the Senate for Democrats and protect the Supreme Court from Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump!

"Friend: Republicans like Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and the DeVos family are spending over $30 MILLION in Michigan to defeat me.
That’s why I’m asking for your help -- but first, I’d like to explain why it’s so important we defend Michigan’s Democratic Senate seat.
With just six days left in this race, the stakes have never been higher. If we lose here, Democrats will throw away our only chance of taking back the Senate. That means two more years of Mitch McConnell calling the shots in Washington.
I've won tough elections before, and I'm all in to do it again this time around. But recent polling shows me two points behind my Trump-backed opponent, and Roll Call just added me to their list of most vulnerable Senators in 2020.
The good news is Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight reports Democrats can flip the Senate, but only if we first win in Michigan.
Over two million Michiganders have already voted, and in a race this close, every dollar could be the difference between winning and losing. We set a goal to raise another $30,000 by 11:59 p.m. tonight to win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats -- but right now we're still $21,549 short. I'd appreciate it if you could give now, even just $3, to help us hit this goal and win.
Here's the best link to donate – whatever you give will go toward keeping Michigan blue and taking back the Senate for Democrats: [[URL REDACTED]]

"Friend -- I need to follow up here. After my Trump-backed opponent officially won his primary last night, we set an emergency goal to raise $50,000 to close our fundraising gap in this race -- but we’re less than halfway there. So please: Can you rush $3 or more before midnight to make sure we win in Michigan and flip the Senate in November?
Thank you for stepping up in this urgent moment,

It's official, friend: John James, the hard-right extremist who has said he backs Trump “2,000%,” just won the GOP primary for Michigan's Senate seat.
Here's why this is concerning: James has outraised our campaign five times in a row. Because of him, we were the ONLY Democratic senator outraised by a challenger last quarter. And he's got the support of Donald Trump, Betsy DeVos’ family and Mitch McConnell – who have been funneling in millions of dollars to buy this seat.
With analysts at CBS News reporting that Michigan’s Senate race will decide Senate control, we’ll have zero chance of taking back the Senate if we lose this seat. And right now that's a real possibility: RealClearPolitics just moved our race from “Lean Dem” to “Toss Up,” and a new poll shows this race is statistically TIED.
I've won tough elections before – but if we're going to win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats, we CANNOT afford to let John James and his GOP billionaire allies continue to outraise us, especially as we enter the general election.
So my team set a rapid-response goal to raise $50,000 immediately to make up our fundraising gap, but right now, we're falling short of what we need to win.
There is too much at stake to sit on the sidelines: Can I count on you to contribute $3 or more now – every dollar you can spare – to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

There's no way of sugarcoating this, friend: I was the only Democratic senator to be outraised this summer -- and our Trump- and DeVos-backed opponent outraised us four out of the last five quarters. Friend, it couldn't have come at a worse time, with a new poll showing me two points BEHIND my far-right opponent and just ONE WEEK left in this race.
With analysts at CBS News reporting that Michigan’s Senate race will decide Senate control, we’ll have zero chance of taking back the Senate if we lose this seat. It's why right-wing interests from Donald Trump to Mitch McConnell to the DeVos family are funneling in over $30 million to buy this Senate seat.
I’m no stranger to tough fights: Fighting for the people of Michigan is the greatest honor of my life, and I do not plan on ceding this seat to a right-wing extremist.
What's more, Trump just came back to Michigan for ANOTHER rally -- this time, he called my far-right opponent ""the next U.S. Senator from the great state of Michigan."" With just ONE WEEK until Election Day and over two million Michiganders already casting their ballots, we're running out of time to make sure that doesn't happen.
Our opponent has the full force of GOP special interests behind him -- but I have you. Can you rush a contribution of $3 or more now -- every dollar you can spare -- to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Folks: Tomorrow starts the 100-day countdown to Election Day.
The bad news: We just found out that we were outraised for the FIFTH time in a row -- right after RealClearPolitics downgraded our race from “Lean Democrat” to “Toss Up.”
The good news: I know together we can protect this seat -- and even the experts at CBS News say we can flip the Senate but only if we win in Michigan.
The big news: With polling showing us tied with my Trump- and DeVos-backed opponent, we’re running out of time to close the fundraising gap.
Where you can help: Yesterday my team set our biggest rapid-response goal of the campaign: an immediate $80,000 in grassroots contributions. Supporters like you started stepping up right away because they know we were the ONLY Democratic Senator to be outraised last quarter -- but we need a surge of grassroots support right now if we’re going to reach this critical goal.
Please, before 11:59 p.m., will you rush an emergency gift of $3 or more now to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

"Our ads have to stay on the air to win
There’s no question, friend: Michigan will determine if Democrats gain control of the Senate – or leave it in Mitch McConnell's hands for another two years. That's because Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight reports that the ONLY way Democrats can take back the Senate is if we win in Michigan.
But winning won’t be easy: Mitch McConnell, Donald Trump and Betsy DeVos' family are all funneling MILLIONS into Michigan to buy this seat for my far-right opponent. I’m already the most attacked Senate Democrat up for reelection this year, and recent polls show this race statistically TIED.
This doesn't scare me, friend. No matter what they throw at me, I will never waver in my commitment for Michigan. But every campaign reaches a critical moment where they must fight back – and if we can't keep our newest ads on the air, my Trump-backed opponent could win, and we could throw away our chance to take back the Senate for Democrats.
We have a hard 10:30 p.m. deadline to keep our ads on the air to reach Michigan voters who will decide Senate control. And right now, we're $10,391 short of what we need to reserve critical airtime. Friend, I'm asking: Will you give $3 or more to keep our ads on the air, flip the Senate and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

We’re not the only ones who know how important winning in Michigan is to flipping the Senate.

"Friend, the stakes could not be higher.
With a vacancy on the Supreme Court, protections for pre-existing health conditions, Roe v. Wade and women’s health care, civil rights, voting rights, and workers’ rights are on the line. Michiganders start casting their ballots this week and deserve to have their voices heard. There should NOT be a Supreme Court nomination until the next presidential term begins.
But just weeks before an election, Mitch McConnell has vowed that Donald Trump's nominee will fill the Supreme Court vacancy and be put on the Senate floor for a vote.
The Supreme Court is on the ballot this November, friend. And with analysts at CBS News reporting that Michigan’s Senate race will decide Senate control, we’ll have ZERO chance of taking back the Senate from McConnell and protecting the Supreme Court if we lose this seat.
That’s why Trump, McConnell and their Republican-allies are funnelling TENS of MILLIONS of dollars to buy this seat -- and after weeks of nonstop GOP attacks against me, a recent poll shows my Trump- and McConnell-backed opponent in the lead by TWO POINTS.
Keeping Michigan blue and flipping the Senate has never been more important, that’s why my team and I have set a $20,000 emergency goal by 11:59 p.m. TONIGHT. Friend, I’m personally asking: Can I count on you to contribute $3 or more now to win in Michigan, take back the Senate and protect the Supreme Court from Mitch McConnell?

"Look at how close we are to the biggest fundraising goal of our campaign.
Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
This is it, friend: The biggest fundraising push of our campaign ends tomorrow at midnight. Our incredible supporters are stepping up, and we’ve made it more than halfway to our goal -- but we still have $43,170 left to go. Can you act before the clock runs out?
CHIP IN NOW
Reaching this fundraising goal will determine whether we have the resources to keep our ads on the air in the weeks ahead. In fact, it’s going to help power our campaign all the way to Election Day. And so much is on the line in Michigan, friend.
Both CBS News and Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight report that if Gary loses in Michigan, Democrats will have ZERO chance to take back the Senate. Everything from the Supreme Court’s future to protecting affordable health care is riding on defending Gary’s seat.
It’s why Gary’s Trump-backed opponent and his well-funded allies are pouring millions into reaching Michiganders around the state with attack ads. The truth is, if we fall short of tomorrow night’s end-of-quarter goal -- our MOST important deadline of the campaign -- we simply won't be able to keep up with the GOP’s onslaught of attacks.
Our deadline is almost here, and YOU could help put us over the top. If you’re able rush a donation of $3 or more right away to help defend Michigan's Senate seat and take back Senate control.

"Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
After a brand new poll had our opponent up by almost TWO POINTS, Donald Trump had this to say:
Leading in Michigan, leading in Minnesota, leading all over. Sorry!
Trump and Republicans now know their massive spending in Michigan is working – and they'll only escalate their efforts to buy Gary's seat and defeat Joe Biden between now and Election Day. After yesterday's alarming polling news, we saw a surge of support  – but still fell $6,289 short of our $25,000 rapid response goal. Can you chip in $3 or whatever you can to close the remaining gap?
\----Forwarded message----
There's no way of sugarcoating this, friend: I was the only Democratic senator to be outraised last quarter – and our Trump- and DeVos-backed opponent has outraised us for more than a full year. And friend, it's starting to tilt the scales in this race: A poll released just hours ago shows my opponent with a two-point lead.
With analysts at CBS News reporting that Michigan’s Senate race will decide Senate control, we’ll have zero chance of taking back the Senate if we lose this seat. It's why right-wing interests from Donald Trump to Mitch McConnell to the DeVos family are funneling in millions to buy this Senate seat.
I’m no stranger to tough fights: Fighting for the people of Michigan is the greatest honor of my life, and I do not plan on ceding this seat to a right-wing extremist.
But if we're going to win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats, we CANNOT afford to keep being outraised. That's why my team set a rapid-response goal to raise $25,000 immediately to make up our shortfall, but right now, we're falling short of what we need to win.
Our opponent has the full force of GOP special interests behind him – but I have you. So I'm asking: Before midnight, can I count on you to contribute $3 or more now – every dollar you can spare – to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

\----Forwarded message----
BREAKING:  Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight just predicted that Gary’s opponent is  “within striking distance” of winning Michigan’s Senate Race -- after reporting that Democrats have ZERO chance of taking back the Senate if Gary loses.
That’s why GOP billionaires are teaming up  right now to prop up Gary’s opponent. In just the last two weeks:
* Trump gave Gary’s opponent his “total and complete” endorsement.
* The  DeVos family super PAC increased their spending to a total of over  $5 million  in TV ads attacking Gary.
* A Koch family super PAC just endorsed Gary's opponent and plans to flood Michigan with a six-figure ad buy!
This onslaught of GOP ads and endorsements is tipping the scales. After RealClearPolitics moved this race from “Lean Dem” to “Toss Up,” yet ANOTHER poll shows this race within the margin of error.
The GOP is surging in Michigan, and how we respond right now could determine what happens to Gary’s seat AND the Senate majority. We set an 11:59 p.m. deadline to raise another $12,500 -- and we just can’t fall short.  Will you contribute $3 or more now – every dollar you can spare – to fight back against GOP spending in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats, and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

Friend: Our country cannot take two more years of Mitch McConnell's hold on the Senate – but Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight says that's exactly what will happen if we lose in Michigan.
And with polling TIED, Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and the DeVos family are pouring millions into Michigan to buy this seat and secure the GOP's hold on the Senate.

"For the past YEAR we’ve been outpaced on fundraising every step of the way
Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Friend: Thanks to special interests and Mitch McConnell, our Trump-backed opponent just outraised us for the FIFTH time in a row. That means that for the past YEAR we’ve been outpaced on fundraising every step of the way – and with a recent poll showing this race TIED, losing in Michigan would make it nearly impossible for Democrats to take back the Senate.
That's because Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight reports Democrats have ZERO chance to flip the Senate if we lose in Michigan. And with President Trump, Mitch McConnell and the DeVos family funneling MILLIONS into this race, losing could be a real possibility.
So I’m going to tell it to you straight, friend: We CANNOT afford to keep being outraised. That's why my team set a goal to raise $100,000 before our end-of-month deadline at midnight tomorrow to make up our shortfall -- but right now we're still short of what we need to win.
In a race this close, with the future of the Senate on the line, I'm counting on your immediate contribution: Will you make a contribution of $3 or more now – every dollar you can spare before midnight – to win in Michigan, take back Senate control and protect the future of the Supreme Court from Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump?

"Friend --
I’ll be honest -- I’ve been incredibly energized by the Senate polls I’ve seen recently. But I’m worried about one.
Michigan Senator Gary Peters is neck-and-neck with his Trump-backed opponent, and with so few opportunities to pick up seats this fall, Mitch McConnell is going all in: He’s pouring in nearly $5 million in new spending to flip this seat, for a total of nearly $30 million invested total by his groups.
Senate Republicans smell blood in the water. If Gary loses, we may lose our ability to take back the Senate -- there’s too much at stake to fall short.
Before midnight, we need to raise another $10,000 for Gary Peters: Donate $3 or more right now to fight back against Mitch McConnell’s last-minute flood of money to flip this seat in Michigan.

Senator Peters took a strong stance earlier this month against the politics of Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett, and last week he voted ""No"" on her nomination to save the Affordable Care Act and reproductive rights.
And that decision was personal for him: Senator Peters, like millions of Americans, has a personal abortion story. When his first wife tragically miscarried their second child, the miscarriage put her life in danger.
Senator Peters knows that abortion is health care, and that health care -- in addition to coverage for pre-existing conditions, Medicaid for millions of Americans, young people on their parent’s insurance -- is at risk with the addition of Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court.
Senator Peters is putting progress over politics to save our health care -- thank him by getting his back when he needs it most.
Gary is in a statistical tie with his opponent in Michigan, and if we lose this seat we could lose the chance to take back the Senate: Donate $3 or more before midnight tonight to support Gary Peters.
Sincerely,
Chuck Schumer

Today’s the day, folks.
We only have until the polls close tonight to secure this Senate seat and take back Senate control for Democrats.
Mitch McConnell and his allies clearly think this seat is for sale -- that’s why they’ve funneled tens of millions of dollars into this race. But guess what? Republican billionaires only get one vote this election, and so do each of us.

Yes, I’ll confirm my voting plan now →

Friend, I’ve been so grateful to have you by my side in this fight. I know that we can win here and keep Michigan blue -- as long as folks like you get out and vote.

FIRST: Gary's far-right opponent outraised him five times in a row thanks to Donald Trump, Betsy DeVos’ family and Mitch McConnell funneling in MILLIONS to buy this seat for the GOP.
THEN: The DeVos family Super PAC announced they’re spending $4 million on ads in Michigan attacking Gary, and Trump gave his ""total and compete endorsement"" to Gary's opponent.
NOW: A Koch family super PAC just endorsed Gary's opponent and plans to flood Michigan with a six-figure ad buy!

"Hi friend, I wanted to take a moment and reach out to you about my husband Gary.
First of all, from the bottom of my heart, I want to say thank you for being a part of this team to help Gary win in Michigan. It means the world to have you fighting so hard alongside us. I don't need to tell you that this race is one of the biggest in the entire country — even Donald Trump himself is focused on winning in Michigan and defeating Gary.
Earlier this year, President Trump personally attacked Gary, calling him a ""Do-nothing Democrat."" Now, the president is known for two things: his nicknames and his lies. But he doesn't know a thing about my husband. I want to tell you exactly who Gary Peters is:
He's the Senator who fights tirelessly for workers and small businesses. He’s the public servant pushing for quality, affordable health care coverage where insurance companies can no longer discriminate because of pre-existing conditions. And as a product of Michigan’s public schools, Gary has always fought for students and has continued to give them the tools they need to reach their full potential.
That's my husband – he's a fighter. For Michigan and our country. But right now, he's in the midst of his toughest election ever.
The stakes of this race have never been higher. Another two years of a Republican-held Senate means two more years of Mitch McConnell calling the shots in Washington. And with a vacancy on the Supreme Court there’s so much at stake: health care protections for pre-existing conditions, Roe v. Wade and women’s health care, civil rights, voting rights and ensuring we’re putting workers before corporate special interests.
My husband's been in tough election fights before, and he's all in to do it again. Believe me, Gary's going to fight tooth and nail to defend this Senate seat – but I'm making a personal ask for you to invest in this fight, too.
Gary's up against the likes of Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and nearly $7 million in dark money from the DeVos family super PAC, all vying to buy this seat for the GOP. That's why I'm reaching out to you today.
His team told me we need to raise another $25,000 by midnight, but right now, we're not quite there. Please, will you consider making a contribution to reelect my husband Gary, win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats?
Here's the best link to donate – whatever you give will go toward keeping Michigan blue and taking back the Senate for Democrats: [[URL REDACTED]]
From the bottom of my heart, thank you. Now let's go win this thing.

"Here's what you need to know about Michigan’s Senate race:
* Our opponent John James, a hard-right extremist who says he backs Trump “2000%” and has Trump's ""total and complete endorsement”, has now outraised us four quarters in a row -- and counting.
* Not only that, James has Donald Trump, Betsy DeVos’ family, Mitch McConnell and now a Koch family super PAC funneling in MILLIONS  to buy this seat for the GOP.
* RealClearPolitics just moved this race from “Lean Dem” to “Toss Up” – and a new poll shows us trailing TWO POINTS BEHIND James.
I’ll be blunt with you: I was the ONLY Democratic senator who was outraised last quarter, and Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight reports Democrats have ZERO chance to take back the Senate if we lose in Michigan. That’s why we set a goal to raise $200,000 before our final FEC quarterly filing deadline of the race – but with only hours left, we’re still $48,720 short of what we need to win.
This is the most important election of our lifetimes, and I need your help: Will you contribute $3 or more now – every dollar you can spare – to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court from Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump?

"Take a look at what we’re up against:
BREAKING:  Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight just predicted that Gary’s opponent is  “within striking distance” of winning Michigan’s Senate Race -- after reporting that Democrats have ZERO chance of taking back the Senate if Gary loses.
That’s why GOP billionaires are teaming up  right now to prop up Gary’s opponent. In just the last month:
* The  DeVos family super PAC increased their spending to a total of  $7 million  in TV ads attacking Gary.
* A Koch family super PAC endorsed Gary's opponent and flooded Michigan with a six-figure ad buy!
* Mitch McConnell's super PAC announced plans to funnel a new  $5.6 million  into the Michigan senate race -- bringing their total spending against Gary to nearly $15 MILLION!
This onslaught of GOP ads and endorsements is tipping the scales. After RealClearPolitics moved this race from “Lean Dem” to “Toss Up,” a brand-new poll from the New York Times shows Gary just ONE POINT ahead of his far-right opponent.
The GOP is surging in Michigan, and how we respond right now could determine what happens to Gary’s seat AND the Senate majority. We set a goal to raise $20,000 by 11:59 p.m. tonight -- and we just can’t fall short.  Will you contribute $3 or more now – every dollar you can spare – to fight back against GOP spending in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats, and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

"Friend – I'm writing to you with an important update:
The National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) – controlled by Mitch McConnell – is launching a MASSIVE TV buy in attack ads against me. We're talking nearly $3 million!
One thing is clear: This race is the TOP priority for Trump and McConnell.
CBS News and Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight are reporting that Democrats can only win back the Senate if we first win in Michigan, so we need to secure this seat to ensure victory in November.
Yesterday, we set a rapid-response goal to raise $50,000 by midnight, but I just checked in with my team, and we fell $12,500 short. But thankfully, a group of fired-up donors is stepping up to personally MATCH every donation (only until midnight!) to close our budget shortfall, win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats.
Friend – Senate control is on the line here in Michigan: Can I count on you to rush $3 now (becomes $6) to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?
I don’t scare easily, friend – the Republican Party can throw everything they want at me. But I’m now the most-attacked Democratic senator up this year, we’re up against some serious money and recent polls have us TIED with our Trump-backed opponent.
Democrats MUST win back a Senate majority – and it's possible. This election is our greatest chance yet, but only if we win here in Michigan. So with a group of donors offering to match all donations, I'm asking you to step up too and make an impact that will go twice as far. I wouldn't ask if it weren't critically important:
Will you make a contribution of $3 or more now and have every dollar of it DOUBLED to defend Michigan's Senate seat, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?
Click to donate $3 (becomes $6).
Click to donate $25 (becomes $50).

"Team, this wasn’t the news we were hoping for: Analysts at the Washington Post just named Michigan as one of the Senate seats most likely to flip this November.
Add that to the fact that a brand new poll from the New York Times shows Gary just one point ahead of his Trump-backed opponent -- within the margin of error -- and that Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight says Democrats have ZERO chance to take back the Senate if we lose in Michigan.
Republicans know that Democrats need to win in Michigan. That’s why Trump, McConnell and Republican mega-donors are funneling almost $30 MILLION into this race -- and why Donald Trump is coming back to Michigan tonight. And in a race this close, with the stakes this high, we need you to step up and help us fight back against the GOP war chest.
With only 17 days until Election Day and Michiganders already casting their ballots, we don’t have any time to spare. Can you chip in $3 or more now - anything you can spare - to help us win in Michigan and take back Senate control from Mitch McConnell?

"Trump says John James has his ""total and complete endorsement.""
Friend, Donald Trump and John James JUST stepped off the stage in Michigan after attacking me in an effort to flip this seat.
It's clear, friend: our opponent John James stands “2000%” with Trump -- and Trump is counting on him to be in the Senate.
But here's the deal, after being outraised for over a year, a brand new poll shows our team trailing by almost 2 POINTS. On top of that, RealClearPolitics just moved this race from “Leans Dem” to “Toss-Up.” And Trump’s rally tonight could make this race closer -- even tipping the scales into the GOP’s favor.
The White House and Senate control are on the line in Michigan, and Trump just showed how badly he wants to defeat me and Joe Biden. If you're ready to take back the Senate AND the White House for Democrats, I need you to step up now. Chip in $3 or whatever you can.

"The most important race happening in 2020 is for control of the Senate.
I will not be the first, nor will I be the last to tell you this, friends: The most important race happening in 2020 is for control of the Senate.
I have a front-row seat to the damage Mitch McConnell is causing in the Senate. He is blocking every last attempt at progress that our Democratic colleagues in the House are fighting so hard for – environmental protections, gun safety measures, affordable healthcare. If a Democrat wins the White House, they MUST have the Senate as well.
That's why I'm reaching out to you about Gary Peters' race in Michigan. Experts from FiveThirtyEight to Roll Call say Democrats can win back the Senate – but only if Gary wins in Michigan.
The thing is that Gary's reelection won't be easy. He's one of two Democratic Senate candidates fighting to win in a state President Trump carried. To top it all off, Gary is neck-and-neck with his hard-right opponent, handpicked by Trump and McConnell.
So here's the deal: I told Gary I'd help him raise $8,500 to protect Michigan's Democratic Senate seat, and we really need to hit that goal before midnight. Can I count on you to give now and help us take back the Senate majority?
Please, click here to give $5 or more to help Gary Peters keep Michigan blue, defeat Mitch McConnell and take back the Senate for Democrats.

"I was the only Democratic senator to be outraised last quarter.
Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
There's no way of sugarcoating this, friend: I was the only Democratic senator to be outraised last quarter – and this makes it the fourth straight reporting period that our Trump- and DeVos-backed opponent has outraised us. Friend, it couldn't have come at a worse time, with polls showing our race in a statistical tie.
With analysts at CBS News reporting that Michigan’s Senate race will decide Senate control, we’ll have zero chance of taking back the Senate if we lose this seat. It's why right-wing interests from Donald Trump to Mitch McConnell to the DeVos family are funneling in millions to buy this Senate seat.
I’m no stranger to tough fights: Fighting for the people of Michigan is the greatest honor of my life, and I do not plan on ceding this seat to a right-wing extremist.
But if we're going to win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats, we CANNOT afford to keep being outraised. That's why my team set a rapid-response goal to raise $50,000 immediately to make up our shortfall, but right now, we're falling short of what we need to win.
Our opponent has the full force of GOP special interests behind him – but I have you. So I'm asking: Before midnight, can I count on you to contribute $3 or more now – every dollar you can spare – to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

Donald Trump has been in Michigan campaigning to defeat me and keep Democrats from taking back the Senate, so there’s more on the line than ever before. And with everyone from DeVos to Trump and McConnell funneling millions into Michigan to defeat me, I’m asking for your help.

"Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Friend,
Earlier today I reached out in hopes of adding another 1,500 Official Team Peters Members in Almont -- but only 692 have signed up so far.
Please, I’m asking you to step up with only weeks left in our fight for Senate control. Will you activate your Team Peters membership by chipping in now?
Thanks,
Gary
\----Forwarded message----
Friend: The presidency, Senate control, the very future of our country -- it all comes down to winning in Michigan.
But with recent polls showing this race statistically tied, and after more than a year of being outraised by my Trump-backed opponent, RealClearPolitics moved this race from “Leans Dem” to “Toss Up.”
With McConnell, Trump and the DeVos family funneling in MILLIONS to Michigan to protect their GOP Senate majority, it’s never been more vital to ensure we have the resources to reach every Michigan voter we can before Election Day -- which is why I'm inviting you to activate your Official Team Peters Membership right now.
Name: On file
Email: [[EMAIL_REDACTED]]
Given to become an Official Team Peters Member in the final month? No, not yet
I just set a goal to add another 1,500 Team Peters Members from Almont before midnight, but we’re still 982 short. Will you donate $3 or more now to become an Official Team Peters Member today?

"We just got some really bad news, friend: Gary’s seat was just added to Roll Call’s list of MOST vulnerable Senate seats in 2020 -- with only FOUR weeks left to go.
Here's why:
* Gary’s Trump-backed opponent has outraised us for over a year.
* GOP outside groups are spending over $25 million in our race right now.
* A new poll shows our far-right opponent in the LEAD!
With voting in Michigan already underway, we don't have much time to fix this -- and Democrats’ risk of losing the Senate is at an all time high.
Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight and CBS News analysts say the future of the Senate will be decided in Michigan. So with this alarming new announcement, we need all hands on deck to raise $30,000 for our rapid response goal -- but we’re already falling short.
Friend -- we’re running out of time before Election Day. Please rush an emergency gift of $3 or more right now to fight back against GOP spending in Michigan, defend Michigan's Senate seat and take back the Senate for Democrats!

Take a look at who’s trying to buy Michigan’s Senate seat for the GOP:
* Our Trump-backed opponent  has launched a multi-million dollar  ad blitz in Michigan.
* Mitch McConnell’s  dark money group spent  $4.5 million  on ads alone in August.
* And the  DeVos family super PAC  just announced  over $4 million  in TV ads attacking Gary.

I just heard from our finance team, and I have to be honest with you, friend: Our fundraising is just not where it needs to be if we're going to reach every Michigan voter by the time the polls close tonight. What's more, Republicans are flooding Michigan with attack ads on the crucial last day of this race.
My opponent – who says he backs Donald Trump “2000%” – outraised us four of the last five quarters thanks to Trump, McConnell and the DeVos family funneling tens of millions of dollars into Michigan to buy this seat for the GOP.

Friend, in a race this close, every single vote makes a difference. With Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight reporting Democrats have ZERO chance to take back the Senate if we lose in Michigan, what we do in moments like this could decide whether Mitch McConnell keeps his grip on the Senate.

But with only two weeks left for voters to make their decisions, a new poll shows me nearly two points behind my far-right opponent. That means we have only 14 days to make sure we defend this seat, take back Senate control from Mitch McConnell and protect the Supreme Court.
The stakes couldn't be any higher: Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight reports Democrats have ZERO chance of flipping the Senate if we lose here in Michigan. But my Trump-backed opponent has outraised me four out of the last five quarters – and Trump, McConnell and the DeVos family are funneling MILLIONS of dollars to buy Michigan’s Senate seat.
After hearing how crucial winning in Michigan is to regaining control of the Senate, a group of donors offered to MATCH every contribution made to our campaign -- up to $250,000!
We have to act fast to take advantage of this match opportunity, and we CANNOT afford to fall behind in fundraising now that Michigan voters are casting their ballots: Please, team, rush $3 or more now – anything you can spare – and have every dollar DOUBLED to win in Michigan, take back the Senate and protect the Supreme Court from Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump!

I’ve been in tough battles, but I know I can’t win this one without Democrats like you fighting tooth and nail to ensure we close the gap now, so we can win on Election Day.
Thanks for making sure we have what it takes.

"Hey folks, wanted to get your eyes on this. We’re seeing a surge of Republican money being spent in our race. And what’s worse, we’re falling behind on where we need to be for our fundraising.
Thankfully, a group of donors will match all contributions up to $25,000 until midnight tonight. If you can, will you give a donation of any amount and have it doubled?

Friend, Donald Trump was just in Michigan campaigning against Gary Peters. Here's why: Trump knows that a win in Michigan will secure a Senate majority for Mitch McConnell.
And after Betsy DeVos' family has already dumped nearly $1 MILLION in attack ads against Gary Peters, polls are showing this race TIED.
Analysts at CBS News report Senate control is riding on what happens here in Michigan, so we can't afford to fall short. And if the GOP wins here, Mitch McConnell will call the shots in Washington for at least another two years.
That's why a group of fired-up donors JUST made a game-changing offer: They're going to personally MATCH every contribution, dollar for dollar, to hit our RAPID-RESPONSE GOAL of $25,000 to win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats!
If we're going to hold onto Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats, we must take full advantage of this opportunity. And in a race this close – with Senate control on the line – every dollar could make the difference between winning and losing.
Rush $3 or more right now – and have every dollar DOUBLED – to keep Michigan blue, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court!

"Take a look at who’s trying to buy Michigan’s Senate seat for the GOP:
* Our Trump-backed opponent  has launched a multi-million dollar  ad blitz in Michigan.
* Mitch McConnell’s  dark money group raised $92 million in September alone -- and Gary's seat is one of their top targets.
* And the  DeVos family super PAC  has spent over $7 million in TV ads attacking Gary.
Thanks to over 20 Republican aligned groups spending big in Michigan to buy Gary’s seat for McConnell, we’re officially set to be outspent on the airwaves in the crucial last days of this campaign.  And now, RealClearPolitics moved this race from  “Leans Dem”  to “Toss Up.”  With a brand-new poll showing Gary nearly TWO POINTS BEHIND, this Senate seat could swing in the Republicans’ favor.
With Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight reporting that Democrats have ZERO chance to take back the Senate if Gary loses, we need your help. We need to raise another $20,000 today to close this spending gap – but we’re falling WAY short of what we need to win.
Our opponent may have Donald Trump, Betsy DeVos’ family, and Mitch McConnell,  but we have supporters like you,  friend. Will you contribute $3 or more now – every dollar you can spare – to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court from Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump?

Friend: The presidency, Senate control, the very future of our country -- it all comes down to winning in Michigan.
But with recent polls showing this race statistically tied, and after more than a year of being outraised by my Trump-backed opponent, RealClearPolitics moved this race from “Leans Dem” to “Toss Up.”

I just got off the phone with our campaign manager, friend, and I have some bad news to share: We’re officially being outspent on the airwaves right as Michiganders are casting their ballots.
With our race downgraded from “Leans Democrat” to “Toss Up” and recent polls showing this race in a statistical tie, this massive TV ad spending gap could tip the scales in our opponent’s favor.

Folks -- I’ll be quick.
This morning, the DeVos family super PAC went up on the air with a new attack ad against me. Betsy DeVos will stop at nothing to buy this seat.

BREAKING NEWS, friend: We just learned the Betsy DeVos family super PAC is dumping NEARLY ONE MILLION dollars into new TV attack ads to defeat Gary Peters.
They know it's the best way to buy Michigan's Senate seat and guarantee Mitch McConnell will call the shots in Washington for another two years.

Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight reports the ONLY way Democrats can flip the Senate is by winning in Michigan. But this DeVos spending could tip the scales in this race – and right now, the polls are showing Gary TIED.
Senate control hangs in the balance here in Michigan. That's why we've set a rapid response goal to raise another $10,000 by midnight, but right now, we're falling WAY short of what we need to win.

"It’s up to every one of us to make sure we come out victorious on Election Day.
$5 dollars, friend.
A $5 contribution from you today is what it will take for us to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats, and protect the future of the Supreme Court. Let me tell you why:
I was outraised for the FIFTH reporting period in a row. That means that for the past YEAR we’ve been outpaced on fundraising every step of the way – and with a recent poll showing me nearly TWO POINTS BEHIND my far-right opponent, losing in Michigan would make it nearly impossible for Democrats to take back the Senate -- that means two more years of Mitch McConnell calling the shots on the future of our nation's highest court.
On top of all that, the DeVos family and right-wing groups are funneling MILLIONS into super PACs to buy this seat for McConnell and Trump.
After talking with my finance team, we've set a goal to raise another $20,000 by 11:59 p.m. tonight to win in Michigan and keep this seat blue – but right now, we're falling short. Your $5 can make all the difference in getting us there.
You know the stakes, friend. Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight reports Democrats have zero chance at taking back the Senate if we lose in Michigan. It's moments like this – right here, right now – that will determine whether we defend this seat and take back the Senate.
Pitch in $5 now to help us defend Michigan's Senate seat, take back the Senate for Democrats, and protect the future of the Supreme Court.
It’s up to every one of us to make sure we come out victorious on Election Day. Thanks for fighting with me,
Gary

Friend –
Donald Trump is holding TWO campaign rallies in Michigan today -- on the last day of his campaign. It's clear Trump and Republicans are betting it all on Michigan, just like they did in 2016.
Before he arrives, here are three things you need to know:
Gary's right-wing opponent supports the president ""2,000%"" – and both Republicans like Mitch McConnell and the DeVos family have funneled over $40 million into Michigan to defeat Gary and flip this seat red.
Senate control hinges on what happens here in Michigan, and recent polling shows Gary two points BEHIND his extremist opponent!
Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight reports the ONLY way Democrats can take back the Senate is if we win in Michigan.
We have only hours until Trump arrives back in Michigan -- and only until polls close tomorrow to secure this seat and take back the Senate for Democrats. In a race as close as this, we need to make sure every vote in Michigan is counted.
Please, will you rush $3 or more -- whatever you can spare -- to help us reach every voter in Michigan and make sure every vote is counted?

With a vacancy on the Supreme Court, health care protections for people with pre-existing conditions, Roe v. Wade and women’s health care, civil rights, voting rights, and workers’ rights are on the line. Michiganders have already begun casting their ballots and deserve to have their voices heard. There should NOT be a Supreme Court nomination until the next presidential term begins.
But in the midst of an election, Mitch McConnell has vowed that Donald Trump's nominee will fill the Supreme Court vacancy -- and her Senate confirmation hearings begin THIS WEEK.
The Supreme Court is on the ballot this November, friend. And with analysts at CBS News reporting that Michigan’s Senate race will decide Senate control, we’ll have ZERO chance of taking back the Senate from McConnell and protecting the Supreme Court if we lose this seat.
That’s why Trump, McConnell and their Republican-allies are funnelling TENS of MILLIONS of dollars to buy this seat -- and after weeks of nonstop GOP attacks against me, a recent internal poll from my Trump- and McConnell-backed opponent shows us STATISTICALLY TIED.

This year we have the chance to take back the White House, flip the United States Senate and renew our sense of hope for our country’s future.
But in order to do so, we have to flip the Senate – and we’ll need your help in order to accomplish a victory in November.
Winning an election is no easy task. It takes an entire community to build around one voice – one person at a time. It’s why I’m reaching out to you on behalf of my friend, Gary Peters.
He’s running for reelection in Michigan – a key battleground state Democrats lost in 2016. If we lose his seat, we won’t flip the Senate and we’ll have more of Mitch McConnell’s destructive partisanship in Washington.
This is the most important election of our lifetimes, and together we can make sure it's a triumphant one for Democrats. It’s why I’m asking you to join me in supporting Gary Peters as he runs for reelection in Michigan. Can you chip in $3 to ensure we keep Michigan blue and flip the Senate this November?

"Our country cannot take two more years of Mitch McConnell controlling the Senate.
Friend: Our country cannot take two more years of Mitch McConnell's control over the Senate – but Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight says that's exactly what will happen if we lose in Michigan.
And with a brand-new poll from the New York Times showing Gary only ONE POINT ahead of his far-right opponent, Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and the DeVos family are pouring millions into Michigan to buy this seat and tighten the GOP's hold on the Senate.
With the future of the Senate and the Supreme Court on the line, we simply CANNOT let Trump and McConnell buy Michigan's Democratic Senate seat.
After hearing how important this seat is, a group of donors offered to MATCH every contribution between now and our final FEC filing deadline at midnight tomorrow -- up to $500,000!
Will you rush $3 or more now – every dollar you can spare – and have every dollar DOUBLED to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court from Mitch McConnell?

"The most important race happening in 2020 is for control of the Senate.
I will not be the first, nor will I be the last to tell you this, friends: The most important race happening in 2020 is for control of the Senate.
I have a front-row seat to the damage Mitch McConnell is causing in the Senate. He is blocking every last attempt at progress that our Democratic colleagues in the House are fighting so hard for – environmental protections, gun safety measures, affordable healthcare. If a Democrat wins the White House, they MUST have the Senate as well.
That's why I'm reaching out to you about Gary Peters' race in Michigan. Experts from FiveThirtyEight to Roll Call say Democrats can win back the Senate – but only if Gary wins in Michigan.
The thing is that Gary's reelection won't be easy. He's one of two Democratic Senate candidates fighting to win in a state President Trump carried. To top it all off, Gary is neck-and-neck with his hard-right opponent, handpicked by Trump and McConnell.
So here's the deal: I told Gary I'd help him raise $7,500 to protect Michigan's Democratic Senate seat, and we really need to hit that goal before midnight. Can I count on you to give now and help us take back the Senate majority?
Please, click here to give $5 or more to help Gary Peters keep Michigan blue, defeat Mitch McConnell and take back the Senate for Democrats.

"Team: Despite unprecedented support for our campaign in Michigan, our opponent has broken fundraising records and outraised us for the third straight reporting period. This is all thanks to Donald Trump funneling MILLIONS into Michigan to defeat Gary Peters and buy this seat to expand Mitch McConnell’s majority in the Senate.

Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight reports that Democrats can take back the Senate, but we must first win in Michigan. That's why a group of donors is matching all donations up to $50,000 – but this only lasts until midnight tomorrow.

"Here's what you need to know about Michigan’s Senate race:
Here's what you need to know about Michigan’s Senate race:
* John James, a hard-right extremist who says he backs Trump “2,000%,” just won the GOP primary to take on Democrat Sen. Gary Peters.
* James has outraised Gary five times in a row thanks to Donald Trump, Betsy DeVos’ family and Mitch McConnell funneling in MILLIONS to buy this seat for the GOP.
* RealClearPolitics just moved this race from “Lean Dem” to “Toss Up” – and a brand-new poll shows Gary's opponent UP BY TWO POINTS!
Gary is the ONLY Democratic senator who was outraised last quarter, and Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight reports Democrats have ZERO chance to take back the Senate if Gary loses. That’s why we set an 11:59 p.m. deadline to raise $25,000 – but we’re already falling WAY short of what we need to win.
This is the most important election of our lifetimes, and we need your help: Will you contribute $3 or more now – every dollar you can spare – to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court from Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump?

"We're getting worried...
Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Folks,
Thanks to Betsy Devos’ family and Mitch McConnell funding my far-right opponent’s campaign, we’ve been outraised three times in a row -- that’s nine months straight!
Now, with another end-of-quarter deadline approaching, our fundraising just isn’t where it needs to be. Our finance team reached out to a group of donors asking them to match all donations up to $50,000 for the next few days. If you chip in $3 now, you could make it $6. Can I count on your help, friend?
Thank you,
Gary
\----Forwarded message----
We're getting worried, friend: Gary just got outraised by our extremist, Trump-endorsed opponent – for the THIRD time in a row.
And now, Mitch McConnell's NRSC is launching a MASSIVE $3 million TV ad buy to attack Gary. This comes right as Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight and CBS News analysts say that Senate control – and the future of the Supreme Court – will be decided in Michigan.
How we respond now will be the most important moment of this campaign – and thankfully, we just got a HUGE boost:
After hearing that Gary was outraised again, a fired-up group of donors said they would match every donation, dollar for dollar, up to our $50,000 match goal!
Our opponent has the full support of Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and the DeVos family – but Gary has you, friend. Can Gary count on you to donate $3 or more to win in Michigan and flip the Senate blue?
With Mitch McConnell at the helm, Senate Republicans have already confirmed two extreme, right-wing justices to the Supreme Court and threatened to dismantle affordable health care. Honestly, it's never been more important for Democrats to win back the Senate majority.
Experts know that the ONLY way Democrats can take back the Senate is if Gary wins in Michigan. But with the balance of the Supreme Court and the future of our country on the line, Gary's counting on your immediate donation to win in Michigan and flip the Senate blue for Democrats:
Rush $3 – becomes $6 – or whatever you can spare before midnight. Every dollar will be DOUBLED to defend Michigan's Senate seat, take back the Senate and protect the Supreme Court!
Donate $3 (becomes $6)
Donate $25 (becomes $50)
Donate $50 (becomes $100)

There's no denying it, friend: Trump is betting EVERYTHING on Michigan. After a rally in Lansing on Tuesday, he just announced that he's coming back to Michigan on Friday. And Sunday. And Monday. That’s FOUR VISITS in the week before Election Day.
Even worse, Trump's last-ditch efforts to defeat me and keep control of the Senate for Mitch McConnell are WORKING. With just FIVE days to go in this race, a recent poll shows us trailing our Trump-backed opponent by 2 points.
Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight says Democrats have ZERO chance to take back the Senate if we lose in Michigan – this close to Election Day, Democrats CANNOT afford to ignore Michigan.

"President Trump and the GOP are doing everything they can to suppress vote-by-mail
Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
It’s urgent you see this, friend: President Trump and the GOP are doing everything they can to suppress vote-by-mail across the country – in the hope that it could help them win.
This is the most important election of our lifetime – the White House, Senate control and the future of the Supreme Court are all on the ballot. But voters should never have to put themselves or their family's health at risk in order to exercise their fundamental right to vote.
Universal vote-by-mail is common sense. We know it’s worked here in Michigan and across the country. And it's never been more important.
But, friend, we’re still 1,158 signatures short of our 15,000-signature goal to demand Congress pass universal vote-by-mail for every American voter. We have to stop the GOP's voter suppression efforts, so please, before 11:59 p.m., will you add your name to support universal vote-by-mail?
Sign the petition
We can’t let Trump and his GOP allies suppress voters when so much is on the line, friend. This team is counting on you to add your name now.
Thank you so much,
Gary

Friend: Donald Trump's attempts to sabotage the USPS are happening in plain sight – and now he's blaming Democrats for the chaos he's created.
FIRST: Donald Trump denied emergency funding to help the USPS stay afloat.
THEN: His new hand-picked postmaster general implemented changes that are leading to massive mail delays.
NOW: Trump says he'll continue to block any coronavirus relief package that helps the USPS – and made clear he's doing this to stop vote-by-mail across the country.
I've launched an investigation into these mail delays, and I’m doing everything in my power to keep the Postal Service operating – but I need your immediate help:

"Our Supreme Court is on the ballot this year.
Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
I'll be blunt, friend: The future of our country rests on what happens in Michigan. That's because our race will decide if Democrats take back Senate control from Mitch McConnell. This could not be more important.
Trump and McConnell have always known what's at stake and have funneled MILLIONS of dollars into Michigan to buy this seat. Their handpicked GOP opponent has also outraised us four of the last five quarters – what's more, RealClearPolitics moved this race from “Leans Dem"" to “Toss-Up,” and a brand-new poll shows me nearly two points BEHIND my far-right opponent.
When Election Day has come and gone, I don't want to look back and wish we had done more to stop Mitch McConnell from calling the shots on the future of our nation's highest court. So with CBS News reporting Democrats have zero chance of winning back the majority if we lose this seat, we've got to give this race everything we've got.
Our Supreme Court is on the ballot this year. To protect it, we MUST keep Michigan blue and flip the Senate, but we're still $9,582 short of our $20,000 midnight goal, and we can't afford to fall short.
So I'm coming to you directly, friend: Will you make a contribution of $3 or more now to win in Michigan, take back the Senate and protect the Supreme Court from Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump?

Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Friend: Thanks to special interests and Mitch McConnell, our Trump-backed opponent just outraised us for the FOURTH quarter in a row. That means that for the past YEAR we’ve been outpaced on fundraising every step of the way – and with a recent poll showing this race TIED, losing in Michigan would make it nearly impossible for Democrats to take back the Senate.

In a race this close, with the future of the Senate on the line, I'm counting on your immediate contribution: Will you make a contribution of $3 or more now – every dollar you can spare before midnight – to win in Michigan, take back Senate control and protect the future of the Supreme Court from Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump?

There is too much at stake to sit on the sidelines: Every dollar chipped in right now will help decide Senate control for Democrats, so rush $3 or more to defend Michigan's Democratic Senate seat, take back the Senate and protect the future of the Supreme Court!

Team: Donald Trump is about to step onstage for his second Michigan rally of the day -- and the final rally of his campaign. Earlier tonight, my far-right opponent joined him onstage to attack me in a last-ditch effort to flip this seat.  Now, Trump is ending his campaign in Michigan because he knows that whoever wins in Michigan will win control of the White House AND the Senate.
On the eve of the most important election of our lifetimes, we need all hands on deck. Chip in $3 or more right away -- whatever you can spare -- to help us reach every last Michigan voter and ensure that every vote is counted.
Thank you,
Gary
\----Forwarded message----
This is urgent, team: Donald Trump is coming back to Michigan for TWO rallies on the final day of his campaign.
He's doing it because he knows if Democrats lose here, we have ZERO chance of taking back the Senate.
What's worse, Trump is bringing in GOP mega-donors from across the country to funnel money into my far-right opponent’s pockets in an attempt to buy this election. I’ve got one thing to say to the Trump team: Bring it on.
With only hours until Trump arrives in Michigan and just ONE DAY left in this race, I'm counting on your donation. Can you rush an urgent contribution of $3 or more -- whatever you can spare -- to help us compete against Trump and reach every last voter in Michigan?

"Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
We want to give you the latest on what’s happening in Michigan's Senate race:
FIRST: Gary's far-right opponent, John James, said he supports Donald Trump 2000%.
THEN: Republicans including Mitch McConnell, Betsy Devos' family, and the Koch family are funneling over $25 million into Michigan to buy this seat for the GOP -- because they know that Democrats can't take back the Senate without winning in Michigan.
NOW: A brand new poll shows Gary statistically TIED with his Trump-endorsed opponent.
It’s time to act. Even the experts across the country – like Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight, The New York Times and The Washington Post – all agree: If we lose this race here in Michigan, Democrats won’t be able to win the Senate majority. We need all hands on deck to hit a $20,000 fundraising goal TODAY -- but right now we’re falling $9,582 short, and we need your help.

"After all the right-wing money that's been spent against me, recent polling now shows this race tied.
Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Friend,
We've always known that Michigan could determine whether Mitch McConnell retains control of the Senate. But now there's no denying it: Both CBS News and Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight report that if we lose, Democrats will have ZERO chance to take back the Senate.
Everything from the Supreme Court to protecting affordable health care is riding on Senate control, and that's why shady right-wing special interests – led by Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and the DeVos family – have funneled millions of dollars into Michigan to try and flip this seat.
I’m not backing down without a fight, friend. No matter what Republicans throw at me, I’ll never stop working for Michigan’s families. But the thing is, after all the right-wing money that's been spent against me, recent polling now shows this race tied.
With my Trump-backed opponent and his allies launching endless attack ads against me, we could very well lose if we're forced to pull down our own ads. If we fall short of tonight's end-of-quarter FEC goal, our MOST important deadline of the campaign, we simply won't be able to keep our TV ads on the air. And with polling tied and my right-wing opponent flush with cash, we cannot afford for that to happen.
Can I count on you to help us close our $4,700 fundraising gap by midnight? Rush a donation of $3 or more now – whatever you can spare – to help keep our ads on the air, defend Michigan's Senate seat and take back the Senate for Democrats!

"The most important race happening in 2020 is for control of the Senate.
I will not be the first, nor will I be the last to tell you this, friends: The most important race happening in 2020 is for control of the Senate.
I have a front-row seat to the damage Mitch McConnell is causing in the Senate. He is blocking every last attempt at progress that our Democratic colleagues in the House are fighting so hard for – environmental protections, gun safety measures, affordable healthcare. If a Democrat wins the White House, they MUST have the Senate as well.
That's why I'm reaching out to you about Gary Peters' race in Michigan. Experts from FiveThirtyEight to Roll Call say Democrats can win back the Senate – but only if Gary wins in Michigan.
The thing is that Gary's reelection won't be easy. He's one of two Democratic Senate candidates fighting to win in a state President Trump carried. To top it all off, Gary is neck-and-neck with his hard-right opponent, handpicked by Trump and McConnell.
So here's the deal: I told Gary I'd help him raise $6,500 to protect Michigan's Democratic Senate seat, and we really need to hit that goal before midnight. Can I count on you to give now and help us take back the Senate majority?
Please, click here to give $5 or more to help Gary Peters keep Michigan blue, defeat Mitch McConnell and take back the Senate for Democrats.

"What I’ve been thinking about recently
Friend – I’ve been thinking a lot recently about how each of us can make a difference in our communities. It’s a sentiment I get from my parents – and I couldn’t be more grateful to have learned from them about fighting for what’s right.
Take my dad, for instance. A veteran of World War II, Dad became a teacher who spent over 30 years inspiring students in his community to learn. And Mom? A tough-as-nails SEIU steward who organized her workplace to help not just our family but the families of her colleagues. Ultimately, it was their example that gave me the courage to put myself through night school and the Navy Reserve.
In our lives, many of us encounter tough fights that test our mettle and define who we are. For me, one of those fights came in 2010 during my first reelection. Across the country, a huge Republican Tea Party wave gave the GOP a House majority.
During that election, I kept coming back to how hard Mom and Dad worked to improve their communities. How they showed me the toughest things are worth fighting for. So, I campaigned harder than I ever had and was one of just a few freshman Democrats to win reelection.
I learned something important that year: determination. So many people in our communities have the odds stacked against them – but when we fight together, we can lift everyone around us and improve each of our lives. That’s why I’ll continue fighting for Michiganders and people across the country, friend.
So, even as the NRSC – Mitch McConnell’s super PAC to keep a Republican Senate majority – targets a MASSIVE $3 million attack ad against me, I know what I’m fighting for, and I know I can’t win without you.
Friend, the Senate is on the line in Michigan – and your support will determine if we can defeat Mitch McConnell. I need you all in: Will you give $3 or more to defend Michigan’s Senate seat? Every dollar you give now will go toward winning this race and helping Democrats take back the Senate.
So much is on the line for every person in this country. Good middle-class jobs. Access to affordable health care. Quality education in our schools. Action on climate change and protecting the environment. I’m committed to defending and fighting for each of these issues because I know it improves lives.
That’s why I’m determined to win this election.
But this race is different than anything I’ve faced. The GOP has made me one of their top targets because if I lose, Democrats will have zero chance to take back the Senate. It’s why Betsy DeVos’ family has already poured $1 million into this race to defeat me. It’s why Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell are all in for my opponent.
I have three words for them: Bring it on.
Here’s what I’ve got they can never have: you. But the reality is that polls are showing this race tied, and truthfully, I suspect this election will be neck and neck until Election Day. That means every fundraising goal will make or break this race – and I just heard we need to raise another $15,000 tonight in order to win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats.
You’re what makes this team incredible, friend: Together we’re creating an unstoppable team that will win this race and help communities across the country. But I need your help immediately, so I’m asking you now: Will you donate $3 – whatever you can chip in to defend Michigan’s Senate seat – so we can win this reelection and take back the Senate for Democrats?
Together, we can make a difference. I can’t thank you enough for fighting this tough fight that will have an impact on all of us.
Take care,
Gary

"Trump and McConnell will stop at nothing to defeat me
Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Friend – Despite unprecedented support for our campaign in Michigan, my extreme right-wing GOP opponent has broken fundraising records and outraised us for the FIFTH straight reporting period.
This is thanks to Donald Trump funneling MILLIONS into Michigan to defeat me and buy this seat to expand Mitch McConnell’s majority in the Senate.
I won't mince words: Democrats cannot take back the Senate if we lose in Michigan. Period. That's why the GOP has made it clear they will stop at nothing to defeat me.
I'm counting on supporters like you, friend: Please rush $3 or more now to defend Michigan's Senate seat and take back the Senate for Democrats.
We can’t afford any more years of a Republican Senate – with a vacancy on the Supreme Court, protections for pre-existing health conditions, Roe v. Wade and women’s health care, civil rights, voting rights, and workers’ rights are on the line. It's never been more important for Democrats to win back the Senate majority.
Friend, here’s the good news: Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight reports Democrats can take back the Senate. But first we have to win here in Michigan.
A new poll shows me nearly TWO POINTS BEHIND my far-right opponent – and in a race this close, every single dollar matters. If we're going to win and take back the Senate, we cannot fall further behind.
What we do right now could be the difference between winning and losing. Please, will you rush $3 or more to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

"My extreme right-wing opponent has outraised us
Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Friend: With the help of Donald Trump and Betsy DeVos' family, my extreme right-wing opponent has outraised us – for the fourth quarter in a row. The GOP has dumped MILLIONS of dollars into the Michigan race to buy this Senate seat, defeat me and guarantee a Senate majority for Mitch McConnell.
Friend, here’s the good news: Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight reports Democrats can take back the Senate! But our only path to Senate control starts with winning here in Michigan, and recent polling has me TIED with my Trump-backed opponent.
With analysts at CBS News reporting that Michigan could decide Senate control, we’ve set a goal to raise $75,000. But right now, we’re falling short of what we need to win.
Simply put, in a race this close, with our democracy at stake, falling short could very well cost Democrats our chance to take back the Senate.
Friend – I wouldn't ask if it wasn't important: Will you rush $3 or more right now – every dollar you can before midnight – to help us win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

"It’s up to every one of us to make sure we come out victorious on Election Day.
$5 dollars, friend.
A $5 contribution from you today is what it will take for us to win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats. Let me tell you why:
I was just outraised for the FOURTH quarter in a row. That means that for the past YEAR we’ve been outpaced on fundraising every step of the way – and with a recent poll showing this race TIED, losing in Michigan would make it nearly impossible for Democrats to take back the Senate.
And to tip the scales in this race, the DeVos family and right-wing groups are funneling millions into super PACs to buy this seat for McConnell and Trump.
After talking with my finance team, we've set a goal to raise another $15,000 by midnight to win in Michigan and keep this seat blue. Your $5 can make all the difference in getting us there.
You know the stakes, friend. Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight reports Democrats have zero chance at taking back the Senate if we lose in Michigan. It's moments like this – right here, right now – that will determine whether we defend this seat and take back the Senate.
Pitch in $5 now to help us defend Michigan's Senate seat, fight this right-wing spending from Trump and the DeVos family and take back the Senate for Democrats.
It’s up to every one of us to make sure we come out victorious on Election Day. Thanks for fighting with me,
Gary

Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Hey team --
Gary is doing everything he can to save our U.S. Post Office but he needs your support on this. We're in search of 113 more people who live in the 48003 area to add their names next to Gary's before midnight tonight. Can you be the next person to sign?
Add your name to demand Congress take action to save the Post Office by clicking here.
I WANT TO HELP SAVE THE USPS
\----Forwarded message----
Friend, I need to speak with you about a looming crisis to a vital American institution: saving the U.S. Postal Service.
We can no longer count on the Trump administration to lift a finger when it comes to protecting our Postal Service. Unless we act now, mail delays will increase for everyone when it comes to getting packages and prescriptions delivered – and folks in rural communities in Michigan and across the country could be cut off from vital services like vote-by-mail.
And without intervention by Congress, 600,000 federal Postal Service workers could lose their jobs – including many in 48003, friend.
That’s why I’m doing everything in my power to keep the Postal Service operating, and why I need your immediate help: Will you sign my petition and demand Congress intervene to save the Postal Service? We need 20,000 signatures by 11:59 p.m. tonight, but we’re falling 8,737 signatures short with hours to go – and your name is still missing.
SIGN THE PETITION
Thank you,
Gary

"Hi friend, I wanted to take a moment and reach out to you about my husband Gary.
First of all, from the bottom of my heart, I want to say thank you for being a part of this team to help Gary win in Michigan. It means the world to have you fighting so hard alongside us. I don't need to tell you that this race is one of the biggest in the entire country — even Donald Trump himself is focused on winning in Michigan and defeating Gary.
Yesterday, President Trump held a rally in Michigan, where he attacked Gary. Now, the president is known for his lies. But he doesn't know a thing about my husband. I want to tell you exactly who Gary Peters is:
He's the Senator who fights tirelessly for workers and small businesses. He’s the public servant pushing for quality, affordable health care coverage where insurance companies can no longer discriminate because of pre-existing conditions. And as a product of Michigan’s public schools, Gary has always fought for students and has continued to give them the tools they need to reach their full potential.
That's my husband – he's a fighter. For Michigan and our country. But right now, he's in the midst of his toughest election ever.
The stakes of this race have never been higher. Another two years of a Republican-held Senate means two more years of Mitch McConnell calling the shots in Washington. And with a vacancy on the Supreme Court there’s so much at stake: health care protections for pre-existing conditions, Roe v. Wade and women’s health care, civil rights, voting rights and ensuring we’re putting workers before corporate special interests.
My husband's been in tough election fights before, and he's all in to do it again. Believe me, Gary's going to fight tooth and nail to defend this Senate seat – but I'm making a personal ask for you to invest in this fight, too.
Gary's up against the likes of Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and nearly $9 million in dark money from the DeVos family super PAC, all vying to buy this seat for the GOP. That's why I'm reaching out to you today.
His team told me we need to raise another $30,000 right away, and with less than a week until Election Day there's no time to spare. Please, will you consider making a contribution to reelect my husband Gary, win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats?
Here's the best link to donate – whatever you give will go toward keeping Michigan blue and taking back the Senate for Democrats: [[URL REDACTED]]
From the bottom of my heart, thank you. Now let's go win this thing.

Just wanted to make sure you saw the survey Gary sent over yesterday. Our team is going to look over the results first thing Monday morning, and we're hoping to add at least 40 more responses from Almont before this week is over.

Hi friend,
I wanted to reach out to you and your family directly.
Back home in Michigan, my wife Colleen and I have been doing our best to speak with as many Michiganders as we can.
So I want to make sure we stay connected, friend. That’s why I put together a few questions for you. If you have a minute, I’m looking for another 4,000 folks to take this survey and share what’s top of mind for you and your family.
My team and I are planning to go through the responses early next week. I’m looking forward to hearing from you.
Thank you very much. I hope you and those close to you are staying safe and healthy.

"I just checked in with my finance team, and I don’t have good news.
Friend, I just checked in with my finance team, and I don’t have good news: We’re still $4,317 short of our $100,000 end-of-month fundraising goal.
With a brand-new poll showing I’m in a statistical tie with my Trump- and McConnell-backed opponent (and with our race recently downgraded to a toss-up) our fundraising gap is more concerning than ever.
Because here’s the truth about Michigan’s Senate race: Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight says Democrats have ZERO chance to take back the Senate if we lose in Michigan. But I was the only Senate Democrat outraised last quarter, and Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell are still funneling millions into this race.
This is a make-or-break moment for this campaign, friend: In a race this close, with the future of the Senate and the Supreme Court on the line, every dollar could be the difference between winning and losing.
Please, friend, I wouldn't ask if it weren't important: Will you make a contribution of $3 or more now – every dollar you can before midnight – to win in Michigan, take back Senate control for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?
I’m counting on you to help me close this gap and stop Donald Trump’s handpicked extremist from flipping this seat. We can do this, friend.
Thanks for joining me in this critical fight,
Gary

There's no way of sugarcoating this, friend: I was the only Democratic senator to be outraised this summer – and our Trump- and DeVos-backed opponent has outraised us for over a year straight. Friend, it couldn't have come at a worse time, with polls now showing me BEHIND my far-right opponent.

"Mitch McConnell and his Washington Republican allies just launched ANOTHER entirely false attack
THIS IS URGENT, team: Mitch McConnell and his Washington Republican allies just launched ANOTHER entirely false attack against Gary Peters. And now, a recent poll shows Gary losing to his Trump-backed opponent by nearly 2 points.
This is deeply concerning because CBS News reports Democrats have ZERO chance of taking back the Senate if we lose in Michigan.
With Senate control and the future of the Supreme Court at stake, Gary can't afford to fall further behind. But Gary was just outraised by his far-right opponent five times in a row, and Republicans including the DeVos family are spending $25 million to buy Michigan's Senate seat.
That's why we just launched an emergency $25,000 fundraising push to combat these latest attacks – but we're falling WAY short.
Can we count on you to contribute $3 or more now – every dollar you can spare – to win in Michigan, flip the Senate blue and protect the future of the Supreme Court from Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump?

"Friend, hundreds of thousands ballots are already being cast by Michiganders -- and a brand-new New York Times poll shows Gary only ONE POINT ahead of his Trump-backed opponent.
What's worse: Republicans have already dumped over $30 million into this race -- including $7 million from the DeVos family super PAC.
Analysts at CBS News report Senate control is riding on what happens here in Michigan, so we can't afford to fall short. And if the GOP wins here, Mitch McConnell will call the shots in Washington for at least another two years.
That's why a group of fired-up donors JUST made a game-changing offer: They're going to personally MATCH every contribution, dollar for dollar, between now and our final FEC filing deadline tomorrow -- up to $500,000 -- to win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats!
If we're going to hold onto Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats, we must take full advantage of this opportunity. And in a race this close – with Senate control on the line – every dollar could make the difference between winning and losing.
Rush $3 or more right now – and have every dollar DOUBLED – to keep Michigan blue, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court!

"We're getting worried...
Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
We're getting worried, friend: Gary just got outraised by our extremist, Trump-endorsed opponent – for the THIRD time in a row.
And now, Mitch McConnell's NRSC is launching a MASSIVE $3 million TV ad buy to attack Gary. This comes right as Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight and CBS News analysts say that Senate control – and the future of the Supreme Court – will be decided in Michigan.
How we respond now will be the most important moment of this campaign – and thankfully, we just got a HUGE boost:
After hearing that Gary was outraised again, a fired-up group of donors said they would match every donation, dollar for dollar, up to our $50,000 match goal!
Our opponent has the full support of Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and the DeVos family – but Gary has you, friend. Can Gary count on you to donate $3 or more to win in Michigan and flip the Senate blue?
With Mitch McConnell at the helm, Senate Republicans have already confirmed two extreme, right-wing justices to the Supreme Court and threatened to dismantle affordable health care. Honestly, it's never been more important for Democrats to win back the Senate majority.
Experts know that the ONLY way Democrats can take back the Senate is if Gary wins in Michigan. But with the balance of the Supreme Court and the future of our country on the line, Gary's counting on your immediate donation to win in Michigan and flip the Senate blue for Democrats:
Rush $3 – becomes $6 – or whatever you can spare before midnight. Every dollar will be DOUBLED to defend Michigan's Senate seat, take back the Senate and protect the Supreme Court!

"Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Gary’s Trump-backed opponent outraised us for the FOURTH quarter in a row, thanks to special interests and Mitch McConnell funneling money into Michigan. Thankfully, a group of committed donors is upping their offer, but ONLY until midnight TONIGHT: every dollar given until midnight tonight will now be TRIPLE-MATCHED to win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats.
Can you rush $3 or whatever you can afford today? Every dollar of your gift will be TRIPLED if you act now.
Thanks,
Peters for Michigan
\----Forwarded message----
This can’t wait, friend: Thanks to special interests and Mitch McConnell, I was just outraised for the FOURTH quarter in a row – and my team just let me know that we're falling dangerously short of our $75,000 rapid-response goal to close our fundraising gap.
We’re exactly $12,913 short of our goal to win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats. But with just hours until our midnight deadline, we're not on track to come up with what we need to win.
That's why a group of committed donors is upping their offer, but ONLY until midnight: I just got the word that every dollar given until midnight tonight will now be TRIPLE-MATCHED to win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats.
Friend, we MUST take complete advantage of this rare triple-match opportunity because Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight reports that what happens here in Michigan will determine Senate control for the next two years – and a recent poll shows me TIED with my Trump-endorsed opponent.
There is too much at stake to sit on the sidelines: Every dollar triple-matched today will help decide Senate control for Democrats, so rush $3 or more – while every $1 becomes $3 – to defend Michigan's Democratic Senate seat, take back the Senate and protect the future of the Supreme Court!

"Double your impact by stepping up today.
Gary’s Trump-backed opponent just won the GOP primary for Michigan's Senate Seat, and he has Mitch McConnell and Betsy DeVos' billionaire family funneling money into Michigan to support him. Thankfully, a group of committed donors is stepping up to support us, but ONLY until midnight TONIGHT: every dollar given until midnight tonight will now be DOUBLED to win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats.

I'm writing to you with an important update, folks:
John James, the hard-right extremist who has said he backs Trump “2,000%,” won the GOP primary for Michigan's Senate seat.
On top of that, he’s backed by Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and Betsy DeVos’ billionaire family.
CBS News and Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight are reporting that Democrats can only win back the Senate if we first win in Michigan, so we need to secure this seat to ensure victory in November.
Yesterday, we set a rapid-response goal to raise $50,000 immediately, but I just checked in with my team, and we’re falling $26,381 short. Thankfully, a group of fired-up donors is stepping up to personally MATCH every donation to close our budget shortfall, win in Michigan and take back the Senate for Democrats.
Friend – Senate control is on the line here in Michigan: Can I count on you to rush $3 now (becomes $6) to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?
I don’t scare easily, friend – the Republican Party can throw everything they want at me. But I’m now the most-attacked Democratic senator up this year AND the only Democratic senator to be outraised last quarter. We’re up against some serious money and recent polls have us TIED with our Trump-backed opponent.
Democrats MUST win back a Senate majority – and it's possible. This election is our greatest chance yet, but only if we win here in Michigan. So with a group of donors offering to match all donations, I'm asking you to step up too and make an impact that will go twice as far. I wouldn't ask if it weren't critically important:
Will you make a contribution of $3 or more now and have every dollar of it DOUBLED to defend Michigan's Senate seat, take back the Senate for Democrats and protect the future of the Supreme Court?

Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Team – we need you to read this:
First: Trump and his allies funneled MILLIONS of dollars toward buying Gary’s seat to keep their hold on the Senate -- including over $10 MILLION from the DeVos family super PAC.
Then: Polling showed Gary two points BEHIND his far-right opponent.
Now: Trump is coming to Michigan FOUR TIMES in the final week of the race to double down and flip this seat.
Trump's visits between now and Election Day could make all the difference in this razor-thin race. After hearing that we were outraised for over a year and RealClearPolitics moved this race from “Leans Dem” to “Toss-Up”,  a group of donors agreed to an emergency TRIPLE-MATCH offer -- up to $100,000!
Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight reports the ONLY way Democrats can take back the Senate is if we win in Michigan, so we can't afford to pass on this match offer.

The Rachel Maddow Show is exactly right: If you care about flipping the Senate and saving our Supreme Court, you need to pitch in right now. You cannot wait!

But McConnell and his super PAC allies just launched an unprecedented BARRAGE of new attacks against our top Democratic candidates!
If we don't fight back now, ALL of our work will have been for nothing \-- we'll lose the Senate and our Supreme Court.

I have to be honest: If our candidates get outraised again, we'll be put in a terrible bind and may lose our chance to retake the Senate.
In just a few years we've endured Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation, tax cuts for billionaires, rampant corruption, millions at risk of losing health insurance, and unprecedented threats to Social Security.
Now, we can either reclaim control and give Joe Biden a Democratic Senate to rebuild our country, or we can hand Mitch McConnell another two years to continue destroying it.

Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell's corruption is chipping away at our democracy brick by brick. I truly believe that to restore the soul of our nation, we have to do more than win the White House. We have to flip the Senate.
That's why I'm reaching out to you today: This isn't my first campaign, so I know just how critical funding is at this late stage of the race.
Democrats only need to flip four seats to take back the majority -- but right now Mitch McConnell and his super PAC allies are spending tens of millions against our Democratic candidates in key battleground states.
We're up against tough opponents: they play dirty, and they have nearly unlimited resources. But grassroots Democrats like you will be the reason we're able to compete with Republicans' money-making machine.
So can I count on you to pitch in $5 to ensure Democrats flip the Senate? Everything we raise before tonight's deadline will help Senate candidates in key battleground states win their races.

But if we fall short, Mitch McConnell will breathe a BIG sigh of relief knowing senators like Susan Collins and Lindsey Graham are on track to be re-elected.
Please, we're running $33,679 behind our goal and all grassroots gifts are currently being TRIPLE-MATCHED to maximize your impact -- but not for much longer! Rush a donation to help Democrats flip the Senate:
Donate $5 (becomes $20)
Donate $10 (becomes $40)
Donate $25 (becomes $100)
Rush Another Amount
I've said it before and I'll say it again: The most significant election taking place in November won't involve Donald Trump. It will involve vulnerable Senate Republicans in battleground states like Arizona, Colorado, Maine, and North Carolina.
The future of our country is at stake, friend. If Republicans keep control, there won't be meaningful action to reduce gun violence, combat climate change, or expand affordable health care, and we could end up with more Supreme Court justices like Brett Kavanaugh who will dismantle Americans' civil and reproductive rights.
That's why we MUST make electing a Democratic Senate our top priority. Our stellar candidates like Mark Kelly, Jaime Harrison, and Sara Gideon are counting on your help, and it'd be devastating if I had to report back bad news to them.
Given all that's on the line, will you make a TRIPLE-MATCHED gift to make sure Democrats flip the Senate in November? You can click here to make a $5 contribution (remember, it becomes $20!) to end Mitch McConnell's majority:

Of course, Michelle is 100% correct: Nate Silver just released his 2020 presidential election forecast, and it's terrifying for Joe Biden. The data shows that Donald Trump has the EXACT SAME chances of winning as he did in 2016.
With the threat of a Trump victory looming, millions of Democrats are answering Michelle's call to action and have already pledged to vote for Joe Biden! But our database shows you still haven't joined Michelle Obama and pledged to vote:

In a moment, I'm going to ask you to split a $5 contribution between my people-powered campaign and the DSCC. First, let me explain why this request is so important.
Arizona has always been a must-win for Democrats to flip the Senate. But Mitch McConnell is spending millions of dollars against me in Arizona, and the gravity of this election has increased tremendously.
That's why I need you.

Mitch McConnell is spending massive sums to boost my opponent. He just dropped $10.6 million here and Trump has already visited Arizona five times this year.
The future of health care and protections for pre-existing conditions are all on the ballot this November. It's never been more critical that we win here in Arizona.
We've got 31 days to go and there's no time to hold back. Please chip in $5 or even $15 to flip Arizona and defeat Mitch McConnell's majority once and for all.
Thanks for all you do,
Mark Kelly

Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight says our race is a must-win for Democrats to take back the Senate, and recent polling has this race within the margin of error. But my campaign is facing two serious threats that could cost us the election:
1. A dark money group just dropped $2.3 million on negative ads to blanket Arizona in a last-ditch effort to defeat me.
2. Two recent polls have shown we could be behind in this race heading into the final days. One poll has us down by 2 points and the other has us down by 3 points.
This race is coming down to the wire and I need an immediate surge of resources to win.
Right now, we're falling short of our critical midnight goal, and with votes already being cast, failing to meet this deadline simply isn't an option.

I've said it before and I'll say it again: The most significant election taking place in November won't involve Donald Trump. It will involve vulnerable Senate Republicans in battleground states like Arizona, Colorado, Maine, and North Carolina.
The future of our country is at stake, friend. If Republicans keep control, there won't be meaningful action to reduce gun violence, combat climate change, or expand affordable health care, and we could end up with more Supreme Court justices like Brett Kavanaugh who will dismantle Americans' civil and reproductive rights.
That's why we MUST make electing a Democratic Senate our top priority. Our stellar candidates like Mark Kelly, Jaime Harrison, and Sara Gideon are counting on your help, and it'd be devastating if I had to report back bad news to them.

Hey folks,
Theresa Greenfield here, and I'm running for the U.S. Senate in Iowa. My race to flip this Senate seat in Iowa is the closest in the country -- the most recent poll has us down one, 45%-44%, with my Republican opponent.  Can you step up right away to help us flip this seat and take back the Senate for Democrats?
Growing up on my family farm, I never thought I'd run for Senate. But after my first husband died -- leaving me with a thirteen-month-old and another one on the way -- Social Security survivor benefits helped keep my family out of poverty.
So when I heard that my Republican opponent said that she wanted to go ""behind closed doors"" to gut Social Security, it made my blood boil.
I'm a scrappy farm kid, so I never back down from a fight. And boy are we in the fight of our lives to flip this Senate seat. Our race is neck-and-neck, and poll after poll shows it. Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight calls this race a toss-up. That's why Mitch McConnell and his allies are spending over $80 million on our race to stop this grassroots team.
Control of the Senate hinges on Iowa and I need your help. Please, will you rush in $5, or whatever you can, to help my campaign and the DSCC in the home stretch of this race?
For maximum strategic impact, your gift will be split between Theresa Greenfield's campaign and the DSCC.

Iowa is our best shot at taking back the Senate. If we fail, we’re facing another six years of McConnell and Ernst’s ""leadership."" That could mean six more years of folks with pre-existing conditions afraid of losing coverage, inaction on climate change, and our hardworking families suffering.
We cannot let that happen. We need to take back the Senate, and to do that we have to win here in Iowa. But we're running out of time to get our message out. Iowans are already voting, and McConnell and his allies will do -- and spend -- whatever it takes to win.
I'm running this campaign the right way -- without a dime in contributions from corporate PACs. That means I'm counting on grassroots supporters like you to step up right away. Pitch in $5 or more now to help flip this seat and take back the Senate.
Let's get to work,
Theresa

Friend -- this is URGENT:
The experts at Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight say Democrats have a 74% chance of flipping the Senate next Tuesday. But if we beat Lindsey Graham here in South Carolina, our chances of winning Senate control go up!
And the data shows we can beat Lindsey Graham and flip the Senate: Polls have us locked in a dead heat -- 48% to 47% \-- and experts are calling this race a true ""toss-up.""
But we just got some bad news: Mitch McConnell and his super PAC allies have begun dumping tens of MILLIONS of dollars into South Carolina to save Lindsey Graham -- and if we don't fight back, our very narrow lead will disappear.
We can’t let that happen -- we have never been this close to defeating Lindsey Graham and FINALLY ending Mitch McConnell’s disastrous Senate majority.
But right now, we're falling dangerously behind the GOP's massive fundraising, and with polls tightening, we're running out of time to close the gap. That’s why I’m counting on your help right now:
We need to raise $50,000 by midnight tonight to send Lindsey home and get our campaign back on track. So please, rush $5, or whatever you can, right now to defeat Lindsey Graham and flip the Senate!

This has been a long and frustrating year, friend -- for a lot of us, it’s been a long and frustrating four years. But when times get tough, I remember what my grandparents told me time and time again while I was growing up: “You work hard, you help others and you give back like so many others have done for you.”
I’m ready to work hard for the state of South Carolina and our whole country. I'm ready to fight until every American has access to affordable health care, until we have a Supreme Court that shares our values, and until everyone has a say in our democracy.
I’m ready to defeat Lindsey Graham. I just need your help to make it happen.
Please, with health care and the future of the Supreme Court on the line, will you split a donation between my campaign and the DSCC to win this tipping-point state and flip the Senate? Every dollar will be used immediately in this final stretch to defeat Lindsey Graham, flip the Senate, and save our Supreme Court. >>
With your help, I know we can win this race and the Senate majority. I can’t thank you enough.

U.S. Senate candidate, South Carolina
Jaime Harrison overcame the challenges of poverty to achieve his American dream. From a mobile home to Yale, to key leadership roles in government, he's led an inspiring life in service to others. Now he's depending on grassroots donors like you to step up and help him defeat Lindsey Graham.

I have to be honest: If our candidates get outraised again, we'll be put in a terrible bind and may lose our chance to retake the Senate.
In just a few years we've endured Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation, tax cuts for billionaires, rampant corruption, millions at risk of losing health insurance, and unprecedented threats to Social Security.
Now, we can either reclaim control and give Joe Biden a Democratic Senate to rebuild our country, or we can hand Mitch McConnell another two years to continue destroying it.
The stakes are too high to not give this everything we've got, so please:

I've said it before and I'll say it again: The most significant election taking place in November won't involve Donald Trump. It will involve vulnerable Senate Republicans in battleground states like Arizona, Colorado, Maine, and North Carolina.
The future of our country is at stake, friend. If Republicans keep control, there won't be meaningful action to reduce gun violence, combat climate change, or expand affordable health care, and we could end up with more Supreme Court justices like Brett Kavanaugh who will dismantle Americans' civil and reproductive rights.

Friend -- I'm running for re-election in Michigan and I've got some extremely important updates on this race for you:
1. While I've received endorsements from President Obama and Vice President Biden, my opponent is a far-right extremist who says he backs Trump ""2,000%.""
2. Sadly, he's outraised our Democratic campaign FOUR quarters in a row, AND Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell's allies, like the Koch super PAC, are funneling in MILLIONS to buy this seat.
3. But here's the hardest news to share: RealClearPolitics just moved this race to ""Toss Up"" \-- and a recent poll shows me trailing nearly two points BEHIND my opponent.
I’ll be blunt with you: The only way we can elect a Democratic Senate for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris is if we WIN in Michigan... but I was the only Democratic senator outraised this summer.
That’s why I set a goal to raise $25,000 today -- but we’re still $13,884 short of what we need to win.
This is the most important election of our lifetimes, and I need your help: Will you split $5 or more between my campaign and the DSCC to win in Michigan, take back the Senate for Democrats, and save the future of the Supreme Court?

Do you APPROVE or DISAPPROVE of Mitch McConnell's COVID response?
APPROVE
DISAPPROVE
Team -- In a recent debate, Amy McGrath called out Mitch McConnell on his REFUSAL to pass new coronavirus relief. And that's when it happened:
A smile lit up McConnell's face and he cackled laughing.
Even as coronavirus cases surge nationwide, McConnell is RAMMING forward a far-right Supreme Court nominee and BLOCKING House-passed legislation to fight COVID-19.
McConnell's priorities are clear, but what's unknown is how YOU feel about it. Thousands of Democrats are answering our live poll and we need just three more responses in 48003 within the hour:
Do you APPROVE or DISAPPROVE of Mitch McConnell's COVID response?
APPROVE
DISAPPROVE

BREAKING: McConnell BLINDSIDES Democrats with $92 million attack blitz -- Democrats now being dangerously outspent in key Senate races
'[[URL REDACTED]]'s the time!' - The Rachel Maddow Show
The Rachel Maddow Show is exactly right: Our ONLY hope to defeat McConnell's MASSIVE attack blitz is if millions of good Democrats step up right now! Please, rush in $5 before it's too late:

Team --
We just got word that the McConnell-linked super PAC raised an unprecedented $92 million in the last month, ERASING the financial advantage our Democrats had in key Senate races.
According to breaking press reports, this means Democratic Senate candidates will be outspent in the final stretch of the election UNLESS grassroots Democrats send them an unprecedented surge of support.
We've never faced a threat this massive. Our ONLY hope to fight back and win is to raise $25,000 in the next 24 hours. If we don't, ALL of our work over the last few years will have been for nothing:
Please, rush in $5 to help hit our EMERGENCY $25,000 goal. This is our ONCE IN A LIFETIME shot to defeat McConnell and flip the Senate -- we can't let it slip away now >>

CHIP IN $5
Friend --
I've been a combat pilot. An astronaut. A father and a husband. And now, I'm running to be the next Senator for Arizona.
Through it all, I've learned the importance of asking for help when you need it, especially when facing a difficult situation.
So I'll be blunt with you: I need your help right now if I'm going to flip this Republican-held seat and defeat Mitch McConnell's majority. >>
Your contribution will be split between Mark Kelly's campaign and the DSCC.
Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight says our race is a must-win for Democrats to take back the Senate, and poll after poll has shown Arizona is a toss-up. But my campaign is facing two serious threats that could cost us the election:
1. Mitch McConnell and his allies are spending MILLIONS on attack ads to defeat me.
2. Even more troubling, my GOP opponent had a fundraising advantage in our last pre-primary fundraising report.
I need an immediate surge of resources to fight back and win. But right now, we're falling short of our critical midnight goal, and failing to meet this deadline simply isn't an option.
So I'm humbly asking you: Will you chip in $5 today to help my campaign and the DSCC win in Arizona and defeat Mitch McConnell's majority? Your contribution before midnight would mean the world to me >>

Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee
'We must elect a Democratic Senate majority' - Carole
DONATE $5 (BECOMES $20)
Friend, as the days grow shorter, I've been thinking about everything that's at stake for us and our children in the upcoming elections. And that’s why I’m reaching out today to ask you to chip in to help elect Democratic Senate candidates.
We have some terrific candidates, and we have a real chance to flip the Senate! But the DSCC is facing a critical fundraising deadline on Wednesday, and that’s why I’m asking you personally to make a donation of $5 today, or whatever you can afford. Every dollar really does make a difference!
I could spend all day listing the reasons we MUST flip the Senate this year, but here are three of the most urgent reasons why I donated to the DSCC, and why I hope you will, too:
* After the passing of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the future of the Supreme Court dropped into the waiting hands of Mitch McConnell. When President Obama nominated Merrick Garland in 2016, McConnell wouldn’t even schedule a hearing, let alone a vote -- which Judge Garland could have won! Mitch’s rationale was that it was an election year.
Well, THIS is an election year, but because it’s Trump’s nominee, Mitch’s 2016 rationale is out the window.
* If we fail to deliver a Democratic Senate, the bold, progressive agenda of, God willing, President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, will be STONEWALLED by Mitch McConnell and his band of fall-in-line, obstructionist Senate Republicans.
* McConnell has refused to bring more than 400 House-passed bills to the floor, including the Heroes Act to help Americans get through this overwhelming time. Bringing bills to the floor is Mitch’s JOB!
Friend, we need to remind Mitch and his out-of-tune band of Republicans that We The People have the power to make them pay for their failure to do their JOB by electing a decisive Democratic Senate Majority!
This is a fight we truly CANNOT afford to lose, and that’s why I’m asking you to pitch in.
The folks at the DSCC tell me they’re $167,460 short of their end-of-quarter fundraising goal, and they need an immediate surge of resources to flip the Senate.
This may be a difficult time, but please give whatever you can afford right now. We NEED to fight back, and the need is even more urgent because early voting is already underway in some states.
The DSCC is a vital part of the effort to save our country from Mitch McConnell's dangerous Republican majority. I’m proud to support this organization, and I hope you'll join me: With just days to go until the Wednesday end-of-quarter deadline, will you donate $5 or more now to flip the Senate?
DONATE $5 (BECOMES $20)
DONATE $10 (BECOMES $40)
DONATE $25 (BECOMES $100)
RUSH ANOTHER AMOUNT
From the bottom of my heart, thank you.
Don’t give up. It will get better, and we will get through this.

Friend,
Yesterday, Mitch McConnell and Senate Republicans confirmed Trump's THIRD far-right Supreme Court nominee, just eight days before the election.
Frankly, it was a devastating outcome. But now, it's up to all of us to make Republicans pay.
We have just ONE WEEK left to flip the Senate and finally end Mitch McConnell's iron grip on power. And I promise, if we all take action now, Mitch will feel the FULL FORCE of our anger, our outrage, and our grassroots power when he loses everything on November 3rd.
Every dollar we give, every action we take over the next 24 hours will determine whether Democrats flip the Senate.
So please, rush $5 or more right now. All gifts are being triple-matched for a very limited time, and if we stand together, we will flip the Senate and end McConnell's hypocrisy once and for all. >>

I've said it before and I'll say it again: The most significant election taking place in November won't involve Donald Trump. It will involve vulnerable Senate Republicans in battleground states like Arizona, Colorado, Maine, and North Carolina.
The future of our country is at stake, friend. If Republicans keep control, there won't be meaningful action to reduce gun violence, combat climate change, or expand affordable health care, and we could end up with more Supreme Court justices like Brett Kavanaugh who will dismantle Americans' civil and reproductive rights.
That's why we MUST make electing a Democratic Senate our top priority. Our stellar candidates like Mark Kelly, Jaime Harrison, and Sara Gideon are counting on your help, and it'd be devastating if I had to report back bad news to them.
Given all that's on the line, will you make a TRIPLE-MATCHED gift to make sure Democrats flip the Senate in November? You can click here to make a $5 contribution (remember, it becomes $20!) to end Mitch McConnell's majority:

Let me be clear: Pledge To Vote data is crucial to our strategy in the final stretch of this election.
Nate Silver just announced that Trump is gaining ground in the polls, including in battleground swing states -- and we're desperately trying to determine whether Joe Biden can drive enough Democratic turnout to win.
So please, submit your response right now:
Will you pledge to vote for Joe Biden in Michigan?
Yes, I support Joe!
No, I support Trump.

URGENT: Michelle Obama just sounded the alarm about Trump's ability to win in 2020. She explained that Joe Biden will need HISTORIC Democratic turnout to defeat him!
Of course, Michelle is 100% correct: Nate Silver just released his 2020 presidential election forecast, and it's terrifying for Joe Biden. The data shows that Donald Trump has the EXACT SAME chances of winning as he did in 2016.
With the threat of a Trump victory looming, millions of Democrats are answering Michelle's call to action and have already pledged to vote for Joe Biden! But our database shows you still haven't joined Michelle Obama and pledged to vote:

Nate Silver's new Senate forecast has Democrats winning in FOUR key races and gives us a chance to defeat at least 12 GOP senators, including Lindsey Graham and McConnell himself.
The momentum is on our side, but RIGHT NOW Senate Republicans are holding hearings to ram through Trump's far-right Supreme Court nominee. And with the future of the court on the line, McConnell and Trump are raising MILLIONS to save their majority.
That's why, effective immediately, we've activated an emergency TRIPLE-MATCH to fight back, flip the Senate, and save our Supreme Court!
We urgently need to raise $100,000 before tomorrow's FEC deadline -- it's the LAST FEC deadline of the 2020 election. Please rush a TRIPLE-MATCHED $5 donation to make sure our Democrats have what it takes to flip the Senate and save our Supreme Court >>

* Orchestrate a SHAM impeachment trial that resulted in Donald Trump's acquittal.
* Block bills to help prevent gun violence and combat climate change.
* Threaten cuts to Social Security and Medicare.
But now we can FINALLY do something about it.
The Senate is up for grabs, our candidates are pulling ahead, and Joe Biden is leading Trump in presidential polls. We're counting on YOUR help today to make sure we elect a Democratic Senate that will support Joe and Kamala's agenda!

"I'm running for the U.S. Senate against Mitch McConnell -- and with your help, we can win this race.
Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee
'I need your help right now...' - Amy McGrath
CHIP IN $5
Friend,
I'm running for the U.S. Senate against Sen. Mitch McConnell. And I need your help.
Defeating McConnell won't be easy, but I'm up to the challenge. I served 20 years in the Marines, flew 89 combat missions in Iraq and Afghanistan, and overcame the odds to become the first woman Marine to fly a combat mission in an F/A-18 fighter jet.
We can win this race. Independent polling shows that I'm within one point of beating him. And two internal polls we released show the race is virtually tied.
But McConnell has already built up a massive $16.6 million war chest and he's flooding the airwaves with vicious attack ads and smears against me.
I'll need your support right now to run the campaign it will take to defeat him.
So I'm humbly asking you -- will you split a $5 donation to help me defeat McConnell? Your donation will be put to work immediately and it won't just help unseat McConnell -- it will help the DSCC flip the Senate majority for Democrats.
When I was 13, I dreamed of becoming a fighter pilot, but women weren't allowed to serve in combat roles in our military. So I wrote to my elected officials to ask them to change the law. I never heard back from my senator -- McConnell. He wasn't listening then, and he's not listening now.
Kentuckians want a senator who will improve health care and protect Social Security and Medicare. But McConnell tried to rip health care away from Kentuckians, including those with pre-existing conditions. And to top it all off, he recently announced his plan to slash Medicare and Social Security, after his massive tax cuts for the top 1%.
Folks around here know McConnell isn't listening, and they're ready for a change. But I'll need your help to make it happen.
Please, will you split a $5 donation to support my campaign and Democrats running for Senate across the country? Together, we can flip the Senate and defeat Mitch McConnell once and for all.

Amy McGrath

Our nation is at a crossroads, and we only have two choices:
Either we allow Mitch McConnell to keep control of the Senate and decide the future of our Supreme Court, or we win back the Senate so Joe Biden can appoint a fair-minded justice to succeed Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
We absolutely must retake the Senate, friend, but right now we're facing a serious threat that could cost us the election.
McConnell-aligned super PACs just booked tens of millions of dollars' worth of TV ads in key Senate races, and with a critical fundraising deadline coming up, our Democratic Senate candidates are falling short of what they need to fight back.
Please, friend, I'm personally asking you to please pitch in $5 right now to help Democrats retake the Senate and win the most critical election in generations >>
The Trump era has been a disaster for our country, and I know you're ready to turn the page.
We believe in building an America that supports senior citizens with benefits like Social Security, an America that ensures no one is going without food in order to pay for medications, and an America with a Supreme Court that shares our values.
But the only way we can make our vision real is if Democrats retake the Senate this November.
Friend, this is going to be a tough battle, but believe me when I tell you that we can win and secure health care, Social Security, and the future of our Supreme Court along the way.
So please, friend: Don't wake up on November 4th wishing you had stepped up when it mattered. Step up now. Please pitch in $5 to do your part in helping Democrats hit this critical fundraising goal and retake the Senate.

"The future of America depends on what we do now.
Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee
Friend -- My dad was a shipyard worker who often worked overtime to help raise six kids, and my mom was a librarian. I remember my dad's calloused hands and worn boots. I remember their conversations about how they would pay the bills and keep a roof over our heads.
Growing up, my parents struggled to make ends meet -- and they weren't alone. Working-class families like ours had a tough time getting ahead in America. And Republicans are making it even harder for families today.
They're ignoring the needs of working Americans and instead putting all their energy into amassing power, suppressing votes, destroying our institutions, and now, stealing another Supreme Court seat. With the future of the Senate and our Supreme Court on the line, I'm reaching out for your help in this fight.
Senate Democrats are fighting back against Republicans' destructive agenda, but right now, they're falling $23,106 short of what they need to raise by midnight tonight to flip the Senate. Can I count on you to chip in a gift of $5 to make sure Democrats have the resources they need to win?
We cannot just sit back while Mitch McConnell dismantles the progress we've fought so hard for. He already stole one Supreme Court seat from President Obama, and now he's trying to steal another.
We can stop this sabotage. We can protect our families, our futures, and our democracy. It all depends on what we do right now.
But if we fall short, Mitch McConnell will breathe a BIG sigh of relief knowing senators like Susan Collins and Lindsey Graham are on track to be re-elected.
The future of our country is at stake. If Republicans keep control, there won't be meaningful action to reduce gun violence, combat climate change, or expand affordable health care, and we could end up with a Supreme Court that will dismantle Americans' civil and reproductive rights.
To create change in America, we must put all our energy, enthusiasm -- and yes, some money -- into winning the Senate. It will be a tough fight, though experts like Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight confirm we can flip control -- but we're running out of time to do it.
So I'm asking, as we come down to the wire: Will you pitch in $5 or more right now -- as much as you can before midnight -- to help Democrats win key races across the country, flip the Senate, and protect the future of the Supreme Court? We can make America a place where anyone can get ahead, but only with your immediate help.
Thanks for standing with me,

I've served our country as a combat pilot and an astronaut. And now, I'm running to serve the great state of Arizona.
This campaign is the most intimidating thing I've done since the first time I walked up to a space shuttle, but the importance of asking for help when you need it is as important now as it was then.

Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight says our race is a must-win for Democrats to take back the Senate, and recent polling has this race within the margin of error. But my campaign is facing two serious threats that could cost us the election:
1. A dark money group just dropped $2.3 million on negative ads to blanket Arizona in a last-ditch effort to defeat me.
2. Even more troubling, Donald Trump has taken to personally attacking me on his frequent trips to Arizona.
This race is coming down to the wire and I need an immediate surge of resources to win.
Right now, we're falling short of our critical midnight goal, and with votes already being cast, failing to meet this deadline simply isn't an option.
So I'm urgently asking you: Will you chip in $5 today to help my campaign and the DSCC win in Arizona and defeat Mitch McConnell's majority? I won't be able to win on November 3rd without your support >>

WE'RE SOUNDING THE ALARM. With less than 30 days until the most important election in history, we NEED to raise another $4,181 by midnight if we want ANY chance at flipping the Senate. But our fundraising is falling short and we're running out of time:
Please, will you donate $5 or more now -- before the midnight deadline -- to turn out Democratic voters, flip the Senate, and protect the Supreme Court? >>

'I'm humbly asking you...' - Pete Buttigieg
DONATE $5 (BECOMES $20)
If you want to bring about real change, retake the Senate, and save the Supreme Court, please pitch in $5 (worth $20) immediately. Election Day is only five days away, and any gift you give today will be put to use immediately to help Democratic candidates in our most critical battleground states.
We are facing a make-or-break moment in our nation's history.
This week, the Republican Senate chose to prioritize confirming a Supreme Court nominee whose ideology will threaten countless hard-earned rights and health care for millions over providing badly needed coronavirus relief to Americans.
This is our one chance to end Mitch McConnell's era of chaos. But as it stands, Democratic Senate candidates are at risk of being dangerously outspent in the crucial final stretch after a McConnell-aligned super PAC raised an unprecedented $92 million last month.
Here's the truth: The Supreme Court is on the line and McConnell's super PAC allies are spending millions attacking Democrats. So now more than ever, we know we cannot afford to get this wrong.
We only have five more days to elect a Democratic Senate and save the Supreme Court. So please, pitch in a gift of $5, $10, or even $25 before tonight's deadline to help Democrats retake the Senate.
We need your help to flip the Senate. If you've saved payment info with ActBlue Express, your donation will be processed immediately. Donate $5 (becomes $20)

If you share my deep sense of alarm over what a Trump-appointed, conservative Supreme Court majority will mean for America, please pitch in $5 (worth $20) today to deliver Joe and Kamala a Democratic Senate. The final public fundraising deadline before Election Day is tonight, and my friends at the DSCC need 20 more grassroots donations in Michigan to reach their must-hit fundraising goal.
What we're watching take place in Washington is a destructive charade.
The Republican Senate refuses to even debate on another coronavirus relief bill, and is instead choosing to ram forward a Supreme Court nominee who would put countless hard-earned rights in jeopardy, including protections for pre-existing conditions, marriage equality, and Roe v. Wade.
We are up against a lot right now. But here's the truth: With the Supreme Court on the line and Mitch McConnell's super PAC allies spending millions and millions against Democrats in key Senate races, your $5 donation couldn't be any more important.
Our nation is at a crossroads and every generous donation helps Democrats end Trump and McConnell's era of chaos.
Tonight is the FINAL public fundraising deadline of the election. So please, pitch in a gift of $5, $10, or even $20 to help retake the Senate. Donating now is the single most impactful way you can help save the future of the Supreme Court.

"I'll be hosting a virtual grassroots fundraiser tomorrow, and I'd really like to see you there.
Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee
Friend -- This election is about more than the names at the top of the ticket. It's about supporting great candidates up and down the ballot -- including Democrats who are fighting to flip the Senate.
That's why I'm excited to announce I'll be hosting a virtual grassroots event tomorrow, October 16 to raise money for some outstanding Democrats in tight Senate races -- and I'm calling on you to join me. All you have to do to secure your spot is make a gift of $5, $10, or whatever fits into your budget.
Donate $5
Our country's future hangs on what we do over the next few weeks. It's up to all of us to join together and elect a whole bunch of Democrats to the Senate who are ready to create change. I'm talking about folks like:
* Sen. Gary Peters (D-MI), an effective leader who's in a tougher re-election fight than just about any Democratic senator. Gary needs our help to hold his pivotal Senate seat.
* Theresa Greenfield (D-IA), a resilient daughter of farmers and a small business leader who Iowans can count on. Theresa's going to protect Social Security and affordable health care, but she needs our help to win.
* MJ Hegar (D-TX), a combat veteran and working mom whose tenacity and compassion will win progress for Texans of all stripes. MJ can flip this seat with our help.
* Jon Ossoff (D-GA), an investigative journalist who is committed to investing in infrastructure, clean energy, and strengthening our civil rights laws. Jon is neck-and-neck in recent polls and could pull ahead with our support.
* Rev. Raphael Warnock (D-GA), a fierce advocate for health care access, voting rights, and the dignity of working people who has dedicated his life to service. Rev. Warnock presides over Dr. King's former pulpit at Ebenezer Baptist Church, and he needs our help to make history as Georgia's first-ever Black senator.
Whether these candidates win or lose depends on what we do now, together, to support them before Election Day. That's why I'm personally asking for your support -- and your attendance at tomorrow's big event.
Please, if you haven't yet, will you chip in $5 to help Democrats flip the Senate? I'll have much more to say at tomorrow's event, but your $5 will make a bigger impact if it's made today.

"I'm running for the U.S. Senate against Mitch McConnell -- and with your help, we can win this race.
Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee
'I need your help right now...' - Amy McGrath
CHIP IN $5
Friend,
I'm running for the U.S. Senate against Sen. Mitch McConnell. And I need your help.
Defeating McConnell won't be easy, but I'm up to the challenge. I served 20 years in the Marines, flew 89 combat missions in Iraq and Afghanistan, and overcame the odds to become the first woman Marine to fly a combat mission in an F/A-18 fighter jet.
We can win this race. Independent polling shows that I'm within one point of beating him. And two internal polls we released show the race is virtually tied.
But McConnell has already built up a massive $16.6 million war chest and he's flooding the airwaves with vicious attack ads and smears against me.
I'll need your support right now to run the campaign it will take to defeat him.
So I'm humbly asking you -- will you split a $5 donation to help me defeat McConnell? Your donation will be put to work immediately and it won't just help unseat McConnell -- it will help the DSCC flip the Senate majority for Democrats.
When I was 13, I dreamed of becoming a fighter pilot, but women weren't allowed to serve in combat roles in our military. So I wrote to my elected officials to ask them to change the law. I never heard back from my senator -- McConnell. He wasn't listening then, and he's not listening now.
Kentuckians want a senator who will improve health care and protect Social Security and Medicare. But McConnell tried to rip health care away from Kentuckians, including those with pre-existing conditions. And to top it all off, he recently announced his plan to slash Medicare and Social Security, after his massive tax cuts for the top 1%.
Folks around here know McConnell isn't listening, and they're ready for a change. But I'll need your help to make it happen.
Please, will you split a $5 donation to support my campaign and Democrats running for Senate across the country? Together, we can flip the Senate and defeat Mitch McConnell once and for all.
[[URL REDACTED]]
Thank you,
Amy McGrath
U.S. Senate candidate, Kentucky
Amy McGrath is a retired Marine Corps fighter pilot, a mom of three, and a lifelong Kentuckian running to defeat Mitch McConnell. The latest polling shows her TIED with Mitch McConnell -- and now she's depending on grassroots donors like you to step up and help her win this critical race.

My fellow Democrats,
I have to tell you: Never in my life have I worried more about America's future. Donald Trump is reckless, dishonest, and a threat to our most sacred constitutional rights.
But it's Mitch McConnell and Senate Republicans who've enabled his destructiveness. They've put themselves before our country and they MUST be defeated.
Defeating them is so urgent that I'm asking you personally: Will you give $5 or more to help Democrats defeat Mitch McConnell, flip the Senate and save our Supreme Court? This close to Election Day, every dollar truly makes a difference >>
We're all living through such a grave situation.
Practically every day, we are blindsided by news of yet another crisis. But we cannot lose sight of the fact that Trump and Senate Republicans are chipping away at the cornerstones of our democracy.
They've spread reckless lies about the coronavirus, undermined confidence in our elections, and are now working to confirm a Supreme Court justice who may vote to eliminate the Affordable Care Act and overturn Roe v. Wade.
This isn't a time for pettiness or hesitation. We must dig down and give everything we've got to elect Joe Biden and a Democratic Senate in order to FINALLY address the needs of the people.
Please, I'm supporting the DSCC and I need YOU to join me. Chip in $5 to help Democrats defeat Mitch McConnell and flip the Senate. It's the only way we'll be able to save our democracy >>

* THEN: McConnell's super PAC launched an UNPRECEDENTED wave of attack ads against Democrats in our SIX most critical battleground states.
* AND NOW: Senate polls are tightening, and Republicans just raised an ADDITIONAL $100 MILLION to crush our momentum -- If supporters like you REFUSE to chip in, Democrats will almost CERTAINLY lose!
Kamala Harris asked you. Joe Biden asked you. Barack Obama asked you -- DOZENS of Democratic leaders have asked!
And now, with Republicans voting on Justice Ginsburg's replacement at ANY moment, we need to ask again for $5 so Democrats can flip the Senate and save our Supreme Court.
Please, we won't get another chance at this. We either hit tonight's goal to defeat McConnell's majority or fall short and accept the consequences. Rush in a TRIPLE-MATCHED donation right now! >>

Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee
'I need you to help...' - Pete Buttigieg
DONATE $5 (BECOMES $20)
If you share my deep sense of alarm over what a Trump-appointed, conservative Supreme Court majority will mean for America, please pitch in $5 (worth $20) today to deliver Joe and Kamala a Democratic Senate. There's a critical deadline tonight, and my friends at the DSCC need 16 more grassroots donations in Michigan to reach their must-hit fundraising goal.
What we're watching take place in Washington is a destructive charade.
The Republican Senate refuses to even debate on another coronavirus relief bill, and is instead choosing to ram forward a Supreme Court nominee who would put countless hard-earned rights in jeopardy, including protections for pre-existing conditions, marriage equality, and Roe v. Wade.
We are up against a lot right now. But here's the truth: With the Supreme Court on the line and Mitch McConnell's super PAC allies spending millions and millions against Democrats in key Senate races, your $5 donation couldn't be any more important.
Our nation is at a crossroads and every generous donation helps Democrats end Trump and McConnell's era of chaos.
So please, pitch in a gift of $5, $10, or even $20 before tonight's deadline to help Democrats retake the Senate. Donating now is the single most impactful way you can help save the future of the Supreme Court.

I have to be honest: If our candidates get outraised again, we'll be put in a terrible bind and may lose our chance to retake the Senate.
In just a few years we've endured Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation, tax cuts for billionaires, rampant corruption, millions at risk of losing health insurance, and unprecedented threats to Social Security.
Now, we can either reclaim control and give Joe Biden a Democratic Senate to rebuild our country, or we can hand Mitch McConnell another two years to continue destroying it.

"I want you to imagine two scenarios. Stay with me here:
It's the morning after Election Day. You jump out of bed. Pour yourself a cup of coffee. Switch on the TV to find out who won those Senate races, the ones that were neck-and-neck when you went to sleep -- the ones that Rachel Maddow said would determine control of the Senate.
In the first scenario, you chose to give a final $5 with this link. And the first thing you see on TV is ""Democrats flip the Senate, McConnell out of power."" Democrats like Mark Kelly and Jaime Harrison have WON by a handful of votes. Your coffee tastes incredible!
But there's a second scenario too. Wake up, coffee, TV on. But in this scenario, you chose NOT to pitch in that final $5. And by just a few votes, key Republican senators have held onto their seats -- and Mitch McConnell has maintained his majority. Your coffee doesn't just taste terrible. It tastes like regret.
You've still got a few hours left to choose one of those two scenarios. But if you wait any longer, it will be too late. Please don't wake up on November 4th wishing you had done more. Make a final donation by clicking a button below and it will be put to use immediately to help Democrats in the states that are going to decide this election:

I'll be blunt: That awful second scenario I explained earlier -- a repeat of 2016 -- could easily happen again.
The latest Senate polls show our Democrats TIED in key races across the country. And with Election Day tomorrow, Mitch McConnell's allies have raised nearly $150 MILLION to spend on a last-minute attack ad blitz.
Right now, every single dollar counts. And it could be YOUR donation that makes the difference for Mark Kelly in Arizona or Theresa Greenfield in Iowa. It could be YOUR donation that flips the Senate!
So please, pitch in $5 (becomes $20) right now to flip the Senate and retire Mitch McConnell. On November 4th, I want my coffee to taste like victory. How about you?

Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight says our race is a must-win for Democrats to take back the Senate, and recent polling has this race within the margin of error. But my campaign is facing two serious threats that could cost us the election:
1. A dark money group just dropped $2.3 million on negative ads to blanket Arizona in a last-ditch effort to defeat me.
2. Two recent polls have shown we could be behind in this race heading into the final days. One poll has us down by 2 points and the other has us down by 3 points.
This race is coming down to the wire and I need an immediate surge of resources to win.
Right now, we're falling short of our critical midnight goal, and with votes already being cast, failing to meet this deadline simply isn't an option.
So I'm urgently asking you: Will you chip in $5 today to help my campaign and the DSCC win in Arizona and defeat Mitch McConnell's majority? I won't be able to win on November 3rd without your support >>
Full speed ahead!
Mark Kelly
Democrat for U.S. Senate, Arizona
Mark Kelly
Former U.S. Navy combat pilot, engineer, and NASA astronaut Mark Kelly is running for Arizona's Senate seat. He's fighting for access to affordable health care, to protect Social Security and Medicare, and make sure we rebuild our economy for everyone.
Will you help Mark Kelly overcome Mitch McConnell's megadonors and flip another Senate seat in Arizona?

"Reaching out again for your critical insights.
We reached out to a select group of top Democrats to gauge support for the Biden-Harris ticket after a troubling polling update from Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight.
But unfortunately, not enough top Democrats have recorded their responses to our poll. So right now, we're on track to fall 17 responses short in 48003 of reaching statistical significance.
This is a big deal: If Nate Silver's data is accurate, we'll have to completely restructure our strategy for the final 40 days, and if we don't hit our response goal, we won't have the critical information we need to prepare for the final push to Election Day.
Our final-stretch election strategy depends on the responses we get here, and this close to Election Day, we can't afford to lose any more time. So please, submit your response now:

Team -- Nate Silver just gave us some bad news: Trump could still win this election. He just released his vaunted 2020 presidential election prediction model and according to the data, Trump has the EXACT SAME chances of winning as he did in 2016!
We MUST ensure Democrats are ready to turn out in historic numbers to avoid a devastating repeat of 2016. We will ONLY defeat Trump if top Democrats like you turn out in numbers large enough to defeat the GOP's voter suppression strategy. That's why we're contacting top supporters to confirm that Joe and Kamala's support is strong enough to beat Trump \-- but as of right now, this live poll is still missing your response.
Please, tell us where you stand immediately:
Will you vote for the Biden-Harris ticket in November?

Election Day is just eight days away and Democrats are still TIED in three must-win Senate races!
New polling shows these states are so razor-close that anything could tip the scales over the next few days. And with control of the Senate at stake, GOP megadonors just donated millions to DESTROY our Democratic candidates and save McConnell's majority.

A message from Cal Cunningham
Rush $5 immediately to Cal Cunningham's Democratic campaign and the DSCC to win in North Carolina, defeat McConnell's majority, and save the Supreme Court! >>
DONATE $5
Team -- Mitch McConnell can't believe what's happening in North Carolina:
Poll after poll shows that Democrat Cal Cunningham can WIN! But North Carolina is on track to be one of the MOST expensive Senate races in HISTORY and McConnell's allies are spending over $60 MILLION to attack Cal.
If Democrats pull together to fight back, then Mitch McConnell can say goodbye to his Republican majority. But if Democrats grow complacent and stop chipping in $5 or $10 to emails like this, Mitch McConnell will BLOCK Joe Biden's agenda and continue his right-wing TAKEOVER of the Supreme Court.
We can't let that happen. We set a goal to raise $25,000 for Cal before midnight, but we're on track to fall DANGEROUSLY short.
Please, there's no more time to wait. Split $5 or more between Cal's campaign and the DSCC right now to win in North Carolina and flip the Senate >>

I have to be honest: If our candidates get outraised again, we'll be put in a terrible bind and may lose our chance to retake the Senate.
In just a few years we've endured Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation, tax cuts for billionaires, rampant corruption, millions at risk of losing health insurance, and unprecedented threats to Social Security.
Now, we can either reclaim control and give Joe Biden a Democratic Senate to rebuild our country, or we can hand Mitch McConnell another two years to continue destroying it.

Emergency Match to DEFEAT McConnell
DONATE $5 (BECOMES $20)
Mitch McConnell is just DAYS AWAY from losing his precious Senate majority -- but news just broke that GOP mega-donors are rallying for an UNPRECEDENTED ad blitz that could CRUSH Democrats in key battlegrounds at the 11th hour!
WE MUST FIGHT BACK if we’re going to defend Democrats like Jaime Harrison and Mark Kelly and flip the Senate. That's why, after careful consideration, Senate Democrats have activated an emergency TRIPLE MATCH -- but we're still falling $23,178 short of what we need to win.
Please, friend, will you give as much as you can so Democratic candidates have what it takes to win tough races and flip the Senate? Every dollar will be triple matched to end McConnell's grip on the Senate >>
DONATE $5 (BECOMES $20)
With just days to go, the race for Senate control couldn’t be tighter -- and grassroots donations for Democrats could not be more critical. Here’s what you need to know:
FIRST, Nate Silver's new Senate forecast predicted Democrats winning in FOUR key races and gave us a chance to defeat at least 12 GOP senators, including Lindsey Graham and McConnell himself.
THEN, Mitch McConnell called an emergency meeting and BEGGED GOP mega-donors and lobbyists to pony up and save the Senate for Trump and Republicans.
NOW, McConnell’s allies are trying to buy the Senate in the eleventh hour: They’ve dropped $271 MILLION on ads to drown out our Democrats and keep the Senate in GOP hands.
If we don’t fight back now, we’ll lose our ONLY chance to flip the Senate for ANOTHER two years. That's why this triple match opportunity is so important -- but with just hours until our deadline, we’re still falling dangerously short of our goal.
Friend, we wouldn’t ask if it weren’t important: Please, give as much as you can now to defend our Democrats from the GOP’s attacks, flip the Senate and protect the future of the Supreme Court >>

Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee
Hi friend,
I need to hear from top Democrats like you at this critical point in our country’s history. Will you please take a moment to share your priorities?
Let me tell you why I think this moment is so important.
Almost everything that's wrong in Washington boils down to this: Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Republicans.
They fill our courts with hard-right nominees, intent on overturning Roe v. Wade and crucial climate protections. They claim to support protections for Americans with pre-existing conditions -- and then they launch attack after attack to gut those protections. Simply put, Senate Republicans enable President Trump's worst behavior and pave the way for his harmful agenda.
So I mean it when I say that the future of our country depends on Democrats flipping the Senate majority. I'm working tirelessly to make that happen, but I need input from you to make sure we have the best possible plan.
We’ve just put together a brand new priorities survey. Will you please take a moment to complete it now? Here's the best link: [[URL REDACTED]]
Thanks for taking the time. I look forward to reading your responses.

"Team, with everything from health care to the Supreme Court on the ballot, it's absolutely critical that every single Democrat makes a plan to vote -- and follows through on that plan.
But unfortunately, even after President Obama called on you to make a plan to vote, not enough Democrats responded. And according to the data we collected, if the election were held today, Democratic candidates might be in danger of losing.
With Election Day 15 days away, and polls showing that the presidential race is now a TOSS-UP in key swing states like Florida, Michigan, and North Carolina, we must turn out in MASSIVE numbers, or Joe Biden AND some of our most crucial Senate candidates could lose this election.

Team -- Barack Obama is counting on every Democrat to immediately make a plan to vote for Joe Biden. Our nation's future is at stake!
New polls show the presidential race is now a TOSS-UP in key swing states like Florida, Michigan, and North Carolina. If Democrats fail to turn out for Joe Biden at historic levels, we could easily lose this election to Donald Trump.
Millions of Democrats have already completed their plans to vote -- but our live poll shows your plan is still incomplete:

"I want you to imagine two scenarios. Stay with me here:
It's the morning after Election Day. You jump out of bed. Pour yourself a cup of coffee. Switch on the TV to find out who won those Senate races, the ones that were neck-and-neck when you went to sleep -- the ones that Rachel Maddow said would determine control of the Senate.
In the first scenario, you chose to give a final $5 with this link. And the first thing you see on TV is ""Democrats flip the Senate, McConnell out of power."" Democrats like Mark Kelly and Jaime Harrison have WON by a handful of votes. Your coffee tastes incredible!
But there's a second scenario too. Wake up, coffee, TV on. But in this scenario, you chose NOT to pitch in that final $5. And by just a few votes, key Republican senators have held onto their seats -- and Mitch McConnell has maintained his majority. Your coffee doesn't just taste terrible. It tastes like regret.
You've still got a few hours left to choose one of those two scenarios. But if you wait any longer, it will be too late. Please don't wake up on November 4th wishing you had done more. Make a final donation by clicking a button below and it will be put to use immediately to help Democrats in the states that are going to decide this election:

I'll be blunt: That awful second scenario I explained earlier -- a repeat of 2016 -- could easily happen again.
The latest Senate polls show our Democrats TIED in key races across the country. And with Election Day tomorrow, Mitch McConnell's allies have raised nearly $150 MILLION to spend on a last-minute attack ad blitz.
Right now, every single dollar counts. And it could be YOUR donation that makes the difference for Mark Kelly in Arizona or Theresa Greenfield in Iowa. It could be YOUR donation that flips the Senate!
So please, pitch in $5 (becomes $20) right now to flip the Senate and retire Mitch McConnell. On November 4th, I want my coffee to taste like victory. How about you?
Thanks for all you do.

"I'm running for the U.S. Senate against Mitch McConnell -- and with your help, we can win this race.
Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee
'I need your help right now...' - Amy McGrath
CHIP IN $5
Friend,
I'm running for the U.S. Senate against Sen. Mitch McConnell. And I need your help.
Defeating McConnell won't be easy, but I'm up to the challenge. I served 20 years in the Marines, flew 89 combat missions in Iraq and Afghanistan, and overcame the odds to become the first woman Marine to fly a combat mission in an F/A-18 fighter jet.
We can win this race. Independent polling shows that I'm within one point of beating him. And two internal polls we released show the race is virtually tied.
But McConnell has already built up a massive $16.6 million war chest and he's flooding the airwaves with vicious attack ads and smears against me.
I'll need your support right now to run the campaign it will take to defeat him.
So I'm humbly asking you -- will you split a $5 donation to help me defeat McConnell? Your donation will be put to work immediately and it won't just help unseat McConnell -- it will help the DSCC flip the Senate majority for Democrats.
When I was 13, I dreamed of becoming a fighter pilot, but women weren't allowed to serve in combat roles in our military. So I wrote to my elected officials to ask them to change the law. I never heard back from my senator -- McConnell. He wasn't listening then, and he's not listening now.
Kentuckians want a senator who will improve health care and protect Social Security and Medicare. But McConnell tried to rip health care away from Kentuckians, including those with pre-existing conditions. And to top it all off, he recently announced his plan to slash Medicare and Social Security, after his massive tax cuts for the top 1%.
Folks around here know McConnell isn't listening, and they're ready for a change. But I'll need your help to make it happen.
Please, will you split a $5 donation to support my campaign and Democrats running for Senate across the country? Together, we can flip the Senate and defeat Mitch McConnell once and for all.

Amy McGrath

I've been a combat pilot. An astronaut. A father and a husband. And now, I'm running to be the next Senator for Arizona.
Through it all, I've learned the importance of asking for help when you need it, especially when facing a difficult situation.
So I'll be blunt with you: I need your help if I'm going to flip this Republican-held seat and defeat Mitch McConnell's majority. >>
Your contribution will be split between Mark Kelly's campaign and the DSCC.
Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight says our race is a must-win for Democrats to take back the Senate, and poll after poll has shown Arizona is a toss-up. But my campaign is facing two serious threats that could cost us the election:
1. Mitch McConnell and his allies are spending MILLIONS on attack ads to defeat me.
2. Even more troubling, my GOP opponent had a fundraising advantage in our last pre-primary fundraising report.
I need an immediate surge of resources to fight back and win. But right now, we're falling short of our critical midnight goal, and failing to meet this deadline simply isn't an option.
So I'm humbly asking you: Will you chip in $5 today to help my campaign and the DSCC win in Arizona and defeat Mitch McConnell's majority? Your contribution before midnight would mean the world to me >>

"We're beating Lindsey Graham!
Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee
Friend -- I want to make sure you've seen this breaking poll:
Harrison \(D\): 45%, Graham \(R\) 43%
This is the FOURTH new poll that has my campaign leading or tied with vulnerable Republican Senator Lindsey Graham! And folks, the good news doesn't stop there:
According to the nonpartisan election experts at Cook Political Report, this race is officially a TOSSUP!
We've got a real shot to win, but this is still an uphill battle against Lindsey's massive fundraising war chest. He's already launched attack ads against me, and Mitch McConnell's allies just dropped $10 MILLION into South Carolina to crush my momentum.
I need your support to fight back against them:
We need to raise $25,000 by tonight to capitalize on our momentum and send Lindsey Graham a message he can't ignore. In a race this close, we can't have any regrets after Election Day that we should have done more. Can you donate $5 right now to DEFEAT Lindsey Graham and flip the Senate?
Your gift will be split between Jaime Harrison and the DSCC to defeat Lindsey Graham and flip the Senate majority for Democrats.
Donate $5
Donate $10
Donate $25
Other Amount
Our momentum is giving me hope for the future of South Carolina -- and our country.
And I know how far hope can go.
My mother had me at 16 years old, and my grandparents raised me. Growing up, there were days we had our cereal with water because milk cost too much.
Kids like me weren't supposed to make it very far.
But thanks to a lot of hard work, and, yes, a little bit of hope, I got to study at Yale, work for Jim Clyburn on Capitol Hill, and today -- I know in my heart that together, we can flip this Senate seat and restore hope to folks who desperately need it.
I know that we can win this fight. South Carolinians are sick and tired of watching Lindsey put party above country. We've exceeded expectations every step of this campaign, but we need to hit our fundraising goals or my team and I will be forced to make some hard choices. We can't slow down now.
Please, will you split $5 between my campaign and the DSCC today? Voting is already underway in my race, and every dollar you give will be put to use immediately to defeat Lindsey Graham and other vulnerable Senate Republicans.
No regrets,
Jaime Harrison
Jaime Harrison
U.S. Senate Candidate, South Carolina
Jaime Harrison overcame the challenges of poverty to achieve his American dream. From a mobile home to Yale, to key leadership roles in government, he's led an inspiring life in service to others. Now he's depending on grassroots donors like you to step up and help him defeat Lindsey Graham.

"I want you to imagine two scenarios. Stay with me here:
It's the morning after Election Day. You jump out of bed. Pour yourself a cup of coffee. Switch on the TV to find out who won those Senate races, the ones that were neck-and-neck when you went to sleep -- the ones that Rachel Maddow said would determine control of the Senate.
In the first scenario, you chose to give a final $5 with this link. And the first thing you see on TV is ""Democrats flip the Senate, McConnell out of power."" Democrats like Mark Kelly and Jaime Harrison have WON by a handful of votes. Your coffee tastes incredible!
But there's a second scenario too. Wake up, coffee, TV on. But in this scenario, you chose NOT to pitch in that final $5. And by just a few votes, key Republican senators have held onto their seats -- and Mitch McConnell has maintained his majority. Your coffee doesn't just taste terrible. It tastes like regret.
You've still got a few hours left to choose one of those two scenarios. But if you wait any longer, it will be too late. Please don't wake up on November 4th wishing you had done more. Make a final donation by clicking a button below and it will be put to use immediately to help Democrats in the states that are going to decide this election:

I'll be blunt: That awful second scenario I explained earlier -- a repeat of 2016 -- could easily happen again.
The latest Senate polls show our Democrats TIED in key races across the country. And with just days left, Mitch McConnell's allies have raised nearly $150 MILLION to spend on a last-minute attack ad blitz.
Right now, every single dollar counts. And it could be YOUR donation that makes the difference for Mark Kelly in Arizona or Theresa Greenfield in Iowa. It could be YOUR donation that flips the Senate!
So please, pitch in $5 (becomes $20) right now to flip the Senate and retire Mitch McConnell. On November 4th, I want my coffee to taste like victory. How about you?

Democrats need to win in Arizona and Iowa to flip the Senate, but GOP megadonors just handed over MILLIONS of dollars to a McConnell-aligned super PAC.
And now, they're crushing our Democrats in the polls!
Losing these races is NOT an option! But we're falling dangerously short of the $500,000 our candidates need to pull ahead immediately and win on Election Day.
Please, this election is RAZOR-CLOSE and your donation could be the one that powers our Democrats into the lead!
Rush in $5 or more to WIN these crucial races, elect Democrats across the country, and flip the Senate. Our Democratic candidates are counting on your help before it's too late >>

Team -- Barack Obama is counting on every Democrat to immediately make a plan to vote for Joe Biden. Our nation's future is at stake!
New polls show the presidential race is now a TOSS-UP in key swing states like Florida, Michigan, and North Carolina. If Democrats fail to turn out for Joe Biden at historic levels, we could easily lose this election to Donald Trump.
Millions of Democrats have already completed their plans to vote -- but our live poll shows your plan is still incomplete:

Donald Trump told supporters at a recent campaign rally that he might FIRE Dr. Anthony Fauci after Election Day.
With COVID-19 cases rising again, America needs smart, honest scientists like Dr. Fauci to keep us safe. Instead, Trump called him ""an idiot"" and is now threatening his job!

"Reaching out again for your critical insights.
We reached out to a select group of top Democrats to gauge support for the Biden-Harris ticket after a troubling polling update from Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight.
But unfortunately, not enough top Democrats have recorded their responses to our poll. So right now, we're on track to fall 5 responses short in 48003 of reaching statistical significance.
This is a big deal: If Nate Silver's data is accurate, we'll have to completely restructure our strategy for the final 29 days, and if we don't hit our response goal, we won't have the critical information we need to prepare for the final push to Election Day.
Our final-stretch election strategy depends on the responses we get here, and this close to Election Day, we can't afford to lose any more time. So please, submit your response now:

We MUST ensure Democrats are ready to turn out in historic numbers to avoid a devastating repeat of 2016. We will ONLY defeat Trump if top Democrats like you turn out in numbers large enough to defeat the GOP's voter suppression strategy. That's why we're contacting top supporters to confirm that Joe and Kamala's support is strong enough to beat Trump \-- but as of right now, this live poll is still missing your response.
Please, tell us where you stand immediately:

Defeating McConnell won't be easy, but I'm up to the challenge. I served 20 years in the Marines, flew 89 combat missions in Iraq and Afghanistan, and overcame the odds to become the first woman Marine to fly a combat mission in an F/A-18 fighter jet.
We can win this race. Independent polling shows that I'm within one point of beating him. And two internal polls we released show the race is virtually tied.
But McConnell has already built up a massive $16.6 million war chest and he's flooding the airwaves with vicious attack ads and smears against me.
I'll need your support right now to run the campaign it will take to defeat him.
So I'm humbly asking you -- will you split a $5 donation to help me defeat McConnell? Your donation will be put to work immediately and it won't just help unseat McConnell -- it will help the DSCC flip the Senate majority for Democrats.
When I was 13, I dreamed of becoming a fighter pilot, but women weren't allowed to serve in combat roles in our military. So I wrote to my elected officials to ask them to change the law. I never heard back from my senator -- McConnell. He wasn't listening then, and he's not listening now.
Kentuckians want a senator who will improve health care and protect Social Security and Medicare. But McConnell tried to rip health care away from Kentuckians, including those with pre-existing conditions. And to top it all off, he recently announced his plan to slash Medicare and Social Security, after his massive tax cuts for the top 1%.
Folks around here know McConnell isn't listening, and they're ready for a change. But I'll need your help to make it happen.
Please, will you split a $5 donation to support my campaign and Democrats running for Senate across the country? Together, we can flip the Senate and defeat Mitch McConnell once and for all.

Thank you,
Amy McGrath

Team,
With polls preparing to close across the country, we need to hear from voters IMMEDIATELY to determine if Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and our Democratic challengers have the support they need to flip the Senate.
That's why we're conducting an URGENT exit poll, and we've chosen a select group of top supporters who we believe form a representative sample of the Democratic base. I'm pleased to inform you that you've been selected to participate in the emergency poll.

I cannot overstate the importance of your response. With Senate control -- and the future of our health care, voting rights, and the Supreme Court -- being decided as we speak, we need to know how our candidates are performing in our key races.
But in order to collect accurate data, we need FULL participation. For that reason, we ask that you prioritize completing and submitting your responses immediately. Please, don't let us down when we need you most.

Friend -- I want to make sure you've seen this breaking poll:

This is the FOURTH new poll that has my campaign leading or tied with vulnerable Republican Senator Lindsey Graham! And folks, the good news doesn't stop there:
According to the nonpartisan election experts at Cook Political Report, this race is officially a TOSSUP!
We've got a real shot to win, but this is still an uphill battle against Lindsey's massive fundraising war chest. He's already launched attack ads against me, and Mitch McConnell's allies just dropped $10 MILLION into South Carolina to crush my momentum.
I need your support to fight back against them:

Our momentum is giving me hope for the future of South Carolina -- and our country.
And I know how far hope can go.
My mother had me at 16 years old, and my grandparents raised me. Growing up, there were days we had our cereal with water because milk cost too much.
Kids like me weren't supposed to make it very far.
But thanks to a lot of hard work, and, yes, a little bit of hope, I got to study at Yale, work for Jim Clyburn on Capitol Hill, and today -- I know in my heart that together, we can flip this Senate seat and restore hope to folks who desperately need it.
I know that we can win this fight. South Carolinians are sick and tired of watching Lindsey put party above country. We've exceeded expectations every step of this campaign, but we need to hit our fundraising goals or my team and I will be forced to make some hard choices. We can't slow down now.
Please, will you split $5 between my campaign and the DSCC today? Voting is already underway in my race, and every dollar you give will be put to use immediately to defeat Lindsey Graham and other vulnerable Senate Republicans.
No regrets,
Jaime Harrison

Team -- The Rachel Maddow Show said it best: ""If you're Mitch McConnell, you are NOT happy with what you're seeing.""
The latest polls spell trouble for Republicans: Democrats are ahead in FOUR battleground states and are tied in at least SIX, including traditionally GOP strongholds like Georgia and Texas.
We were on track to give Joe Biden a historic Senate majority, but right-wing mega-donors just donated MILLIONS to keep Mitch McConnell in power, and our grassroots deadline is coming up. If we fail to reach our goal, our chances of winning could be decimated!
President Obama already urged you to get involved, but with Republicans shattering fundraising records we need to ask you once again:
TRIPLE-MATCH ACTIVE: Please, give as much as you can so Democratic candidates have what it takes to win tough races and flip the Senate. We need to raise $100,000 to stay on track! >>

'We've got to retake the Senate' - Pete
Donate $5 (BECOMES $20)
I'll be blunt because we're running out of time: Friend, can you please pitch in $5 right now to help send Mitch McConnell into retirement and flip the Senate? The fate of the Supreme Court hangs in the balance and Democrats like us cannot sit on the sidelines.
Our nation is at a crossroads, and we only have two choices:
Either we allow Mitch McConnell to keep control of the Senate and decide the future of our Supreme Court, or we win back the Senate so Joe Biden can appoint a fair-minded justice to succeed Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
We absolutely must retake the Senate, friend, but right now we're facing a serious threat that could cost us the election.
McConnell-aligned super PACs just booked tens of millions of dollars' worth of TV ads in key Senate races, and with a critical fundraising deadline coming up, our Democratic Senate candidates are falling short of what they need to fight back.
Please, friend, I'm personally asking you to please pitch in $5 right now to help Democrats retake the Senate and win the most critical election in generations >>
The Trump era has been a disaster for our country, and I know you're ready to turn the page.
We believe in building an America that supports senior citizens with benefits like Social Security, an America that ensures no one is going without food in order to pay for medications, and an America with a Supreme Court that shares our values.
But the only way we can make our vision real is if Democrats retake the Senate this November.
Friend, this is going to be a tough battle, but believe me when I tell you that we can win and secure health care, Social Security, and the future of our Supreme Court along the way.
So please, friend: Don't wake up on November 4th wishing you had stepped up when it mattered. Step up now. Please pitch in $5 to do your part in helping Democrats hit this critical fundraising goal and retake the Senate.

I have to be honest: If our candidates get outraised again, we'll be put in a terrible bind and may lose our chance to retake the Senate.
In just a few years we've endured Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation, tax cuts for billionaires, rampant corruption, millions at risk of losing health insurance, and unprecedented threats to Social Security.
Now, we can either reclaim control and give Joe Biden a Democratic Senate to rebuild our country, or we can hand Mitch McConnell another two years to continue destroying it.

Let's elect Democrats like Amy McGrath, Sara Gideon, and Mark Kelly in November!

BREAKING NEWS  McConnell's allies investing MILLIONS to replace two pivotal Democratic women senators and confirm Trump's right-wing SCOTUS nominees
EMERGENCY $25,000 GOAL: Split $5 right away between Jeanne Shaheen, Tina Smith, and Senate Democrats to BEAT McConnell's megadonors and save the Supreme Court >>
Support Jeanne Shaheen and Tina Smith
Donate $5
Nate Silver says Democrats can flip the Senate... BUT, that will be IMPOSSIBLE if we lose Senators Jeanne Shaheen and Tina Smith.
They are BOTH facing far-right, Trump-endorsed opponents who would sabotage our Supreme Court for generations, rip away health care, and dismantle women's rights.
If we fail to give our incredible senators enough resources to fend off their pro-Trump challengers in New Hampshire and Minnesota, Republicans could take these seats away and ruin our chance to flip the Senate!
We set an EMERGENCY $25,000 goal to make sure these Democratic women have what it takes to win, but we're currently 13 donors short in Michigan.
Please, our deadline is TONIGHT and your donation is CRITICAL!
There's so much riding on this! Rush in $5 or more to defeat McConnell's Senate and save the Supreme Court >>

Folks, here's the deal:
It's going to take an incredible amount of money to make Donald Trump a one-term president and defeat his Senate enablers. And with voting already underway in key battleground states, we're quickly running out of time to have a meaningful impact, so I have to ask:
Could you chip in $5 to my campaign and the DSCC today? We need to counter Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell's enormous fundraising machine to elect our Democrats and enact the transformative change America so badly needs.
Donate $5 Now
Asking good folks like you for your hard-earned dollars is one of the toughest parts of this job. But we cannot afford to take our foot off the gas for one second.
We remain locked in a battle for the soul of this nation. And to win, it isn't enough to only defeat Donald Trump. We must flip the Senate and hold to account all those who've sat idly by as Trump lies, obstructs, and passes the buck.
Listen, it won't be easy. We're up against a Republican war chest which they'll gladly spend down to zero to try to buy their way into a second term. And there is simply too much at stake to not give our full one-hundred percent.
With only five short days until Election Day, I'm counting on you to dig deep and pitch in so my campaign and Democratic Senate candidates across America have the resources to win.
Will you please split a donation between my campaign and the DSCC today, while there's still time for our investments to have a big impact? It'd mean a lot to me, to Kamala, and to so many Democratic candidates nationwide.

"I can't emphasize this enough:
Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee
Friend -- Tomorrow is our fundraising deadline, and frankly, it could determine everything.
If we hit our $250,000 goal, it'll prove Democrats have what it takes to finally end Mitch McConnell's iron grip over our government.
But if we fall short, Mitch McConnell will breathe a BIG sigh of relief knowing senators like Susan Collins and Lindsey Graham are on track to be re-elected.
Please, we're running $101,874 behind our goal and all grassroots gifts are currently being TRIPLE-MATCHED to maximize your impact -- but not for much longer! Rush a donation to help Democrats flip the Senate:
Donate $5 (becomes $20)
Donate $10 (becomes $40)
Donate $25 (becomes $100)
Rush Another Amount
I've said it before and I'll say it again: The most significant election taking place in November won't involve Donald Trump. It will involve vulnerable Senate Republicans in battleground states like Arizona, Colorado, Maine, and North Carolina.
The future of our country is at stake, friend. If Republicans keep control, there won't be meaningful action to reduce gun violence, combat climate change, or expand affordable health care, and we could end up with more Supreme Court justices like Brett Kavanaugh who will dismantle Americans' civil and reproductive rights.
That's why we MUST make electing a Democratic Senate our top priority. Our stellar candidates like Mark Kelly, Jaime Harrison, and Sara Gideon are counting on your help, and it'd be devastating if I had to report back bad news to them.
Given all that's on the line, will you make a TRIPLE-MATCHED gift to make sure Democrats flip the Senate in November? You can click here to make a $5 contribution (remember, it becomes $20!) to end Mitch McConnell's majority:

DONATE $5 (BECOMES $20)
If you share my deep sense of alarm over what a Trump-appointed, conservative Supreme Court majority will mean for America, please pitch in $5 (worth $20) today to deliver Joe and Kamala a Democratic Senate. There's a critical deadline tonight, and my friends at the DSCC need 22 more grassroots donations in Michigan to reach their must-hit fundraising goal.
What we're watching take place in Washington is a destructive charade.
The Republican Senate refuses to even debate on another coronavirus relief bill, and is instead choosing to ram forward a Supreme Court nominee who would put countless hard-earned rights in jeopardy, including protections for pre-existing conditions, marriage equality, and Roe v. Wade.
We are up against a lot right now. But here's the truth: With the Supreme Court on the line and Mitch McConnell's super PAC allies spending millions and millions against Democrats in key Senate races, your $5 donation couldn't be any more important.
Our nation is at a crossroads and every generous donation helps Democrats end Trump and McConnell's era of chaos.
So please, pitch in a gift of $5, $10, or even $20 before tonight's deadline to help Democrats retake the Senate. Donating now is the single most impactful way you can help save the future of the Supreme Court.

ANNOUNCEMENT: Emergency Triple-Match EXTENDED
'I need you with me...' - Joe Biden
Rush a $5 donation (it becomes $20!) to defeat Republicans like Mitch McConnell, Susan Collins, and Lindsey Graham >>
Donate $5 (becomes $20)
Team -- Mitch McConnell's majority -- and even HIS OWN SEAT -- are officially in danger!
Democrats are ahead in at least SIX states, and Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight has called Joe Biden a HUGE BOOST for our chances of ending Mitch McConnell's majority!
The momentum is on our side, but with the Supreme Court on the line, Trump and McConnell are raising MILLIONS to try and save their majority. We set a goal to fight back by raising $250,000 -- but the deadline just passed and we came up short. That's why we've EXTENDED our triple-match offer to make up ground and hit this critical goal!
Your triple-match offer is being EXTENDED to help raise the $250,000 we need to stay on track against McConnell. Please rush a donation now to make sure our Democrats have what it takes to win >>
Donate $5 (becomes $20)
Donate $10 (becomes $40)
Donate $25 (becomes $100)
Rush Another Amount
Under Mitch McConnell's reign as majority leader, we've seen Republicans:
* Orchestrate a SHAM impeachment trial that resulted in Donald Trump's acquittal.
* Award Brett Kavanaugh a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court.
* Block bills to help prevent gun violence, secure U.S. elections, and combat climate change.
* Threaten cuts to Social Security and Medicare.
But now we can FINALLY do something about it.
The Senate is up for grabs, our candidates are pulling ahead, and Joe Biden is leading Trump in presidential polls. We're counting on YOUR help today to make sure we elect a Democratic Senate that will support Joe and Kamala's agenda!
Rush in $5 now to have 4X the IMPACT and help us hit our $250,000 fundraising goal -- EVERY dollar you give will be TRIPLE-MATCHED to flip the Senate. >>
Let's elect Democrats like Amy McGrath, Sara Gideon, and Mark Kelly in November!
Thanks,

URGENT: Michelle Obama just sounded the alarm about Trump's ability to win in 2020. She explained that Joe Biden will need HISTORIC Democratic turnout to defeat him!
Of course, Michelle is 100% correct: Nate Silver just released his 2020 presidential election forecast, and it's terrifying for Joe Biden. The data shows that Donald Trump has the EXACT SAME chances of winning as he did in 2016.
With the threat of a Trump victory looming, millions of Democrats are answering Michelle's call to action and have already pledged to vote for Joe Biden! But our database shows you still haven't joined Michelle Obama and pledged to vote:

CHIP IN $5
Friend --
I've been a combat pilot. An astronaut. A father and a husband. And now, I'm running to be the next Senator for Arizona.
Through it all, I've learned the importance of asking for help when you need it, especially when facing a difficult situation.
So I'll be blunt with you: I need your help right now if I'm going to flip this Republican-held seat and defeat Mitch McConnell's majority. >>
Your contribution will be split between Mark Kelly's campaign and the DSCC.
Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight says our race is a must-win for Democrats to take back the Senate, and poll after poll has shown Arizona is a toss-up. But my campaign is facing two serious threats that could cost us the election:
1. Mitch McConnell and his allies are spending MILLIONS on attack ads to defeat me.
2. Even more troubling, my GOP opponent had a fundraising advantage in our last pre-primary fundraising report.
I need an immediate surge of resources to fight back and win. But right now, we're falling short of our critical midnight goal, and failing to meet this deadline simply isn't an option.
So I'm humbly asking you: Will you chip in $5 today to help my campaign and the DSCC win in Arizona and defeat Mitch McConnell's majority? Your contribution before midnight would mean the world to me >>

Majority Leader McConnell and his allies are shattering fundraising records to keep their grip on the Senate majority and cover for President Trump -- so that makes reaching our goal even more critical.
Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight reports the Senate is up for grabs -- but for Democrats to flip the Senate, this grassroots team must step up. Every single donation matters now, whether it's $5 or $25, and right now ALL gifts are being triple-matched!

"I have to ask you
Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee
Hi again, I'll be brief.
We will never be able to save the Supreme Court or rebuild our democracy as long as Mitch McConnell stays in power.
It will be heartbreaking if all our time and effort to save our country is squandered, which is why I'm asking you to help Democrats flip the Senate.
This fight is WAY too important to give anything less than our all.
Please join me and pitch in $5. The DSCC only has 6 hours left to raise $7,568 and they need everyone to do their part. I hope I can count on you. >>
We will get through this difficult time together, and we will WIN this fight by standing together!

The Rachel Maddow Show is exactly right: Our ONLY hope to defeat McConnell's MASSIVE attack blitz is if millions of good Democrats step up right now! Please, rush in $5 before it's too late:

We just got word that the McConnell-linked super PAC raised an unprecedented $92 million in the last month, ERASING the financial advantage our Democrats had in key Senate races.

We've never faced a threat this massive. Our ONLY hope to fight back and win is to raise $500,000 right away. If we don't, ALL of our work over the last few years will have been for nothing:

But unfortunately, not enough top Democrats have recorded their responses to our poll. So right now, we're on track to fall 11 responses short in 48003 of reaching statistical significance.
This is a big deal: If Nate Silver's data is accurate, we'll have to completely restructure our strategy for the final 36 days, and if we don't hit our response goal, we won't have the critical information we need to prepare for the final push to Election Day.
Our final-stretch election strategy depends on the responses we get here, and this close to Election Day, we can't afford to lose any more time. So please, submit your response now:
Will you vote for the Biden-Harris ticket in November?
YES
NO
More soon -- thanks for being a part of our team.

Will you vote for the Biden-Harris ticket in November?

No
This is a live poll being conducted on September 19, 2020. Submissions received after the deadline will be disregarded.
\----------
Team -- Nate Silver just gave us some bad news: Trump could still win this election. He just released his vaunted 2020 presidential election prediction model and according to the data, Trump has the EXACT SAME chances of winning as he did in 2016!
We MUST ensure Democrats are ready to turn out in historic numbers to avoid a devastating repeat of 2016. We will ONLY defeat Trump if top Democrats like you turn out in numbers large enough to defeat the GOP's voter suppression strategy. That's why we're contacting top supporters to confirm that Joe and Kamala's support is strong enough to beat Trump \-- but as of right now, this live poll is still missing your response.
Please, tell us where you stand immediately:
Will you vote for the Biden-Harris ticket in November?
Yes
No
This is a live poll being conducted on September 19, 2020. Submissions after the deadline will be disregarded.

Friend -- We're at a point of no return.
Our fundraising deadline is almost here, Mitch McConnell is celebrating his record fundraising, and our hard-earned Democratic momentum is at risk.
The latest polls have us AHEAD or TIED against Senate Republicans like Susan Collins and Lindsey Graham, but Republican donors are doubling down and we're not on track to reach our must-hit $250,000 fundraising goal.
Please, click here to make a $5 contribution and have 4X the IMPACT immediately. 100% of your gift helps Democrats flip the Senate. >>

I have to be honest: If our candidates get outraised again, we'll be put in a terrible bind and may lose our chance to retake the Senate.
In just a few years we've endured Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation, tax cuts for billionaires, rampant corruption, millions at risk of losing health insurance, and unprecedented threats to Social Security.
Now, we can either reclaim control and give Joe Biden a Democratic Senate to rebuild our country, or we can hand Mitch McConnell another two years to continue destroying it.
The stakes are too high to not give this everything we've got, so please:
I'm asking you to give $5 (it becomes $20) to help Democrats close our fundraising gap and flip the Senate. Your gift will be TRIPLE-MATCHED to support candidates like Mark Kelly, Sara Gideon, and Jaime Harrison. >>
Thanks for all your help,
Chuck

Team -- Election Day is less than 30 days away, and the latest Senate polls show that Mitch McConnell's majority is officially in danger!
Nate Silver's new Senate forecast has Democrats winning in FOUR key races and gives us a chance to defeat at least 12 GOP senators, including Lindsey Graham and McConnell himself.

* Orchestrate a SHAM impeachment trial that resulted in Donald Trump's acquittal.
* Block bills to help prevent gun violence and combat climate change.
* Threaten cuts to Social Security and Medicare.
But now we can FINALLY do something about it.

Chuck Schumer's Message
DONATE $5 (BECOMES $20)
Friend, I'm emailing to personally ask you to make a $5 donation before our crucial FEC deadline. This is our biggest general election deadline yet but we're on track to fall short. And remember, your $5 will become $20 right now.
Time is running out, so I need to be brutally honest. If we miss this goal, Democrats could lose any chance of taking back Senate control from Mitch McConnell.
Why? It all comes down to dollars and cents.
Every day since this campaign began, Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump have been raising jaw-dropping sums of money. They've already amassed a war chest so huge I've never seen anything like it -- and they're about to unleash their millions to try and crush our candidates.
The ONLY way we can compete and win against McConnell's money is by hitting every single quarterly fundraising goal like this one. There is simply no other way!
That's why I'm coming to you at this critical moment.
Please, will you rush in $5 (becomes $20) to defeat Mitch McConnell and flip the Senate? With our nation's future at stake, I hope I can count on you.

Hey, folks, it's Joe.
This is urgent: There are just 10 days left in this campaign and with so much on the line, we simply cannot afford to wait around for someone else to do the necessary hard work.
So I'm asking you to step up, dig deep, and make sure we elect a Democratic Senate. Can you chip in $5 today to help Democrats oust Mitch McConnell and flip the Senate?
Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell have derailed our country and rolled back much of the progress we've made. If we want to build back better, then we've got to flip the U.S. Senate. It's the only way we can create the real, transformative progress our country needs.
I know from my past campaigns that the final weeks aren't just tough -- they're also expensive, but I'm deadly serious when I say you have the power to ensure we can take back the Senate and get Kamala and me to the White House to make the change our country needs.
I mean it when I say that this election is going to come down to what we can accomplish in the next 10 days. This is the moment to give the race everything we've got.
So I'm humbly asking for your support, before tonight's fundraising deadline. Can you pitch in $5 right now to help Democrats flip the Senate?

THEN: President Obama personally called on Democrats like YOU to fight back!
NOW: The response of grassroots Democrats has Mitch McConnell TERRIFIED!
Millions of Democrats are already rushing their donation to flip the Senate -- but according to our records, you haven't chipped in today!

'Help me unseat Mitch McConnell' - Amy McGrath
Donate $5
Hi friend. I'm Amy McGrath, and with your help, I'm going to unseat Mitch McConnell next month.
Defeating him won't be easy. But ""easy"" has never really been in my vocabulary.
I served 20 years in the Marines, flew 89 combat missions in Iraq and Afghanistan, and became the first woman Marine to fly a combat mission in an F/A-18 fighter jet. None of those things were easy, either. But they were worth it -- and so is ending Mitch McConnell's Senate majority once and for all.
We can win this race, friend. In fact, polls have shown our race is neck-and-neck, which is why two Republican super PACs bought over $16 MILLION in ads against me.
But I cannot run the campaign it will take to defeat him unless I have your help.
There's a huge deadline looming at midnight tomorrow, so I'm asking you, right now, to split a donation of $5 -- or as much as you can spare -- between my campaign and the DSCC's effort to flip the Senate. Every single dollar you give will go toward kicking McConnell out of power, so please don't sit this out.
Friend, I know how hard it is to go up against Mitch McConnell when he puts up a roadblock. When I was 13, I wrote to my senator, Mitch McConnell, and asked him to change the law so women could be fighter pilots. I never heard back from him -- but I beat him then, and we're going to beat him now. For good.
The reason it's so critical that we win is because McConnell simply is not serving the people he claims to represent. He's let over 400 bills gather dust on his desk, refusing to bring them up for a vote, while instead promoting whatever Donald Trump asks him to: tax cuts for the mega-rich, slashes to health care coverage, and attacks on Social Security.
It's time for a change. And I know we can make it. But it will only happen with your help, and time is running out.
Please, will you split a donation between my campaign and the DSCC to win Senate races across the country? We CAN end McConnell's majority. It won't be easy, but it will be worth it. And it's within our grasp, but only with support from Democrats like you right now.
Thank you,
Amy McGrath
Candidate for U.S. Senate (D-KY)
Amy McGrath is a retired Marine Corps fighter pilot, a mom of three, and a lifelong Kentuckian running to defeat Mitch McConnell. Polling shows she CAN beat Mitch McConnell -- and now she's depending on grassroots donors like you to step up and help her win this critical race.

I have to be honest: If our candidates get outraised again, we'll be put in a terrible bind and may lose our chance to retake the Senate.
In just a few years we've endured Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation, tax cuts for billionaires, rampant corruption, millions at risk of losing health insurance, and unprecedented threats to Social Security.
Now, we can either reclaim control and give Joe Biden a Democratic Senate to rebuild our country, or we can hand Mitch McConnell another two years to continue destroying it.

EXCLUSIVE INVITATION: You have been selected to represent Michigan in our official Election 2020 Exit Poll.
Details below, please read carefully. (If you are not [[EMAIL_REDACTED]], please exit this email immediately.)
Team,
With polls preparing to close across the country, we need to hear from voters IMMEDIATELY to determine if Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and our Democratic challengers have the support they need to flip the Senate.
That's why we're conducting an URGENT exit poll, and we've chosen a select group of top supporters who we believe form a representative sample of the Democratic base. I'm pleased to inform you that you've been selected to participate in the emergency poll.
USER ID: 13656138
REASON FOR SELECTION: Past Survey Responses
ACTION REQUIRED: Accept Invitation to Exit Poll
I cannot overstate the importance of your response. With Senate control -- and the future of our health care, voting rights, and the Supreme Court -- being decided as we speak, we need to know how our candidates are performing in our key races.
But in order to collect accurate data, we need FULL participation. For that reason, we ask that you prioritize completing and submitting your responses immediately. Please, don't let us down when we need you most.
[[URL REDACTED]]
Please, with health care, the Senate, and the Supreme Court on the line -- and only HOURS left to save our democracy -- take your exit poll right now:
Thank you,

The Rachel Maddow Show is exactly right: If you care about flipping the Senate and saving our Supreme Court, you need to pitch in right now. You cannot wait!
With just 11 short days left, McConnell's majority is in EXTREME danger! Nate Silver's latest Senate forecast gives Democrats an edge in FOUR races and a chance to defeat at least TWELVE senators, including Lindsey Graham and McConnell himself.
But McConnell and his super PAC allies just launched an unprecedented BARRAGE of new attacks against our top Democratic candidates!
If we don't fight back now, ALL of our work will have been for nothing \-- we'll lose the Senate and our Supreme Court.
Please, we absolutely must hit our $250,000 fundraising goal to defeat Mitch McConnell, flip the Senate, and save the Supreme Court! Rush in a TRIPLE-MATCHED $5 or more before it's too late >>

Team -- The Rachel Maddow Show said it best: ""If you're Mitch McConnell, you are NOT happy with what you're seeing.""
The latest polls spell trouble for Republicans: Democrats are ahead in FOUR battleground states and are tied in at least SIX, including traditionally GOP strongholds like Georgia and Texas.
We were on track to give Joe Biden a historic Senate majority, but right-wing mega-donors just donated MILLIONS to keep Mitch McConnell in power, and our extended grassroots deadline is coming up. If we fail to reach our goal, our chances of winning could be decimated!
President Obama already urged you to get involved, but with Republicans shattering fundraising records we need to ask you once again:

We just got word that the McConnell-linked super PAC raised an unprecedented $92 million in the last month, ERASING the financial advantage our Democrats had in key Senate races.
According to breaking press reports, this means Democratic Senate candidates will be outspent in the final stretch of the election UNLESS grassroots Democrats send them an unprecedented surge of support.

We are facing a make-or-break moment in our nation's history.
Yesterday, the Republican Senate chose to prioritize confirming a Supreme Court nominee whose ideology will threaten countless hard-earned rights and health care for millions over providing badly needed coronavirus relief to Americans.
This is our one chance to end Mitch McConnell's era of chaos. But as it stands, Democratic Senate candidates are at risk of being dangerously outspent in the crucial final stretch after a McConnell-aligned super PAC raised an unprecedented $92 million last month.
Here's the truth: The Supreme Court is on the line and McConnell's super PAC allies are spending millions attacking Democrats. So now more than ever, we know we cannot afford to get this wrong.
We only have seven more days to elect a Democratic Senate and save the Supreme Court. So please, pitch in a gift of $5, $10, or even $20 before tonight's deadline to help Democrats retake the Senate.

But there are only 15 days left until Election Day and McConnell's top super PAC ally has raised over $100 million to save his Senate majority, putting our momentum in SERIOUS jeopardy!
Joe and Kamala are counting on YOU to help elect a Democratic Senate, so please: Will you pitch in $5 now to flip the Senate and save our Supreme Court? EVERY dollar you give will have 4X the IMPACT! >>
With your support, we can elect Democrats like Jaime Harrison, Sara Gideon, Amy McGrath, and Mark Kelly in November!
Thanks,

Mitch McConnell's vow to advance Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee this close to Election Day is a stunning show of hypocrisy, but President Obama knows what's possible when Democrats stand together and demand change.
That's why he personally asked YOU to take action to help elect a Democratic Senate!
Nate Silver's forecast says the Senate is a toss-up, but GOP megadonors are investing MILLIONS to attack Democrats, keep McConnell in power, and confirm an ultra-conservative replacement for Justice Ginsburg.
Please, triple-match is ACTIVE and Democrats need YOUR support to flip the Senate! Rush in a gift now to have 4X the impact in the fight to defeat McConnell's majority and save the Supreme Court:

"I'm running for the U.S. Senate against Mitch McConnell -- and with your help, we can win this race.
Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee
'I need your help right now...' - Amy McGrath
CHIP IN $5
Friend,
I'm running for the U.S. Senate against Sen. Mitch McConnell. And I need your help.
Defeating McConnell won't be easy, but I'm up to the challenge. I served 20 years in the Marines, flew 89 combat missions in Iraq and Afghanistan, and overcame the odds to become the first woman Marine to fly a combat mission in an F/A-18 fighter jet.
We can win this race. Independent polling shows that I'm within one point of beating him. And two internal polls we released show the race is virtually tied.
But McConnell has already built up a massive $16.6 million war chest and he's flooding the airwaves with vicious attack ads and smears against me.
I'll need your support right now to run the campaign it will take to defeat him.
So I'm humbly asking you -- will you split a $5 donation to help me defeat McConnell? Your donation will be put to work immediately and it won't just help unseat McConnell -- it will help the DSCC flip the Senate majority for Democrats.
When I was 13, I dreamed of becoming a fighter pilot, but women weren't allowed to serve in combat roles in our military. So I wrote to my elected officials to ask them to change the law. I never heard back from my senator -- McConnell. He wasn't listening then, and he's not listening now.
Kentuckians want a senator who will improve health care and protect Social Security and Medicare. But McConnell tried to rip health care away from Kentuckians, including those with pre-existing conditions. And to top it all off, he recently announced his plan to slash Medicare and Social Security, after his massive tax cuts for the top 1%.
Folks around here know McConnell isn't listening, and they're ready for a change. But I'll need your help to make it happen.
Please, will you split a $5 donation to support my campaign and Democrats running for Senate across the country? Together, we can flip the Senate and defeat Mitch McConnell once and for all.

Amy McGrath
U.S. Senate candidate, Kentucky

"URGENT UPDATE:
The good news: Democrats only need to win FOUR seats to flip the Senate, and according to Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight, Sara Gideon, Mark Kelly, John Hickenlooper, and Theresa Greenfield can ALL win in just five days.
The bad news: Mitch McConnell's allies raised nearly $150 MILLION to bury our candidates in nonstop attack ads from here until Election Day -- and polls show the attacks are working!
We can win this race but ONLY if we have the funds to fight back. That's why we set a critical goal to raise $500,000 before Saturday's end-of-month deadline.
Please, rush in $5, $10, $25, or even more to make sure our candidates can win on Election Day! We won't be able to defeat Mitch McConnell's majority without your donation >>

'I'm asking you to make a donation' - Chuck Schumer
Friend, we have a make-or-break goal of raising $500,000 by Saturday's critical end-of-month deadline, and I need your help right now to hit it.
Please, click here to give a triple-matched contribution of $5 (it's worth $20) or more to flip the Senate.
I need to make this clear for you: The future of our nation is at stake.
If we fall short, we could lose our chance to flip the Senate and leave the future of the Supreme Court and Roe v. Wade in the hands of Majority Leader McConnell, President Trump, and justices like Brett Kavanaugh.
Majority Leader McConnell and his allies are shattering fundraising records to keep their grip on the Senate majority and cover for President Trump -- so that makes reaching our goal even more critical.
Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight reports the Senate is up for grabs -- but for Democrats to flip the Senate, this grassroots team must step up. Every single donation matters now, whether it's $5 or $25, and right now ALL gifts are being triple-matched!
I'm only asking you because this is absolutely crucial: Will you make a triple-matched gift to elect Democrats and flip the Senate? Every dollar you give will go toward taking back the Senate majority.
We need your help to flip the Senate. If you've saved payment info with ActBlue Express, your donation will be processed immediately. Donate $5 (becomes $20)

The stakes of this election simply could not be any higher. Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell are trying as hard as they can to ram through a Supreme Court nominee who could overturn Roe v. Wade, eviscerate the Affordable Care Act, and turn back the clock on our nation's progress.
We absolutely must flip the Senate, but we're facing a massive threat that could cost us the election.
Mitch McConnell's super PAC allies just booked tens of millions of dollars' worth of TV ads in key Senate races, and with a crucial fundraising deadline tomorrow at midnight, our Democratic Senate candidates are falling short of what they urgently need to fight back and win.

Mitch McConnell's vow to advance Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee this close to Election Day is a stunning show of hypocrisy, but President Obama knows what's possible when Democrats stand together and demand change.
That's why he personally asked YOU to take action to help elect a Democratic Senate!

Please -- this is important: Rush $5 now to beat Lindsey Graham, flip the Senate, and save our Supreme Court! >>
We are so close to defeating Lindsey Graham:
Democrat Jaime Harrison has pulled ahead of Graham in the polls, and experts from Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight to RealClearPolitics say Harrison can really win it!
But with Graham plummeting in the polls, GOP outside groups just announced a massive multi-million dollar spending spree -- and if we don't fight back immediately, all of Democrats' progress in South Carolina and in races across the country could be erased.
After Lindsey Graham's blatant hypocrisy was on full display for the nation as he led the Supreme Court confirmation hearings, Democrats have never had a better shot to defeat him and flip the Senate.
This is our chance to FINALLY send Lindsey Graham packing, flip the Senate and save our Supreme Court -- but it’ll only happen if you take action now.

I've said it before and I'll say it again: The most significant election taking place in November won't involve Donald Trump. It will involve vulnerable Senate Republicans in battleground states like Arizona, Colorado, Maine, and North Carolina.
The future of our country is at stake, friend. If Republicans keep control, there won't be meaningful action to reduce gun violence, combat climate change, or expand affordable health care, and we could end up with more Supreme Court justices like Brett Kavanaugh who will dismantle Americans' civil and reproductive rights.
That's why we MUST make electing a Democratic Senate our top priority. Our stellar candidates like Mark Kelly, Jaime Harrison, and Sara Gideon are counting on your help, and it'd be devastating if I had to report back bad news to them.

This race will make or break Democrats' chances of flipping the Senate so we NEED every Democrat to take action right away!
We activated an emergency TRIPLE-MATCH to fight back and flip the Senate, but we fell short of our $500,000 end-of-month goal. We can only make up ground and defeat McConnell's majority if grassroots donors like you give immediately.
Please, there's no time to waste. Rush in $5 (worth $20) before it's too late.

"Hi, do you have a minute?
Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee
Hi friend,
I'm writing to you personally to ask you to be part of today's DSCC General Election Focus Group. Please, let me quickly explain what that means and why I'm reaching out to you.
Mitch McConnell and Senate Republicans have caused a tremendous amount of damage to our country and our democracy. Unless we stop them, they're going to take over more seats on the Supreme Court and change the makeup of our judiciary for the next generation.
I don't think it's hyperbolic to say that the future of our democracy depends on Democrats winning a decisive majority in the Senate this year. That's why I'm doing everything I can to help our terrific Democratic Senate candidates flip the Senate, and I'd really like you to join me!
One way to flip the Senate is to donate whatever we can afford. If you do leave to donate, please come back and read the rest of my email.
The DSCC is asking informed and engaged Democrats to get more personally involved by sharing their opinions with top Democratic Party leaders.
The Senior Leadership Team is eager to hear from YOU through their General Election Focus Group—and so am I. The DSCC folks will be sharing the results of this survey with me tomorrow at 10:00 A.M.
Will you join the DSCC General Election Focus Group right now? Here's a personalized link so I'll know that you responded: [[URL REDACTED]]
Thank you so much for contributing in whatever ways you can. I look forward to seeing your responses!

'I need your help' -- Mark Kelly
DONATE $5 NOW
Friend, I've seen a lot in my life: from the cockpit of a fighter jet to the Earth from the International Space Station.
But this race for the U.S. Senate is one of the most challenging missions I’ve ever been on.
So let me cut right to the chase: I need your help and your $5 right now to propel my campaign to victory in Arizona and flip the Senate.
For maximum strategic impact, your gift will be split between Mark Kelly and the DSCC
We must win this seat to flip the Senate, and Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight reports that this race is a must-win for us. I'm determined to win in Arizona -- but poll after poll has shown Arizona is a toss-up.
Plus, Mitch McConnell is willing to spend whatever it takes to keep his hold on power. His special interest allies are laser-focused on this race and have been pouring millions into Arizona on attack ads to stall our momentum.
We cannot let up through Election Day and things are heating up. For the first time, my opponent outraised us, and her campaign is picking up steam.
We can win this race, and we can flip the Senate. But it’s important we don’t fall behind, to do that we need a surge of resources right now.
So with our next major deadline fast approaching, I'm asking you humbly but urgently: Will you give $5 right now to keep both my campaign and the DSCC fighting to win battleground races and take back the Senate? >>

Will you help Mark Kelly overcome Mitch McConnell's mega donors and flip another Senate seat in Arizona?

With Lindsey Graham's blatant hypocrisy on full display for the nation this week as he leads the Supreme Court confirmation hearings, Democrats will never have a better shot to defeat him and flip the Senate.

Folks, here's the deal:
It's going to take an incredible amount of money to make Donald Trump a one-term president and defeat his Senate enablers. And with voting already underway in key battleground states, we're quickly running out of time to have a meaningful impact, so I have to ask:
Could you chip in $5 to my campaign and the DSCC today? We need to counter Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell's enormous fundraising machine to elect our Democrats and enact the transformative change America so badly needs.
Donate $5
Asking good folks like you for your hard-earned dollars is one of the toughest parts of this job. But we cannot afford to take our foot off the gas for one second.
We remain locked in a battle for the soul of this nation. And to win, it isn't enough to only defeat Donald Trump. We must flip the Senate and hold to account all those who've sat idly by as Trump lies, obstructs, and passes the buck.
Listen, it won't be easy. We're up against a Republican war chest which they'll gladly spend down to zero to try to buy their way into a second term. And there is simply too much at stake to not give our full one-hundred percent.
With only 16 short days until Election Day, I'm counting on you to dig deep and pitch in so my campaign and Democratic Senate candidates across America have the resources to win.
Will you please split a donation between my campaign and the DSCC today, while there's still time for our investments to have a big impact? It'd mean a lot to me, to Kamala, and to so many Democratic candidates nationwide.

If we don't, ALL of our work over the last few years will have been for nothing:
Please rush in $5 (becomes $20) to help hit our EMERGENCY $500,000 goal. This is our ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME shot to defeat McConnell and flip the Senate -- we can't let it slip away now:
We need your help to flip the Senate. If you've saved payment info with ActBlue Express, your donation will be processed immediately. Donate $5 (becomes $20)

BREAKING from The New York Times: If Mark Kelly wins in Arizona, he could cast the DECIDING VOTE to stop Trump's SCOTUS nominee
A message from Mark Kelly
Donate $5 (becomes $20)
Team -- There has NEVER been so much at stake in a Senate race:
The New York Times announced that if Mark Kelly wins in Arizona, he could be sworn in EARLY and cast the DECIDING VOTE against Trump's SCOTUS nominee!
But recent polling has Mark Kelly just a hair ahead of his GOP opponent. And with control of the Supreme Court on the line, Mitch McConnell and the entire GOP just unleashed an UNPRECEDENTED onslaught of attack ads to defeat Mark!
Failing to fight back could mean losing our ONLY chance to save the Supreme Court.
That's why we set a goal to raise $100,000 to flip the Senate, but right now, we're on track to fall DANGEROUSLY short. We MUST hit this goal, and we won't meet it without your help.
Please, rush in $5 (becomes $20) to elect Mark Kelly, flip the Senate, and save our Supreme Court! The deadline is only HOURS away and no fight is more urgent >>

"These final days might not go as planned...
MAJOR UPDATE, friend, and it's not a good one:
With just 8 days until the most consequential election of our lifetimes, polls in four KEY battleground states have become SUPER close:
DONATE TO FLIP THE SENATE!
We only need to flip four seats to retake Senate control, and Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight reported that we had a chance to defeat SIX GOP senators, including Mitch McConnell AND Lindsey Graham!
But that's why Mitch McConnell’s allies dropped $94 MILLION on attack ads in the first two weeks of October ALONE -- and now, Republicans are SURGING in the polls!
Friend, if we lose these races, we lose our chance to flip the Senate and protect the future of our Supreme Court. There is no room for error, and no time to waste.
We CANNOT let Mitch buy another two years of his majority, but right now, we're falling $27,894 short of tonight's critical fundraising goal. That's why we're triple-matching ALL gifts until midnight.
Please, with the GOP raking in record-breaking sums of money, and only 8 days to turn these races around, will you rush $5 or more -- as much as you can -- right now to defeat McConnell, flip the Senate, and save our Supreme Court?

It's clear why Trump is furious: Dr. Fauci just publicly CONDEMNED his new campaign ad which falsely depicts Fauci praising the administration's COVID response.
In fact, Fauci was applauding public health officials, not Trump!
We all know Donald Trump will do anything to hide the fact that he has FAILED our country on COVID-19.
So it's never been more urgent to stand by Dr. Fauci in this fight. But we still need 213 more signatures from Michigan to prove that the public is with Dr. Fauci!

The latest polls spell trouble for Republicans: Democrats are ahead in FOUR battleground states and are tied in at least SIX, including traditionally GOP strongholds like Georgia and Texas.
We were on track to give Joe Biden a historic Senate majority, but right-wing mega-donors just donated MILLIONS to keep Mitch McConnell in power, and our grassroots fundraising deadline is TONIGHT. If we fail to reach our goal, our chances of winning could be decimated!
President Obama already urged you to get involved, but with Republicans shattering fundraising records we need to ask you once again:
TRIPLE-MATCH ACTIVE: Please, give as much as you can so Democratic candidates have what it takes to win tough races and flip the Senate. We need to raise $250,000 by MIDNIGHT to stay on track! >>
Your donation will be invested to defeat Republicans like Mitch McConnell, Susan Collins, and Lindsey Graham! Donate $5 (becomes $20)

Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee
'I'm asking you to make a donation' - Chuck Schumer
Friend, we have a make-or-break goal of raising $250,000 and I need your help right now to hit it.
Please, click here to give a triple-matched contribution of $5 (it's worth $20) or more to flip the Senate.
I need to make this clear for you: The future of our nation is at stake.
If we fall short, we could lose our chance to flip the Senate and leave the future of the Supreme Court and Roe v. Wade in the hands of Majority Leader McConnell, President Trump, and justices like Brett Kavanaugh.
Majority Leader McConnell and his allies are shattering fundraising records to keep their grip on the Senate majority and cover for President Trump -- so that makes reaching our goal even more critical.
Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight reports the Senate is up for grabs -- but for Democrats to flip the Senate, this grassroots team must step up. Every single donation matters now, whether it's $5 or $25, and right now ALL gifts are being triple-matched!
I'm only asking you because this is absolutely crucial: Will you make a triple-matched gift to elect Democrats and flip the Senate? Every dollar you give will go toward taking back the Senate majority.
Donate $5 (becomes $20)
Donate $10 (becomes $40)
Donate $25 (becomes $100)

With so much at stake, we can't afford to fall short. I'm counting on your immediate contribution before triple-match expires.
Thank you,
Chuck

"What we're watching take place in Washington is a destructive charade.
Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee
'I need you to help...' - Pete Buttigieg
DONATE $5 (BECOMES $20)
If you share my deep sense of alarm over what a Trump-appointed, conservative Supreme Court majority will mean for America, please pitch in $5 (worth $20) today to deliver Joe and Kamala a Democratic Senate. The final public fundraising deadline before Election Day is tonight, and my friends at the DSCC need 23 more grassroots donations in Michigan to reach their must-hit fundraising goal.
What we're watching take place in Washington is a destructive charade.
The Republican Senate refuses to even debate on another coronavirus relief bill, and is instead choosing to ram forward a Supreme Court nominee who would put countless hard-earned rights in jeopardy, including protections for pre-existing conditions, marriage equality, and Roe v. Wade.
We are up against a lot right now. But here's the truth: With the Supreme Court on the line and Mitch McConnell's super PAC allies spending millions and millions against Democrats in key Senate races, your $5 donation couldn't be any more important.
Our nation is at a crossroads and every generous donation helps Democrats end Trump and McConnell's era of chaos.
Tonight is the FINAL public fundraising deadline of the election. So please, pitch in a gift of $5, $10, or even $20 to help retake the Senate. Donating now is the single most impactful way you can help save the future of the Supreme Court.
Donate $5 (becomes $20)

We are so close to defeating Lindsey Graham:
Democrat Jaime Harrison has pulled ahead of Graham in the polls, and experts from Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight to RealClearPolitics say Harrison can really win it!
But with Graham plummeting in the polls, GOP outside groups just announced a massive multi-million dollar spending spree -- and if we don't fight back immediately, all of Democrats' progress in South Carolina and in races across the country could be erased.
After Lindsey Graham's blatant hypocrisy was on full display for the nation last week as he led the Supreme Court confirmation hearings, Democrats have never had a better shot to defeat him and flip the Senate.
This is our chance to FINALLY send Lindsey Graham packing, flip the Senate and save our Supreme Court -- but it’ll only happen if you take action now.
We need to raise $19,723 to counter the GOP's massive spending and end McConnell's reign over our democracy once and for all: Please, rush $5 to elect Jaime Harrison, flip the Senate, and save our Supreme Court.

"Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee
Friend,
My name is Mark Kelly. I’m a retired Navy combat pilot, former space shuttle commander, and the husband of former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords. Now, I’m running for the United States Senate here in Arizona to bring science, data, and facts back to Congress.
I’d like to take a few minutes to introduce myself and share a bit more about why I’m running. But before I do, I’m going to ask you to donate $5, $25, whatever you can spare, to help me flip this seat—and take back the Senate.
To be honest with you, I never expected to be here. Gabby was always the member of Congress in our family. She taught me how to use policy to improve people’s lives. She taught me that when we’re faced with challenges, we should fight harder — not give up.
This campaign is the most intimidating thing I’ve done since the first time I walked up to the space shuttle. But our country is facing big challenges right now, and Washington is broken. We need a leader who can push past the party politics and fix the problems facing Arizona families.
So, can you split a $5 donation between my campaign and the DSCC to help fuel our people-powered campaigns? It’s people like you who chip in that make this mission possible.
Mitch McConnell is spending millions of dollars to try to defeat me. $5 may not seem like a lot, but by the time you chip in, someone will have chipped in $10 and someone else will have chipped in $25 — and that’s how we win! Together, we’ve built a campaign powered by folks like you, and I’m proud of that.
Thank you for your support,
Mark Kelly
Candidate for U.S. Senate, Arizona

"These final days might not go as planned...
MAJOR UPDATE, friend, and it's not a good one:
With just six days until the most consequential election of our lifetimes, polls in four KEY battleground states have become SUPER close:
DONATE TO FLIP THE SENATE!
We only need to flip four seats to retake Senate control, and Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight reported that we had a chance to defeat SIX GOP senators, including Mitch McConnell AND Lindsey Graham!
But that's why Mitch McConnell's allies dropped $94 MILLION on attack ads in the first two weeks of October ALONE -- and now, Republicans are SURGING in the polls!
Friend, if we lose these races, we lose our chance to flip the Senate and protect the future of our Supreme Court. There is no room for error, and no time to waste.
We CANNOT let Mitch buy another two years of his majority, but right now, we're falling short of our emergency $500,000 fundraising goal. That's why we're triple-matching ALL gifts until further notice.
Please, with the GOP raking in record-breaking sums of money and only six days to turn these races around, will you rush $5 or more -- as much as you can -- right now to defeat McConnell, flip the Senate, and save our Supreme Court?
We need your help to flip the Senate. If you've saved payment info with ActBlue Express, your donation will be processed immediately. Donate $5 (becomes $20)

"I'm running for the U.S. Senate against Mitch McConnell -- and with your help, we can win this race.
Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee
'I need your help right now...' - Amy McGrath
CHIP IN $5
Friend,
I'm running for the U.S. Senate against Sen. Mitch McConnell. And I need your help.
Defeating McConnell won't be easy, but I'm up to the challenge. I served 20 years in the Marines, flew 89 combat missions in Iraq and Afghanistan, and overcame the odds to become the first woman Marine to fly a combat mission in an F/A-18 fighter jet.
We can win this race. Independent polling shows that I'm within one point of beating him. And two internal polls we released show the race is virtually tied.
But McConnell has already built up a massive $16.6 million war chest and he's flooding the airwaves with vicious attack ads and smears against me.
I'll need your support right now to run the campaign it will take to defeat him.
So I'm humbly asking you -- will you split a $5 donation to help me defeat McConnell? Your donation will be put to work immediately and it won't just help unseat McConnell -- it will help the DSCC flip the Senate majority for Democrats.
When I was 13, I dreamed of becoming a fighter pilot, but women weren't allowed to serve in combat roles in our military. So I wrote to my elected officials to ask them to change the law. I never heard back from my senator -- McConnell. He wasn't listening then, and he's not listening now.
Kentuckians want a senator who will improve health care and protect Social Security and Medicare. But McConnell tried to rip health care away from Kentuckians, including those with pre-existing conditions. And to top it all off, he recently announced his plan to slash Medicare and Social Security, after his massive tax cuts for the top 1%.
Folks around here know McConnell isn't listening, and they're ready for a change. But I'll need your help to make it happen.
Please, will you split a $5 donation to support my campaign and Democrats running for Senate across the country? Together, we can flip the Senate and defeat Mitch McConnell once and for all.

Amy McGrath
U.S. Senate candidate, Kentucky

A plan to help Democratic Senate candidates like Sara Gideon, John Hickenlooper, Theresa Greenfield, and Jaime Harrison flip the Senate. A plan to win big in November. A plan to start making real, structural change in January.
I'd love to talk with you about that plan face-to-face -- and right now you have the power to make that happen. If you chip in to help flip the Senate before midnight you'll be automatically entered for a chance to hop on a private Zoom call with me.

So I'm personally asking if you can pitch in because if -- and only if -- we work together, we can take back the Senate and change the future of this country.
But, this is your last chance to enter this contest. Even if you've pitched in before, every contribution you make gives you another shot to win.

The Rachel Maddow Show Quote
Donate $5 (Becomes $20)
Election Day is just 11 days away and Democrats are still TIED in three must-win Senate races!
New polling shows these states are so razor-close that anything could tip the scales over the next few days. And with control of the Senate at stake, GOP megadonors just donated millions to DESTROY our Democratic candidates and save McConnell's majority.
If we don't fight back immediately, Mitch McConnell will KEEP his stranglehold on the Senate and GAIN a stranglehold on our Supreme Court.
So please listen to The Rachel Maddow Show and pitch in right now! Your donation can't wait:
Rush in $5 or more to win these TIED races, flip the Senate, and save our Supreme Court. All gifts are TRIPLE-MATCHED and our Democratic candidates are counting on your help before it's too late >>

Hi, it's Joe. I'm humbly asking you to pitch in $5 to help Democrats oust Mitch McConnell and flip the Senate.
You've heard me say over and over that I'm running for President to restore the soul of our nation. Donald Trump is one of the most dangerous presidents our country has ever known.
But this election is about more than just Trump. If we want to create the better future for America that I know is possible, we must flip the Senate.
Winning a Senate majority will pave the way for everything from building on the Affordable Care Act to fighting the climate crisis. But without taking back the Senate from Mitch McConnell, our bold, forward-thinking agenda will be at risk.
Early voting and voting by mail is underway in key battleground states, and your investment right now will have a more significant impact than it would in October or November. So please:
Will you rush a $5 donation before Wednesday's deadline to help Democrats flip the Senate? I want to watch Trump's reckless Republican Senate get voted out of office and your support is mission-critical. >>
Folks, I know we can win this fight. Democratic Senate candidates have real momentum across the country, including in states Republicans thought were strongholds. And that's thanks to grassroots supporters like you pitching in what they can before important deadlines like the one coming up.
We can't afford to slow down one bit, so your support today is critical. Can I please count on you to pitch in a $5 donation to help Democrats flip the Senate?
I can't thank you enough for taking a stand.
Joe
Joe Biden

'I'm asking you to make a donation' - Chuck Schumer
Friend, we have a make-or-break goal of raising $250,000 and I need your help right now to hit it.
Please, click here to give a triple-matched contribution of $5 (it's worth $20) or more to flip the Senate.
I need to make this clear for you: The future of our nation is at stake.
If we fall short, we could lose our chance to flip the Senate and leave the future of the Supreme Court and Roe v. Wade in the hands of Majority Leader McConnell, President Trump, and justices like Brett Kavanaugh.
Majority Leader McConnell and his allies are shattering fundraising records to keep their grip on the Senate majority and cover for President Trump -- so that makes reaching our goal even more critical.
Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight reports the Senate is up for grabs -- but for Democrats to flip the Senate, this grassroots team must step up. Every single donation matters now, whether it's $5 or $25, and right now ALL gifts are being triple-matched!
I'm only asking you because this is absolutely crucial: Will you make a triple-matched gift to elect Democrats and flip the Senate? Every dollar you give will go toward taking back the Senate majority.
Donate $5 (becomes $20)
Donate $10 (becomes $40)

We are facing a make-or-break moment in our nation's history.
The Republican Senate has chosen to prioritize confirming a Supreme Court nominee whose ideology will threaten countless hard-earned rights and health care for millions over providing badly needed coronavirus relief to Americans.
This is our one chance to end Mitch McConnell's era of chaos. But as it stands, Democratic Senate candidates are at risk of being dangerously outspent in the crucial final stretch after a McConnell-aligned super PAC raised an unprecedented $92 million last month.
Here's the truth: The Supreme Court is on the line and McConnell's super PAC allies are spending millions attacking Democrats. So now more than ever, we know we cannot afford to get this wrong.
We only have two more days to elect a Democratic Senate and save the Supreme Court. So please, pitch in a gift of $5, $10, or even $25 to help Democrats retake the Senate.

The Rachel Maddow Show is exactly right: Our ONLY hope to defeat McConnell's MASSIVE attack blitz is if millions of good Democrats step up right now! Please, rush in $5 before it's too late:
Donate $5 (becomes $20)
Team --
We just got word that the McConnell-linked super PAC raised an unprecedented $92 million in the last month, ERASING the financial advantage our Democrats had in key Senate races.
According to breaking press reports, this means Democratic Senate candidates will be outspent in the final stretch of the election UNLESS grassroots Democrats send them an unprecedented surge of support.
We've never faced a threat this massive. Our ONLY hope to fight back and win is to raise $25,000 in the next 24 hours. If we don't, ALL of our work over the last few years will have been for nothing:
Please, rush in $5 or more to help hit our EMERGENCY $25,000 goal. This is our ONCE IN A LIFETIME shot to defeat McConnell and flip the Senate -- we can't let it slip away now >>

Team -- Kamala Harris is asking personally because she knows the choice before us couldn't be any clearer: We cannot take back the Senate unless Democrats take action RIGHT NOW.
We're so close to ending McConnell's destructive majority -- we only need FOUR seats to flip the Senate, and new polls show Democrats leading in at least SIX states.
But McConnell and his allies are raising MILLIONS to attack our Democratic Senate candidates, and right now our fundraising is falling short of what we need to flip the Senate.

Team -- The Rachel Maddow Show said it best: ""If you're Mitch McConnell, you are NOT happy with what you're seeing.""
The latest polls spell trouble for Republicans: Democrats are ahead in FOUR battleground states and are tied in at least SIX, including traditionally GOP strongholds like Georgia and Texas.
We were on track to give Joe Biden a historic Senate majority, but right-wing mega-donors just donated MILLIONS to keep Mitch McConnell in power, and our grassroots deadline is coming up. If we fail to reach our goal, our chances of winning could be decimated!
President Obama already urged you to get involved, but with Republicans shattering fundraising records we need to ask you once again:

Friend --
I never planned to run for Senate. But as my wife, former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords, likes to say, I know when it's time to serve.
I've served our country as a combat pilot and an astronaut. And now, I'm running to serve the great state of Arizona.
This campaign is the most intimidating thing I've done since the first time I walked up to a space shuttle, but the importance of asking for help when you need it is as important now as it was then.
So I'll be blunt with you: I need your help and your $5 right now if I'm going to flip this Republican-held seat and defeat Mitch McConnell's majority tomorrow. >>

Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight says our race is a must-win for Democrats to take back the Senate, and recent polling has this race within the margin of error. But my campaign is facing two serious threats that could cost us the election:
1. A dark money group just dropped $2.3 million on negative ads to blanket Arizona in a last-ditch effort to defeat me.
2. Two recent polls have shown we could be behind in this race. One poll has us down by 2 points and the other has us down by 3 points.
This race is coming down to the wire and I need an immediate surge of resources to win.
Right now, we're falling short of our critical midnight goal, and with votes already being cast, failing to meet this deadline simply isn't an option.
So I'm urgently asking you: Will you chip in $5 today to help my campaign and the DSCC win in Arizona and defeat Mitch McConnell's majority? I won't be able to win tomorrow without your support >>
Full speed ahead!

I have to be honest: If our candidates get outraised again, we'll be put in a terrible bind and may lose our chance to retake the Senate.
In just a few years we've endured Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation, tax cuts for billionaires, rampant corruption, millions at risk of losing health insurance, and unprecedented threats to Social Security.
Now, we can either reclaim control and give Joe Biden a Democratic Senate to rebuild our country, or we can hand Mitch McConnell another two years to continue destroying it.
The stakes are too high to not give this everything we've got, so please:
I'm asking you to give $5 (it becomes $20) to help Democrats close our fundraising gap and flip the Senate. Your gift will be TRIPLE-MATCHED through tonight at midnight to support candidates like Mark Kelly, Sara Gideon, and Jaime Harrison. >>

I'll be blunt because we're running out of time: Friend, can you please pitch in $5 right now to help send Mitch McConnell into retirement and flip the Senate? The fate of the Supreme Court hangs in the balance and Democrats like us cannot sit on the sidelines.
Our nation is at a crossroads, and we only have two choices:
Either we allow Mitch McConnell to keep control of the Senate and decide the future of our Supreme Court, or we win back the Senate so Joe Biden can appoint a fair-minded justice to succeed Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
We absolutely must retake the Senate, friend, but right now we're facing a serious threat that could cost us the election.
McConnell-aligned super PACs just booked tens of millions of dollars' worth of TV ads in key Senate races, and with a critical fundraising deadline on Wednesday, our Democratic Senate candidates are falling short of what they need to fight back.
Please, friend, I'm personally asking you to please pitch in $5 right now to help Democrats retake the Senate and win the most critical election in generations >>
The Trump era has been a disaster for our country, and I know you're ready to turn the page.
We believe in building an America that supports senior citizens with benefits like Social Security, an America that ensures no one is going without food in order to pay for medications, and an America with a Supreme Court that shares our values.
But the only way we can make our vision real is if Democrats retake the Senate this November.
Friend, this is going to be a tough battle, but believe me when I tell you that we can win and secure health care, Social Security, and the future of our Supreme Court along the way.
So please, friend: Don't wake up on November 4th wishing you had stepped up when it mattered. Step up now. Please pitch in $5 to do your part in helping Democrats hit this critical fundraising goal and retake the Senate.

Friend -- I want to make sure you've seen this breaking poll:
Harrison \(D\): 45%, Graham \(R\) 43%
This is the FOURTH new poll that has my campaign leading or tied with vulnerable Republican Senator Lindsey Graham! And folks, the good news doesn't stop there:
According to the nonpartisan election experts at Cook Political Report, this race is officially a TOSSUP!
We've got a real shot to win, but this is still an uphill battle against Lindsey's massive fundraising war chest. He's already launched attack ads against me, and Mitch McConnell's allies just dropped $10 MILLION into South Carolina to crush my momentum.
I need your support to fight back against them:
We need to raise $25,000 by tonight to capitalize on our momentum and send Lindsey Graham a message he can't ignore. In a race this close, we can't have any regrets after Election Day that we should have done more. Can you donate $5 right now to DEFEAT Lindsey Graham and flip the Senate?

Our momentum is giving me hope for the future of South Carolina -- and our country.
And I know how far hope can go.
My mother had me at 16 years old, and my grandparents raised me. Growing up, there were days we had our cereal with water because milk cost too much.
Kids like me weren't supposed to make it very far.
But thanks to a lot of hard work, and, yes, a little bit of hope, I got to study at Yale, work for Jim Clyburn on Capitol Hill, and today -- I know in my heart that together, we can flip this Senate seat and restore hope to folks who desperately need it.
I know that we can win this fight. South Carolinians are sick and tired of watching Lindsey put party above country. We've exceeded expectations every step of this campaign, but we need to hit our fundraising goals or my team and I will be forced to make some hard choices. We can't slow down now.
Please, will you split $5 between my campaign and the DSCC today? Voting is already underway in my race, and every dollar you give will be put to use immediately to defeat Lindsey Graham and other vulnerable Senate Republicans.
No regrets,

"race:
With three days left until Election Day, here are three things you urgently need to know about Michigan’s Senate race:
Gary was outraised by his far-right opponent four of the last five quarters thanks to Republicans like McConnell and the DeVos family funneling in over $40 MILLION to buy this seat for the GOP.
RealClearPolitics moved this race from “Leans Dem” to “Toss-Up,” and recent polling shows Gary two points BEHIND his Trump-backed opponent.
Vox is now reporting that Democrats CANNOT afford to lose this race if they want to retake the Senate majority.
Gary was the ONLY Democrat in a competitive Senate race who didn’t massively outraise his opponent last quarter, and we CANNOT afford to lose Michigan if we want ANY chance at taking back the Senate.
With only three days left in this race and CNN calling Michigan one of the Senate seats ""most likely to flip,"" there's no time to spare.

"Hello —
In the face of today's economic crisis, it won't be enough to build back to the way things were before COVID-19. We have to build back better. That's why today Joe Biden is in Warren, Michigan announcing his plan to ensure the future is Made in America by all of America's workers.
Joe has spent his entire career fighting for working people, and that's exactly what he'll do as president. So it's no surprise that just a day after Joe's visit, Trump will be coming to Michigan to twist the facts about his failed jobs record.
Trump thinks he can fool voters into believing that COVID-19 just miraculously went away and jobs will come roaring back on their own. It's not going to work, because we won't let it.
We need to fight back and make sure voters learn the truth about Trump's failed leadership for Michigan. Will you chip in $10 or more to help us spread that message before Trump's rally tomorrow?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:

The only way Trump can compete with Democrats' energy and enthusiasm is by hosting rallies. That's why we need to fight back against Trump's disinformation campaign and reach voters with the truth about Joe's record of fighting for Michiganders.
But if we don't have the resources to respond to Trump's attacks and make sure voters know the truth about his broken promises, the GOP might get away with keeping this state red.
Rush an urgent donation of $10 or more to ensure we have the resources to respond to incoming attacks from the Trump campaign.
Thank you,
Michigan Dems

Senate Republicans Encourage Public to Celebrate Teachers, Nurses
Shirkey’s remarks coincide with Teacher Appreciation Week and Nurse Appreciation Week
LANSING, Mich., May 6, 2020 – With the wide-reaching effects of COVID-19 touching all aspects of life and creating new challenges for many professions, Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey (R-Clarklake) is emphasizing the importance of this year’s Teacher Appreciation Week (May 4-8) and National Nurses’ Week (May 6-12) and sharing his own words of appreciation.
“We are all experiencing the effects of COVID-19, and in honor of Teacher Appreciation and National Nurses’ Week, I want to express my sincere gratitude to those who work in these two critical professions,” said Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey.
Recent months have seen teachers across the state make the switch from in-person to remote teaching. Within days of the switch, and despite their own situations, teachers were online with their students, continuing to deliver the high-quality education Michigan’s students have come to expect.
“Making the move to remote learning was a significant challenge that Michigan educators were asked to tackle very quickly,” said Shirkey. “They responded immediately and successfully, and we are once again seeing the dedication, passion and expertise of Michigan’s teachers.”
Around the world, the tireless efforts of frontline health care workers have been recognized and celebrated. Shirkey encourages fellow Michiganders to continue sharing their appreciation for nurses and frontline health care workers.
“Supporting and acknowledging nurses—and everyone at the frontline of this world health crisis—is more important now than ever,” said Shirkey. “We need to show our appreciation not only this week but for the weeks, months and years to come. A big thank you to our nurses and health care workers!”
Established in 1985 by the National Parent-Teacher Association, Teacher Appreciation Week takes place during the first full week in May and honors the efforts teachers make to educate the nation’s students. National Nurses’ Week takes place each year between May 6 - 12.

Today is a big campaign finance deadline-there are only 2 weeks until election day! As the election draws near, democrat organizations from around the country are pumping money into Michigan to bolster democrat wins. It is imperative that we protect the Michigan House Republican Majority.
Governor Whitmer and her radical progressive operatives will go to any length to advance her agenda. She has shown that with her excessive orders recently struck down by the Supreme Court.
Senate Republicans are all-in to win the Michigan House and protect a strong conservative majority for Michiganders but WE NEED YOU.
Can you donate today?! Every dollar helps us fight the radical left.
We have two weeks and it is all on the line.
DONATE HERE!
Sincerely,
Mike Shirkey

Last week was proof that our Governor, Gretchen Whitmer, doesn’t care about your constitutional rights. Throughout this process, we have been team players, trying to work with her to protect and restore your rights she is trampling on. She showed her true colors last week-she doesn’t want to work with us-she wants to go it alone and she is proving that she is capable of doing it in an extreme way.
Well, Senate Republicans are fighting back! I am angry. Are you?
She gave us the double middle finger. She is getting too comfortable in her developing role as the lone spokesperson for 10 million people. She falls short of checking any boxes with regards to being a leader.
It first started with her hiring a democrat operative firm to keep track of our health records. When this was discovered and we called her out, she fired them immediately with little comment. She continues to make unforced errors and demonstrate that she is tone deaf.
Then, our caucus, along with the House Republicans, tried to negotiate with her on re-opening our culture, our society and our jobs. And guess what she did? She broke trust and released private emails to the media on the negotiations from staff. I guess that proves that she doesn’t want to work with us.
We need to send a STRONG message to her. We are fighting back. Will you join me? Pledge that you are fighting back for your constitutional rights.
I am asking you to consider making a donation for our cause. I am mad. Are you?
Sincerely,
Mike Shirkey

Fellow Michigander,
These are strange times we are living in. Like many of you, I am trying to keep up on the constant deluge of facts. I have spent much of the last few days in meetings assessing the options to cope with the coronavirus pandemic in a way that protects life in Michigan. Governor Whitmer's executive order Monday requires non-essential businesses and employees to stay home and stay healthy. I know this is difficult and I know this is putting a strain on many families and businesses.
Over the last few weeks, I have seen the best of people and industry in Michigan and across the country, and it renews my faith. Citizens, companies, and businesses working together to re-tool to supply much needed personal protective equipment, food, and supplies to families, health care workers and first responders. It is a true testament that we are all in this together. We are being asked to make significant sacrifices for the good of the world. Consider that-it is profound.
I have no doubt, we will overcome. I see brighter days ahead and I am in awe of the power of our communities and our residents.
In the eternal words of President Ronald Reagan, it can be done. Thank you for your sacrifice, know that it is not going unnoticed.

Fellow Michigander,
As we make our way through week 3 of Stay Home, Stay Safe, I wanted to provide an update of where things stand. None of us are immune to this and we must continue to practice extreme social distancing to beat this virus.
We also must continue to focus our efforts on supporting our families, students, and businesses through this time. When we beat the virus, we will still have significant economic impacts to navigate.
The Governor asked the legislature to extend the state emergency declaration by 70 days this week. My colleagues and I, as a result of communication with our constituents, had serious reservations about extending the declaration to such an extent. We took extraordinary precautions to meet on Tuesday, in the safest manner we were able, and ultimately decided to extend it to April 30. We may need to revisit that date in the coming weeks but at this time, we felt that proceeding with that date was the most reasonable option.
We also continue to work on a myriad of issues surrounding the situation we find ourselves in. I have no doubt that there will be significant policy measures that need to be taken in response to the educational and economic impact this coronavirus has on our state, our country, and our world. If you have any issues, please feel free to reach out to your state senator. Staff are working remotely during this time but they remain accessible, only a phone call or email away.
Although we may be heading into some of the hardest weeks, I am confident that the true spirit of Michiganders and of Americans will continue to pour out. Everyday, we can find more and more examples of ingenuity, bright spots, and American resolve. I am confident that these bright spots will soon outweigh the bad news.
Stay home, stay healthy, stay positive. We will get through this.

Governor Whitmer has issued 103 executive orders to rule Michigan since COVID-19 arrived on our shores. 103!
The Governor of Illinois has issued 35. The Governor of Indiana has only issued 27. And in Ohio, the Governor has relied upon a meager 19 executive orders to help manage the presence of COVID-19. If we combine all the orders issued by governors of neighboring states, we are still 22 orders short of reaching the 103 orders Governor Whitmer has thrust upon our lives and livelihoods.
Gretchen Whitmer does not want to govern. She wants to rule by executive order. She does not recognize us as citizens. She's trying to rule us like subjects. America did away with that system long ago.
These onerous orders are confusing and frustrating. Governor Whitmer has left our citizens with no real answers and no ability to navigate their surroundings without fear of inadvertently breaking the law.
It is more important than ever that we work together to put an end to rule by executive order and return to government of the people, by the people, and for the people.
We cannot do it alone. We need your help. $5, $10, $100 - any amount helps us fight. Elections have consequences. At the worst of times we are seeing exactly what that means.
Donate!
Sincerely,
Mike Shirkey

In 4 days, you'll be able to get a haircut.
Governor Whitmer took to the airways last week and celebrated that she will grant permission for barbershops and salons to reopen in Michigan. This change came days after the governor insulted the men and women who own small businesses and employ our neighbors and family members by telling Michiganders to ""Google"" at-home haircuts.
It does not appear as though the governor has gone without her own personal glam squad during the pandemic, but you and I are NOT allowed to support our community businesses or take care of ourselves. As always, it's one set of rules for our privileged Governor and another set of rules for the rest of us. As we have said time and again: we are ready to safely and sensibly return to our daily lives.
Residents in Ohio and Indiana have been able to get haircuts for three weeks. Even Illinois reopened their barbershops and salons in May. In Michigan, you can take your dog to the groomer, but you cannot get a haircut. There is no rhyme or reason to the decisions made by Governor Whitmer.
We need your help and support in order for us to continue to fight to push for change and restore commonsense. You cannot sit on the sidelines and wait for the governor to grant you permission to return to your lives and livelihoods. It is time to engage!

Mike Shirkey

Elections have consequences.
Last Tuesday, voters were given the opportunity to choose Republican candidates to best represent them this fall. Now, we must unite for victory in November.
Republicans up and down the ballot, from the Michigan and U.S. House, our President, the Supreme Court and university governing bodies need our help.
Won't you consider donating? Your efforts will allow the Senate Republicans to support our Republican legislative partners in the Michigan House - it is imperative that we maintain a Republican majority to thwart the progressive Democrat agenda.
The November election is not about choosing to be part of one political party over another, it is about choosing to stand up and support the candidates who will work to protect our American values. Any amount helps. Together, we can deliver election victories this November.

When is enough, enough?
More than 250 years ago, a revolution was spurred by a lack of representation. A small but mighty group of citizens waged a war to overcome tyranny and a political agenda forced upon them without their permission. The result was a new republic founded in liberty with the understanding that citizens would be represented by their government: America.
Fast forward to the position we find ourselves in today. Our Governor is acting unilaterally without consulting with her co-equal branches of government. The curtain behind which decisions are being made has not been opened to the Legislature. And as far as I have been told, it isn't going to be. She is blazing a dangerous path as the lone decision maker for 10 million Michiganders and it is incumbent upon us to resist. It is exactly what our forefathers rebelled against 250 years ago.
I find her actions infuriating. I find her lack of respect for the legislature and the thousands of Michigan citizens that NEED to get back to work maddening.
Let me be clear, a literal revolt is not what I am getting at here. Our best recourse is through the third co-equal branch of our government, the courts. Exactly as our system of government was designed to work, when two branches disagree, the third weighs in. We must properly employ the design of our beautiful republic.
The lawsuits are piling up. At last count, I saw 16 lawsuits against Governor Whitmer and some of her nonsensical executive orders. Churches, Congressman, and now the Senate Republicans and the legislature have filed suit against Governor Whitmer and her dictatorial actions. Stay tuned, oral arguments coming soon.
When is enough, enough? Donate today and join us.

The 4th of July is a time to gather with our family and friends to celebrate our unique American values. Our backyard BBQs may be smaller this year and there may be fewer fireworks to light up the night sky, but the pride we feel for our country is not diminished.
Senate Republicans continue to deliver better policies for our state. As of July 1st, Michiganders can take advantage of changes in car insurance that end the mandate of unlimited coverage and deliver choice to families looking to lower their car insurance rates.
We recently passed legislation to ensure our schools have the funds necessary to prepare for a safe restart in the fall. We supported hazard pay for first responders and front-line workers. And, the Senate Republicans committed hundreds of millions of dollars to improve Michigan's preparedness for COVID-19.
This weekend, while you are celebrating the beauty of our country and the freedoms you enjoy, consider supporting the Senate Republican Caucus as we continue to work to improve our state and pursue reforms that deliver savings for Michigan families.
Happy 4th of July and God Bless America!
