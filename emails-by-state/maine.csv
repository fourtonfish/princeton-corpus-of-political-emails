Hey Team,
Good News – we got all our mail out before the deadline and we got all our ads up and running before that new deadline.
More Good News – We hit almost 60,000 doors last week and nearly 250k phone calls. We are over 440,000 doors this election cycle.
Bad News – We still need funding to fill the gaps on our GOTV program for the final weekend. Need to boost pieces of our turnout operation in CD1, make sure we get final info out in our targeted state and federal races and chase down absentee ballots that have not been returned.
Can you send something out to our strongest supporters asking them to chip in and help fill these gaps? Things are going to be close and putting every bit of muscle we can into turnout is critical.
Let’s ask them to donate here so we know they got this message and responded.

Friend,
I'm not a Senator because of the fanfare. I'm a Senator because first and foremost I want to help the incredible people of Maine. The very people who in turn, helped shape me into the person I am today.
I grew up in Caribou, Maine where I learned firsthand the value of hardwork and a hard earned dollar. As a child I picked potatoes -- working alongside my siblings to help our local farmers and our community.
I was born in Maine, raised in Maine, live in Maine, and I take my job representing Maine very seriously.
I'm not in Washington DC for the fancy dinners or hoop-la, in fact, my favorite meal since I was a young girl was lobster and a baked potato, and it still is to this day. My vote can't be bought and I can't be bullied by special interest groups or liberal billionaires -- I work directly for the people of Maine and America.
Friend, I'm writing to you today because the race here in Maine is unlike anything I've ever seen before. Up until this election cycle, all of the campaigns I've faced have been against Mainers, where we've had civil debates about the real issues Mainers face. But this year has been anything but civil.
After I cast my vote for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, Chuck Schumer decided he wanted to turn Maine blue... and with that decision came a sudden flood of money and attacks like we have never seen before. This year more outside money has poured into Maine than any other state in the nation.
Maine is a small state, yet more money is blanketing Maine than anywhere else. It's a startling thing to think about... especially if you realize that Mainers might see more than 30 attack ads against me every day of the week!
Right now I am up against an opponent who is NOT from Maine and who was specifically chosen by Elizabeth Warren and Chuck Schumer to run against me. You see, Chuck and Elizabeth want a dependable liberal vote in Washington.
If you don't want to see the Senate in Schumer's liberal, tax-raising hands, then I need you to stand with my campaign right now.
Donate to Susan >>>
Asking for money is my least favorite thing to do. I know how hard you work for your paycheck, and I want you to know that not a penny goes to waste on our campaign. Every dollar donated will go immediately towards our GOTV efforts.
The balance of the Senate will come down to Maine.
Yes, Maine is the state who will decide whether or not to hand the Senate over to Chuck Schumer.
Friend, this campaign is far from over. Right now the polls are tied and 12% of Mainers remain undecided. Your support will help my team reach these undecided voters and ensure they know the stark contrasts between me and Sara Gideon.
No donation is too small -- every dollar makes a difference, and in fact, it could be your dollar that helps us reach the undecided voter who decides this election.
I hope I can count on your support. Our future is counting on it.
Sincerely,
Susan Collins

Friend,
I'm writing to you again about the Maine Senate race because the situation there has gotten worse.
<< SUPPORT SUSAN TODAY >>
Susan's liberal opponent, Sara Gideon, has launched smear after smear, spending absurd amounts of money on ads filled with lies and misleading personal attacks against Susan's record and integrity. Funded by the likes of Chuck Schumer, Elizabeth Warren and Hillary Clinton, Susan's opponent would be just a puppet for the Democratic leadership in the Senate.
Here are a few things we all know to be true...
* We know when the coronavirus hit the U.S., Sara Gideon closed Maine's legislature's doors and hit the campaign trail, showing her true colors: she cares more about running for office than delivering for the people of Maine.
* We know when coronavirus devastated the U.S. economy, Susan wrote the Paycheck Protection Program, delivering massive relief to America's workers and small businesses and never took a day off from fighting for Americans. (not to mention, Susan has also NEVER missed a roll call vote while serving as Maine's Senator!!)
* We know in 2018, the Far Left threatened Susan over Justice Brett Kavanaugh and when she didn't take their bribe, they promised to create a $4 MILLION slush fund for her opponent. (Which Sara Gideon gleefully accepted last month!)
* We know Sara Gideon trashed the Paycheck Protection Program on the campaign trail but behind hid the fact her husband's law firm took up to $2 million from the program.
* We know Sara Gideon continually lies about who she supports and who's supporting her. She's been untruthful about her connection to Defund the Police and Big Pharma.
Most importantly, we know, if elected, Sara Gideon would be disastrous for the people of Maine and America. Schumer could count on her loyal support for his left-wing agenda.
That's why it's so critical we stand with Susan right now. Susan and her team are doing everything they can to win, but it's not enough. They need our support right now to ensure they cross the finish line in November with a WIN!
<< SUPPORT SUSAN TODAY >>
Our country's future is resting on what happens in Maine, which could determine who controls the Senate. That's why I am so hopeful you'll take a moment right now to show your support.

DEFEND THE SENATE MAJORITY
Friend, I just must show you this. I'm so glad to see what Susan Collins has said about her campaign in a recent Politico article.
Of the millions of dollars in negative advertising being spent to ruin her good name Sen. Collins had this to say:
""It's very frustrating because it's backed by so much money. And it's been going on for two years now: Non-stop negative ads. That eventually it pulls you down,"" Collins said of the campaign against her. ""What's amazing is that I'm still going to win.""
That is the Susan Collins I know and respect: fiery, smart, level headed and grounded.
SUPPORT SUSAN TODAY
Susan is a fighter and wicked smart deal cutter. She's not in Washington D.C. for the fancy dinners or exclusive events or notoriety... Susan Collins puts her name and energy on the line every day to make Maine and the United States a better place. And she's darn good at it!
Here is another snippet from the article that I thought was noteworthy:
Susan is the toughest, most tenacious, most resilient and most durable member of the Senate. She is quite literally under attack 24/7 and continues to lead an incredible campaign. Chuck Schumer has openly admitted that he is targeting Susan Collins and doing everything he can to oust her from Congress and she still remains grounded and strong.
Susan needs a huge influx of support TODAY. Her team is trying to buy valuable airtime on television to sway the 12% of undecided voters to become Team Collins members.
Your donation today will go directly into her advertising campaigns. Maine voters deserve to hear from Susan herself, but without you, they will only hear lies from Chuck Schumer bought cronies.
Please, friend, won't you chip into Susan's campaign right now?
CHIP IN NOW
Susan's team is buying a major advertising spot this Monday. Will you please chip in now so they can be ready to wire the money over?
CONTRIBUTE NOW
Thank you so much, I know it will make Susan glad to see your name on her donor list.

P.S. I'm contacting you today because I know you support Susan Collins, but I need you to make a donation to Susan's campaign before it's too late. The entire country is following her fundraising numbers and scrutinizing her every move. We need to rally behind Susan and support her with everything we got.

To unsubscribe visit here
Dear Friend,
You may have heard Susan’s opponent will receive an additional $4 million after the primary election polls close tonight. I wanted to explain to you how this worked and why we have never seen anything like it in American politics.
Two years ago, the Far Left tried to buy Susan’s vote during the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanuagh. They tried to bribe Susan into voting the way they wanted.
In the weeks leading up to the confirmation vote, many Far Left groups got together and conducted a smear campaign against Justice Kavanaugh. They leaked confidential documents and politicized the confirmation process in stunning ways. Knowing that Senator Collins would be a critical swing vote, they created a “CrowdPAC” fund. They asked people to contribute money to fund Susan’s future opponent if she voted for Justice Kavanaugh. If she voted against him, the money would be refunded.
This fund -- now totaling over $4 MILLION dollars -- is to be awarded to the winner of the Maine democratic primary -- Susan’s future opponent, TONIGHT.
No matter what you think of Justice Kavanaugh, this is not the way our democracy should work. We do not “auction off” votes to the highest bidder.
However, Susan stood her ground, ignored their threats, and did what was right -- as she always does.
At that moment, the Far Left got away with something unprecedented. Never before in American politics has a group attempted to bribe a US Senator in this way.
While Susan refused to take that bribe, her opponent has no issue cashing in and taking every penny.
This is why Susan needs your help today. Please chip in to help her fight for what is right and to show the far left that votes are not for sale.
Thank you.

Friend,
Far Left liberal, Sara Gideon, quietly announced Thursday evening that her campaign had raised $39.4 MILLION.
For a number of reasons she was quiet about this number. Sara, herself, could not be more out of touch with Mainers, but she realizes one thing: no one in Maine is impressed with her excessive fundraising haul. And the top reason no one's impressed is because 94% of her $39.4M came from donors living outside of Maine.

Sara's campaign is being run and financed by Chuck Schumer, Elizabeth Warren, Nancy Pelosi, AOC and their staffs and liberal donors. Not one of them actually cares about Mainers, they just want to ""fill the Seat"" with a vote they can count on.
We have just two weeks to ensure these liberals aren't able to BUY this election. Please, friend, if you don't want to see Maine turn into another vote for Schumer, support Susan right now.
Help Susan fight back →
Friend, Susan is running a campaign OF Maine and FOR Maine. Susan was born and raised in Caribou and has spent her entire life working for Mainers. No one knows the issues facing Mainers better than Susan.
Sara is a dream candidate for the National Far Left liberals -- which is evidenced by her fundraising totals -- they know they can count on her to support their agenda from top to bottom.
We need your help to fight back. With just 2 weeks to go, every dollar raised goes instantly towards our efforts to add last minute advertising across the Maine airwaves, help cover the final costs of printing pamphlets and getting Susan's message in front of Maine voters.

Maine is in trouble. The US Senate race being battled out between Susan Collins and her opponent Sara Gideon is the most expensive and contested race in the Senate this year.

Although Hillary Clinton failed as a presidential candidate, she still has a voice that reaches millions on the far left. A tweet from Hillary Clinton has the capacity to raise millions of dollars for Susan’s opponent.
Hillary would love nothing more than to have people remember her for helping to win the Senate for the Democrats rather than running the poorly operated Presidential campaign that she did. Don’t be mistaken -- Hillary doesn’t actually care about Mainers, she is doing this to try and “fix” her reputation.
We cannot let Hillary Clinton determine what happens in Maine.
Susan has always and will always put the lives and livelihoods of Mainers and Americans first, but she won’t be able to do so if she’s not successful in November.
Your donation today will help Susan reach every Maine voter and make certain they know the differences between Susan and her opponent.
No donation is too small -- in fact, it could be YOUR donation that helps us reach that undecided voter which pushes us to victory.
Our nation’s future is at stake. We must take every action we can today to ensure victory in November.

"Sara Gideon Raised Taxes, and Wants to Keep Raising Taxes.
To unsubscribe visit here
Friend,
As we close in on Election Day, our supporters are asking how they can help Susan win!
We need you to talk to your friends, family, and coworkers and make sure they know the key facts in this race. Thousands of Maine voters are still undecided, this race is neck and neck, and every single vote counts.
Can you share this information with as many people as possible? However you can do it - social media, email, phone, in person conversations -- it all helps!
Sara Gideon Raised Taxes, and Wants to Keep Raising Taxes
Sara Gideon's record is clear. As a Town Councillor in Freeport, she voted to raise property tax rates by 20%. And in the State Legislature, she supported increased taxes and fees an astounding 86 times.
Those are the facts. And they make it clear what Gideon would do if she's elected to the US Senate.
Gideon has already promised to raise income taxes on 90% of Mainers. She proposed a fuel tax that would increase the cost of gasoline and heating oil by 40 cents a gallon. That means an extra $100 every time Mainers fill the oil tank - and would be especially harmful to seniors and low income families who rely on oil to heat their homes.
Gideon even promises a tax on health care -- making Mainers who can't afford insurance premiums pay a $1,000 fine. How does that make sense?
Sara Gideon has pushed tax increases on everything from food to beer, and from heating oil to health care. And she'll keep raising your taxes, unless we stop her.
This is a critical issue in this race, and a message we need your help to get out. Every last undecided voter needs to know Sara Gideon chose her campaign over helping the people of Maine.
Thanks for all you do, and please spread this message far and wide!

Sara Gideon's false claims of ""bipartisanship""
Susan Collins has been named the most bipartisan member of Congress for seven years in a row. Putting Maine before political parties is what she's known for.
Sara Gideon knows this, and she's tried to sell a totally made up story of her own bipartisan record.
But it's completely false. Sara Gideon is a party-line extremist who couldn't name a single time she's ever bucked her party… she even called Republicans “terrorists” at one point. And if she goes to Washington, she'll vote in lock-step with Chuck Schumer.
Ken Fredette was the Republican leader in the House and worked directly with Gideon. Ken calls Gideon ""the most partisan Democratic leader that we've seen in the Legislature in the last half-century.""
Please watch the ad below, and share it in any way you can:

"This is BAD.
To unsubscribe click here
Friend -- with only 6 days until election day, the Democrats just launched their BIGGEST attack of this race.
In their most egregious move yet, Chuck Schumer and national Democrats bought a $3.43 MILLION ad buy during the final week of this race. To put this into perspective, that is more money than my campaign spent on TV during the ENTIRETY of my 2014 race.
This move has never made Chuck Schumer and my opponent�s motives more clear: they are blatantly trying to buy this election. They aren�t respecting the voters of Maine and will do absolutely anything to win.

That is why I must ask for your support during the final few days of this race. The number of false attacks against me is inconceivable. The polls are tied. And there are only days left of this race. Can I count on you to chip in to my campaign right now to help me fight back before election day?

Friend, it all comes down to this. Chuck Schumer and my opponent think they can buy this Senate seat. I need your help right now to fight back and let them know Maine and the future of the United States Senate is NOT for sale.

To unsubscribe click here
Friend,
If I've said it once, I've said it 1,000 times: the Senate majority will come down to what happens in Maine.
Support a RED Senate Majority HERE
Moreover, what happens in Maine will determine the leadership of the U.S. Senate for years to come. If Susan is ousted from Congress by the likes of Chuck Schumer, Elizabeth Warren, the Hollywood and D.C. elites, and the failed Clinton administrations, our country's premier legislative body will be led by left-wing partisans, intent on passing their far-left agenda, no compromise, no bipartisanship, no cooperation.
This is why I need you to support Susan TODAY with a $5, $15, $25, $50 or $100 contribution.
The entire Liberal money making-machine is pummeling Maine with false ads and just downright lies, Friend. We must do something about it. We can't let Chuck Schumer, Planned Parenthood and the Defund the Police Movement try bullying a common sense leader like Susan.
Listen, you may agree what Chuck Schumer is doing - the mockery he's making of the process of free elections - is wrong. But if you don't stand up for what's right, you're giving Schumer a free pass to keep doing.
We must help Susan win. There's TOO MUCH at stake to ignore the race in Maine.
Friend, please, I hate asking people for money. I know you work hard for each paycheck. But Susan needs you to chip in $5, $10 or $15 before midnight so she can keep her ads on the air, buy postcards and yard signs, and fill-up her campaign tour bus through the end of the month.
Chip in NOW >>>
Thanks for checking out my plan, Friend. I know you'll help save the Senate this November.

P.S. I'm not afraid to break rank. Neither is Susan. I'm not afraid to disagree with colleagues on my ""side of the aisle."" Neither is Susan. This is why I respect her so much.
→ Susan has always been an independent voice in Congress. She's not afraid to stand alone to do what's right for her state and country. Susan studies through the night, on planes and buses and on weekends. She works harder than any other Senator -- even when cameras are off and Sara Gideon is hiding away. Susan has true character and integrity - she'll do the right thing when no one is looking and even when it's not popular.

Right now the Far Left is pouring millions and millions of liberal dollars into Maine to tarnish and destroy Susan Collins. They are flooding Maine with outside funds from their Hollywood money machine to try and turn the Senate BLUE.
Friend, Susan has had our backs time and time again. She has voted to lower taxes and she wrote the legislation to help small businesses through the COVID-19 crisis.
If Susan Collins loses in November, our nation will NEVER be the same. The Senate will fall into Chuck Schumer's hands and everything we've fought for would disappear in an instant.
It's a terrible thought, and it's why we've got to work overtime to ensure it doesn't happen.

Yes, you read that right. Senator Elizabeth Warren is on the campaign trail to endorse and help fundraise for Susan’s opponent. She is trying to control Maine’s election.
Yesterday, she sent out a fundraising email full of falsehoods. Her false attacks show that the Far Left will stop at nothing to flip the Senate in November. The Far Left is more interested in unseating Susan than doing what is right for Maine. Over 120 days ago, Susan’s opponent -- the Speaker of the Maine House -- shut her office doors and hit the campaign trail, leaving Mainers without a state legislature. That is not the leadership Maine deserves.
The Far Left is working around the clock to get rid of Susan. Chuck Schumer, Hillary Clinton, and Elizabeth Warren have all teamed up to help Susan’s opponent spread these false attacks across Maine. But we are stronger!

P.S. Susan is a tremendous role model of mine. Because she refuses to be bought off or bullied, she has had to face a barrage of attacks from the Far Left. But she has always faced these attacks with grace and refuses to let it sway or change her. She's calm in a storm and brave in a fight. Even now.
Ever since being elected to Congress and even before so, I've viewed Susan Collins as an incredible leader for the citizens of Maine. Mainers know when Susan tells them she's working on a bill or fighting to change a law that she is working day and night to fulfill her promise. I hope I can represent and serve my constituents with the same amount of fervor and excellence in which she serves the people of Maine.

We need you to fight back against the lies -- we know that sounds daunting but TOGETHER we can do this.
Support Susan Today >>>
We can’t give up! As we enter the fall months and Election Day gets closer and closer, Schumer, Warren, Pelosi, Clinton, and Obama will release all their fury on our campaign. Together we will weather their storms, but only if we are together on this.
Can you pitch in to our campaign today? $5, $10, $25, $50 or whatever you can contribute would make an enormous difference in our ability to fight back against their attacks!
Thank you so much for your loyal support, friend.

Friend,
I have a critical update for you on the status of my campaign.
My August End-of-Month deadline is only FOUR days away. This deadline has become the most CRITICAL fundraising deadline of my campaign to date. And right now, my campaign continues to be OUTRAISED and ATTACKED by my opponent and her Far Left allies.
As I write this to you, Chuck Schumer and his Far Left allies are planning another multi-million dollar ad campaign against me. They have spent so much money in my race that almost every single commercial on Maine TV is a false attack on my record. In order to have enough resources to fight back against their shameless lies, I need your support before this incredibly important deadline.
Can I count on you to chip in to my campaign before August 31st at Midnight? The Far Left has outraised us for this ENTIRE race. We must catch up and fight back against their lies!

Yesterday marked our July End-of-Month deadline and we were just short of reaching our goal.
However, this morning we were alerted of two incredible things that will help us get there:
FIRST: Our campaign’s deadline was granted an EXTENSION for just 24 hours! Even though we missed our goal yesterday, we still have time to get there.
SECOND: For today only, supporters have pledged that every donation to Susan’s campaign will be 5X matched. That means every dollar you give to our campaign will be matched an additional 5X times!
We MUST take advantage of this rare opportunity. Until midnight tonight, our End-of-Month deadline is extended with a 5X match activated on ALL donations! Can Susan count on you to chip in today and help her FIGHT BACK against the Far Left?
5X MATCH $500 → $3,000

Susan’s opponent has a massive war chest of Far Left money waiting for her to spread lies through the rest of this election. On top of that, she continues to outraise our campaign month after month. We must take advantage of this opportunity to CATCH UP and get AHEAD!
This opportunity expires tonight and MIDNIGHT! Donate before it’s gone!
Thank you for all your support. Susan is counting on you.

Friend, this election isn't about Susan Collins. It's about protecting our people, continuing to strengthen our economy, and ensuring taxes stay as low as possible. Susan has a bipartisan record of fighting for our future, and Susan's opponent has a record of being a puppet for the Far Left.
If Sara Gideon were to win this November, she would do and say whatever Chuck Schumer, Elizabeth Warren, Nancy Pelosi and AOC want. She wouldn't have a backbone or a voice of her own. Simply put, if Sara Gideon were to win, it would be destructive and irreversible for not only Maine but our entire nation.
But here's the good news. We still have 75 days before Election Day and 75 days to fight around the clock ensuring Susan Collins is victorious in November.
That's why we are reaching out to you today. The Far-Left is going to view this announcement as a victory. We need your support to ensure Susan has the resources needed to run the strongest campaign possible over the next 75 days.

You see, Susan is running her own campaign. She oversees every television or radio ad that is approved. But Sara Gideon is running a campaign controlled by the Far Left. She says or does whatever they want her to do. She is on board with their agenda and will support it down the line in the Senate.
It's honestly a terrifying thought. The Far Left wants to elect someone who will support them no matter what, and they know they have NO power or control over Susan Collins.
If you want to send a strong message to the Far Left that you don't want that kind of agenda in the Senate, that you want to send a strong, independent, trusted leader who will fight at all costs for our nation, then we hope you will stand with Susan right now!!

I've never faced a campaign like this before. In fact no one in Maine or anywhere in the country has. More outside dollars have poured into Maine than any other state. And, it appears there's going to be no end in sight.
But here's the good news. We don't need to match my opponent dollar for dollar. But we do need to hit our fundraising goals. Let me explain.
My campaign has a path to success, but it requires being able to increase our television advertising each week, adding additional digital ads, and extending our voter outreach efforts. Not reaching our fundraising targets would mean having to pull back from some of our GOTV programs and quite frankly, it could put the election in jeopardy.
Our future is on the line this fall. This campaign is not about me, it's about ensuring Mainers have a voice they can count on in the Senate. My opponent wouldn't be a voice we could count on; she will just echo whatever Chuck Schumer and Elizabeth Warren do.
So, today I'm asking you to please stand with my campaign by making a donation of whatever you can afford. And if you've given before, I hope you will consider making another contribution.

Every dollar that is donated goes immediately towards our GOTV efforts and not a penny is wasted. You can rest assured that your hard earned dollars will go to great use to win this November!

Friend,
I've been a part of politics for long enough to recognize a historic moment, and the onslaught of vicious attacks Democrats are hurling at Susan Collins -- and the way they are trying to push her out of the US Senate -- are unprecedented, landmark and historic.
SUPPORT SUSAN TODAY
Susan Collins is a vital member of the US Senate. In all her years of public service, she has never missed a roll call vote, she consistently puts her constituents first, and she is one of the most hard working Senators in Congress. But right now there is a frenzied campaign led by the far Left liberals to oust Susan from the Senate.
Her opponent, Sara Gideon, is funded and supported by the radical Left (Chuck Schumer, Elizabeth Warren, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama) and has spent millions of dollars to spread lies about Susan.
And after Susan's opponent won the Democrat primary, something unprecedented happened -- something that has never occurred in the history of our democracy -- Gideon was given $4 million dollars for winning a mostly uncontested race. Friend, that has never been done before, and the fact that it happened just last month should bother you.

Susan fight back >>
Here are the details:
In 2018, when Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh was up for confirmation, partisan activists cornered Susan to try and buy her vote. If she voted against Justice Kavanaugh, the money would be refunded to donors and just ""go away."" But if she voted for Kavanaugh, they would award her future opponent $4 million!
Susan's vote cannot and will not ever be bought -- something you and I both know full well. She is one of the toughest leaders out there.
But her vote that day in 2018 made her campaign a massive target, some pollsters and experts are claiming Maine's US Senate race is the most expensive and contested race in the country right now. And Susan is at a $4 million disadvantage.
Republicans need to rally behind Susan's campaign if we want to hold the Senate this fall. If we let the Senate slip into Schumer's greedy hands, Republicans will have no majority voice in Congress for YEARS.
Susan, you have my support!!

Friend,
One of the things that makes the Senate so incredible is the variety of backgrounds, voices and opinions. In a perfect world, each of these 1OO leaders would listen to each other, treat everyone with respect and be courteous.
Of course, as you know, that's not the case. Our political system has devolved into mayhem and become more divisive than ever.
However there is one Senator who I can always count on to not only treat everyone with dignity but to listen to both sides of the argument, to put in the hours and hours of research needed to fully understand the bill being discussed or any topic that's up for debate. And that Senator is Susan Collins.

Susan exemplifies what a Senator should be. She is only beholden to the American people and the great people of Maine.
She has NEVER missed a vote in the Senate. Friend, I can say with certainty -- never missing a vote is quite an accomplishment, and further exemplifies how serious she takes her role as a Senator and how much of an asset she is not just for Mainers, but all Americans. She is truly 1 in 1OO.
The Democrats, led by Chuck Schumer and Elizabeth Warren, are working around the clock to defeat Susan Collins. They want to replace Susan's voice in the Senate with one that they can control. The thought of that is terrifying to me, as I hope it is to you as well.
Not much time remains until voters head to the polls, so we've got to do everything we can to ensure Susan has the help she needs.
Won't you please stand with me in supporting Susan right now?
Yes, Tim! I'll join you in supporting Susan! We can't lose her in the Senate!

Friend,
I'm being outraised and I need your immediate help.
All accounts of the money Democrats raised since Friday evening are staggering. An investment of $6 MILLION or more into Maine by my opponent's supporters could drastically change the outcome of this election in November.
I need your IMMEDIATE help to fight back and keep the Senate red.
KEEP THE SENATE RED
<< Rush an emergency $250 now >>
<< Rush an emergency $100 now >>
<< Rush an emergency $50 now >>
<< Rush an emergency $20.20 now >>
If we slip any further in our fundraising goals, the Democrats will overtake us in advertising and drown out our Maine-first message before Election Day.
\---> This race in Maine will decide the Senate majority, and a victory for the Democrats means liberals will be completely in charge.
I need your help to raise $500,000 between now and the end of the quarter this month. Will you join me?
Together we can keep the Democrats at bay and send a strong message that Republicans are here to win.
Donate Now... Before Time Runs Out!
If we can't meet our $500,000 goal before the end of the month, Democrats will have an easy path to victory. Please don't let us fall behind.

Friend,
I hate asking again -- but this is absolutely critical.
There are only HOURS remaining until the most important deadline of my campaign. Once the clock strikes midnight, my final End-of-Quarter deadline will be over and we will enter the final stretch of this race. We must be prepared for what the next few weeks will bring...
The attacks this summer were outrageous. The lies this fall have been unthinkable. But Friend, I promise you we haven't seen the worst of it. These next 34 days leading to November 3rd will be the most vicious and difficult days of this race. And right now, my campaign does not have the funding we need in order to fight back against the Far Left's lies.
That is why I must ask you this: Can I count on you to give a donation of any size to my campaign before midnight? We are still $100,000 away from our goal and need your help to get there. It is critical that we are well funded NOW so we have enough time to fight back against the immense amount of dark money and fake ads they are going to funnel into Maine throughout October.
DONATE NOW
I wouldn't be reaching out if this wasn't absolutely necessary. Chuck Schumer and my opponent are trying to buy this election and it is our job to tell him Maine and the United States Senate are not for sale. I hope I can count on your support before midnight tonight!

To unsubscribe click here
Friend -- I need you now. My race is coming down to the wire.
There are just 10 days until Election Day. And the truth is, the future of the United States Senate will come down to my race in Maine. Chuck Schumer has admitted Maine is the key to flipping the Senate from red to blue. From day 1, he has done everything in his power to control Maine's fate.
MILLIONS of dollars from Chuck Schumer and countless Far Left groups continue to pour into Maine. Our country is at a pivotal moment in our history, and we simply cannot afford to let Chuck Schumer and his radical policies take control. That is why I must ask you this: Can you chip in just $10 to SAVE the Senate? Click HERE to chip in now.
I am counting on you more than ever before. In order to continue to fight back against Schumer's lies, our team must close the fundraising gap. The polls are tied and there is no time left. Please contribute anything you can TODAY!
Thank you. If we work together we will WIN on November 3rd.

* Susan has been working everyday to make sure Mainers and Americans have the relief and care they deserve.

Friend,
As we close in on Election Day, our supporters are asking how they can help Susan win!
We need you to talk to your friends, family, and coworkers and make sure they know the key facts in this race. Thousands of Maine voters are still undecided, this race is neck and neck, and every single vote counts.
Can you share this information with as many people as possible? However you can do it - social media, email, phone, in person conversations -- it all helps!
Sara Gideon's Condo Development Fiasco
OpportinityKnocking
Rhode Island native Sara Gideon moved to Maine and only a year later, she named a Freeport street after herself.
Gideon's Way was a condo development scheme that Gideon and her husband ran out of their Freeport home. They borrowed millions for their project from a Maine bank, and then ran the project into the ground.
The family business stopped paying property taxes for years, and the town of Freeport levied 77 liens on the Gideon business.
Gideon's Way was finally auctioned off at foreclosure. But just months after the investment debacle was over, Sara bought a $1.4 million oceanfront estate in South Freeport, complete with a 300' dock and a three-car garage.
When Gideon was asked about this mess, she first claimed she and her husband were barely involved, and that everyone was ""made whole."" Once a reporter showed the documentation that said otherwise, Gideon claimed only her husband was involved.
And when a reporter showed documents proving Sara worked for the business as well, she finally admitted to it.
This is a critical issue in this race, and a message we need your help to get out. Every last undecided voter needs to know Sara Gideon chose her campaign over helping the people of Maine.
Thanks for all you do, and please spread this message far and wide!

Sara Gideon Can't Be Trusted
If there's one thing that's become clear throughout this campaign, it's that Sara Gideon has no problem bending, and often breaking, the truth.

In fact, right now, she's running a desperate, last minute radio ad that poses as a fake news report, making completely made-up allegations of ethics charges against Senator Collins.
Gideon herself has been caught in lie after lie. She's claimed she doesn't take corporate PAC donations, but corporate donors have funded her political career from the very beginning. She's taken donations from pharmaceutical companies, fossil fuel companies, lobbyists, corporate executives, and just about anyone who will write her a check.
Gideon spread falsehoods about the PPP program that Susan Collins authored, claiming it was a ""bailout"" for big corporations that didn't help small businesses. But then it was reported that her own husband's law firm received up to $2 million from the PPP program!
Gideon was caught on camera lying about her affiliation with her family business -- claiming she wasn't involved until a reporter produced proof she was.
Gideon was also caught lying during a debate \-- claiming she tried to negotiate a return of the Legislature to help with COVID. Her fellow legislative leader issued a statement calling her claims false, and revealing Gideon hadn't spoken with her in months.
The list of Gideon's false statements goes on and on.
This is a critical issue in this race, and a message we need your help to get out. Every last undecided voter needs to know Sara Gideon chose her campaign over helping the people of Maine.
Thanks for all you do, and please spread this message far and wide!

SUPPORT SUSAN TODAY
Democrats have been working to defeat Susan for years. In fact, they groomed her opponent and even set her up with Elizabeth Warren's former Campaign Manager. This race has never been about the future of the people of Maine. It's always been all about Democrats turning the Senate blue.
I don't want to sound extreme, but if we don't rally behind Susan RIGHT NOW - THIS WEEK - THIS MONTH, the Senate could be lost to extreme, Far Left Democrats. And the thought of that is dangerous and scary.
SUPPORT SUSAN TODAY
Chuck Schumer has filled the wallet of her opponent and if Susan's team doesn't meet her fundraising goals this month, well frankly, friend, I shudder to think what will happen to our country.
Friend I'm asking you to donate to the Susan Collins campaign today. Anything you can send her campaign right now is greatly appreciated.

As of today, only THREE weeks remain until November 3rd and I need your URGENT help.
My campaign is doing everything we can to keep up with my opponent's absurd attacks. Far Left groups are funneling more money into Maine during these final three weeks than EVER before. It is impossible to avoid their lies.
I must be blunt with you: what we are doing is simply NOT enough. We only have 21 days until election day and 2 days until my critical Mid-October fundraising deadline. That is why I must ask you this: Can I count on you to chip in anything you can TODAY?

My opponents have significantly outraised my campaign every month of this year. On top of that, Far Left groups have invested more money in Maine than any other Senate race in the country. The only way we will win three weeks from today is if we gather the necessary resources to FIGHT BACK against their lies. This is an emergency.

Three weeks. 21 days. 500 hours. That is all we have left. I am counting on you to help my campaign FIGHT BACK and WIN on November 3rd.

THREE: With only THREE days left in July, our campaign continues to remain BEHIND in fundraising. Susan needs your support more than ever to catch up and fight back!

Help Susan Collins fight back >>>
Not only was this a personal attack on our Senator that was downright nasty, but it's yet again an example of how low Susan Rice is willing to go to try and increase her political standing within her party.
Susan Rice only cares about climbing her own political ladder. She doesn't give an actual hoot about the great people of Maine; no, instead she's trying to prove she's a team-player to improve her chances of being selected to run on the Democrat ticket.
Not to mention, there have been stories written about how Susan Rice would like to run for Senate one day in Maine -- so believe us, this email was with ulterior motives.
The problem is this: Susan Rice has access to millions of email records and probably sent this email to millions across the country, raising tens of thousands for our opponent. That's why we need to urgently fight back.
We cannot let political climbers like Susan Rice determine what happens in the Maine Senate race. We've got exactly 90 days to fight back, and you better believe - we are going to be fighting every second of those 90 days. If we've got your support, won't you please let us know by making a financial contribution of whatever you can afford before it's too late?

There are those who are elected to Congress and the Senate who view it as a popularity contest and one to climb some sort of ladder. And then there are those who are elected because they want to fight for their constituents, they want to improve our country; they don't care about the partisan bickering but instead care about how a bill is going to impact their hometown, their neighbors, and Americans.

Susan is a tremendous role model of mine. Because she refuses to be bought off or bullied, she has had to face a barrage of attacks from the Far Left. But she has always faced these attacks with grace and refuses to let it sway or change her. She's calm in a storm and brave in a fight.
We witnessed her strength during the confirmation hearings around Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. When she cast her vote to confirm Kavanaugh, she also sealed her fate of becoming the Left's #1 Target. But that didn't scare her.
You see, the Far Left, under the terrible direction of people like Chuck Schumer, AOC and Nancy Pelosi, knows that Susan is their biggest threat. They know Susan's vote can never be bought or lobbied and that terrifies them. So right now as I'm typing this email out to you, the Far Left is working around the clock to see Susan defeated.

Friend, I've gone up against my own share of attacks from the Far Left and I can tell you first hand, they fight dirty. And I've seen the tactics they are currently using against Susan in Maine, and, frankly, it's horrible and downright slander.
Tens of millions of dollars are being poured into Maine with absolute lies on Susan's record. The Far Left is slandering her character and stopping at nothing to try and defeat Susan.... And if they were to end up being successful, it would damage our nation for decades.
Having grown up in upstate New York I am very aware that there are not enough federally elected GOP members from the northern states let alone female members, but Susan is both. And even more incredible is that Susan is the ONLY federal GOP office holder in New England.
Ever since being elected to Congress and even before so, I've viewed Susan Collins as an incredible leader for the citizens of Maine. Mainers know when Susan tells them she's working on a bill or fighting to change a law that she is working day and night to fulfill her promise.
Not only Mainers need Susan Collins, friend, but our nation NEEDS Susan Collins.
No donation is too small. Every dollar donated to Susan's team goes immediately toward their efforts to fight back against the lies being funded into Maine by Chuck Schumer.

Susan's opponent in the Maine Senate race is a candidate Chuck Schumer and Elizabeth Warren literally cherry picked to run against Susan. Sara Gideon has a dismal record of helping Mainers, but Chuck and Elizabeth don't care. All they cared about was finding a candidate who they could control and would be forever indebted to them.... Yes, that's right. If Susan doesn't win, Maine would have a Senator who would be a rubber stamp vote for the Far Left.
Friend, just the thought of that makes me cringe and gets me fired up. I'll say it again: Losing Susan in the Senate would be an absolute travesty for our nation.
That's why I'm so fired up about what's happening in Maine and it's why I'm not going to stop fighting to help Susan.

Over a year ago, my opponent and Chuck Schumer decided that they were going to do everything in their power to remove me from office and turn the Senate blue.

Midnight tonight marks my last opportunity to fundraise before Q2 ends. Last quarter, my campaign was outraised by $4.7 MILLION. My opponent has brought more money into this Senate race -- raised from out-of-state far left activists and liberal billionaires -- than Maine has ever seen before.
That is why I must ask you this: Can you please chip in anything to my campaign before midnight tonight? Every single donation, no matter the amount, helps me tremendously in this fight.
Thank you, I hope I can count on you before midnight.

Friend, there are fewer than 4 weeks until Election Day and I just asked Amy for a list of our top supporters - I'm hoping your name is the top name on the list.
Right now, more negative ads are being run in Maine than ANY OTHER STATE. Chuck Schumer and the Far Left have made Maine their top target in order to flip the Senate. I can't fight back against their liberal money machine without your support.
CHIP IN HERE
With more money being poured into Maine every day, it's critical I have my top supporters along my side. Won't you please let me know if I can continue to count on you by making a donation of $10, $25, $50, $100 or even $250?
So, friend, I'm emailing you today to see if you'll stand with me at this critical milestone - with 4 weeks until Election Day, 12% of Mainers are undecided. Your donation would help my team reach them and move the polls in Maine.
This is critical, friend. I hope to see your name on the list Amy sends over.
Susan Collins
P.S. Amy is going to send me this 4 week supporter list sometime today. You don't have much time to get your name on it!

Friend,
Asking for money is my least favorite thing to do. I know how hard you work for your paycheck and how valuable every dollar is. I want you to know that I would never be asking if it wasn't critical, but unfortunately friend, it is.
DONATE
I've never faced a campaign like this before. In fact no one in Maine or anywhere in the country has. More outside dollars have poured into Maine than any other state. And, it appears there's going to be no end in sight.
But here's the good news. We don't need to match my opponent dollar for dollar. But we do need to hit our fundraising goals. Let me explain.
My campaign has a path to success, but it requires being able to increase our television advertising each week, adding additional digital ads, and extending our voter outreach efforts. Not reaching our fundraising targets would mean having to pull back from some of our GOTV programs and quite frankly, it could put the election in jeopardy.
Our future is on the line this fall. This campaign is not about me, it's about ensuring Mainers have a voice they can count on in the Senate. My opponent wouldn't be a voice we could count on; she will just echo whatever Chuck Schumer and Elizabeth Warren do.
So, today I'm asking you to please stand with my campaign by making a donation of whatever you can afford. And if you've given before, I hope you will consider making another contribution.
DONATE
Every dollar that is donated goes immediately towards our GOTV efforts and not a penny is wasted. You can rest assured that your hard earned dollars will go to great use to win this November!
Thank you for your continued support and friendship. This campaign hasn't been easy, but every day I'm so thankful to have you by my side.
Sincerely,
Susan Collins

Next week, Susan’s opponent will receive a Far Left fund totaling over $4 MILLION after the primary election. In 2018, they told Susan if she did not vote the way they wanted her to, they would fund her future opponent. Susan said no, stood her ground, and refused to be bribed.

Through all of this, Susan is counting on one thing: YOU. We cannot spend one more day behind. Your support today is critical to Susan’s ability to fight back against all the attacks coming her way.

Friend,
Just when I think I've seen it all from the Far Left -- they have stooped to a new low.
Yesterday, in an attempt to defame me, supporters of my opponent began tweeting quotes and attributing them to me when I have never spoken those words. And in true liberal fashion, these tweets started gaining traction with thousands of retweets amongst Sara Gideon's liberal supporters.
Friend, this is beyond FAKE NEWS, it's SLANDER.
There seem to be no repercussions for the amount of lies and fake headlines that are swirling around both Maine and our nation. But here's the BEST response → we can WIN on November 3rd and put to rest their false accusations and utter lies.
Right now this race in Maine is in a statistical tie, which has the Far Left panicked that they are stooping to new lows.
Won't you please help me fight back and WIN in 3 weeks? That would be the best way to stand up to these trolls!

Friend -- I know it's late but I saw that my close friend and colleague Susan Collins has a big debate coming up this Friday and I want to pass along some information to you.
Sara Gideon knows she is a much weaker debater than Susan. Last week, they were both touring Maine and ended up in the same town- Susan's hometown of Caribou. And the moment Susan learned they were going to be in the same town, she extended an invite for Sara to debate with her.
You know what she got Friend? RADIO SILENCE.
Susan is a top-notch debater and policy maker. I wouldn't want to debate her either (that's part of the reason why I won't ever run for Senator in Maine 😂 ).
On top of that, this week there are advertisements running across Maine that are ripping apart Susan's good name -- and they are ALL FALSE and they are ALL BOUGHT BY CHUCK SCHUMER.
Susan needs our help. Not only is she in Washington DC right now fighting for our nation's economy, but she's also busy prepping for the debate.
Before she steps on the debate stage, she is going to see a list of Debate Week Donors. Won't you be one of them? I know a contribution of $5, $10, $15, $25 or $50 will be greatly appreciated by my friend Susan.

Friend,
Finally, debate week is here! After weeks and months of Susan proposing debates, Sara Gideon's team has begrudgingly agreed to a debate this Friday. Mainers will get the chance to hear directly from Susan about her solid record of putting Mainers first, while Sara Gideon has to defend her record of raising taxes and keeping businesses closed during the pandemic.
The Far Left knows Sara's terrified to debate Susan, and they are going to ramp up their support around Sara Gideon this week. That's why, Friend, we've got to double down and increase ours for Susan.
Before Susan steps on the debate stage, I'll be giving her a list of all Debate Week Donors. Will you please chip in $15 or more right now and make sure your name is on that list?

This week is critical to our campaign's success and I know it would mean the world to Susan to see your name on the list of Debate Week Donors.
Friend, even if you've made a previous donation to our team, I hope you'll consider making another one.
No donation is too small -- every dollar contributed to Team Collins goes instantly towards our efforts to fight back against the onslaught of attacks being funded by Chuck Schumer, and toward all of our Get-Out-The-Vote efforts.

You see, both of our moms are in the middle of some pretty tough campaigns, and they need our help to ensure they can stay fighting for our values. And no we don’t mean fighting for unlimited treats, but, that would be pretty delicious.
Even though we live far apart from each other, our moms have a lot in common. They are both hardworking, determined fighters who work every single day to ensure Americans (and their pets!) are safe and successful. Our moms don’t toe the party line, they vote based on the values and beliefs of the people they serve. They don’t put up with the bickering and games of Washington DC; in fact, the only games they like are catch and fetch with us!
And, as we mentioned, they are both in really tough races right now and need all hands or paws on deck! So if you could join us in supporting our moms, Susan and Martha, we would really appreciate it.
When you click on this button you’ll be taken to a page where you can donate to both of our moms.

Friend,
Last night Sara Gideon won the Democrat primary to be my opponent this November. But something else also happened, something that has never occurred in the history of our democracy... she was given $4 million dollars for winning.
Let me explain.
In 2018, when Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh was up for confirmation, several Far Left groups got together to try and buy my vote -- if I voted for Justice Kavanaugh they would award my future opponent a fund that is now valued at $4 million dollars. If I voted against him, the money would be refunded and just disappear.
My vote can not and will not ever be bought -- something you know full well.
My vote that day in 2018 put a bullseye on my campaign, and has now put my race at a $4 million dollar disadvantage.
I voted to confirm Brett Kavanaugh, and it's a vote I stand by. I voted for fairness, due process, and the rule of law. But right now I need to know if you will stand by me.
Yes, Susan! You've got my support!

Friend,
It's Election Day, and it's time to VOTE!
We need you to talk to your friends, family, and coworkers and make sure they know the key facts in this race. Thousands of Maine voters are still undecided, this race is neck and neck, and every single vote counts.
Can you share this information with as many people as possible? However you can do it - social media, email, phone, in person conversations -- it all helps!
The Most Out-of-State Campaign in Maine History
Sara Gideon was born and raised in one of the wealthiest towns in Rhode Island, and moved to Maine in 2004. And now she's running a campaign to hand Maine's senate seat over to out-of-state interests.
Gideon's campaign has been entirely directed by DC partisans and special interests. From her campaign staff, to her donors, to the tens of millions in dark money spending, Gideon's campaign has nothing to do with Maine. Her bank is on K Street in Washington. Even the return address on her donation envelopes is in Baltimore.
Gideon has received more out-of-state donations than any campaign in Maine history, and more dark money support as well. And for months, thousands and thousands of phone calls have come from out-of-state groups, aimed at spreading false information about Susan Collins.
Here are a few examples of these groups: Rhode Island for Sara Gideon, Progressive Charlestown, Cambridge City Councilors, Revere Democratic City Committee and Mayor, Berkshire Democratic Brigades, Young Workers Movement, Boston University College Democrats, Swing Left Greater Boston, Tufts University, Stitch-It to the Patriarchy, Take Back Our Democracy Coalition, Needham Democratic Town Committee, Left Field, South Asian American Women's Political Alliance, Bend the Arc: Jewish Action Riverdale, West Harlem Democrats,Act Bronx, New York Indivisible,Central Brooklyn Independent Democrats,Manhattan Young Democrats, Progressive Schenectady, Hell's Kitchen Democrats, Georgetown University Democrats, Persist George Washington University, Moms Demand Action, DC Schools For Sara Gideon, Indivisible, Team Pete Win the Era, San Francisco, Santa Clara Democrats, SoCal Blue,NARAL Pro-Choice California, University of Virginia Democrats, Arlington Young Democrats, Virginia Young Democrats, Democratic Women Of Westport, Princeton College Democrats
One of Gideon's Maryland campaign workers even made this remarkable statement about their time calling Maine voters: ""My history of political engagement � or lack thereof � is embarrassing. I don't do my research on the candidates running for Senate or House in my home state of Maryland, I don't read my local [[URL REDACTED]] these past few weeks, I've been working with Planned Parenthood Votes to get Maine voters to vote for Democratic Senate candidate Sara Gideon.""
This is what we're up against: an army of out-of-state political activists with no concern or connection to Maine, trying to steal our senate seat with $100 million worth of lies.
This is a critical issue in this race, and a message we need your help to get out. Every last undecided voter needs to know Sara Gideon chose her campaign over helping the people of Maine.
Thanks for all you do! Please spread this message far and wide and VOTE.

Friend,
The amount of money being spent in Maine right now is astounding. I've never seen anything like it but neither has anyone else. Right now my opponent and her wealthy friends are pouring millions into Maine with one goal in mind: defeating me.
Except, here's what my opponent and her friends don't understand: this election isn't about me. It's about YOU. It's about our friends and family. It's about our neighborhoods, our towns and cities and our country. It's about ensuring that we leave our nation better than when we inherited it.
My opponent is running a vicious campaign against me because she's being told to do so. Chuck Schumer and Elizabeth Warren are controlling her every move, and the reality is if she were to win, they would control everything she did in the Senate.
That truly scares me to think about, and it reminds me that again this election is not about me. It's about our future.
The actions you and I take today, right now in this very moment are going to have impacts on future generations. That's why we can't afford to sit by and just hope things work out in November. I am working around the clock to ensure every Maine voter knows both the truth about my failed opponent and the truth about me.
But I can't do this alone. I need your support.

Friend,
In a few hours, Senator Chuck Schumer will speak at the Demcoratic National Convention. Somehow he's going to find a few minutes in his very ""busy schedule"" to do this.
What has been taking up a majority of his time lately? Working to defeat Senator Susan Collins.
For almost an entire year now, Schumer has been working to unseat Susan by helping to raise millions of dollars -- all to be spent across Maine's airwaves slandering Susan's record and name. There is no doubt about it: Chuck Schumer views Susan Collins as a threat to his liberal agenda and has made Maine his #1 focus.
STOP CHUCK SCHUMER >>
In total, Chuck Schumer's SuperPAC has spent more than $11 MILLION on false and absurd attacks against Susan and we know it's just the beginning. While Senator Chuck Schumer may speak words about unity and compassion at the convention this evening, it's all fake. He has a dangerous, extreme, far-left agenda and cares nothing about bipartisanship or compromise -- he just wants to replace Susan with a liberal who will vote however he wants.
STOP CHUCK SCHUMER >>
We've got to send Schumer a message that Susan's vote can never be bought. Our team has made a goal to raise $25,000 before Schumer speaks tonight.
Can you chip in and help us fight back against his lies when he least expects it?
Schumer's attacks are only getting worse by the hour. Every single dollar given to Susan's campaign makes an enormous difference in her ability to fight back and ensure Mainers know the truth.
Let's show Chuck Schumer how strong Susan's grassroots movement truly is!

Finally, debate week is here! After weeks and months of Susan proposing debates, Sara Gideon's team has begrudgingly agreed to a debate this Friday. Mainers will get the chance to hear directly from Susan about her solid record of putting Mainers first, while Sara Gideon has to defend her record of raising taxes and keeping businesses closed during the pandemic.
The Far Left knows Sara's terrified to debate Susan, and they are going to ramp up their support around Sara Gideon this week. That's why, Friend, we've got to double down and increase ours for Susan.
Before Susan steps on the debate stage, I'll be giving her a list of all Debate Week Donors. Will you please chip in $15 or more right now and make sure your name is on that list?

This week is critical to our campaign's success and I know it would mean the world to Susan to see your name on the list of Debate Week Donors.
Friend, even if you've made a previous donation to our team, I hope you'll consider making another one.
No donation is too small -- every dollar contributed to Team Collins goes instantly towards our efforts to fight back against the onslaught of attacks being funded by Chuck Schumer, and toward all of our Get-Out-The-Vote efforts.
Friend, simply put, your contribution is greatly needed to ensure victory for Susan this fall!!

Friend, less than one month remains until Election Day and 12% of voters in Maine are undecided.
I need your immediate help to reach these undecided voters before it’s too late!
>>>MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN MAINE>>>
MAKE A ONE MONTH OUT DONATION
Right now, more outside money is pouring into Maine than ANY other state. Voters in Maine are being pummeled with negative ads from my opponent and her liberal cronies.
And what’s even worse is that there are no repercussions for the complete and utter lies and slander in my opponents ads against me. The media and press are allowing them to air lies without any factual evidence.
With less than one month to go, all hope I had for my opponent to do the right thing and pull her false ads down and condemn the liberal outside groups who are spewing lies, is lost.
I need your immediate help. I need to get my message in front of voters. My opponent is backed by Chuck Schumer and the Far Left money making machine, she has enough cash to buy out all the advertising space in Maine. Everyday, ads against my character are running rampant through Maine and they are causing chaos and confusion for voters.
DONATE NOW >>
Friend, less than one month remains and we need ALL hands on deck.
Mainer’s deserve to know more about me than what Chuck Schumer is willing to tell them. Your donation to my campaign will help me get my ads in front of undecided voters across Maine.
DONATE NOW >>
Chuck Schumer doesn’t want what’s best for Maine, he wants what’s best for his leadership position in the Senate (which, by the way, if the Senate flips from RED to BLUE, Chuck Schumer will become the Senate majority leader…. No wonder he is working so hard to flip the Senate!).
Friend, any size donation today would help me and my team. Whether it’s $1000, $500, $100, $50, $25, $15 or $10… I can’t emphasize enough how much it would mean to me and Team Collins.

Thank you, friend. Asking you for money is my least favorite thing to do, but it has become one of the most critical components of my campaign during these final few weeks. October will bring the worst attacks we have seen during this race. I am going to need your help more than ever before to fight back during this final stretch.

Friend,
From cotton to Congress in one lifetime. That's my story. That's my American Journey.
I grew up in North Charleston, South Carolina in a single parent household. My mother had to work 16-hour days just to earn enough money to put food on the table and keep a roof over our heads.
Those early years and my journey are why I am so passionate about fighting in the Senate to make sure every American has the same opportunities to succeed.
One of my strongest allies in the Senate is Susan Collins. She is passionate about ensuring that folks up in Maine have opportunities to succeed.
Democrats have targeted Susan for defeat in November and they are outspending her by MILLIONS of dollars.
We cannot lose Susan's voice in the Senate- I am asking you to dig deep and give $100, $50, $25 or even $10 to help Susan win.
Stand with Susan
Chuck Schumer and his deep-pocketed allies have flooded the airwaves with false and dirty attack ads against Susan.
But I know Susan and I believe that she wakes up every single day fighting for the people of Maine. And let me be very clear: No one cares more deeply about Maine than Susan Collins.
We cannot allow Susan to be outraised and outspent�so please chip in $100, $50, $25 or even $10 to help Susan win.

I’ve never faced a campaign like this before. In fact no one in Maine or anywhere in the country has. More outside dollars have poured into Maine than any other state. And, it appears there’s going to be no end in sight.
But here’s the good news. We don’t need to match my opponent dollar for dollar. But we do need to hit our fundraising goals. Let me explain.
My campaign has a path to success, but it requires being able to increase our television advertising each week, adding additional digital ads, and extending our voter outreach efforts. Not reaching our fundraising targets would mean having to pull back from some of our GOTV programs and quite frankly, it could put the election in jeopardy.
Our future is on the line this fall. This campaign is not about me, it’s about ensuring Mainers have a voice they can count on in the Senate. My opponent wouldn’t be a voice we could count on; she will just echo whatever Chuck Schumer and Elizabeth Warren do.
So, today I’m asking you to please stand with my campaign by making a donation of whatever you can afford. And if you’ve given before, I hope you will consider making another contribution.

Every dollar that is donated goes immediately towards our GOTV efforts and not a penny is wasted. You can rest assured that your hard earned dollars will go to great use to win this November!

Friend,
As one of my top supporters, I want to make sure you know the truth about what’s happening both in Maine and across the country right now.
As I type this, millions of dollars are being poured into Maine to completely slander my name and record in an attempt to silence and defeat me. Fake polls and fake news are currently flooding our airwaves and there seem to be no repercussions for the lies and misinformation being spread around. And these dollars are coming from groups led by Chuck Schumer and Elizabeth Warren, who want to replace me in the Senate with a vote they can control.
I am so tired of the lies being blasted across Maine airwaves by the Left. There is no accountability from the mainstream media.
CLICK HERE TO HELP
I am running a campaign from Maine, FOR Maine. My opponent is running a campaign fueled by phone-bankers up and down the East Coast and has a bevy of out-of-state liberal advisors who don’t actually care about Mainers or Americans -- all they want is another seat in the Senate. It’s repulsive.
Friend, I am tough, and I don’t let these lies and attacks get to me. Instead, I’ve been laser focused not only on my job in Washington to fight for our nation, but also on ensuring Mainers know the truth.
I am never going to stop fighting for the critical issues at hand -- lowering taxes, reducing prescription drug costs, creating more American jobs, strengthening our economy and making health care easier and more accessible.
I have never faced a campaign like this before, but your friendship and support have helped me and my team so much. Less than 50 days remain and I know the toughest days lay ahead -- but with your support, we can and WILL win in November. Please let me know if I can continue to count on you.

From Day 1, Susan Collins has been running a campaign OF Maine, FOR Maine, while Sara Gideon's Washington, DC-based campaign has been running a campaign against Maine.
This race is in a dead heat, and time is running out. Your online donation is CRITICAL to our team being able to make certain all Maine voters know the truth about Sara Gideon before they cast their ballot.
No one knows Maine better than Susan Collins. Sara is running a campaign of smokescreens and lies and she's being funded by the Far Left.
Help us STOP SARA!

We don't have much time -- ACT now to save our country!

BREAKING: Susan Collins and Sara Gideon
virtually tied in new Maine AARP poll
Friend, 48 days remaining and it's a TIE here in Maine. We have NO time to waste. We need your help to ensure every Maine voter knows the stark differences between Susan Collins and Sara Gideon before they vote.
The future of the Senate will be decided by this election in Maine. If Susan loses, the Senate will be handed over to the Democrats. If that's not a future you want to see then we need your immediate support now.
HELP SUSAN WIN IN NOVEMBER >>>
KEEP THE SENATE RED >>>
This is a good sign. It means that our hard work is making an impact, but we need to triple our efforts to ensure victory in November.
We are working around the clock, but we are up against the Democrat money machine. Yes, every single powerful Democrat from the likes of Hilary Clinton to Chuck Schumer is trying to help defeat Susan Collins.
If you don't want Maine to turn blue and Chuck Schumer to take control of the Senate, then you've got to take action right now.
HELP SUSAN WIN IN NOVEMBER >>>
KEEP THE SENATE RED >>>
We need ALL HANDS ON DECK to win in November. Now is the time to step up and show your support. We CANNOT win without your support!

Maine GOP Statement on ME-02 Congressional Debate
AUGUSTA-- Maine Republican Party Chair, Dr. Demi Kouzounas, released the following statement regarding the ME-02 Congressional Debate:
""There is a reason that Dale Crafts has earned the endorsement of President Donald Trump and Governor Paul LePage,"" said Chair Dr. Demi Kouzounas. ""Mainers deserve a Congressman who represents them, not D.C. special interests, and as your Congressman, Dale Crafts will stand with our President, utilize his experience as a businessman to create jobs, and stand with our gun-owners to protect our 2nd amendment rights.""
""Since becoming Maine's 'Second Place Congressman', Jared Golden has consistently voted against the people he represents. Although he represents a Trump +10 district, Jared Golden voted to impeach the President, voted against the bi-partisan USMCA Trade Deal in favor of job-killing NAFTA, and votes with the extreme liberals, like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, 85% of the time. Simply put, Mainers stand with President Trump and deserve a Congressman who does the same.""

""Today we saw record turnout for this historic event, drawing Mainers from all 16 counties to welcome Vice President Pence back to our beautiful state. The enthusiasm we saw today made it clear: Mainers are ready for four more years of 'Promises Made, Promises Kept'.""
""We must unify behind Republicans up and down the ballot if we want to continue the great American comeback. The Trump administration has built the greatest economy America has ever seen and they will do it again, but they can not do it alone. Every Mainer should be making a plan right now to get out and vote on Election Day so their voice is heard, and that we have four more years of President Trump.""

Does Sen. Eloise Vitelli (D-Bath) Stand With BIW or Jackson & Gideon?
AUGUSTA – Maine Republican Party Executive Director, Jason Savage, issued the following statement:
""While Democrat leaders like Senate President Troy Jackson and Speaker Sara Gideon attempt to renege on a $45 million tax break granted to Bath Iron Works, Democrats like Sen. Eloise Vitelli (D-Bath) who represents the district and many of it’s workers are shockingly quiet.
It is incredibly disturbing that Democrat leadership would send a threatening letter to one of
Maine’s largest employers, one that provides good wages, employs Mainers in all 16 counties,
and is a major economic driver for the state. This is just another example of the Democrat anti-
business and job killing agenda and it must be stopped.
Bath Iron Works, their workers, and surrounding communities deserve to know where their elected leaders stand on this massive tax hike that Democrats are pushing in Augusta.
We call on Senator Eloise Vitelli (D-Bath) and Senator Brownie Carson (D-Harpswell) who represent large numbers of BIW workers to answer one simple question: Do you stand with BIW and their workers or your party leaders in Augusta?""– Executive Director Jason Savage

AUGUSTA, ME-- Maine Republican Party Chair, Dr. Demi Kouzounas, released the following statement regarding Maine's Second Congressional District Primary:
""Now that the Secretary of State has completed their unneccesary and costly tabulation of a race that has already been decided, we are happy to congratulate Dale Crafts on his win in the Second Congressional District Primary. Dale is an incredibly strong candidate who will fight tirelessly to earn the vote of Mainers and defeat Jared Golden in November"" said Maine GOP Chair Dr. Demi Kouzounas.
""While Jared Golden campaigned as a 'moderate', he has been nothing but a rubber stamp vote for Nancy Pelosi and D.C. Democrats, earning him the title of most partisan member of the Maine Delegation.""
""Over the last two years it has become abundantly clear that Maine's second place Congressman has no interest in representing Maine's Second Congressional District, a +10 Trump district in 2016. Instead, Jared Golden has fought the President at every turn, including voting to wrongfully impeach the President and voting against the historic USMCA trade deal.""
""As your next Representative, Dale Crafts will fight to uphold the values of Maine's Second Congressional District and will always work for you, not D.C. Democrats. Our entire party, including Dale's primary opponents, are fully behind his candidacy and look forward to his victory in November.""

Repeal of Ranked Choice Voting to be on 2020 ballot
State Court Decision Stops Use Of RCV in 2020 Presidential Election and Allows Maine Voters to Reinstate One Person Equaling One Vote
AUGUSTA, ME - Maine Republican Party Chairman and Doctor Demi Kouzounas issued the following statement regarding the court's decision to allow the Ranked Choice Voting Repeal back on the ballot:
""Late today the court affirmed what we always knew, that the Repeal Ranked Choice Voting campaign gathered enough signatures to place the people’s veto on the ballot. We need to restore the principle of one person equals one vote,"" said MEGOP Chair Dr. Demi Kouzounas.
""Over 70,000 Maine people signed petitions to have their voices heard to stop ranked choice voting. For months teams of volunteers worked tirelessly to collect these signatures against great odds – including the City of Portland’s efforts to stop signature gathering and a global pandemic – just to have the Secretary of State improperly reject the signatures of thousands of Maine voters. Now, after our team has spent weeks working around the clock to ensure these signatures would be counted, the court has finally confirmed that we have the required signatures to be on the ballot in November.""
""While we find it unacceptable that Secretary of State Matt Dunlap failed to protect the people’s constitutional rights, we have always been confident that we would ultimately prevail. Today the court vindicated that confidence, and the Constitution in reversing Secretary of State Dunlap's incorrect decision. This is a massive win not only for the effort to Repeal Ranked Choice Voting, but also for the people of Maine.""
""The fight to Repeal Ranked Choice Voting marches on, and we remain laser-focused on winning in November,"" said Doctor Kouzounas.
""Thank you to the hundreds of volunteers and thousands of voters who participated in this effort,"" said Maine GOP Executive Director Jason Savage.
""We said we would not stop fighting until the Secretary of State's incorrect decision was overturned. Now we are on to November and to Repeal RCV and restore the principle of one person, one vote,"" said Mr. Savage.

First of all, I wanted to say Happy Mother's Day! We're nothing without our mothers -- literally! HAPPY MOTHER'S DAY TO ALL OF OUR LOVING MOMS!
Since representing Maine in Congress, I’ve enjoyed staying in the fight for common sense solutions to the serious problems impacting our families and small businesses.
Like holding Governor Janet Mills accountable for extending her lockdown, killing our jobs, and having no reasonable plan to safely reopen the economy right before our critical tourism season begins.
And, exposing Governor Mills and her far left Democrat Majority for recklessly spending and borrowing an additional $1 billion over the past year, leaving no financial cushion going into the COVID-19 recession.
Like returning to one-person, one-vote sanity and ending the ranked choice voting scam for our presidential election in November.
And, calling out open border liberals for refusing to help President Trump secure our borders to keep deadly drugs and infectious diseases out of our country.
And, explaining how our Republican building blocks of lower taxes, fewer regulations, cheap energy and fairer trade deals resulted in the strongest economy in fifty years until the coronavirus pandemic hit.
Last week, I launched my new website to stay better connected with you.
Please click here to sign-up to receive regular updates.
You can also listen to my radio interviews, read the OpEds, and easily connect with me on Facebook and Twitter.
Plus, you can weigh-in on my next survey question below (and also see the results of last week’s poll):
""Do you agree with President Donald Trump’s Executive Order temporarily halting most legal immigration to give priority to Americans looking for jobs as our economy reopens?""
I’m grateful to the Maine GOP for allowing me to invite you to sign-up on my new website for regular updates about how we conservatives can battle to shape the decisions coming out of Augusta and Washington.
Every month, I push our common sense positions on seven different talk radio shows across Maine. Several times each week, I spread the good word on Facebook and Twitter. My OpEds are published in the major daily newspapers throughout Maine.
The bigger we get, the stronger our voice! I look forward to staying connected with you.
Thanks and be well,
Bruce

Governor Mills More Concerned More About Partisan Games Than Helping Mainers
AUGUSTA, ME-- Maine GOP Chair Dr. Demi Kouzounas released the following statement regarding Governor Janet Mills' response to President Trump's Executive Order on COVID-19.
""President Trump has taken unprecedented action to help American families and businesses during the devastating impacts of COVID-19. Meanwhile, Janet Mills would rather play partisan games than find solutions that will work for Mainers. Even in her own statement today, Janet Mills admitted she did not understand the order, and instead of getting clarifying answers to her questions, preferred to put out a cheap hit piece on our President to score a few political points with her supporters,"" said Chair Dr. Demi Kouzouas.
""Governor Mills and Maine Department of Labor Commissioner Laura Fortman should be the last people criticizing the President as they have yet to clean up the complete economic catastrophe they have created in Maine. From a lack of clear direction for Maine small businesses resulting in massive closings, to the complete failure we have seen in Maine's unemployment system, the people of Maine are getting nothing out of Augusta except regurgitated talking points from Washington, D.C.""

Her support of Joe Biden's socialist agenda would dismantle American livelihoods and unravel the good work the Trump Administration has accomplished. From supporting the Green New Deal, to implementing massive tax hikes on Americans, and a complete government healthcare takeover, a Harris/Biden administration would be devastating to the American people and the American economy.
The choice could not be more clear -- President Trump and Vice President Pence will uphold the rule of law and continue to lead Mainers through the Great American Comeback."" -Chair Dr. Demi Kouzounas

""Tonight highlighted the sharp contrast between Senator Susan Collins' and Sara Gideon's records,"" said Chair Dr. Demi Kouzounas. ""While Collins has never missed a day of work or missed a vote, Sara Gideon took 8 months off to raise 64 million dollars for her Senate campaign, all while leaving Mainers in the lurch in the midst of a pandemic.""
""While many people have become numb to the regurgitated talking points coming from Sara Gideon, tonight's exchange over packing the courts should concern every Mainer. Sara Gideon's willingness to pack the court is radical and dangerous and is just another reason Mainers should reject Sara at the ballot box on November 3rd.""
""Throughout her career, Susan Collins has delivered for the people of Maine. From Kittery to Fort Kent, from Eastport to Eustis, there is not a single town that has not benefited from Senator Collins' tireless advocacy for the people of Maine. Maine cannot afford to lose Susan Collins. From cutting taxes, to bolstering Maine's historic industries, to saving over 240,000 jobs during the pandemic, and saving our small businesses, the choice is clear: Maine needs Susan Collins.""

We hope you are doing well and staying safe as our state weathers the storm this virus has created. We’re writing today because even though much of the state has slowed down or stopped during this pandemic, our candidates for the Maine Legislature still need to prepare for the upcoming election.
With many events and in-person activities shut down, many of our candidates who are using the Maine Clean Election Program are facing a deadline of collecting $5 donations. The donations our Republican candidates receive by MIDNIGHT TONIGHT (May 18) will determine how much funding they receive to make Maine red again!
Helping push your local Republican candidate to victory is easy. All that it requires is to submit a $5 donation to their campaign through MCEA's secure donation page which can be found HERE.
Your $5 contribution to help your Republican Legislative candidate qualify for the MCEA program will be a key contribution to the work of reclaiming seats in the Maine Legislature and bringing some common sense back to our legislature.
If you have any questions about how to do the online contribution for MCEA candidates, the Maine Senate Republicans have put together an easy-to-understand video tutorial you can watch by clicking here.
From that page you can click to contribute as well.
The system is safe, secure, and again, critical for the candidate’s success in November of 2020.
Thank you for all that you do.

"Alex,
We knew it was only a matter of time: As the pressure rises, Sara Gideon is melting down.
While her campaign desperately have tried to to cover up her abysmal record in Augusta, including heating oil and gas tax hikes, gun grabbing, and covering up for a sexual predator accused of sexual misconduct with underage girls, the lies are beginning to unravel.
Just this week, after years of saying she was unaware about the Dillion Bates scandal in Augusta, she finally broke, admitting that she knew about the ""rumors"" but there was ""nothing"" to act on.
When asked by a Mainer on Maine Public Radio's Maine Calling program about Bates, Gideon lashed out at the question, and repeatedly said ""there was nothing"" to the allegations:
""There was nothing, until that Bollard article was actually published that said that individuals had come forward to that reporter. And before that, there was nothing but a rumor."" -Speaker Sara Gideon
THERE WERE AT LEAST 9 SOMETHINGS THAT GIDEON CALLED ""NOTHING""
1. The all-girls school fired Dillon Bates
2. The Maine Department of Health and Human Services was investigating Bates
3. The Maine Department of Education was investigating Bates
4. The local police department was investigating Bates
5. The state’s 24-hour student abuse hotline was notified about Bates
6. Bates acknowledged to school administrators the sexual text messages sent to a student
7. The local theater banned Bates from attending plays
8. There was a petition at the all-girls school to address Bates’ firing
9. The Maine Girls' Academy closed, with some suspecting Bates' actions contributed
BUT THE BIGGEST SOMETHING: GIDEON ADMITTED SHE KNEW
10\. a spokeswoman for Speaker Gideon, confirms the speaker has known about misconduct allegations against Bates for ""several months."" (WMTW)
Clearly, Gideon is not comfortable being asked about her failure to act (cover-up) of an alleged sexual predator in her caucus. But there remains a series of unanswered questions about what unfolded, and why she allowed for a predator to continue serving in her caucus. Watch the latest from the NRSC on the matter here.
Throughout her time in Maine politics, Sara Gideon has shown she will do anything in her power to stay in power. Even if it means covering for a sexual predator under her leadership.
This type of behavior has no place in Maine, and should not be rewarded with a United States Senate seat. As we speak, Gideon's D.C. allies are dumping millions in the race to cover up this story. Here is how you can fight back:
1) VOTE. Early voting is happening throughout Maine right now. Head down to your Town Hall or request your absentee ballot HERE.
2) Share this information with your family and friends by forwarding this email NOW.
3) Visit [[URL REDACTED]] for more information on Shady Sara Gideon's record in Augusta.

NEW: Sara Gideon Hit With Another Ethics Complaint, Potential Investigation
AUGUSTA, ME – Today, Dr. Demi Kouzounas filed an ethics complaint with the Maine Commission on Governmental Ethics and Election Practices and is urging an investigation of Sara Gideon’s corporate-funded Leadership PAC failing to disclose thousands of dollars worth of Facebook ads.
In addition to the undisclosed campaign spending, the Facebook ads appear to have promoted Sara Gideon, amounting to an in-kind contribution to her 2018 campaign, far exceeding the $400 per election contribution limit.
""Sara Gideon continues her pattern of unethical behavior,"" said Dr. Demi Kouzounas. ""First, the Maine Ethics Commission found Gideon broke the law by illegally using her corporate-funded Leadership PAC to reimburse herself for campaign contributions. Today, Mainers learn she tried to hide thousands of dollars worth campaign ads while also illegally boosting her own political ambitions.""
""Mainers know Gideon has long relied on corporate money, shady donors, and now illegally hiding campaign spending to further her political ambitions and give Maine’s voice away to Washington special interests.""
Please see the ethics complaint HERE.
Please see the exhibits for the complaint HERE.
Dr. Demi Kouzounas is the Chair of the Maine Republican Party. Dr. Kouzounas is a Dentist and a small businesswoman with nearly 30 employees. Before receiving her doctorate in dentistry, Dr. Kouzounas served our country in the U.S. Army.

GIDEON PAC BANK RECORDS TO BE REVIEWED BY MAINE ETHICS COMMISSION
AUGUSTA-- Despite protest by Sara Gideon's lawyer, the Maine Ethics Commission will review Gideon Leadership PAC bank records after more than $3,200 in unreported expenditures through her corporate-funded PAC.
This is not an isolated incident for Speaker Sara Gideon, who has also been fined by the Maine Ethics Commission for her illegal ""straw-donor"" scheme, where she made political donations to federal candidates in her own name, then reimbursed herself from her corporate-funded PAC.
The Gideon Leadership PAC received the largest ""adjustment"" in the history of the Maine Ethics Commission just before Gideon launched her U.S. Senate Campaign. The focus of today's hearing was on more than $3,000 in Facebook ads that went unreported, including ads that attacked Senator Susan Collins, that reached over 500,000 Mainers.
""Throughout her time in Augusta, Sara Gideon has shown a pattern of unethical behavior with her corporate-funded PAC,"" said Chair Dr. Demi Kouzounas. ""Once again the Maine Ethics Commission has taken issue with her misuse of funds and wrongful reporting. Sara Gideon continues to try every play in the book to illegally influence Maine politics, and we will not stand idly by and let that happen.""
""We look forward to the findings in the investigation of Gideon's Leadership PAC. The people of Maine deserve a look into how Sara Gideon's shady PAC has operated over the last several year. Until then, we will continue to expose her brazen ethics violations at the state and federal levels.""

"NEW INFO ON DILLON BATES
For the first time, a reason for Gideon doing nothing about Dillon Bates has come to light.
Because of the partisan balance of the Legislature at the time, Speaker Gideon held a tenuous grasp on the majority and on her Speakership.
In short, Gideon couldn't investigate Bates' actions because she desperately needed Bates' vote to hang on to power.
A new story outlines Gideon's power play:
Now, amid Gideon’s bid to unseat longtime incumbent Sen. Susan Collins, the speaker has come under renewed scrutiny for how she handled the sexual misconduct allegations, and several individuals familiar with the matter have indicated that the tense legislative makeup of the House may have influenced Gideon’s decision to personally address Bates rather than go through a formal process.
The legislature in 2018 comprised 74 Democrats, 70 Republicans, and six independents, a narrow divide when 76 votes are needed for a majority.
""Dillon Bates was a necessary vote,"" Deb Plowman, a former Republican state senator and policy director for the state’s Department of Education (DOE), told Breitbart News. ""I’ve been in the legislature 16 total years. I’ve seen the 72–72 kind of thing. You actually can get things done when you’re that close. … That did not happen. This was raw power, and it had to be held together, and Dillon needed to be in his seat.""
DOE by spring 2018 had investigated Bates and concluded that he was ineligible to have a teaching certification by ""gross moral misconduct"" and a ""lack of moral character,"" according to a separate individual who was affiliated with DOE at the time. Bates’s teaching certificate was officially denied that September. The individual described the Maine House building as ""a sieve"" and affirmed that ""certainly by March everyone in the building knew"" about the allegations against Bates. Bates however continued to work as a lawmaker and also a girls’ track coach at another high school until August 2018.

Statement on Golden's Vote to Impeach President Trump
AUGUSTA – Maine Republican Party Chair, Dr. Demi Kouzounas, issued the following statement regarding Rep. Jared Golden’s announcement that he will vote to impeach President Donald Trump:
""Simply put, Jared Golden is putting manufactured D.C. drama ahead of his own constituents. It’s clear that Golden has no interest in being the voice of a district that overwhelmingly voted for President Trump.
From day one of the impeachment sham, Jared has attempted to play both sides of the issue. Whether it was paying his constituents lip service when he cast a critical vote to formalize the impeachment inquiry, or hiding from Mainers who demanded to know where he stood during the hearings, or ‘splitting his vote’ to impeach the President, the lack of leadership from Jared Golden is astounding. Regardless of how the one-term Congressman attempts to sell you on his political games, make no mistake, Jared Golden is voting to IMPEACH our President.
Today Jared Golden showed his true colors. While he has spent his political career attempting to convince Mainers he is a moderate and a ‘straight-shooter,’ he has proven he is nothing but an empty suit and a rubber stamp vote for Nancy Pelosi and D.C. Democrats.
In less than a year, Mainers will once again make their voice heard in the 2020 election, and unlike Jared Golden they won’t split their vote. They will re-elect Donald Trump and replace Jared Golden with a new member of Congress who represents them."" -Maine GOP Chair Dr. Demi Kouzounas

"Folks,
The Maine press is refusing to even ask Sara Gideon if she believes Tara Reade, despite her well known claim to #believewomen and Gideon saying that Senator Susan Collins’ vote on Justice Kavanaugh inspired her to run and has been a big driver for her fundraising.
If the Maine press doesn’t want to hold Sara Gideon accountable, it’s up to us, Maine voters, to hold her accountable.
Call Sara Gideon right now and ask her: do you believe Tara Reade?
Sara Gideon's phone number: (207) 865-9593
\---
Please see more from the Republican National Committee below:
When Sara Gideon jumped into the Senate race last year, her reason for seeking higher office was because Senator Collins’ vote for Justice Kavanaugh ""felt like a betrayal"" of sexual assault survivors.
Since 2018, Gideon has been  attempting to capitalize on Justice Kavanaugh’s confirmation,  constantly attacking Senator Collins on social media and receiving  support from special interest groups- solely based on her opposition of Collins’ vote to confirm.
Over the course of the Kavanaugh confirmation hearings, Collins and her staff  endured death and rape threats, and the Senator’s husband even opened a  letter that claimed to be filled with ricin in their Bangor home.
On the one year anniversary of Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony, Gideon tweeted that she believes women.
And, as recently as Monday, Sara Gideon used Justice Kavanaugh‘s name in a fundraising email.
Less than a year after her 2019 tweet, Joe Biden was accused of sexual assault and Gideon has yet to say a single word about Tara Reade- not even to offer Reade praise for coming forward just as she  did for Christine Blasey Ford.
In 2018, Sara Gideon  posted a Planned Parenthood video that asked ""How do I respond when someone shares an experience of sexual assault?"" The video and Gideon expressed the answer is simple, ""I believe you"".
Gideon hasn't said she believes Tara Reade, in fact she hasn’t said  anything.
Bottom line: Sara Gideon  supports Joe Biden and voted for him in March. At the same time, she has staked her entire candidacy on the need to support all women. Unfortunately for her, both of those things cannot remain true. Gideon needs to say whether she still supports Biden or she believes the allegations against him like she believed those of Christine Blasey Ford.

""America needs President Trump to continue 'The Great American Comeback'. Under a Biden/Harris Presidency, the incredible economy President Trump built would be destroyed. Instead of promoting pro-business policies to get America back to work, his burdensome regulations would kill jobs throughout the country and his tax hikes would devastate middle class families paychecks.

Sara Gideon’s Legacy: 100 Days of Inaction During Candidate-Defining Crisis
During Maine’s Dark Hour, #SaraDidNothing
In Contrast, Senator Collins Stepped Up And Delivered Avalanche of Aid
Members of the press,
Today marks 100 days since Speaker Sara Gideon adjourned the Maine Legislature at the start of a health and economic crisis. During the last 100 days, many thousands of Mainers have needed immediate, serious assistance, and Speaker Gideon has done nothing to help. But Susan Collins has.
Sara Gideon’s legacy has been set by her behavior during the last 100 days. The stories of Mainers struggling do not appear to have moved her to action at all - in fact, it appears as if the State Legislature won’t return until AUGUST. Gideon could call the House back in session tomorrow if she wanted to lend a hand.
In stark contrast, Senator Collins has stepped up to the plate and delivered a stunning amount of aid to Mainers in need.
Let’s look at the very real impact of Speaker Gideon’s decision to keep the Legislature away from helping with COVID aid. Each of these bullet points represents thousands upon thousands of Mainers in need.
""Maine's economic fallout from coronavirus could be nation's worst""
* Gideon stood aside as the state’s economy collapsed. Thousands of Mainers lost their jobs, businesses closed, and Gideon did nothing.
""Maine lags neighbors in allocating $1B in federal virus aid...""
* Gideon did nothing and failed to distribute more than $1 billion in federal aid to Maine’s cities and towns. Senator Collins delivered $1.25 billion in state and local aid to Maine in May, but that money is just starting to be disbursed. The vital aid could have been distributed much sooner had the Legislature acted. Governor Mills even requested Gideon’s assistance in a letter on May 29th, but Gideon did nothing.
""Unemployment claims in Maine surpass 100,000 since pandemic began""
* Gideon did nothing to help with the unemployment crisis. Thousands of Mainers are still waiting for a broken state unemployment system to be fixed, and Gideon hasn’t shown any interest in their plight. It’s also important to remember how much worse the unemployment crisis would have been without the Paycheck Protection Program, authored by Senator Collins. [The same program that Sara Gideon attacked in a campaign ad that the Washington Post’s independent Fact Checker rated MOSTLY FALSE.]
In contrast, Senator Collins put forth an immense, effective, immediate effort to deliver aid to Maine.
* Senator Collins wrote the bipartisan Paycheck Protection Program, which has supported more than 200,000 Maine jobs and delivered well more than $2 billion to support about 75-percent of small employers in Maine.
* Senator Collins also delivered tens of millions of dollars in aid and protective equipment to hospitals, schools, social services, the fishing industry, the farming industry, Maine’s media, and many others.
And during that time, Collins has been on the job in Washington. She never stopped legislating. In addition to responding to the coronavirus crisis, the Senate recently passed the Great American Outdoors Act which provides $900 million per year for the Land and Water Conservation Fund to help preserve Maine’s beauty for generations to come - an important priority of Senator Collins.
It’s pretty simple - when coronavirus hit Maine,
Senator Collins took effective, aggressive action to benefit her fellow Mainers.
Speaker Gideon did nothing. Not a single thing to help Mainers in need.

Maine GOP Launches People’s Veto To
Repeal Ranked Choice Voting
AUGUSTA – Dr. Demi Kouzounas issued the following statement today regarding her filing for a People’s Veto to L.D. 1083 to Repeal Ranked Choice Voting in Maine’s Presidential Elections:
""One person, one vote is a bedrock American principle. Ranked Choice Voting (RCV) is a direct violation of that principle and threatens the rights of all Mainers and delegitimatizes our election process,"" said Dr. Kouzounas.
The people’s veto effort will be managed by the Maine Republican Party’s new ballot question committee, led by Chair Kouzounas.
Because of the manner in which Gov. Janet Mills allowed L.D. 1083 to to pass into law without her signature, a major window for a people’s veto of L.D. 1083 has now opened. To stop the current implementation of ranked-choice voting in Maine’s 2020 Presidential election and instead bring the repeal question to the November ballot, supporters must submit 63,067 signatures of registered Maine voters before the 90th day after the end of the current legislative session.
When ranked-choice voting was first proposed by out-of-state political operatives and mega-donors, it was billed as a new election system that would improve voter participation, create a more civil dialogue in our political process, and elect the ‘majority’ winner.""
The promises supporters of ranked-choice voting made – funded with massive amounts of out-of-state-money, have been proven unequivocally false:
* RCV is NOT a more fair or equal process. It allows some voters to get multiple votes, while some only get one vote.
* RCV does NOT create majority winners. In fact some people’s ballots are ""exhausted"" and thrown out in the counting.
* RCV does NOT make elections more civil or cut down on negative politics.
* RCV does NOT increase participation. In fact, it serves as voter suppression.
* RCV is NOT simple. Maine’s experience shows a much higher rate of voter error and spoiled ballots.
* RCV costs our cities, towns and state more money than traditional elections.
* RCV has already been found unconstitutional in state general elections. Why should we use it anywhere?
Despite mountains of testimony from Mainers across the political spectrum who citied major issues and concerns with Ranked Choice voting, the Maine Legislature and Governor Mills approved the use of expanding Ranked Choice Voting to our Presidential Elections.
""It has become abundantly clear that the people of Maine must take the power of elections back into their own hands and restore faith and constitutionality into our electoral system,"" said Dr. Kouzounas.
""Over the next several months Mainers from Kittery to Fort Kent will be working to repeal RCV from being used in our Presidential Elections and finally begin the process of restoring Maine’s elections to their traditional form.""

""We should expect candidates running for the Maine legislature to be people who conduct themselves in a civil, respectful, and professional manner. That is what citizens should expect from their Representatives"" House Republican Leader Kathleen Dillingham said. ""The severe budget crisis brought on by overspending and then the pandemic, will require everyone elected this Fall to be able to work together in a respectful, professional environment without bullying and workplace hostility.
We will need to be able to work together to help create and support legislation that will aide in our economic recovery. It is concerning to read that the democrat candidate from Freeport has a history that runs counter to these principles while working for the Sexual Assault Response Services of Southern Maine.
Creating a work environment where employees feel unsafe and harassed by any individual in an authority and supervisory role should not be tolerated. To make a statement that dismisses her former employees concerns as being purely political demonstrates a lack of awareness and remorse for her actions and I would be concerned for the non-partisan staff that would have to work with the candidate should she be successful in her campaign.
Democrat Leadership and the Democrat party should consider withdrawing their support for this candidate.""

Alex,
Had enough of this impeachment fiasco?
We have a record-breaking economy, the era of NAFTA hollowing out Maine’s economy is coming to an end and the paychecks of Maine people keep getting bigger.
There is one thing you can do right now to help President Trump continue on the incredible winning streak he is on right now - call Rep. Jared Golden.
Rep. Golden told Mainers on the campaign trail that he would represent us as a moderate. The numbers show that has turned out to be untrue. In fact, according to FiveThirtyEight, Rep. Golden’s anti-Trump voting record is tied with Rep. Rashida Tlaib, a member of the socialist ""Squad"" with AOC.
Rep. Golden will have to vote on articles of impeachment this week – and he has not yet announced his plans.
We know he voted in favor of the impeachment inquiry, but now that Democrats have been exposed for this witch hunt, will Rep. Golden do what Nancy Pelosi tells him to do, or will he represent the people as he promised?
This district is a strong pro-Trump district, but Rep. Golden has liberal dark money special interest groups trying to convince him to vote for impeachment. They want to fool him into thinking most of his constituents want impeachment.
The truth is, if Golden votes for impeachment, he will pay the price at the ballot box.
But we still owe it to our President to stand with him and ask Rep. Golden to stand up and vote no on the articles of impeachment.
Please call one of Rep. Golden’s offices right now and register your opinion.
CALL REP. JARED GOLDEN:
WASHINGTON D.C. (202) 225-6303
LEWISTON (207) 241-6767

Tell his staff you want Rep. Golden to vote against this impeachment witch hunt fabricated by his party. Tell him you want him to get back to work for the American people, not trying to overturn a national election.
And please be polite to the staffer that takes your call. They are doing their jobs, and they can do it better if we stay positive and treat them with kindness.
We can have a positive impact while staying above the tactics of the radical left.
Please call Rep. Golden now and tell him to stand with the people, not Pelosi!

"In the interest of sharing information, we are forwarding the following message from Andrew Mahaleris, Deputy Communications Director – ME & NH for the Republican National Committee.
Hey there,
President Trump is aggressively confronting coronavirus on multiple fronts: not only to protect the health of Americans, but their economic wellbeing too.
That’s why President Trump secured the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) to inject $350 billion into America’s great small
businesses.
Small businesses in Maine have been hit hard by COVID-19, but the PPP will provide economic relief for Maine businesses – which will allow them to keep workers on the payroll and keep their businesses open.
Starting today, this program, through the Small Business Administration, will:
* Provide 8 weeks of cash-flow assistance to small businesses who maintain their payroll during the coronavirus crisis.
* Small businesses can take out a forgivable loan: If the employer maintains its payroll and this money is used for paying rent or salaries, then the loan will be forgiven.
* The loan is also retroactive. Workers who have already been laid off can be brought back onto payrolls.
* Small businesses can find these details as well as apply at [[URL REDACTED]]
Reminder: Since President Trump was elected, he has always fought for the American worker. Now with an unprecedented global crisis affecting every single American, President Trump’s administration has provided a much needed lifeline.
Bottom Line: President Trump and Maine Senator Susan Collins are committed to making sure small businesses in Maine and their workers, the backbone of America, are able to get back up and running once the economy reopens, putting our country in the strongest possible position to come back stronger than ever.

"Alex,
I hope you're staying warm in this cold, snowy weather.
On our end, the news just keeps getting better.
As the architect of the Maine GOP’s national award-winning 2014 field and data operation I need to tell you, there has never been a better organized and stronger Republican program than what we have right now in 2020 working as a team with the RNC and Trump Victory.
Just the other day when we announced the people’s veto of RCV we had more than 3,000 people tell us they would sign our petitions and more than 200 people volunteered to collect signatures to repeal RCV.
The Maine GOP / Trump Victory field team has knocked on doors all over this state. They hit their goals (often, they far surpass them!) every week since the cycle began.
But I'm also writing to tell you – we really need your help.
Our ""troops"" are now in every quarter of the state, fighting the battle to help President Trump. We have Republicans holding caucuses, organizing, registering voters and collecting signatures for candidates to get them on the ballot.
This is a whole-ticket effort. We can’t just re-elect President Trump. We have to send him reinforcements and we have to elect Republicans to stop Janet Mills in Augusta.
And because, here in snowy February, we have so many troops in the field, we must keep the supply lines full.
It looks like Democrats are poised to nominate Bernie (Socialist) Sanders as their Presidential nominee. We could be looking at a head-to-head matchup with an avowed socialist trying to become the leader of the free world.
Right now, our team in the field is strong and morale is high. Polling shows President Trump emerged from impeachment stronger. Gallup says the views of Americans on the economy, national security and many other issues are at incredible highs.
But to keep this momentum, we need to keep growing and moving forward.
Every day, dozens of requests come in for more petitions, new candidates, more voter lists, more email invitations to local events. This is a good problem to have, but it costs money.
Our work extends so far beyond what we typically post on social media or send to you in emails. We are not just growing on our own – we are growing, equipping and supplying every Republican group we work with that asks for help.
Can you chip in right now to help us sustain our work?
We expect another wave of volunteers for President Trump and another wave of volunteers to collect signatures to repeal RCV any day now.
We have a strong, spirited and growing army out in the field across Maine – but we need to keep them well-supplied so we can turn back the socialists at our gate.
Any amount you can chip in, right here and now, is an incredible help. The matching donor we had last week is allowing us to continue that offer right now at this link.

"Maine GOP calls on Gideon to take responsibility for budget crisis
AUGUSTA – The Maine Republican Party is calling out Speaker Sara Gideon for her complete absence in speaking out on key issues impacting Mainers in recent weeks. After passing a rushed package of legislation to ""deal"" with coronavirus, Gideon left Augusta, hit the campaign trail and has not looked back.
Now, Maine faces the largest budget shortfall in 30 years due to the massive spending spree Speaker Gideon shepherded through the Maine House of Representatives. Two former governors say in a new article from the Portland Press Herald, ""The revenue shortfall soon to unfold in Maine will be unlike any the state has ever seen, including the Great Recession of 2008 to 2010 and the decline of the economy following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.""
Where’s Sara Gideon?
On the campaign trail, running attack ads and pretending to be a hero.
Here’s the reality: Sara Gideon pushed through a spending package last year that has put Maine on track for the worst budget crisis in three decades or more.
Now she is staying as far away from Augusta as she can.
Let’s be clear, many of us were warning Gov. Mills, Speaker Gideon and anyone who would listen that Maine would not be able to sustain their blockbuster spending spree. The shortfalls that are coming may be larger than predicted, but shortfalls were predictable.
Instead of setting aside more money in our rainy day fund, Speaker Gideon pushed for taxpayer funded abortions, twice voted to provide welfare for non-citizens and whole lot of other spending increases.
""It’s time for Sara Gideon to take ownership of the crisis that she helped create in Augusta,"" said Maine GOP Chair Dr. Demi Kouzounas. ""Sara’s spending spree is about to have catastrophic effects in Maine’s budget and people. Core services are being threatened every day the state continues on the massive spending spree Sara Gideon, Janet Mills and Troy Jackson pushed us into.""
Because of the state budget’s fiscal year calendar, the Maine Republican Party is cautioning Mainers that Gideon, Mills and others may try to apply a band-aid this year and get back on the campaign trail.
From the Portland Press Herald:
""But all 186 seats are up for election in November, meaning much of the heavy financial lifting in response to the COVID-19 recession will be left to the next Legislature.""
Speaker Gideon, Governor Mills and Senate President Troy Jackson must not push off bringing Maine’s state budget in line with revenues until next year.
""Pushing this off to future lawmakers would be unconscionable and worsen the crisis by an order of magnitude,"" said Dr. Kouzounas. ""Sara Gideon and her allies need to come back and fix this state budget, avoid raising taxes during a recession and bring spending in line with what we can afford.""
Waiting until January of 2021 to begin fixing the second year of the state budget would put Maine about halfway through the fiscal year before we could begin addressing problems.
""Speaker Gideon’s irresponsible spending and leadership drove Maine into this financial ditch,"" concluded Dr. Kouzounas. ""She owes it to Maine to come back and deal with the financial crisis she helped create.""
BACKGROUND
More than 100,000 Mainers are currently collecting unemployment due to layoffs as a result of COVID-19 stay home orders and other factors. This will severely impact Maine’s tax revenue going forward.
Moody’s projects Maine’s budget shortfall and fiscal impact could be as high as $1.1 billion, that is more than 20% of the state budget.
A study from Oxford Economics says Maine has the most vulnerable economy in the nation right now.
Officials say major travel reductions are going to dramatically reduce revenue from gas tax.
Sales and income tax revenue is also projected to take a major drop.

AUGUSTA – Today, U.S. Senator Susan Collins laid out a clear explanation for why she will not vote to convict President Donald Trump. This follows Senator Collins’ well-known study and consideration of all the facts brought by both sides in this impeachment trial.

""From explaining the flaws in the House Managers’ arguments against President Tump to a lesson on the separation of powers as it truly exists, Senator Collins made the right choice,"" said Dr. Kouzounas. ""Senator Collins is the adult in the room here, and we thank her for standing up as a Mainer and showing the world how this should be handled.""

"Alex,
Today is our Chair Dr. Demi Kouzounas' birthday. I've been racking my brain thinking of what we can do for Demi to thank her for her tireless work to elect Republicans up and down the ticket.
Then it hit me-- next week Demi will be in Florida meeting with top officials from the Trump campaign and others. What better way to say happy birthday than to send her to the meeting with a report of an eye-popping number of donations to help re-elect President Trump?
It seems like every time we have a report on President Trump's donor support at Maine GOP, the already unprecedented support Chair Kouzounas has secured for us grows even more. Make no mistake, your previous support has already shown President Trump and his team how strong you stand with him. It has helped Demi and our entire team invest and bring in even more resources for President Trump. If you can help us out in sending Demi to the next meeting with another round of strong support and wish her a happy birthday, please do so now!
Say happy birthday to Demi and help re-elect President Trump by making a donation right now for her birthday!
Thank you for all that you do.

Maine Dems Don't Think Military Members Should Run for Public Office
AUGUSTA, ME - The Maine Republican Party released the following statement regarding the Maine Democratic Party's mailer criticizing Col. Duncan Milne's military service:
""As a veteran and a Mainer, I am disgusted by the tactics of the Maine Democrat Party and their dark money allies,"" said Chair Dr. Demi Kouzounas. ""Col. Duncan Milne’s service should be celebrated, not attacked, and we thank him for the sacrifices he made serving our country all around the world.""
""The Maine Dems should be ashamed of their mailer attacking Col. Milne for serving our country and should apologize immediately. Like many Mainers, Col. Milne left his home to protect our country overseas. Now, Democrat operatives are using it as a ridiculous ploy to discredit a great man.""
""Actions like this truly show how desperate the Maine Dems have become. While Democrats continue to show no respect to our men and women in uniform, the Maine Republican Party stands united in our steadfast appreciation for all who have served.""
BACKGROUND:
Households in Waldo County have recently received a negative mailer that attacks Senate candidate and retired Marine Colonel Duncan Milne for his military service. Colonel Milne is the Republican candidate for Maine Senate in District 11, which is made up of the municipalities of Waldo County.
With a photo of a moving truck and the words ""Moving in, Milne?"" as well as language stating that Col. Milne moved to Maine ""for political gain,"" the mailer insults every military veteran who has left their home state to serve our country and moved home again. It insults every active duty service member who is currently living in a different state or different country because their service requires them to be there.
Like them, Colonel Milne left Maine to serve our nation. Colonel Milne grew up in Maine, and he and his family moved away because of his military service, though he maintained his Maine residency for much of that time. He served 25 years in the Marine Corps, serving on every continent except for South America and Antarctica. His personal decorations include the Legion of Merit, Defense Meritorious Service Medal, the Meritorious Service Medal, the Individual Action Air Medal with Combat ""V"", the Strike Flight Air Medal, the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal with Combat ""V"" and Gold Star in lieu of fourth award. Following his retirement from the military, Col. Milne has continued to serve others as President of Dixon Center for Military and Veterans Services.

"FAKE AD ALERT: GIDEON STAGES PHONY TOWN HALL TO FEIGN ACCESSIBILITY IN TV AD
Participants in Gideon’s ""Virtual Town Hall"" Were Pre-Screened and Forced to Sign Model Releases
Augusta, ME – Sara Gideon, a Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate, staged a fake ""Virtual Town Hall"" meeting last week to provide footage for a TV ad that is now running on Maine television. Gideon’s campaign posted notice of the online videoconference meetings to social media, but did not allow open participation by the general public. Instead, the campaign pre-screened participants and forced registrants to sign releases that allowed their words and images to be used in campaign advertising prior to being cleared to participate. The campaign has also not released the actual video of the ""Town Halls"" on social media.
Social media advertisement for Gideon's fake town hall
In her television ad, Gideon claims to be holding ""Virtual Town Halls,"" and appears to be interacting with Mainers through an online videoconference system.
""We’re going to continue to innovate in this way and reach out and talk to people across this state for as long as we are in this space,"" Gideon says in the ad. ""There is nothing more important to me.""
Gideon TV Ad
In order to participate in this staged event, Gideon required participants to ""irrevocably grant"" her campaign sole ownership of their images and the things they said during the videoconference, including their ""name, likeness, voice, story, comments, and persona, in any manner or media and for any purpose whatsoever at the sole discretion of the campaign.""
Gideon's videoconference registration requirements
""Forcing Mainers to be in a television commercial before they can ask a question is not a 'town hall' in any way,"" said Demi Kouzounas, chair of the Maine Republican Party. ""These were staged events, pre-screened to only allow hardcore supporters to participate. It's disingenuous that Sara Gideon would now try to pass these off as actual town halls.""
Gideon’s campaign has been criticized for sheltering the candidate from direct interaction with Maine voters. Gideon’s so-called ""Suppers with Sara"" are highly controlled events that only allow pre-screened participants, and forbid the use of audio or video recording devices. Gideon’s campaign staff has also restricted the use of cell phones during her events.
Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer reportedly sequestered Gideon and several other Democratic senate candidates as part of his ""windowless basement strategy,"" forcing them to stay away from uncontrolled public events and requiring them to spend the majority of their time making campaign donation phone calls.
""Sara Gideon is not ready for prime time, and these fake town halls make that point crystal clear,"" continued Kouzounas. ""Mainers deserve a candidate who will be responsive and honest with us, not a DC-controlled empty vessel like Sara Gideon. The stakes are too high to send someone to Washington who can’t even be honest about the simplest things, and lying about these phony, online town halls shows clearly that Sara Gideon can’t be trusted.""
Below is an image of Gideon’s screening form for her fake town halls, including a release that requires participants to allow themselves to appear in her ads. The release can be found online here:

"From: Nina McLaughlin, RNC Spokeswoman Maine and New Hampshire
Good Afternoon –
In a bombshell report by Business Insider, the Biden campaign has been caught in a cover up that started back in Spring 2019, when they sent researchers to the University of Delaware to access Senate documents that could include records surrounding Tara Reade's allegations that are unavailable to the public or the press:
Since the Spring of 2019, the Biden research team has gone back and accessed the Biden Senate documents for reasons unknown to the public. From Business Insider: Andrea Boyle Tippett, a spokeswoman for the University of Delaware, confirmed to Insider that individuals from the campaign have accessed the collection since Biden announced his presidential campaign in the spring of 2019.""
The campaign of Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has repeatedly insisted that journalists ""rigorously vet"" the accusations, yet they refuse to release these documents and have now potentially tampered or altered the documents in question, which raises new questions:
1. Did the Biden campaign send researchers to tamper or alter the Senate documents?
2. Did the University of Delaware tamper or alter the Senate documents?
3. If the Biden campaign accessed these documents, why can’t the press or the American people?
Bottom Line: The Biden Campaign is acutely aware of what’s in those Senate documents, and they sent researchers to assess the damage. We need proof that the documents haven’t been tampered with by the Biden Campaign or The University of Delaware immediately.

"Alex,
I hope you're staying warm in this cold, snowy weather.
On our end, the news just keeps getting better.
As the architect of the Maine GOP’s national award-winning 2014 field and data operation I need to tell you, there has never been a better organized and stronger Republican program than what we have right now in 2020 working as a team with the RNC and Trump Victory.
Just the other day when we announced the people’s veto of RCV we had more than 3,000 people tell us they would sign a petition and more than 200 people volunteered to collect signatures to repeal RCV.
The Maine GOP / Trump Victory field team has knocked on doors all over this state. They hit their goals (often, they far surpass them!) every week since the cycle began.
But I'm also writing to tell you – we really need your help.
Our ""troops"" are now in every quarter of the state, fighting the battle to help President Trump. We have Republicans holding caucuses, organizing, registering voters and collecting signatures for candidates to get them on the ballot.
This is a whole-ticket effort. We can’t just re-elect President Trump. We have to send him reinforcements and we have to elect Republicans to stop Janet Mills in Augusta.
And because, here in snowy February, we have so many troops in the field, we must keep the supply lines full.
It looks like Democrats are poised to nominate Bernie (Socialist) Sanders as their Presidential nominee. We could be looking at a head-to-head match up with an avowed socialist trying to become the leader of the free world.
Right now, our team in the field is strong and morale is high. Polling shows President Trump emerged from impeachment stronger. Gallup says the views of Americans on the economy, national security and many other issues are at incredible highs.
But to keep this momentum, we need to keep growing and moving forward.
Every day, dozens of requests come in for more petitions, new candidates, more voter lists, more email invitations to local events. This is a good problem to have, but it costs money.
Our work extends so far beyond what we typically post on social media or send to you in emails. We are not just growing on our own – we are growing, equipping and supplying every Republican group we work with that asks for help.

California Kamala Is Too Extreme For Maine
AUGUSTA, ME-- Maine GOP Chair Dr. Demi Kouzounas released the following statement regarding Joe Biden tapping Kamala Harris as his running mate:
""As we've seen throughout his campaign, Joe Biden is being taken for a ride by the far-left. Now, while Biden continues to pretend he is a moderate, he has chosen California Kamala Harris, who wants to defund the police, to be his running mate,"" said Chair Dr. Demi Kouzouas.
""By picking California Kamala as his running mate, Joe Biden finally publicly endorses the most extreme in his party. From pushing the Green New Deal, to abolishing private health insurance, and comparing law enforcement officials to the KKK, it has become as clear as ever that the left-wing mob is controlling Biden’s candidacy, just like they would control him as president. These radical policies might be popular among liberals, but they are well outside the mainstream for most Mainers. Simply put, Kamala Harris is too extreme for Maine.""
""Instead of working together to make America a better place, Democrats like Senator Kamala Harris have fought President Trump and every turn to score cheap political points. It appears that Kamala has cashed in those points with the D.C. Democrats in the hopes she can get some national exposure on Joe Biden's failing campaign.""
""When it comes to embracing the radical left, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are perfect together, but wrong for America.""

""Dr. Biden wants to hold a small business economic roundtable, but it was the Obama – Biden Administration that led the slowest economic recovery in modern times- in their administration Maine lost 4,400 manufacturing jobs alone. Even Barack Obama admitted that their initiative ""had fallen short."" Meanwhile, under Senator Susan Collins’ Paycheck Protection Program, more than 28,000 Maine small businesses received nearly 2.3 billion in loans, saving more than 255,000 Maine jobs.""
""As for her sudden interest in our great fishing industry, I hate to inform Dr. Biden that she is late to class. President Trump and Governor Paul LePage have been tireless advocates for our great fishermen and women, they don’t just show up to the roundtable- they take action. Last month, President Trump worked to end the Obama – Biden era European Union’s tariffs of up to 8% on Maine lobsters, and up to 20% on Maine lobster products, leading to even Chellie Pingree, Jared Golden and Angus King applauding President Trump.""

The Wuhan coronavirus is turning our lives upside down. Kids are at home instead of being at school; we can’t visit our aging parents and grandparents; and the economy is in lock-down.
I haven’t been able to visit my 90-year-old parents at the nursing home for over two weeks. But, each morning, a terrific health care worker uses her cell phone to connect us via FaceTime. Mom and Dad don’t quite know where I am even though they see and hear me! It gets us going each day with a good laugh and the peace-of-mind that everyone is safe.
We’ll all get through this tough time in our own way. President Trump and his public health and economic teams are the best there are, anywhere. Thank God for their leadership and decisive actions. This will likely be the Trump Administration’s finest hour.
Beyond the Covid-19 virus, we’ve all had ups and downs in our lives. Many of us have endured personal tragedies and come out stronger and more grateful on the other side. In my life, I’ve learned how a positive daily routine, including work if possible, keeps me focused and productive to help heal and move on. Life cannot stop for long, and it shouldn’t.
With that thought, I hope you don’t mind me reaching out to you about the important work needed to help President Trump and all Maine Republicans get re-elected, and elected, in November. The coronavirus will not stop the elections. It would be malpractice for us Republicans not to have done the hard work needed to win this fall.
The Maine GOP Team has been working through the Wuhan virus challenge. For example, while keeping themselves and others safe, they’re pushing ahead to meet the signature collection deadline to end the Ranked Choice Voting rip-off. Otherwise, we’ll all be forced to watch in horror as it tries to scam President Trump in November.
Nobody has learned better than me that family must always come first. But, if you can help our dedicated Maine GOP Team get its work done, I’d really appreciate it. Success in Maine is very important to the Trump Campaign. The March 31 financial goal is $4,300 short. It would be great it you’re able to help out.
Many thanks for listening. Stay positive, stay safe and wash your hands!
God Bless our brave healthcare workers. We’re going to get through this, together!

Maine GOP Files Appeal of RCV Decision, Over 2,000 Maine Voters Wrongly Disenfranchised
AUGUSTA, ME-- Today the Maine GOP filed an appeal in Cumberland County Superior Court on the Secretary of State’s outrageous ruling to silence and invalidate thousands of Maine voters’ voices.
Maine GOP Chair Dr. Demi Kouzounas commented on the filing, ""through a meticulous investigation by our team and volunteers, we have found and verified that thousands of registered Maine voters’ signatures were improperly deemed invalid.""
""Much like when we cast a vote, each signature from a registered Maine voter deserves to be counted. It is shocking how many voters the Secretary of State chose to silence.""
""Our repeal calls for the swift reversal and reinstatement of the signatures that Secretary Dunlap wrongly disqualified. It is completely unacceptable that our Secretary of State would handle such an important process so poorly. As long as Maine voices are silenced, we will not stop fighting,"" concluded Kouzounas.
Background:
* Through a review of nearly 10,000 petition sheets processed by the Secretary of State, Maine GOP has identified over 2,000 signatures improperly invalidated under four different categories of technical invalidation.
* Maine GOP’s findings are more than necessary to qualify the People’s Veto of Rank Choice Voting for the ballot this November.
* Invalidation of signatures in a number of other areas, including simple tabulation errors, erroneous disqualifications, and even improper claim of material alteration, account for hundreds more signatures that should have been deemed valid.
* In one instance, a signature from a voter with cerebral palsy who legally signed a petition with a stamp, as is his constitutional right, was deemed invalid.
* Maine GOP was not able to access and scan petitions until the middle of last week. If given more time, there is no question that more discrepancies would have been uncovered.

"Alex,
I can’t say it is a surprise, but yesterday Jared Golden made it official – he’s joining Nancy Pelosi and voting to impeach President Trump. Make no mistake, Golden’s voting record against President Trump is horrible. On the campaign trail he told people he would be a moderate voice in Congress, he has been anything but a moderate.
His voting record looks more like AOC. Golden is actually tied with AOC’s ""Squad"" member, Rep. Rashida Tlaib for his anti-Trump voting record.
Here’s the truth – Jared Golden’s stunt yesterday doesn’t change anything. He is vulnerable. He’s anti-Trump. He’s not a voice for Maine CD2, he’s a reliable vote for Nancy Pelosi.
Maine CD2 is a Trump +10 district. It should not be complicit in the witch hunt impeachment against President Trump. I mean, not only is Golden supporting this effort to overturn the 2016 election, he’s not helping much in any other way either.
Jared Golden won’t even support the USMCA trade deal – and he represents a region where NAFTA decimated our economy and left tens of thousands of Mainers without jobs. But we are ready to take this seat back for the good people of Maine CD2. We have great candidates running to take on Jared Golden.
Each of our candidates have strong values, level heads and incredible hearts for the people of Maine. We are not taking a side in the Republican primary – but we are going to build a campaign war chest for the nominee. We are proud to introduce the Take Back ME-02 Republican Nominee Fund 2020.
Your donation to this fund will provide critical resources to the Republican nominee taking on Jared Golden after the June primary.
Jared Golden has locked down some support from Nancy Pelosi by doing her bidding on impeachment – but he has not gained any votes by defying his district.
We can neutralize Golden’s support from Pelosi and the ""Squad"" by ensuring our nominee is well-funded and ready for the fight on day one of the general election.
Will you donate right now to make sure Jared Golden is held accountable for supporting this witch hunt? We’ll be tracking results and trying to reach some strong goals by the end of the year for our report.
If you want to make sure your donation is spent holding Jared Golden accountable for siding with Nancy Pelosi over the good people of his district, the Take Back ME-02 Republican Nominee Fund 2020 is the way to go.
Thank you for all that you do. There is a price to pay for Democrats who support this impeachment witch hunt, and we are proud to have you by our side for the fight.

Maine GOP Statement on Status of People's Veto to Repeal Ranked Choice Voting
AUGUSTA, ME-- Maine Republican Party Chair, Dr. Demi Kouzounas, issued the following statement regarding the Secretary of State's Decision to reject the People's Veto of RCV in Presidential Elections.
""Let me be clear. This fight is not over."" said Chair Dr. Demi Kouzounas. ""It is abundantly clear that the Secretary of State used every trick in the book to throw out enough signatures through a litany of technicalities to keep this question off the ballot.
The voters who signed these petitions to Repeal Ranked Choice voting deserve to be heard, not silenced through bureaucratic technicalities. These voters were from across the political spectrum and included Democrats, Independents, and Republicans. We were given no notice of this decision before it was announced by the Secretary of State, but this statement is our notice that we will fight to make sure every Maine voter is heard and every legitimate signature is counted.""

Maine GOP Cracking Down on Lawn Sign Theft & Destruction
Initial report by party to local authorities leads to
summons of lawn sign thief
AUGUSTA – The Maine GOP is putting lawn sign thieves on notice. Last week, the Maine GOP provided evidence to a police department in northern Maine that shows the theft and destruction of lawn signs by at least one college student. The evidence provided resulted in a summons for theft of multiple lawn signs (which were also defaced) later that same day.
After the rampant increase in the theft of signs across Maine, the Party says it is providing evidence to local and county police departments of the thefts. Stealing or defacing a single lawn sign carries a fine of up to $250 in Maine.
""I want to be clear, our tolerance for this rampant theft of lawn signs is now zero. We will turn over evidence of theft to authorities in every instance it is provided to us,"" said Maine GOP Executive Director Jason Savage.
""The rule of law matters. Property matters and most importantly, the First Amendment matters,"" said Mr. Savage.
""This is about protecting the free speech of Maine people. If you steal a lawn sign and we get photos or evidence, you will be answering to authorities.""
The Maine GOP will not be publicly releasing the name of the lawn sign thief charged last week in the hope that the offender will learn a lesson and refrain from such activities in the future. Any additional charges brought will result in the Maine GOP publicly releasing the names of those known to have stolen or damaged lawn signs or other property.
If you have evidence of a lawn sign theft that can identify the perpetrator, please email the evidence, with a detailed description and any videos or photos, to [[URL REDACTED]]

"Alex,
Wait until you read this. It is shocking what Democrats and their liberal allies are now trying to do here in Maine!
As you know, we have been fighting to stop Maine Secretary of State Matt Dunlap from disenfranchising tens of thousands of Mainers who signed to Repeal RCV. We have also been fighting to set the record straight on a recent order that was badly misrepresented to some members of the press.
But there is more. The Maine GOP is now also intervening in a lawsuit to defend Maine’s basic election laws. A union-funded group that is filing lawsuits around the nation to tear down the integrity of our elections has come to Maine.
This group only supports Democrats and they appear to hide their donors from public view. The one thing we know is they only give money to Democrats and only support liberal causes.
Among other things, this group wants to eliminate voter ID requirements for voter registration and allow “ballot harvesting” in Maine, which would allow ballots to keep pouring in after election day.
Along with eliminating identification requirements and allowing ballots to come in after election day, they want to allow online voter registration (without ID) and allow anyone to turn in ballots from these voters. IT IS INSANITY.
I want to be extremely clear – this is part of a national attempt to undermine our election integrity and throw everything into chaos.
That is why we are intervening to stand up to them and stop them.
We are fighting this battle on many fronts.
-A battle to ensure your voices are heard and Matt Dunlap does not disenfranchise you. No matter what he says, this is not over.
-A battle to protect the integrity of our elections and stop attempts to allow ballot harvesting, throw out ID requirements and more. We are here to defend the integrity of our elections. No ballot harvesting. No undocumented voters.
-A battle on the streets of Maine to win hearts, minds and votes for President Donald Trump and GOP candidates up and down the ticket. We have already knocked on over 200,000 doors and exceeded 1 million total voter contacts.
But we still have almost two full months to go. With your support, we can prevail in all these battles, which, make no mistake, is a fight to preserve the very heart of our nation.
Can you chip in whatever amount you can afford right now to help us win the battles? Whether it is $10, $25, $50 or more, your contribution will help us keep up the fight.
We plan to do so much more. We are on the path to victory, but we must keep up the fight on every front – legal, political, communications and more.
Please chip in now to keep us going strong. Whatever you can afford will help. $10, $25, $50 or more will keep the front lines strong as we fight this ballot harvesting, integrity destroying, disenfranchising and chaos inducing agenda of the left.
Thank you for all that you do and thank you in advance for your most generous contribution.
Sincerely,
Jason Savage
Executive Director
Maine GOP
P.S. I know you are getting a lot of requests for donations, but please know that right here, right now, your support will help us protect the integrity of Maine's elections and fund the work that we need to do to win here in Maine. Thank you again.

Maine GOP Calls on Secretary of State To Clarify Conflicting RCV Instructions on Ballots
AUGUSTA-- Maine Republican Party Chair, Dr. Demi Kouzounas, released the following statement regarding conflicting instructions on how to use Ranked Choice Voting on Maine's 2020 ballots:
""Secretary of State Dunlap needs to issue an immediate clarification to Maine's election clerks and staff regarding the conflicting instructions his office has given,"" said Maine GOP Chair Dr. Demi Kouzounas. ""On one hand, Secretary Dunlap's website instructions tell voters, correctly, that they can select one candidate across their ballot in each round. But on the other hand, the instructions Secretary Dunlap put on our actual ballots says the opposite.
""Once again we are seeing unforced errors made by Secretary of State Matt Dunlap,"" said Chair Dr. Demi Kouzounas. ""Earlier this year, the Secretary of State lost 11,000 ballots in the Maine Primary, now, he has put out contradicting instructions on how to use Ranked Choice Voting on the 2020 General Election ballots.""
""The Maine Republican Party has received a flood of concerns from voters regarding the instructions on this November's ballot about this specific contradiction. It must be clarified immediately,"" added Dr. Kouzounas. ""Everyone who understands RCV knows a voter can vote for the same candidate in each round, yet in the most importand spot in the election, on Maine's ballots, Secretary Dunlap has sown confusion on the matter.""
The images below show the discrepancy in the voting instructions provided by the Secretary of State's website and those listed on the ballot. On instructions printed on the ballot it states that voters should, ""fill in no more than one oval for each candidate."" However, the Secretary of State's website informs voters that a valid form of voting is filling multiple ovals across for one candidate.
""Instructions to Voters"" on Maine's 2020 ballots

""This discrepancy is causing distress among Maine voters and confusion among clerks. We are calling on Maine Secretary of State Matt Dunlap to immediately issue a public clarification and instruct ALL town clerks that this method of voting is valid. This is needed to stop the disenfranchising Maine voters and to ensure the voter suppression of Ranked Choice Voting is limited. There is no valid excuse or explanation for why Secretary Dunlap cannot do this.""

Team Trump Travels Maine
AUGUSTA-- Maine Republican Party Chair, Dr. Demi Kouzounas, issued the following statement regarding to Team Trump's bus tour in Maine:
""While Joe Biden has all but abandoned the people of Maine, President Trump continues to send his top people to meet the people of Maine,"" said Chair Dr. Demi Kouzounas. ""Whether it is the First Family, his closest advisors, the Vice President, or the President himself, Mainers have shown up in in droves to have the opportunity to meet with the Trump campaign.""
""This style of campaigning is in sharp contrast to the Biden campaign, where Joe Biden has not even stepped foot in Maine since he began his campaign. While President Trump sends his top people to Maine, Jill Biden and Kamala Harris' husband to do his bidding for him. Mainers deserve more than that.""
""On behalf of the people of Maine, thank you Governor Noem, RNC Co-Chair Tommy Hicks, Corey Lewandowski, and Mick Mulvaney, for taking the time to travel the state and meet the great people of our state.""

"SARA GIDEON RELEASES OUTDATED, FLAWED PLAN TO ADDRESS COVID-19
Proposals in Maine House Speaker’s Plan Already Solved by Law that
Senator Susan Collins Helped Write
Augusta, ME – Too little too late for Maine House Speaker Sara Gideon who, this week, released her plan to combat the coronavirus. Gideon waited until after the U.S. Senate has already voted on a third stimulus package to deal with the epidemic to release her plan – and, even more stunning, nearly every point Gideon’s raised in her plan had already been addressed.
Shockingly, Gideon’s ""plan"" completely ignores the major economic issues being caused by the outbreak of COVID-19 and it offers zero assistance to Maine’s small businesses.
""At a time when the people of Maine need real leadership, they see it in Senator Susan Collins. Senator Collins has worked relentlessly over the past several weeks to help ensure Maine’s small businesses and everyone who works there receives desperately needed assistance as Congress addresses the coronavirus crisis,"" said Maine GOP Chair Dr. Demi Kouzounas. ""Speaker Gideon, on the other hand, waited until after the Senate had passed a third stimulus bill to even present a plan – and even then, nearly every single issue she raised had already been fixed. It was simply too little, too late. This is yet another example of how Sara Gideon is not ready for primetime.""
Gideon’s plan, ""What the Federal Government Must Do to Address COVID-19,"" was released on March 26, 2020.
The U.S. Senate approved its third stimulus plan on March 25, 2020 – THE DAY BEFORE GIDEON EVEN RELEASED A PLAN.
Here are the details of Gideon’s plan and the facts.
* Ensure COVID-19 testing is available for every American who needs a test and immediately expand the number and kinds of labs that are able to process the tests.
FACT: The ""Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act,"" or CARES Act, that Senator Collins helped negotiate, includes $127 billion in the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund. Senator Collins personally intervened to ensure that NorDx received the critical supplies it needed to restore its testing capacity.
* The Trump Administration should also dispatch the Department of Defense to set up field hospitals for trauma patients and run drive-through testing centers, and ensure that hospitals have the critical resources — especially personal protection equipment — by utilizing the powers of the Defense Production Act.
FACT: The CARES Act, that Senator Collins helped negotiate, includes $1 billion for the Defense Production Act to increase access to materials necessary for national security and pandemic recovery.
* Expand access to mobile testing centers and clinics.
FACT: The CARES Act, that Senator Collins helped negotiate, includes $127 billion in the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund.
* Fund telehealth options by investing in rural broadband and funding programs that work to connect rural communities with health care providers via telemedicine.
FACT: On March 17th, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) significantly expanded telehealth capabilities through regulatory authorities.
In addition, the CARES Act, that Senator Collins helped negotiate, includes:
* $275 million to remain available until Sept. 30, 2022, for the services administered under the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), of which $180 million will need to be used to carry out telehealth and rural health activities. 2022, for the services administered under the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), of which $180 million will need to be used to carry out telehealth and rural health activities.
* Allows Federally Qualified Health Centers and Rural Health Clinics to furnish telehealth services to Medicare beneficiaries in their home or other setting during the COVID-19 emergency.
* $25 million to the USDA’s Rural Development Grant Program for Distance Learning and Telemedicine Program, as well as $100 million to the USDA’s ReConnect program to help ensure rural Americans have access to broadband.
Senators Collins and Doug Jones (D-AL) have also introduced the bipartisan American Broadband Buildout Act of 2019 (ABBA), to ensure that rural Americans have access to broadband services at speeds they need to fully participate in the modern society and economy by directing the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to provide up to $5 billion in matching grants to help states improve broadband infrastructure.
* Mobilize federal employees who are already living and working in rural parts of our state to help with the coronavirus response.
* Lift the 25-bed limit on ""critical access hospitals"" in rural areas (like Houlton Regional Hospital and Millinocket Regional Hospital in Maine) to allow them to serve more patients.
FACT: This was done on March 13th by CMS via regulation.
* Increase funding for community health centers. Congress has appropriated additional funds for community health centers, but more support is needed to address the pandemic.
FACT: The CARES Act, that Senator Collins helped negotiate, contains $1.32 billion and the Senate Health Committee, on which Senator Collins serves, passed a 5-year reauthorization just last year.
* Further expand paid family and medical leave for workers whose children are out of school or daycare, who are sick, or who are caring for a sick person.
FACT: On March 19th, with Senator Collins’ support – the Senate passed the second stimulus, The Families First Coronavirus Response Act. As a result, certain employers can now provide paid sick and family leave for the first time. The U. S. Department of Labor has already published guidance explain paid sick leave and expanded family and medical leave. [[URL REDACTED]]
* Expand SNAP and increase funding for school meal programs to enable them to fully serve their students and families while schools are closed.
FACT: The Families First Coronavirus Response Act also included:
• Pandemic-SNAP (P-SNAP) Policy. Grants USDA the authority for states to provide SNAP benefits to households with children who attend a school that closes for more than five days and who would otherwise receive free or reduced-price meals. This can be in the form of additional EBT benefits.
• Waived Able-Bodied Adult Without Dependents (ABAWD) time limit (and subsequent work requirement). This means that ABAWDs will be permitted to receive SNAP for longer than three months in a 36-month period even when not fulfilling a 20 hour-per-week work or work readiness requirement.
• Additional SNAP Flexibilities in a Public Health Emergency. Gives USDA the authority to (1) provide the maximum monthly allotment to households when States provide sufficient reasoning to do so and (2) provide additional administrative flexibilities (e.g. reduced reporting, reduced face-to-face interviews, etc.)
• WIC. Increases funding for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) by $500 million.
• Child Nutrition. Provides authority to waive requirements that limit program operators’ ability to get these meals to the children who need them and permits the Secretary to waive provisions in the school meal programs even if it would result in an additional cost to the federal government.
In addition, the CARES Act, that Senator Collins helped negotiate:
• Provides nearly $16 billion for to cover the estimated increase in participation and new flexibility.
• Provides nearly $9 billion for Child Nutrition Programs, and both the second and third stimulus packages provide significant funding to support food banks and other local organizations that fill gaps between child nutrition programs and SNAP.
Again, Gideon’s plan DOES NOTHING to provide economic assistance to small businesses, such as restaurants, bars, hotels, breweries, cosmetologists, or self-employed individuals. However, on March 17th, Senator Collins released her own plan to preserve Maine jobs and protect small businesses – which became law when President Trump signed the relief bill on Friday and will provide much-needed relief Maine’s small businesses and our workers.

Maine GOP Statement on ME-02 Congressional Debate
AUGUSTA-- Maine Republican Party Chair, Dr. Demi Kouzounas, released the following statement regarding the ME-02 Congressional Debate:
""Once again, Dale Crafts proved to be the right person to represent the people of Maine's Second Congressional District,"" said Chair Dr. Demi Kouzounas. ""There is a reason why Dale has been endorsed by President Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and Governor Paul LePage. It is because Dale understands the people of Maine's Second District. As your Congressman, Dale will bring his experience as a businessman to grow Maine's economy and will stand with our President to Make Maine Great Again.""
""Since becoming Maine's 'Second Place Congressman,' Jared Golden has consistently voted against the people he represents. Although he represents a Trump +10 district, Jared Golden voted to impeach the President, supports Medicare for All, voted against the bi-partisan USMCA Trade Deal in favor of job-killing NAFTA, and votes with the extreme liberals, like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, 85% of the time. Simply put, Mainers of the Second District stand with President Trump and deserve a Congressman who does the same.""

Maine GOP's Response to Secretary of State Matt Dunlap’s
Buried Clarification on RCV
AUGUSTA-- Despite his best efforts to keep this complicated, Secretary of State Matt Dunlap has confirmed that voters can choose either to fill in one oval for a candidate or vote straight across in each round for one candidate under RCV and their vote will ""stick"" to that candidate through the end.
Yesterday, we asked Secretary of State Matt Dunlap to issue a clarification to Maine’s election clerks and the public on the issue of the instructions he printed on Maine’s ballots contradicting his office’s website.
Sadly, instead of issuing a concise clarification that voters can either fill in one oval for a candidate or fill in the ovals all the way across for the same candidate without disqualifying their ballot, as we have told voters, Secretary Dunlap chose to bury that part of his ""clarification"" in paragraph 10 of his statement.
Why did Secretary Dunlap place this instruction at the end of his statement, burying it under 400 words in 9 paragraphs of commentary to muddy the waters for voters when the answer was so simple?
Let us be clear, we have told voters on our website that either voting method is acceptable.
These two RCV voting methods have been by far the majority of questions we have fielded this year.
Our position is that either way works. We have advised people in a mailer to vote for President Trump all the way across the ballot. This is what his team feels is the safest, strongest way to vote for him.
Our concerns about the ballot go beyond partisan accusations. In the case of a close election and recount with manual ballot review, voter intent is undeniable if you vote straight across for one candidate.
In the case of a scanning failure on a ballot in the first column, a second place vote for the same candidate locks in your choice.
We saw in 2018 that Secretary Dunlap’s couriers were delivering ballot boxes to Augusta without padlocks on them. This caused us great concern. Voting straight across the ballot for Trump decreases the likelihood of anyone tampering with a ballot.
These are not foolish games we are playing and Secretary Dunlap needs to recognize this. As the top election official in a swing state that will choose the leader of the free world, it is Secretary Dunlap’s sacred duty to get this right.
We once again call on Secretary Dunlap to issue a clarification to all Maine election clerks that the method of filling in the oval for the same candidate across an RCV ballot is acceptable – just as he states on the Maine Secretary of State website.

"Alex,
American communities are at risk.
Right now American cities run by Democrats for decades are being ravaged by the liberal mob, all while Democrats like Sara Gideon and Joe Biden stand by and accept the support of ""Defund the Police"" groups and activists. In fact, a bombshell report was just released that shows Sara Gideon's team has been DONATING to bail out violent criminals from these riots, even criminals who have been charged with rape, murder, assault, and shooting at police.
For those of you who have been paying attention, this is likely no surprise. Sara Gideon has been receiving massive amounts of money from radical groups who work to defund our police and fund the liberal mobs that are causing chaos and destruction in our cities.
BUT WE CAN'T LET THE LIBERAL MOB WIN. That is why we are working tirelessly to talk to tens of thousands of voters in their communities about the importance of the 2020 election. Across the board we are finding voters want law-and-order in their communities, not liberal mobs torching buildings, destroying property and assaulting police.
The choice for Mainers this November is clear.
Democrats, who will defund the police, as Democrat politicians stand by watching the most radical of their party destroy communities.
Or Republicans, who stand for law-and-order, defend our wonderful law enforcement and generally work to make America and Maine safe.
Our team is working around the clock to ensure these radical Democrat goals never become a reality, but we can't do it alone. We NEED your help!
Please donate NOW to help us fight to win the elections that will maintain law-and-order in our country and protect our police and communities. All proceeds will go directly to fighting the Defund the Police Democrats like Sara Gideon and Joe Biden. We are on the streets every day standing up for law-and-order in the face of the liberal mob.
We will never stop fighting, and we will never let the liberal mob win.
Stay safe,

Speaker Gideon Must Call On ""Abusive"" Candidate to Drop Out Immediately
Dem Candidate in Gideon’s backyard created ""abusive"" workplace at Sexual Assault Response Organization
Gideon has track record of doing nothing in similar situations
AUGUSTA, ME-- In light of the bombshell report by the Bangor Daily News that ME House Candidate Melanie Sachs (D- Freeport) fostered a ‘hostile’ and ‘abusive’ workplace at a sexual assault agency, Maine Republican Party Chair, Dr. Demi Kouzounas, is calling on Maine Speaker of the House Sara Gideon (D- Freeport) to demand Melanie Sachs drop out of her race:
""I am appalled by Melanie Sach’s behavior as Executive Director of Sexual Assault Response Services of Southern Maine,"" said Chair Kouzounas. ""For this many of her employees to come forward about her abusive behavior to both staff and survivors, including cutting mental health benefits and that workers feared to be alone with her, is incredibly concerning. There is no place for this type of behavior in any workplace, especially not in the Maine Legislature.""
""As a healthcare professional and business owner, I have a deep understanding of the importance of creating a safe environment for my employees and patients. Creating this type of abusive culture is unacceptable in and of itself, but to behave in this manner when dealing with the most vulnerable among us is well beyond the pale. I applaud the women who came forward to tell their stories and bring this to light.""
""I think we can all agree that this type of behavior does not deserve to be rewarded with the honor of serving in Augusta. As Speaker of the House, Leader of the Democrat caucus, and Sara Gideon’s replacement in Freeport, she has the duty to call on Melanie Sachs to drop out of the race immediately.""
""It is no secret that Sara Gideon has a long history of covering up for abusers within her caucus, including refusing to hold a Democrat lawmaker accountable for alleged sexual abuse of underage girls. It is time for Sara Gideon to stand up and do what’s right - now is not the time to do nothing.""
Gideon is the head of her party’s House campaign apparatus and her Leadership PAC is the third-largest donor to the House Democrat campaign arm.
CLICK HERE TO READ THE BOMBSHELL REPORT BY THE BANGOR DAILY NEWS
BACKGROUND:
Excerpts from the article:
* ""‘We refuse to watch another coworker weep in their car after a meeting with Melanie or hold our breath every time she goes on a hospital accompaniment. The harm that Melanie has caused abounds and has been piling up for years,’ the three staff members, all of whom later left the organization, wrote in their complaint.
Seven former employees and one former intern at Sexual Assault Response Services of Southern Maine spoke to the Bangor Daily News about their experiences working for Sachs, describing how she yelled at them, slammed doors, got angry when staff asked questions about their jobs and cut benefits for staff mental health. In response, some staff members worked out plans to never end up alone with her and recorded their interactions with her, several said.""
* ""The ""final straw"" that led Tanksley and two other colleagues to file the complaint about Sachs in January 2019 stemmed from her time co-facilitating an in-person support group for survivors of sexual assault that quickly went ""downhill,"" she said.
When one member of the support group needed more individual attention in late 2018, Sachs declined the facilitators’ request to add a third advocate to help. Instead, Sachs said the support group member would have to leave, as the person had ""too many needs,"" according to the complaint.
When Tanksley and her co-facilitator ""vehemently disagreed,"" their boss said that, if they didn’t tell the support group participant to leave, Sachs would do it herself, according to the complaint. Ultimately they agreed they would rather end the group entirely.
Sachs’ overall response ""blamed that survivor for her experience of a situation that SARSSM had placed her in,"" the staff members wrote.
* Former employees also alleged that Sachs oversaw a violation of client confidentiality by ordering staff to go to a victim’s home where they disclosed that the person was a client… ""That should never have happened,"" Adell said. ""We don’t barge into people’s homes, ever.""
* ""I find Melanie’s handling of this entire situation to be unprofessional, unfounded, and in violation of multiple SARSSM policies, which is one of the many reasons why I can no longer work for this agency,""

AUGUSTA, ME-- Maine GOP Chair Dr. Demi Kouzounas released the following statement regarding Secretary of State Matt Dunlap's People's Veto review:
""While our team has laid out clear factual and legal arguments, the Secretary of State has continued to refuse to count valid signatures of Maine voters.

""Throughout this entire process, the left has done everything they can to stop Mainers' voices from being heard. In fact, just today the Law Court rejected the RCV Committee’s attempt to prevent us from pursuing the people’s veto process at all.""
""In its decision today, the Court rejected the RCV Committee’s argument that the people either never had the right to pursue a people’s veto, or, alternatively, that the people were required to pursue a veto before the Governor allowed the bill to become law. In so holding, the Court protected the democratic process in Maine.""
""Let me be clear, we will not quit until we see the legitimate signatures of registered voters counted and the Peoples Veto on the ballot. We look forward to having our day in court to finally allow the voices of Mainers heard.""

"Don't let the Democrats win
Alex,
IF YOU DON’T VOTE TODAY, ULTRA-PROGRESSIVE SARA GIDEON WILL BE YOUR NEXT SENATOR.
Hundreds of thousands of the Democrats have already voted.
That means if you don’t vote today, Republicans up and down the ballot will be in trouble. Don’t make excuses - vote. Don’t get caught off guard - vote. This state needs you.
Here are a few final reasons to get to the polls and vote for Susan Collins today:
AOC WANTS SUSAN COLLINS TO LOSE. ENOUGH SAID.
GIDEON HAS AN F RATING FROM NRA, SPORTSMAN’S ALLIANCE OF MAINE, AND GUN OWNERS OF MAINE.
Chuck Schumer and every out-of-state billionaire dark money donor have teamed up to get Gideon elected so they can make DC their progressive playground. Don’t let them push Maine around.
Gideon tries to raise taxes on everything she [[URL REDACTED]] though her family business dodged paying its own taxes .
I could go on and on about Gideon’s ultra-left record, but you know the stakes by now.

"Illegal Polling Location Manipulation by Portland City Officials Stopped by Emergency Court Order
Superior Court puts an end to City Officials’ Attempts to Silence the Voices of Their Own Residents
PORTLAND, MAINE – The Cumberland County Superior Court has issued a temporary restraining order against City of Portland officials who attempted to silence their own voters.
Officials within the City of Portland attempted to restrict the ability for their own citizens within the city to sign legal petitions at their polling locations, issued under the authority of the Maine Secretary of State, which would allow a referendum on the Maine ballot overturning provisions of Ranked Choice Voting.
In the last few hours an order was granted by the Cumberland County Superior Court ordering Portland City Officials to cease their signature blocking attempts and allow signatures to be gathered at the polls.
Despite a long history in Maine of allowing groups to collect signatures at the polls for ballot referendums, Portland City officials attempted to deny this same right to Maine citizens who are working to restore one man, one vote voting in Maine; a ballot system which produced Senators like Olympia Snowe, and Margaret Chase Smith, decades of successful Governors, and winning United States Presidents of both political parties.
A rush is on to fill as many petition tables as possible to allow City residents to exercise their right to sign.

"This is game changing news
Alex,
The Maine GOP just secured a HUGE victory to protect the integrity of our elections!
Democrats and their liberal allies have been working overtime to find ways to undermine the integrity of our elections, and we have fought them at every turn. Including winning a major court case in Maine Superior Court today. But there are more challenges to our Democracy on the way.
As you know, we have been fighting to stop Maine Secretary of State Matt Dunlap from disenfranchising tens of thousands of Mainers who signed to Repeal RCV. We are preparing to take the Ranked Choice Voting issue to the Supreme Court, and are going through the proper steps with our legal team as we speak.
But there is more. The Maine GOP also intervened in a lawsuit to defend Maine’s basic election laws against a union-funded group that is filing lawsuits around the nation to tear down the integrity of our elections has come to Maine.
This Democrat dark money wanted to eliminate voter ID requirements for voter registration and allow ""ballot harvesting"" in Maine, which would have allowed ballots to keep pouring in after election day.
Along with eliminating identification requirements and allowing ballots to come in after election day, this group wanted to allow online voter registration (without ID) and allow anyone to turn in ballots from these voters. IT IS INSANITY.
There was no way we were going to let this happen, so we built a team and put an end to it.
These types of attacks on our election process are constant, and we will never stop fighting them. We aren't just fighting to get Republicans elected, we are fighting to ensure that Maine has fair elections and that YOUR vote counts.
We are fighting this battle on many fronts.
-A battle to ensure your voices are heard and Matt Dunlap does not disenfranchise you. No matter what he says, this is not over.
-A battle to protect the integrity of our elections and stop attempts to allow ballot harvesting, throw out ID requirements and more. We are here to defend the integrity of our elections. No ballot harvesting. No undocumented voters.
-A battle on the streets of Maine to win hearts, minds and votes for President Donald Trump and GOP candidates up and down the ticket. We have already knocked on over 200,000 doors and exceeded 1 million total voter contacts.
The Democrats are pulling out every trick in the book to undermine our elections, and even more battles are on the horizon. With your support, we can prevail in all these battles, which, make no mistake, is a fight to preserve the very heart of our nation.
Can you chip in whatever amount you can afford right now to help us win the battles? Whether it is $10, $25, $50 or more, your contribution will help us keep up the fight.
We plan to do so much more. We are on the path to victory, but we must keep up the fight on every front – legal, political, communications and more.
Please chip in now to keep us going strong. Whatever you can afford will help. $10, $25, $50 or more will keep the front lines strong as we fight this ballot harvesting, integrity destroying, disenfranchising and chaos inducing agenda of the left.
Thank you for all that you do and thank you in advance for your most generous contribution.
Sincerely,
Jason Savage

P.S. I know you are getting a lot of requests for donations, but please know that right here, right now, your support will help us protect the integrity of Maine's elections and fund the work that we need to do to win here in Maine. Thank you again.

Maine GOP Chair Dr. Demi Kouzounas’ Statement on Rep. Ilhan Omar's Anti-Semitic Rhetoric
AUGUSTA – Maine Republican Party Chair, Dr. Demi Kouzounas, issued the following statement following Rep. Ilhan Omar's campaign stop in New Hampshire:
""Controversial Congresswoman Rep. Ilhan Omar is currently touring the country with Presidential nominee hopeful Bernie Sanders. Recently, Rep. Omar stopped in New Hampshire to stump for her fellow socialist colleague in Congress, and part of her media tour included discussing her interest in Maine politics.
While some media outlets in Maine fawn over the freshman Congresswoman from Minnesota, we'd like to remind everyone that Rep. Omar has a history of anti-semetic remarks and offensive views on September 11th.
Whether it referring to September 11th as ""some people did some things"", tweeting ""Israel has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel"", or leading the charge behind the anti-Isreal BDS (Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions) movement, her outlandish, extreme, and anti-semetic rhetoric has no place in Maine politics.
Rep. Omar's history of anti-semetic comments are so damaging, that even her fellow Democratic Congressman, Rep. Max Rose said, ""Congresswoman Omar’s statements are deeply hurtful to Jews, including myself.""
Mainers must reject the radical agendas Rep. Omar and her allies in Congress are pushing and call on Rep. Pingree, who votes with Rep. Omar 97% of the time, and Rep. Golden, who votes with Rep. Omar 87% of the time, to denounce this kind of hateful rhetoric.
Hate has no place in politics. Instead of playing identity politics and pitting Americans against each other, we urge all elected officials to work together and focus on improving the lives of all who live here.""

Sara Gideon is once again trying to push a gas tax that could raise gas, heating oil and other fuels by roughly 40 cents a gallon! Read more from Team Collins below.
Gideon’s Real Climate Change Plan: Raise Taxes on Hardworking Mainers
Gideon Supports Gas Tax Hike That’ll Hurt Working Families, Farmers, & Seniors
Hypocrisy Alert: Gideon Also Has Long Track Record of Donations from Fossil Fuel Interests
Members of the press:
Sara Gideon released her ""climate agenda"" today. Here’s what she’s not telling you.
* Gideon’s climate change agenda includes a gas tax. Gideon supports a plan to hike taxes on gas, home heating oil, and other fuel products in Maine by roughly 40 cents a gallon.
* Gideon has benefited heavily from fossil fuel interests, including oil pipeline companies and fossil fuel billionaires like Donald Sussman, Tom Steyer, and Michael Zilka.
* Gideon doesn’t address how she’s going to pay for her plan.
Gideon’s devastating gas and heating oil tax would especially affect working families and seniors - the people who can least afford Gideon’s new tax.
The gas tax bill that Gideon supports, LD 434, ""An Act to Price Carbon Pollution in Maine,"" would have slapped a new fee on fuel distributors in Maine. It would have affected fuel products from gasoline to diesel to home heating oil. Gideon cosponsored and spoke at a press conference in support of the bill.
The money taken from Mainers by Gideon's new tax would not have been used to fix and improve Maine’s crumbling infrastructure. Instead, it would have gone to a brand new fund administered by the Maine Public Utilities Commission and distributed to Central Maine Power and other utilities.
Gideon has taken donations from oil pipeline companies like Enbridge, raised money at the Houston mansion of fossil fuel billionaire Michael Zilka, and is benefiting from millions of dollars of political support from Donald Sussman and Tom Steyer, two billionaires who made their fortune in fossil fuels.

Collins Shines Again While Gideon Stumbles
The Maine Republican Party released the following statement following tonight's U.S. Senate Debate:
""Once again, Senator Susan Collins showed why Maine needs her in the U.S. Senate,"" said Chair Dr. Demi Kouzounas. ""Since she took office, Susan Collins has proven time and time again that nobody works harder for Mainers in D.C. than her. From Kittery to Fort Kent, to Eastport to Eustis, there isn't a single town in the State of Maine that hasn't been positively impacted by Senator Collins' tireless work to better our state and our country.""
""While Gideon attempts to run from her abysmal record, including attempting to raise heating oil costs by 40 cents a gallon, a litany of ethics violations, dodging taxes, or protecting a fellow lawmaker accused of sexual abuse of a minor, Mainers know that Sara Gideon doesn't have the integrity to be our Senator.""
""Senator Collins' understanding of Maine and our people is unmatched, and while Sara Gideon regurgitates tired D.C. Democrat talking points, Collins has the unique ability to highlight and discuss the real issues facing Mainers. The winner of this race will not be the candidate with flashy TV ads and millions of out-of-state money pouring into their campaign, it will be Maine's own Susan Collins, who has a proven track record of making Maine a better place.""

""There isn't a town in Maine that hasn't been positively impacted by Senator Collins' tireless advocacy. Whenever Mainers have an issue, or are in need of assistance, Senator Collins jumps into action to save the day.  Senator Collins doesn't represent special interests, she represents us. She speaks for our shipyard workers, our farmers, our fishermen, and has delivered historic victories to our state.""
""While Collins works for Mainers, Gideon has proven to be nothing but an empty suit pushing D.C. special interests. From supporting a 40 cent per gallon gas and heating oil tax, to embracing the Green New Deal, and campaigning with Defund the Police groups, Gideon has shown that she stands with the most extreme of her party, not everyday Mainers.""
""Collins is from here and for us. She has earned the vote of Mainers, and I look forward to her serving another term in the United States Senate.""

""While Joe Biden is doing his best impression of a 'moderate' politician, the policies he has backed during his campaign are anything but. From defunding the police and confiscating firearms from law-abiding citizens, to the 'Green New Deal', Joe Biden has been commandeered by the most extreme members of his party. Simply put, a Biden-Harris presidency would kill jobs, decimate our economy, and put our communities in danger.""

"Dear Alex,
Data shows that as of right now, Republicans and Democrats are in a dead heat to win the Maine House and Maine Senate. That means that whichever side best utilizes these finals days will win on Election Day.
Right now, the Dems have a flood of outside money pouring into these campaigns to tip the scales in their favor. In fact, the Maine Senate Democrats just raised over $500,000 in less than two months. Over 70% of their donations were large contributions from out of state donors.
We have to fight back.
Our candidates need to have the funding to match their opponents. If not, the Democrats will dominate the airwaves, social media, and local ""get out the vote"" operations. We cannot let this happen.
Here are a few ways I need you to fight back:
1) Maine Clean Elections deadline is October 13th at 5:00PM. Please click HERE to see if any local Republicans are running using this program. Many of our candidates are just a few donations away from unlocking their next round of funding. Your donation of just $5 could make a game-changing impact on your local race!
2) If you have no candidates running clean in your district, please donate that $5 (or more) HERE. Your donation will be spent directly on electing Republicans in your district.
Please know I would not be asking for your support unless we had a real opportunity to flip the Maine Legislature. Donating is quick, easy, secure and could change the outcome of the upcoming election.
As always, please do not hesitate to reach out with any questions, or your thoughts on your local races. I am always here to help.
Thank you for all you do. I'm proud to have you part of our team.
Together we will win this.

As a US Senator for Texas, I have had a front-row seat for the unrelenting attacks that the deep state and the liberal mob have thrown against our President and our allies all over our country. We are entering an unprecedented time in American history. We need leaders who can withstand unknown attacks from some of the darkest forces our country has ever known. Now is the time for courageous conservatives to rise up and save our country.
I can think of very few Americans that are as courageous as Dale Crafts.
Dale knows what it is to face overwhelming obstacles head-on, have the wisdom to figure out how to overcome them and move on to the next. He understands that winning isn’t just defeating the enemy today it's getting up and facing them every day - win or lose. We need more people like Dale in Congress. That’s why I’m reaching out to you today.
When I met Dale and heard his story I knew that I needed to do all that I could to help get him to Washington, DC. Nancy Pelosi is not willing to let Jared Golden lose this seat. She and her San Fransisco liberal elites are already planning on spending millions of dollars to make sure they have a yes man like Jared Golden representing the hard-working people of northern Maine. Maine doesn’t need, and quite frankly can’t afford, another two years of Jared Golden doing Nancy Pelosi’s bidding.
So here’s the deal. While Nancy Pelosi, Janet Mills and Jared Golden are busy shutting down businesses and applying one set of rules for them and another for you, we need your help. Can you pitch in $5, $10, $25, $100, or even $500 today? Every single dollar counts. This race is one of the most important in the country. Your donation could be the very one that puts Dale over the top on November 3rd.
I have had the honor to get to know Maine people. Honestly, they remind me a lot of Texans - tough, proud, and hard-working. We need Dale to bring Maine values to Washington and I’m asking for your help.

Sara Gideon accepts $4 million BRIBE
Gideon has already raised the most out-of-state $ in Maine history, yet still accepted funding intended to bribe Senator Collins
Gideon has track record of campaign ethics violations & backing special interests
Clear example of a bribe: $ offered in exchange for a vote
Members of the press:
Today, Sara Gideon showed that her vote is for sale to the highest bidder. She accepted a $4 million pot of money that was originally intended to sway Senator Collins’ vote… in other words, a bribe.
Click here to watch our video on Gideon auctioning her vote off to the highest bidder.
Click here to watch our video about Gideon taking the bribe.
Collins rejected the bribe, a fund originally established by an out-of-state, dark money group, because her vote is not for sale.
Check out the definition of bribery in U.S. code:
2041\. BRIBERY OF PUBLIC OFFICIALS
Section 201 of Title 18 is entitled ""Bribery of public officials and witnesses."" The statute comprises two distinct offenses, however, and in common parlance only the first of these is true ""bribery.""
The first offense, codified in section 201(b), prohibits the giving or accepting of anything of value to or by a public official, if the thing is given ""with intent to influence"" an official act, or if it is received by the official ""in return for being influenced.""
That’s exactly what happened here. A fund was established to try and bribe Senator Collins to vote against the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. If the Senator voted no, the money would be returned to the donors, but if she voted YES, the money would be donated to Collins’ future Democratic opponent.
Sara Gideon became the nominee Tuesday and she rushed to take the money as soon as she could; her vote was SOLD to the highest bidder.
It’s no surprise, however - Gideon has a long track record of hypocrisy, campaign ethics violations and backing special interests.
Of course, the three groups that raised the money are all dark money groups and any reporting on this bribe should report its origins as such.
If Sara Gideon was concerned about taking this bribe for any reason, she would have rejected it. But she kept it, and it’ll be spent on her false TV ads and out-of-state staffers.

"Alex,
Since Sara Gideon moved to Maine from Rhode Island 16 years ago, she’s worked hard to restrict your 2nd Amendment rights and implement Michael Bloomberg’s gun control agenda ever since. She’s been unsuccessful thus far, so now, she wants to take her agenda to the US Senate, where she promises to fight to change our country, our culture and our heritage.
During her time as Speaker of the Maine House of Representatives, Sara Gideon made gun control her ‘absolute top priority’, regularly projecting her Rhode Island values on our rural state. She took money from Michael Bloomberg’s gun control groups, and she (unsuccessfully) carried their water in Augusta.
Recently, Sara Gideon was endorsed by Bloomberg’s Everytown for Gun Safety group, and just last week, she served as the keynote speaker at a digital Moms Demand Action event, where she exposed her extreme agenda.
A recording of the event can be found here.
If you’re unable to stomach 20 minutes of gun control talk, here’s the major takeaways:
* Gideon thinks HR 8, an extreme gun control proposal, is a ""really good, very strong bill."" This bill, which is essentially Bloomberg’s failed Question 3 referendum from 2016, would make it illegal to TRANSFER firearms, or sell them to your neighbors, without going through an FFL. This means, you would have to pay an FFL to complete a background check to lend a friend a firearm, then pay to complete a background check to get it back, or face jail time. Obviously, this would be an incredible infringement on our rights, and it could potentially make criminals from otherwise law-abiding citizens.
* Gideon doesn’t think that the ""yellow flag"" bill, worked on by Republicans and Democrats last year, was a success. Instead, she favors Bloomberg’s extreme ""red flag"" legislation that is opposed by even members of her own party.
* Gideon supports an expansive ban on so-called ""assault weapons,"" even though it didn’t do anything to deter violent crime in America.
* Gideon wants to hand the gavel, and control of the Senate, over to her benefactor, Chuck Schumer, so they can pass gun control laws and change our country.
The bottom line is, Sara Gideon is an extreme gun control activist who is far to the left, even of her own party. Her agenda is to make Maine, and our nation, more like Rhode Island. We must spread the word that a vote for Sara Gideon is a vote for Michael Bloomberg.

We all know Sara Gideon is as far left as it gets. In Augusta, she's pushed tax hikes, gun grabs, and even called Republicans ""terrorists.""
But how many people know the REAL Sara Gideon.
Watch our new video below to learn more about ""Maine's Special Speaker"".

"CORRUPT GOVERNMENT: Gideon’s refusal to bring lawmakers back shields her from Ethics determination and fine
AUGUSTA – Today on the 100th day of Speaker Sara Gideon sitting on her hands while Maine suffers, a story central to the accountability of Gideon and her terrible record of violating campaign finance laws is being overlooked.
Amid the lack of Legislative oversight on Governor Mills’ failed decisions during the COVID-19 crisis it has also become clear that Sara Gideon has a conflict: by not ordering Legislators to return to Augusta she is shielding herself from a full ethics investigation, determination, and fine.
Doctor Demi Kouzounas filed a request for investigation with the Maine Ethics Commission noting Gideon failed to disclose more than $3,200 in spending from her corporate funded PAC to promote herself in ads raising her profile and attacking her future opponent, U.S. Senator Susan Collins.
The violation investigation request demonstrates that, in total, the ads Gideon failed to disclose to the Maine Ethics Commission garnered more than 500,000 impressions on Facebook, funded with corporate money.
The spending was discovered through Facebook’s ad library feature, which showed Gideon’s Leadership PAC had run the ads, but the spending never appeared in Gideon’s legally required finance reports. The corporate-funded PAC was then closed out as Gideon launched her U.S. Senate campaign as she claimed to oppose corporate PAC money.
Now, Gideon’s continued refusal to bring the Maine Legislature back into session is providing her a shield from the investigation and penalties for the violation.
The Maine Ethics Commission has five Members. However it has been operating with only three Commissioners as it awaits the confirmation of two more Commissioners already nominated by Gov. Janet Mills. Mills announced those nominations on February 28th and the nominations were placed on file in the Maine Senate on March 3rd. Until those nominations are confirmed, the Commission only has three commissioners, the bare minimum needed for a quorum to conduct business.
However, just about 24 hours before a June 24th hearing, one of those existing Commissioners, Meri Lowry, suddenly announced she would be recusing herself from the Gideon hearing. Lowry had previously recused herself from another Gideon ethics violation hearing, disclosing she had donated to Gideon’s campaign. In this instance, Lowry also said she had been making small donations to the campaign of Gideon’s attorney, Ben Grant, who is running for Maine House.
The recusal move suddenly denied the Commission the necessary quorum to take up and determine the violation against Gideon. Gideon is now continuing to shield herself from the consequences of her illegal actions by simply refusing to bring the Maine Legislature back, effectively denying the Commission a quorum to impose a violation and fine.
""The Maine Ethics Commission has already found Sara Gideon guilty once,"" said Doctor Demi Kouzounas. ""Now, every day that passes with Sara Gideon ignoring the needs of the Maine people, she shields herself from accountability for her illegal violation.""
""Denying the Ethics Commission enough members to investigate her advertising scheme is the latest in what appears to be a very, very crooked pattern of behavior,"" said Doctor Kouzounas.

"Alex,
We need you to help us stop Sara Gideon. She’s debating Sen. Susan Collins at 7pm on Friday.
We wanted to give you a heads up so you can tune into the debate, and we also want to ask that you do one very important thing:
When the debate starts, please fire up Facebook and comment on the debate live stream about your opposition to Sara Gideon.
Your neighbors need to know about Sara Gideon because we can’t afford to have her in the Senate.
When you comment, make sure you include arguments like:
* Gideon’s plans to hike taxes on heating oil.
* Her family business dodging taxes while Gideon was raising her neighbors’ taxes on Freeport town council.
* The millions of dollars from out of state progressive defund the police groups Gideon is receiving.
* Gideon’s Rhode Island progressive agenda.
NewsCenter, the Press Herald, and the Bangor Daily News are hosting the debate, so pick a Facebook page and weigh in. Each group will be live streaming on its Facebook - and the comments will all be from out of state progressives if Maine’s Republicans don’t get in there and set the record straight.
Again, Friday at 7pm please log on to Facebook during the U.S. Senate debate and help us set the record straight about Sara Gideon!
Thanks for all you do,

ANOTHER GIDEON CAMPAIGN LAW VIOLATION: CANDIDATE ELECTIONEERING AT POLLS
AUGUSTA, ME--  Today Sara Gideon was seen in a video directly violating state election law.
The video shows Gideon and her staff handing out her campaign signs within 250 feet of the entrance to the Presque Isle polling location - a clear violation of laws designed to protect the integrity of the election process.
Today’s violation is only the latest example of Gideon breaking election laws. She was also recently found guilty of violating campaign finance and ethics laws with an illegal campaign donation, and California hedge fund billionaire Tom Steyer was recently caught giving far more than the maximum allowable donation to Gideon’s campaign.
Gideon’s election law violation at the polls in Presque Isle today should be swiftly investigated by Secretary of State Matt Dunlap. Poll wardens statewide should also beware of more illegal activity by Gideon’s campaign.
Here’s the relevant state law:
2\. Influence prohibited. On public property within 250 feet of the entrance to the voting place as well as within the voting place itself, a person may not:
A. Influence another person's decision regarding a candidate for an office or question that is on the ballot for the election that day; or [PL 2019, c. 371, §21 (AMD).]
B. Attempt to influence another person's decision regarding a candidate for an office or question that is on the ballot for the election that day. [PL 2019, c. 371, §21 (AMD).]

Alex,
I thought I've seen it all, but the Maine Dems have really outdone themselves this time.
Right now, they are spending massive amounts of money on a mailer criticizing Col. Duncan Milne, Republican Candidate for Senate District 11, for serving 25 years in the United States Marine Corps.

Maine Democrat Mailer Attacks Colonel Duncan Milne,
Maine Senate Candidate, For Military Service
Maine Democrats are attacking Republican State Senate candidate and retired Marine Colonel Duncan Milne for his military service.
Attacking a retired Colonel or any Mainer who has moved out of state to serve our nation, and then moved home to Maine, is despicable.
Maine Democrats are so scared of losing their majority in the Maine Senate that they have stooped to a new low by attacking active service members, veterans, and their families for moving away to serve our nation.
Below is the absurd attack mailer they sent out to households across Waldo County where Col. Milne is running for State Senate. To read our full response, click here.
We want to send a clear message to Colonel Milne, and all members and families of the Armed Forces to know we support them. Can you help us send this message today?
With less than 60 days, the time to get our message out is now.

"Dear Alex,
Right now, there are almost two dozen House districts in Maine that we are within striking distance of winning in November .
In many of these districts, the Democrat incumbent sponsored a bill to raise your tax on heating oil and gasoline by 40 cents per gallon!
Maybe these Democrats are unaware that heating oil is a life or death issue for Mainers, or that 40 cents per gallon tax on gasoline would destroy the bank accounts of the people they represent. Either way, it is clear these Democrats are more interested in squeezing every penny out of Maine people to fund their extreme agenda than keeping Mainers safe during our harsh winters.
That's right, despite having some of the lowest emission rates and harshest winters in the country, and their constituents constantly pushing back on this insane tax increase, these Democrats have continued to push their extreme agenda and expect YOU to pay for it.
It is simply wrong.
In most of the other districts, these Democrats also voted to provide illegal immigrants coming into Maine full welfare benefits, including cash.
Once again, while some Maine families are struggling to put food on the table for their families, we are welcoming an additional strain on our resources to law-breaking immigrants instead of taking care of the Maine families who are already struggling. These welfare benefits were not just going to go to people who were stuck in the immigration process - they voted to give it to anyone who said they would apply.
Our team is working around the clock to defeat Democrats on all fronts. We are on the airwaves, in the media, and dominating on the streets and in the field. Our team has already made over a million voter contacts and we are growing every day. But our work is NOT done yet if we want to flip the Maine House.
We have momentum, but we need to drive these wins home. We need to raise another $9,800 to do a full court press in these races, including targeted digital ads in these districts through election day. This will help us reach critical undecided voters in these districts that will decide these races and ultimately decide if we flip the Maine House in November.
Please chip in anything you are able to right NOW by clicking this link to help us get the word out in these districts. Any donation you make will go to reaching hundreds more voters in these key districts.
Every $25 or $50 we raise helps us reach hundreds more voters again. A couple hundred dollars can cover several days of digital advertising in an entire district!
Please make your most generous donation now to help us take back the Maine Legislature and put an end to this harmful, destructive agenda!

MAINE GOP STATEMENT ON PRESIDENT TRUMP'S HISTORIC USMCA TRADE DEAL
AUGUSTA, ME-- Maine GOP Chair Demi Kouzounas issued the following statement today on the United States Mexico Canada Agreement going into effect,
""Today, the United States Mexico Canada Agreement (USMCA), President Trump’s signature renegotiation of the failed NAFTA agreement, will go into effect. This is a critical program for our country with the potential to raise our GDP by $235 billion, and add close to 600,000 jobs across the nation.
""Despite Jared Golden, Nancy Pelosi, and Congressional Democrats' best attempts to delay this crucial program for more than a year, President Trump got the deal done.
""Here in Maine, our agricultural industry has always been important, and under the USMCA we can expect a $2.2 billion increase in food exports. Maine’s potato and blueberry industries have always been an important part of our history, in 2018 Maine exported $247 million in agricultural products, and with the USMCA we can expect these crops and sales to grow even more.""
Chair Kouzounas concluded, ""Because of President Trump, Maine businesses finally have fair trade again. We simply cannot afford to let Joe Biden back in D.C. where he could continue to craft policies that would harm our state and nation for another fifty years.""

""It should come as no surprise that Chuck Schumer's hand-picked candidate won the primary"" said Chair Dr. Demi Kouzounas. ""Considering Sara Gideon's D.C. run campaign has been flooded with out-of-state money and staff, the primary was never even a fair fight.""
""While Democrats attempt to paint Speaker Sara Gideon as a strong candidate, it could not be further from the truth. From refusing to bring back the legislature to deal with the economic damage of COVID-19 and bring Mainers relief, to numerous ethics violations, and criticizing the Paycheck Protection Program while her husband's law firm received millions in loans to save his business, Sara Gideon has more baggage than Logan International Airport.""
""Mainers want more than endless sappy T.V. ads paid for by out-of-state mega donors, they want results. While Senator Collins has worked tirelessly to pass legislation that saved over 240,00 Maine jobs, Sara Gideon stayed home and left Mainers in the lurch.

DID WE LOSE YOUR SUPPORT????
Democrats just reported nearly $100,000,000 more cash on hand just DAYS out from the election. Hitting our goal just became our last chance to WIN BIG on November 3rd.
We need every single Pro-Trump Patriot -- including you -- to step up ASAP. If you agree to help before midnight, your contribution will be 700% matched:
>> Deadline Approaching <<
700% Match: $500 → $3,500 Impact

700% Match: $50 → $350 Impact

As of a few moments ago, we’re behind by 320 contributions.
We are out of time. Election Day is less than 48 hours away.
Without your (700% matched) support, we’ll miss our deadline AND risk everything we’ve accomplished under the leadership of President Trump.
Onward,
Newt Gingrich

STAND WITH TRUMP
I just found out from the latest FEC reports that Liberals have a massive -- and I mean MASSIVE -- fundraising lead on us heading into the most important hours of the entire election.
I’m asking all dedicated Conservatives for help. Our country needs you, and I arranged a temporary 700% donation match if you act now.
PITCH IN $500 = $3,500
PITCH IN $250 = $1,750
PITCH IN $100 = $700
PITCH IN $50 = $350
PITCH IN $25 = $175
With Liberals still MAXING OUT this late in the game, it is absolutely essential that we meet our goal before the midnight deadline.
I know it’s ambitious, but this is what it’s going to take to win.
This needs to be our top priority. Right now we’re still 925 contributions short.
All these top Conservatives and I are coming to you for help. Can you pitch in any amount to help put us over the edge? 700% matching is active now.

Fellow Conservative,
Our backs are against the wall, and we’re in a dire position. Democrats are fighting tooth and nail to flip Senate seats in Colorado, Maine, North Carolina, Iowa, and Arizona this year. They just need 4 to win back the Majority!
The Democrat Machine hasn’t slowed down ANY of their efforts – so why should we?
Resources are still needed to recruit volunteers, ensure we have the needed staff, and keep our ads on the air in these final hours. Republicans are facing an uphill challenge against well-funded, far-left Democrats handpicked by Chuck Schumer. Grassroots conservatives like YOU are the only thing that stands in their way.
I need you to rush in a 6X-MATCHED donation right now and help us keep must-win states red AND help stop a left-wing takeover.
My father’s allies and I have reached out to you many times throughout this election cycle, and you have been a crucial supporter.
Now in the final stretch, I have requested one last 6X-MATCHING extension for you because I know you won’t let Republicans down.
MAKE A $25 6X-MATCHED DONATION
MAKE A $50 6X-MATCHED DONATION
MAKE A $75 6X-MATCHED DONATION
MAKE A $150 6X-MATCHED DONATION
MAKE A $250 6X-MATCHED DONATION
MAKE A 6X-MATCHED DONATION NOW
These FINAL hours are our last opportunity to stop a Democrat takeover. The Left has smashed fundraising records – raising over a billion dollars in a matter of months.
The future of the Senate, White House, Supreme Court, and our country are on the line. You can’t wait another moment – rush a 6X MATCHED donation before it’s too late!
Thank you for your support in these final moments of the election season.
Donald Trump Jr.

URGENT: This just became the most expensive Senate race in Arizona’s history
Fellow Conservative,
This is a gut punch.
My leftist opponent has raised $38.7 MILLION in the 3rd quarter and a total of $83 MILLION for the campaign so far. Leftist radicals have been pouring money into his campaign because they know that he’ll be a rubberstamp for the left-wing agenda.
This level of spending is unprecedented. Democrats know that turning Arizona blue will hand them control of the Senate Majority for years to come.
Joe Biden and Chuck Schumer have made Arizona central to their 2020 strategy. We MUST close this gap now to have any chance of keeping Arizona red. Pitch in now to stop the Democrat takeover.
We don’t have much time left until Election Day.
I’m depending on you. We need to send a LOUD message to the left that Arizona and the Senate is NOT for sale. Will you help me? Pitch in before it’s too late!

Democrats raised over $1.5 BILLION last Quarter, and Senate Republicans just made ourselves their top target with this week’s confirmation vote. Can we count on you to rush a donation right now to help defend our Senate Majority?
Fellow Conservative,
First, I want to sincerely say thank YOU. My Senate colleagues and I were only able to ensure a conservative majority on the Supreme Court and confirm Justice Barrett because of your incredible support.

Chuck Schumer is already considering plans to pack the Court with liberal activists in response to Justice Amy Coney Barrett’s confirmation if he wins control of the Majority in November. We can’t sit back now – the Senate and Supreme Court are still in danger of a Democrat takeover.

Your support is essential to continuing this fight to the end. Can you pitch in $25, $50, $70, or any amount before midnight tonight to defend the Senate?

BREAKING NEWS: President Trump is campaigning in Arizona today
Fellow Conservative,
Democrats have admitted that Arizona is the key to the Senate Majority and the White House. Joe Biden’s campaign manager even said, “if we win Arizona, we will win the presidency.”
Now, President Trump is coming to Arizona, and we need to show we have the momentum to defend this battleground. Joe Biden launched a massive ad blitz and more ads are running in Phoenix, Arizona than any market in the nation!
We set a goal to raise $15O,OOO by midnight tonight so we can keep Arizona RED! Can you help? Pitch in to our Battleground Fund to help hold the Senate and the White House.
My opponent has endorsed Joe Biden and was endorsed by his running mate Kamala Harris. He has raked in $38.7 million last Quarter and is one of the best-funded Democrats in the nation.
We are less than 1 week from Election Day, and millions will be poured into Arizona to turn it and the Senate blue. Can you help me fight back? Donate ANY amount to help me reach this important goal!
We are hanging by a thread right now. We’ve been outraised and outspent, but this race is still a dead heat. Democrats think their massive war chest can turn this battleground blue. We need to send a LOUD message and show we’re ready to fight!
Don’t be a bystander this election. This is the top battleground and if you don’t defend this must-win state, Democrats will have a path to taking the White House and Senate. Pitch in now to stop a liberal takeover and help us reach our $150K goal!

McSally for Senate
Fellow Conservative,
URGENT: Ratings change Arizona from LEAN DEMOCRAT to TOSS UP. It’s Election Day, and Arizona’s Senate race is the most competitive race in the entire country.
You have one last opportunity to make an impact on this race before all the ballots are cast, and I need you now more than ever. Will you rush ANY AMOUNT now to defend this must-win battleground?
National Democrats need FOUR seats to take the Senate. While my opponent has hid from voters, powerful liberal special interests and Chuck Schumer’s Super PAC have tried to buy this seat.
We were outraised. We were outspent 2:1. Despite this, we are at a TIE. This race could be decided by a few thousand votes, and it’s vital we have the resources to WIN today!
Last chance – will you help keep Arizona and the Senate red?
RUSH A DONATION
The future of our country is on the line. If Democrats flip Arizona, they almost certainly will capture the Senate.
They’ve promised to make Republicans pay for confirming Justice Barrett, and if they take the Senate, they will pass the most radical agenda in American history.
It’s all up to you. I can’t do this alone – will you stand with me in these final hours and help us fight back? Rush any amount now >>
Thank you for your support.

Arizona is central to the Democrats’ plan to take the White House and Senate. After we confirmed Justice Amy Coney Barrett, National Democrats, liberal megadonors, and dark money groups all turned their attention to flipping this battleground state and handing control to the Radical Left.

As you're probably well-aware, Democrats from liberal states have poured money into battlegrounds like Arizona, Maine, North Carolina, and Colorado in the hopes of flipping the Senate blue this year.

Fellow Conservative, I’m about to start my next meeting, so I’ll make this quick.
A few months ago, I couldn’t imagine Democrats being competitive in states like Iowa or Georgia. But today, I’m looking at Democratic fundraising numbers for Republican-held seats across the board and see huge amounts of out-of-state donations and negative ad buys by national far-Left groups.
Will you rush resources to help defend our must-win states? 6X-MATCHING is unlocked to help Senate Republicans in these critical final hours.
Democrats are angry, emboldened and determined to flip the Senate and put Schumer as Majority Leader. Then they can enact their far-left agenda, ELIMINATE the filibuster, and pack the Supreme Court with their own far-left activist nominee.
Can Senate Republicans count on you to make a 6X-MATCHED donation to stop a liberal takeover before it's too late?
DONATE BEFORE THE DEADLINE!
RUSH $25O NOW
RUSH $15O NOW
RUSH $75 NOW
RUSH $5O NOW
RUSH $25 NOW
We must take this all seriously. Schumer and his allies are INCREDIBLY well-funded. It’ll be a fight to the end to stop them. That’s why I’m asking if we can count on you right now?
Before I sign off, let me remind you what all is on the line. We’re fighting to defend the White House AND protect our Senate Majority. This is the only way to protect the values that make our country great.
Today, your donation could make a MAJOR difference in stopping them from achieving what Barack Obama only dreamed of doing for their side. Do your part and rush a 6X-MATCHED donation NOW to President Trump’s Senate allies!
Thank you,
Karl Rove

With less than 24 hours until the FINAL deadline before Election Day, Joe Biden, Chuck Schumer, Kamala Harris, and the rest of the radical left have amassed the biggest campaign war chest we’ve ever seen.
ALERT: FINAL END OF MONTH DEADLINE IN LESS THAN 24 HRS
Fellow Conservative,
I hate to admit this, but money makes all the difference in the final stretch of the election. More resources mean keeping ads on the air, more doors knocked, more calls made, and so much more.
This year’s elections are shaping up to be the most expensive and most hard-fought battle in our nation’s history.
With less than 24 hours until the FINAL deadline before Election Day, Joe Biden, Chuck Schumer, Kamala Harris, and the rest of the radical left have amassed the biggest campaign war chest we’ve ever seen.
Their numbers easily top $1 BILLION – all of which goes towards funding the most radical Democrat ticket in the history of our country.
Every Republican understands that no amount of money can buy the American people's trust and support.
But to be totally transparent, we need close the fundraising gap. If we do not, we could lose it all. We cannot surrender the future of our country to the radical left!
That’s why for the next 24 hours, a group of generous donors agreed to 6X MATCH all contributions to help Senate Republicans before the FINAL End of Month deadline before Election Day! Make a 6X-MATCHED gift now >>
MAKE A $500 CONTRIBUTION
MAKE A $250 CONTRIBUTION
MAKE A $150 CONTRIBUTION
MAKE A $70 CONTRIBUTION
MAKE A $50 CONTRIBUTION
MAKE A $30 CONTRIBUTION
No matter the amount, any contribution directly helps President Trump’s Senate Republican allies. Your contribution will have 6X THE IMPACT to help reach the final End of Month goal.
So, what are you waiting for? Protect Conservatives with a 6X-MATCHED donation now!
Thanks for your support,
Sarah Huckabee Sanders

Without the support of folks like you before our FINAL End of Month fundraising deadline tomorrow, we'll come up short. Without resources to win, we’re powerless to stop Democrats from achieving the most radical agenda in the history of their party.
Socialized medicine…
Open borders…
A Green New Deal…
Removing sanctions on Iran, China, and Russia…
Trillion-dollar tax hikes on the middle class…
A liberal majority of activist judges on the Supreme Court…
Fellow Conservative, I’m worried that these far-left ambitions could come true if we don’t act quickly.

McSally for Senate
Fellow Conservative,
Once news of the Supreme Court vacancy broke, millions of dollars flooded into my opponent’s campaign war chest from National Democrat donors. They saw Mark Kelly as their best chance to block now Justice Amy Coney Barrett’s confirmation.
When they failed at stopping us, my decisive YES vote enraged them! Since then, they’ve turned their attention to flipping Arizona and capturing the Senate for good.
They want payback and control of the Senate will come down to Arizona.
We have less than 24 hours until Election Day, and I need your immediate help to keep this must-win battleground state RED. I’m humbly asking you to chip in what you can in these final days to ensure we can defend Arizona and the Senate.
If we lose the Senate, Democrats have promised to “make us pay.” That means packing the Supreme Court with liberal activists and changing Senate rules to ram through the most liberal agenda in American history!
And that’s just the beginning.
This nightmare could become our reality if you don’t act today to stop them. Help defend Arizona and stop a liberal takeover this November!
I’ll be candid with you. We’re being outraised and outspent in battleground states -- by 2:1 in some cases. Our last and best hope is defending Arizona, but right now, we need an immediate surge of support.
Don’t regret sitting out the most consequential election of our lifetime. Rush ANY amount before it’s too late!

Democrats are angry. They’ve already drawn up their playbook to push through the most radical agenda in our country’s history if they win control of the Senate.
They need just 4 Republican seats to flip to put Schumer in charge -- Arizona is at the top of the list.
NOW is the time to take a stand. The final days of a campaign are critical, even a small contribution can make a huge difference. Don’t sit this election out! Pitch in to keep Arizona and the Senate red!

Republicans have only days left -- not weeks -- before we close the books on our FINAL DEADLINE of the election… and we’re dangerously behind our fundraising goal!
This would be the worst possible time to fail and let the President down.
So Mike Pence, Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump, Newt Gingrich, and SO MANY OTHERS are personally asking for your help. Steve Scalise even managed to arrange a 650% contribution match through midnight, specifically for you.
As of a few moments ago we still need 2,196 matched donations. Anything less than that would be a serious problem.

"Alex,
A quick update – this past weekend a group of Republican leaders from around the state sat down at our office in Augusta to work on bringing the best candidates we can find to the ballot in 2020 and bring the destructive agenda of Janet Mills and Democrats to a stop in 2020.
Speaker Sara Gideon is running for U.S. Senate but still in charge of the Maine House - she has a history of questionable ethics as Speaker, was recently fined for violating ethics laws and faces additional charges before the FEC.
Last week a story broke showing that Senate President Troy Jackson had been personally paid $20-$25k by the parent organization of a union seeking a dispute with Bath Iron Works. While Sen. Jackson was still on their payroll, he sent BIW a letter threatening to reconsider a tax credit unless they did what the group paying him wanted. He used his official government position to advance the cause of an organization that was paying him.
You know who signed that letter with Troy Jackson? Shady Sara Gideon.
Shady Sara and Tricky Troy, at it again. It’s not like this is the first time. Shady Sara Gideon appointed a Representative to chair the legislature’s Taxation Committee who literally had just been paid by a special interest committee to support a tax increase.
But back to our plans and our meeting. Our meeting in Augusta was amazing for a several reasons – here are a couple:
1) The incredible unity and sense of purpose every single member of our team has in restoring sanity to Maine state government.
2) The reports of the superb candidates coming out to run for House and Senate as Republicans.
As part of our work, we need to help the Maine House and Senate Republicans right now. Their recruitment can only pay off if supporters around the state help them support those candidates.
We have created a joint fundraising form where your donation can be divided among the House, Senate and Maine GOP as we work, day and night, to take Maine back from the extreme left.
Tricky Troy and Shady Sara will march into the future thinking they can keep getting away with this type of unethical behavior if they don’t lose elections because of it.
We have strong candidates. We have a united front of leaders around the state. We have a plan to stop Janet Mills in her tracks and win back seats across the state.
No more gas and heating oil tax increases. No more ridiculous job-killing regulations. No more welfare for illegal immigrants. No more ridiculous bans on anything they can dream up. No more taxpayer funded abortions and special interest spending while our elderly and disabled are left on waiting lists.
We have a plan to win. Do we have you?
If you want to help the Maine House Republicans, Maine Senate Republicans and Maine GOP as we work to recruit, train and run strong candidates to defeat the Democrats, please go here and chip in whatever amount you can. Your donation will be divided evenly and go toward the most important efforts we all have going.
We’re doing really well right now, but need to keep the momentum going. You can help by donating here, whatever you can, right now.
Thank you for all that you do.
Sincerely,
Dr. Demi Kouzounas

"Alex,
You have probably noticed we have been somewhat quiet on Governor Mills’ recent orders that asked, then directed Maine people to stay home in the past few weeks. To be clear, we believed that in such a time of crisis, too much political communication around the COVID-19 issue might cause confusion and harm and that it was important for public health information not be filtered through a partisan lens.
Instead, we left the White House and Governor Mills’ administration to relay most information directly to you through the daily communications they have provided.
We have been patiently watching and hoping for the best.
After what we saw from Governor Mills last week when she announced her stay home order extension with confusing and to some, destructive, new restrictions, I can only imagine the stress many of you are feeling. I am personally sharing your pain, having been forced to close both of my dental practices and furlough 30 employees.
Then yesterday we learned there was a new committee being formed that would issue a final report by December 1 – but Maine’s economy is in crisis right now.
Nobody wants to see harm befall anyone, from this virus or anything else.
Unfortunately, our opinion on the new restrictions and muddled, broken roll out of the Governor’s reopening plan is that the damage being done to Maine’s economy will create many new problems, some of them permanent.
Rather than slowly bringing our economy back to normal, we are seeing Maine be driven through a complicated maze of confusing new restrictions toward a ""new normal"" imagined by a small group of individuals in Augusta.
The ""new normal"" we are on the path toward is one of crushing poverty, higher rates of drug addiction, domestic violence and government dependence.
Governor Mills’ plan has no clearly defined goals to work toward. The people of Maine are not being told what our goals for a full reopening are, or when it might happen. We are not being told what data the state is relying upon to make decisions, and the Maine CDC is refusing to release town-by-town data on confirmed COVID-19 cases.
Mainers always pull together in times of crisis to help those in our own communities. We can accomplish amazing things when given a clear goal and the proper information. But we have not been provided clear goals or consistent data to reach any goal as of today.
For all the talk about relying upon science, Maine’s current ""plan"" is shockingly lacking in actual science. It feels more like hysteria is masquerading as science.
Maine people have been denied vital health care such as restorations to fix broken teeth, surgeries, counseling and many, many other services. Our places of healing have been closed - yet abortion clinics have continued operating.
Child abuse reports are reportedly in sharp decline, but we know so many families are under greater distress right now than they were before this all began.
Church doors are locked by mandate of the state and no options are available for them to open their doors.
As you read this, two Maine hospitals teeter on the verge of bankruptcy and other hospitals across the state have furloughed large numbers of workers. Those two hospitals on the verge of bankruptcy are in rural areas mostly untouched by the virus and with the most need.
Virtually any place Mainers usually can go for spiritual, physical or emotional health and healing is unable to open and help them.
The very human, very real impact of our state economy being shut down is just beginning to come into view.
Now, we are seeing Maine’s government, just as it botched the response to Maine’s unemployment crisis leaving tens of thousands with no regular income, also struggle to manage and implement the so-called ""reopening"" of Maine.
The plan lacks clear goals. It is heavy on vague ideas for the future and lacking in actionable data. While it relies heavily on saying the plan ""contemplates"" things in the future, it’s clear that it did not adequately contemplate the implementation of phase 1 or the scope of damage to Maine’s economy.
Aside from the illogical decision making and potential destruction of tens of thousands of small businesses, the actual process of opening some businesses is nearly impossible. This process needs to be completely overhauled. Even in dentistry, there are no guidelines on how to reopen and no help on acquiring PPEs, even as many of us donated our reserves to nursing homes and other facilities in need.
There are over 250,000 small businesses in Maine and we recently learned only a few hundred have been approved to reopen almost a week after this new process began.
Instead of issuing standard safety protocols for all businesses in an industry to follow, Maine DECD is requiring businesses to go through a bureaucratic process that will overwhelm the department while Maine’s economy continues to struggle. This is wrong!
You do not need a doctorate in public administration to see that this system can’t possibly be managed in a fair or efficient manner for tens of thousands of small businesses across Maine.
Some of our fellow Mainers are now in their second month of restrictions, loss of income and loss of freedom despite the data showing their region has little to no problems with COVID-19.
I have no doubt that if there was an outbreak in one of these rural counties, Governor Mills would not have shut down Portland – so it stands to reason that the opposite should also be true.
This message, however, is not just a list of grievances about Maine’s response to COVID-19. It is also a call to action for Governor Janet Mills, Speaker Sara Gideon, Senate President Troy Jackson, all other lawmakers and you, the people of Maine.
We urge the following, either through actions taken by Governor Janet Mills or through a reconvening of our Legislature in a bipartisan manner:
- Hit the reset button on the complicated, unworkable four phase plan announced by Gov. Janet Mills.
- Clearly articulate goals for Maine to fully reopen and publish the corresponding data at Maine CDC website to allow the public to monitor progress.
- Allow for county level regional re-openings in rural counties that have low COVID-19 rates.
- Reopen health care, counseling facilities and houses of worship with social distancing requirements as soon as possible statewide; and yes that includes dental offices.
- Scrap the individual business approval process through Maine DECD and allow all businesses to open on an industry-wide basis when approved. Do not allow the application and ""checklist"" process to pick winners and losers.
- Adopt a general principle of trust in the people and small businesses of Maine to function in a safe and healthy manner; we are after all Mainers.
- Adopt a general principle that a balance must be found between allowing Maine people to make a living while we work through the COVID-19 pandemic.
- Adopt a general principle that our goal is a return to normal, not a ""new normal"" chosen by Governor Janet Mills and Dr. Nirav Shah. A complete return to normal need not happen tomorrow, but a return to normal is not something that can be denied on the whims or vision of a select few in Augusta.
- Add resources to expedite unemployment claims, there are no excuses for the delay of critical help to the neediest in our state. We have seen enough of this disaster. If we have to hire people to sit in a room and hand write the checks to get people some help, let’s do it.
Freedom matters. The power of government has been brutally efficient in destroying jobs across Maine and woefully inadequate in delivering assistance to those whose jobs have been destroyed.
We hope Governor Mills would take a more balanced and straightforward approach than what we have seen and restore a balance for the good of Maine.
The time is now to speak out to Speaker Sara Gideon, Senate President Troy Jackson and Governor Janet Mills and call for a reset of the complicated mess that has been created. Our Maine Legislature should reconvene and work to create a more balanced reopening plan that allows our people to heal, work and help one another in a safe manner!

"Alex,
Even though we are all dealing with the COVID-19 Pandemic, the amount of fellowship and concern for our neighbors is so apparent in our State of Maine. As a state where the economy is mostly run by small businesses and employs the majority of people, and the largest private employers are MaineHealth, Hannaford and Walmart, all I can say is we should be proud.
I also feel that our top officials have done a great job with this crisis and are working together well.
However, we still need to deal with RCV and the November elections which will re-elect our President.
We are well over half-way to our goal of collecting the signatures needed to stop RCV, thanks to our incredible team of volunteers. But the path before us is more challenging than anticipated.
As you may know, many government deadlines have recently been changed. However, there is one deadline which has not been moved back: the deadline to repeal Ranked Choice Voting for Presidential elections.
Despite recent events, we must press ahead in our efforts to repeal Ranked Choice Voting, which seeks to upend this year’s Presidential election.
The developing coronavirus situation caused the Legislature, led by Sara Gideon and Troy Jackson, to adjourn a month early. Although this decision may not have had anything to do with our effort, I am sure that Speaker Gideon and President Jackson are not unhappy that we now must turn in our 63,000 signatures a full month earlier than planned.
Don’t forget, adding presidential elections to Ranked Choice Voting was Troy Jackson’s bill, backed by liberal special interests, and the focus of this people’s veto and repeal effort.
We have to finish and get the remaining signatures we need and with your help we will.
Your help collecting signatures has been incredible and humbling to me personally, and I thank you.
Our new plan takes us on the road, going to the voters and taking the necessary precautions to get the thousands and thousands of signatures we still need. This takes time and is much more expensive.
Help me meet this new challenge. Contribute here, now.
As I wrote last week, this effort is a central, critical piece of our mission for the entire 2020 election effort.
We are fighting the extreme, out-of-state special interests who will do anything they can to keep Ranked Choice Voting in place for Maine’s presidential election this year. They are happy that recent events have made it harder to accomplish and that our deadline is now earlier.
We are on the clock!
President Trump has done a lot for Maine and we are grateful. But it is up to us to stay focused on protecting Maine’s Presidential elections for 2020 and beyond.
Every dollar contributed will help us protect Maine’s presidential election from Ranked Choice Voting.
Please contribute here, now.
Thank you for all that you have done and continue to do. Stay safe and stay healthy.

Click here to see the card and affirm your commitment.
Now, more than ever, the Maine GOP needs to be strong as we take on the battles happening here in Augusta and the larger battle for the soul of America in Washington D.C.
We must support our President this year as he fights for re-election. Never has a President been so assaulted by the media and the political left while he works so hard for the American people. The economy is growing and Americans have more and better jobs to choose from. Our country is safer, the border is being secured and terrorists are being eliminated. Our federal court openings are being filled with judges that will obey the Constitution.
Promises Made, Promises Kept!
Here in Maine, our Republican lawmakers are standing up to Janet Mills’ and Sara Gideon’s radical agenda. But they don’t have the votes to stop every crazy thing Mills and Gideon do. So we are working to strengthen their numbers in the coming election.
We know Mills and Gideon want to raise gas and heating oil taxes. They are pushing to get spending as high as they can get it without even fixing our roads or ending the wait lists of disabled Mainers waiting for services. Instead, they spend on hiring more employees to join the union and funding for taxpayer funded abortion, Planned Parenthood, climate change bureaucrats and more.
We provide critical help to all Republicans.
Door-to-door canvassing. An advanced data operation. Daily communications that support Republicans from the local to national level. Direct assistance to hundreds of candidates and a strong foundation of support that everyone relies on. We are the hub and organizational framework for all of our candidates.
This kind of work is an around-the-clock, seven day a week effort that requires support from Republicans across Maine. Renewing your commitment and becoming a 2020 member of the Maine GOP is one of the ways to support our team and our efforts!
Please, affirm your commitment to the Maine GOP today by going to this link and making your annual membership donation. We will be sure to send you your personalized card in the mail.
As a special bonus, if you affirm your commitment to the Maine GOP today, in any amount, we will drop a brand new, official ""Trump / Pence – Keep America Great 2020"" bumper sticker in the mail with your card.

P.S. On top of all the work I mentioned, and more, in this email, we are also leading the charge to Repeal Ranked Choice Voting with close to 300 volunteers along with our team collecting signatures to put the people’s veto on the 2020 ballot. We don’t do these things because they are easy, we do them because they are hard.

"Alex,
While Democrats fawn over Joe Biden picking Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate, I wanted to provide you with some facts about the REAL Kamala Harris:
KAMALA HARRIS IS LEADING THE CHARGE FOR THE GREEN NEW DEAL: Kamala Harris has teamed up with the most extreme in her party such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC) and ""the squad"" to push ""[[URL REDACTED]] - Recognizing the duty of the Federal Government to create a Green New Deal"". That's right, not only does Kamala Harris support the Green New Deal, but she is working with the most radical members of her party to lead the charge to ensure it is passed. This multi-trillion dollar legislation would kill hundreds of thousands of jobs, ban current forms of transportation such as cars and airplanes, and greatly increase the cost of gas, heating oil and fuels. Simply put, your family just can't afford Kamala Harris.
KAMALA WANTS TO DEFUND OUR POLICE: Despite once being a prosecutor, Kamala Harris is now leading the charge to DEFUND THE POLICE. From referring to law enforcement as the KKK in 2018, to pushing the decriminalization of illegal border crossings, Kamala Harris has shown a complete disregard for the rule-of-law in America. While defunding and abolishing the police may be popular with the un-hinged left, mainstream America supports our law enforcement community. Simply put, our families, streets and communities will be less safe under Kamala Harris.
Right now, we are seeing a massive coordinated misinformation campaign to hide Kamala Harris' true record. That is why we need your help!
There are two ways you can help combat this misinformation campaign:
1) Share this information with your friends right now! Forward this email to 10 or more friends to educate them about the real Kamala Harris.

"But our fight has just begun...
Alex,
THIS IS HUGE! Today, we turned in our signatures to the Maine Secretary of State to put RCV Repeal on the ballot in November, blocking RCV from being used in Maine's Presidential Election!
This is a historic victory. Not only did the Maine GOP and our Army of volunteers overcome a global pandemic, but they also battled a statewide stay-at-home order and government red tape that made collecting nearly impossible.
But our fight has just begun.
Radical left-wing dark money groups have already made it clear they will be exhausting all options to throw out the signatures of the people who signed the Repeal RCV petitions and take away your voice.
That is why we need your help, please click here to chip in to defend these signatures right now.
While liberal lawyers comb through every one of our certified signatures, we need to be ready to fight back to ensure your voices are heard.
These liberal RCV supporters claim they want ""more voice and more choice"" but right now they are gearing up to TAKE AWAY YOUR VOICE AND CHOICE.
Unlike the pro-RCV group fighting us, we do not have access to endless amounts of dark-money to fund our legal team to protect your voice. Can we count on you to make a donation NOW to protect Mainers voices and ensure RCV Repeal will be on the ballot in November? Click here to donate right now to defend these signatures and all this hard work.
This is urgent. We must all fight together to make sure we restore the bedrock principle of ""one person, one vote"" back to our elections.
Thank you for all you do!

PRESS RELEASE
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: June 15, 2020
CONTACT: Jason Savage, [[URL REDACTED]]
MAINE GOP ANNOUNCES REPEAL RCV CAMPAIGN COLLECTED MORE THAN 72,000 SIGNATURES TO PROTECT ONE PERSON, ONE VOTE IN MAINE’S PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS
-More than 72,000 Mainers Signed Petitions to Repeal Ranked Choice Voting in Maine's Presidential Elections
-Collected well beyond minimum required signatures when faced with nearly insurmountable odds
-Only had 64 days of signature gathering instead of what is normally a 90-day period, collecting more than 1,100 signatures per day
-Forbidden to knock on doors, no large gatherings due to pandemic, followed social distancing rules
-Experienced political minds calling achievement ‘unprecedented, historic, amazing’
-More than 315 ‘stop & sign’ events in a three week period
-More than 500 volunteers and circulators
-Signatures gathered from more than 450 cities, towns, townships and plantations across all 16 counties – this is nearly every community in the state
-With virtually every other political deadline in Maine extended, Repeal RCV campaign’s deadline was actually shortened by about a month – specifically targeted by Gov. Mills Executive Order on notaries denying campaign same benefits as others
AUGUSTA, ME-- While facing nearly insurmountable odds and with forces aligning to thwart Maine GOP efforts to collect the necessary signatures to allow the people of Maine to have their voice heard, the Maine GOP today is announcing that the Repeal RCV campaign is submitting well beyond the required number of signatures to ensure repealing Ranked Choice Voting will be on the ballot in November.
""Collecting more than 72,000+ signatures in the midst of a pandemic and statewide lock-down that greatly reduced our capacity to collect signatures is a historic feat,"" said Chair Dr. Demi Kouzounas. ""Completing this task with only 64 days of signature gathering is a true testament to the dedication of our team and amazing volunteers and the amount of energy Mainers have to restore the principle of one person, one vote in our election process.""
The coronavirus pandemic, statewide lock-down, early adjournment of the Maine Legislature, and governmental red-tape created major delays in the collecting process, allowing only 64 days of collecting. Despite the odds stacked against them and numerous roadblocks, over 500 circulators across the political spectrum collected signatures from more than 450 Maine cities, towns, and plantations in all 16 Maine counties.
""Major roadblocks in the signature collection process required our team to completely re-invent the signature gathering process. Due to state restrictions, we were forbidden from knocking doors and unlike other people's veto campaigns, there were no large gatherings,"" said Jason Savage, Executive Director of the Maine GOP.
""While other political deadlines were extended to assist campaigns, our deadline was actually cut shorter by a month due to the early adjournment of their legislature. That meant we had to go into overdrive to make sure the voice of the voters was heard.""
In order to collect the required number of signatures while complying with CDC and State regulations, the Maine Republican Party held more than 315 ""Stop and Sign"" events in a 3 week period, essentially inventing a new signature gathering model and scaling it to unprecedented levels in just days.
With all the burdens and obstacles placed before the campaign, experienced political minds initially called the feat ""unachievable"".
Now that the process is complete, many are calling the accomplishment, ""unprecedented, historic, and amazing.""
""We are proud of our team for completing the signature collecting process and we are now focused on ensuring the People's Veto is successful at the ballot box in November,"" said Jason Savage.
""The People's Veto has always been about restoring the sanctity of our election process, preserving the bedrock American principle of 'one person, one vote' and ensuring that Ranked Choice Voting does not interfere with Maine's Presidential elections.""
BACKGROUND:
After Governor Mills allowed the extension of Ranked Choice Voting to the Presidential Election, the Maine Republican Party launched a ""People's Veto"" to allow Mainers to have their voice heard and return our Presidential Election to the bedrock American principle of ""one person, one vote"".
Maine voters should not be subject to a process that so clearly violates one person, one vote, serves as voter suppression, and puts Maine's votes for President in question.
Our entire nation and the Presidential election should not be subject to a complicated and time-consuming process that could tear Maine apart at the seams.
The promises supporters of ranked-choice voting made – funded with massive amounts of out-of-state-money, have been proven false:
-RCV is NOT a more fair or equal process. It allows some voters to get multiple votes, while some only get one vote.
-RCV does NOT create majority winners. In fact some people’s ballots are ""exhausted"" and thrown out in the counting.
-RCV does NOT make elections more civil or cut down on negative politics.
-RCV does NOT increase participation. In fact, it serves as voter suppression.
-RCV is NOT simple. Maine’s experience shows a much higher rate of voter error and spoiled ballots.
-RCV costs our cities, towns and state more money than traditional elections.
-RCV has already been found unconstitutional in state general elections. Why should we use it anywhere?
By submitting the required number of signatures, the Maine Republican Party has halted the use of Ranked Choice Voting in the 2020 Presidential Election in Maine. The question will be decided on the November ballot.

Senator Collins Seeks Clarification from CDC Director on Reopening Dental Practices
Click HERE to watch Senator Collins’ Q&A with Dr. Redfield. Click HERE to download.
Washington, D.C.—This morning, U.S. Senator Susan Collins relayed to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Robert Redfield the frustration she has heard from dentists across Maine who have been unable to reopen their practices despite following strict infection control protocols. Senator Collins also emphasized the health consequences of dental office closures.
""Dentists tell me that teeth with cavities that could have been filled are now going to need root canals. Teeth that could have been treated with root canals are now going to require extractions. People with oral cancers cannot get the treatment, the cleanings, that they need before beginning their treatment,"" said Senator Collins.
Dental practices in 47 other states have reopened or have a day set to reopen, but official guidance from the CDC has yet to be issued.
""[M]y question to you is this,"" Senator Collins told Dr. Redfield. ""If dentists are following the American Dental Association guidelines; if they’re instituting strict protective measures for their patients, their staffs, their hygienists, and themselves; and if they’re closely examining and seeing a decline in the number of COVID-19 infections in their county, are these reasonable factors for states to consider in reopening the practice of dentistry?""
Dr. Redfield agreed with Senator Collins that it is important to follow the American Dental Association’s guidelines and said that the CDC is working on providing specific guidance for dental practices.
Following today’s hearing, Maine Department of Health and Human Services Commissioner Jeanne Lambrew announced that unless Maine receives updated CDC guidance by May 18th, the state will defer to the recommendations of the American Dental Association and Maine Dental Association.
Senator Collins, a member of the Senate Health Committee, made those comments at a hearing focused on what federal, state and local governments are doing to help Americans go back to work and back to school as rapidly and safely as possible. Today’s hearing featured testimony from officials at HHS—including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

"Alex,
I hope you had a Merry and Wonderful Christmas and that you are preparing for a Happy, Productive New Year.
Here at Maine GOP we have been working very hard to prepare for the upcoming election year. Our plans are in place, our team is growing and we are getting ready to help our ticket secure victories in the most consequential election of our lifetime.
In the past year, we led the charge to protect the electoral college, fight off a massive gas and heating oil tax (they are coming back for some of this again) and stopped numerous other crazy, destructive policies. But Democrats won some too.
Going into 2020, we are working to build out the strongest ground game in state history. We helped President Trump turn in a record number of signatures to qualify for the primary ballot. We have a recruiting system up and running to find the best candidates for Maine House and Senate. We are preparing to take back Maine CD2 from Jared Golden, who this month voted to impeach President Trump and then voted to leave NAFTA in place.
Let’s not forget, we are also the epicenter of the national battle for control of the U.S. Senate – with what may be the most targeted and expensive U.S. Senate race in the nation.
All this work costs money. We have been incredibly blessed to add almost 500 new donors this year. The support from so many of you has been strong. But right now, we still have a year-end goal to meet.
Before the clock strikes midnight tomorrow night, we need to raise $4,600 to meet our goal.
You see, we report back on our progress to President Trump’s team and our national partners to demonstrate the strength of Maine’s support for President Trump and Republicans. We’re a targeted swing state, and that can bring a lot of support – but we have to show commitment from Mainers as well.
Right now, can you help us meet our year end goal?
Your contribution of $10, $20.20, $50 or more goes a long way to showing your commitment to re-electing President Trump and turning Maine red to stop Janet Mills.
Meeting our year-end goal would mean so much as we march into 2020 preparing for our state convention, helping our candidates qualify for the ballot up and down the ticket and… another surprise we have in store for you very soon.
Will you chip in whatever you can right now, so we can get your contribution toward our 2020 success counted against our year end goal? Any amount you can chip in gets counted toward our goal.
Our small core team here in Augusta does so much, and knowing you have their backs while they prepare for another political battle against the radical left means the world to them.
Please chip in now – let’s get ready to put some electoral college votes on the board for President Trump, save the Republic by holding the U.S. Senate and send Jared Golden packing for his bad votes.
If we do those things, we will flip seats in the Maine Legislature and bring Janet Mills’ destructive agenda to a screeching halt.
Thank you for all that you do.
Sincerely,
Dr. Demi Kouzounas
Chair
Maine GOP
P.S. Even if you can only do a few dollars, I would love to have your name counted as a supporter that answers the call to defend our state and our Republic. Please chip in any amount you can right here.

"Alex,
Despite all the swampy schemes of the extreme liberals, we are now only days away from having enough certified signatures to fairly qualify a Repeal of Ranked Choice Voting for Presidential elections on November’s ballot.
As you know, under Maine law, if we gather the right amount of signatures, we not only get a chance to vote in November to permanently repeal Ranked Choice Voting for Presidential elections going forward, but we stop it from interfering in our Presidential vote this year.
That is why these signatures are so critical. To those who who have already signed, thank you!
Should those signatures be enough? Absolutely!
Will they be enough? Extreme Liberal pro-RCV folks will do anything to stop us!
We know from experience that the liberals, especially the out-of-state extreme groups, who first brought Ranked Choice Voting to Maine will use every tactic in the book to stop us. That includes attacking our signature process and even trying to throw some of our signatures into question.
Once we started showing success in this effort they filed a lawsuit. Now we fully expect them to do even more.
We don’t want to simply cross that finish line, we want to bury it. To do so, we must make one last, big push between now and June 6.
A contribution here today will help us get it done.
Our plan is working!
We are working night and day to finalize the signature gathering process to stop Ranked Choice Voting for this year’s Presidential elections and to give Mainers an opportunity to permanently repeal it for Presidential elections with a vote in November.
Please consider contributing, here, now, today to help us defeat Ranked Choice Voting.
Time is of the essence. Thank you for your support.
Sincerely,
Dr. Demi Kouzounas

"Dear Alex,
Did you see the news? The Ranked Choice Voting agitators are at it again.
Just as it is clear we are close to having the signatures needed to stop Ranked Choice Voting for this year’s Presidential Election, out-of-state funded political operations have rushed to the Maine courts to try and stop us.
Their lawsuit is without merit. These issues were already addressed by the Maine Secretary of State when the People’s Veto Effort was authorized to move forward.
But, it tells us one thing.
They are very scared. Tens of thousands of Democrats, Republicans, and Independent voters have already signed petitions to repeal provisions of ranked choice voting. As voters they do not want their voices silenced. The Ranked Choice Voting out-of-state funded operatives know we are fighting back. We will not allow out-of-state liberal billionaires and special interests to upend Maine’s long tradition of how we vote for President of the United States.
Help us keep pushing and finish our the Ranked Choice Voting signature effort. Help us restore the one person = one vote Presidential election this year.
The RCV lawsuit tries to confuse the courts and the public on the timing of our effort. However, the Secretary of State’s office informed us officially in September 2019 that the application to begin the veto could not begin until after January of 2020. In doing so the Secretary of State’s office specifically noted the Attorney General’s Official Opinion No. 79-170, which has long guided the timing of Legislation and legal deadlines in Maine.
What’s even more interesting is that when Janet Mills allowed RCV to be applied to the Presidential Election this year, the Associated Press and other Maine media outlets noted that due to the timing of her actions RCV would only apply to the November Presidential Election and not Maine’s Presidential Primary. It was seen as a ""having her cake and eating it too"" move on Mills' timing to protect party insiders connected to the Primary.
Now with this new liberal lawsuit push they could inadvertently nullify that very Presidential Primary. Their lawsuit would require that Primary vote to be held under Ranked Choice Voting as well.
It is ridiculous but the entire lawsuit is a further indication of the games being played with Ranked Choice Voting. They will do anything to try and stop us.
Help us here, now, to continue the push to repeal Ranked Choice Voting for this year’s Presidential Election.
As the Forecaster newspaper accurately reported when ranked choice voting was first brought to Maine: ""the RCV campaign in Maine has been partly bankrolled by John Arnold, a former Enron executive and billionaire hedge fund manager from Texas.""
In reality Texas Citizen John Arnold had used his vast fortune, made from Enron and hedge funds, to provide most of the money to thrust RCV on Maine. Tens of thousands of additional dollars were also funneled in from other out-of-state bankrolled liberal entities to push it. It was never about Maine voices.
We are going to continue fighting back to restore our Presidential vote.
Right now we are still gathering the final signatures we need – adding to the tens of thousands we already have – to stop Ranked Choice Voting from ruining Maine’s one person equals one vote 2020 Presidential election.
Your contribution, right here, right now, helps us keep up this fight.
Maine citizens are taking our voice back. And, we are not going to give up or be deterred by false lawsuits seeking to silence Maine voices.
We will continue gathering signatures to help stop Ranked Choice Voting in this year’s Presidential election, with your help.
Thank you for your support.
Sincerely,
Doctor Demi Kouzounas
P.S. The lawsuit filed by the Ranked Choice Voting consortium of liberals will not deter us. It only propels us to work harder. Help us complete the task. Please donate here, today.

"Alex,
I wanted to drop you a note and provide an update on our Repeal RCV effort.
First, we far exceeded our goal for signature collection on Super Tuesday. In fact, I think we collected almost twice as many signatures as we expected to collect.
That said, there are rumors floating around that we collected everything we need. Those rumors are false, we still have a fair bit of work to go to hit our goal but we are in great shape. PLUS, I want to make sure that every single one of you who wants to sign gets to sign the legal petition to protect One Person, One Vote.
The outpouring of support after we fought and won the legal battle with the City of Portland to collect signatures in Portland polling places has been tremendous and the financial support that came in proved that we are ready to get rid of this bad bill.
Now, as you know, we covered more than 200 polling places on Super Tuesday. We did our best to cover as many as we could, but many of you have reached out to me saying there was nobody at your polling place.
The reality is, there were some places we could not find a volunteer on a Tuesday, and in some cases, the signatures came in so fast our people filled all their sheets before polls closed.
But, rest assured, we have a plan for that.
We have been collecting information from people who want to sign at the website: [[URL REDACTED]] and collating the info into regions and towns. In coming weeks, we will be deploying volunteers to come collect your signature and give other people in your town and region a chance to sign as well.
It is important to me to make sure you get to sign and be on the record as a Maine citizen opposing RCV.
If you did not get to sign on Super Tuesday and you want to sign, please go here right now and just check off the ""I want to Sign the People's Veto Paper Petition"" box at the bottom of the form. (Click here for the form)
As well, we are grateful for anyone willing to circulate a petition and collect signatures from friends, family and neighbors. We have packets we can drop in the mail for you if you would like.
We are well on our way and we want to keep getting stronger and make sure every single Mainer who wants to Repeal RCV gets their name on the petition.
Thank you for all that you do.
Sincerely,
Dr. Demi Kouzounas

P.S. - I have received a lot of inquiries about President Trump's actual vote total on Tuesday. By our estimation, he received what may be a record-breaking number of votes for an incumbent Presidential candidate in Maine! We'll keep you posted. The Secretary of State has not yet released the final numbers, but we are not going to let those numbers be kept hidden from public view.
We are very, very proud of how many of you turned out Tuesday to show your support!

President Donald Trump recently tweeted, ""Dale Crafts will be a tremendous Congressman for Maine! An experienced businessman, Dale knows how to Create Jobs. He loves our Vets and Military, and he will always defend your Second Amendment. Dale has my complete and total endorsement!""
I want to tell you, I’m excited! It is yet another piece of evidence that shows how closely President Trump is watching Maine and how much he cares about our state!
Right now our team is on pace to surpass our 2018 voter contact numbers before Labor Day. Everyone is working together and we are one unified political fighting force.
But the largest remaining piece of our puzzle is one that we always are working toward, and that is funding our programs and making the case to every last voter that our party’s positions, focusing on freedom and prosperity for all Americans, is best for our state and nation.
With that, I wanted to ask you to donate right now to support Dale Crafts for Congress. Dale recently received the endorsement of President Donald Trump during a Maine/NH tele-rally and then again in a tweet over the weekend.
We are ready to Take Back Maine’s Second Congressional District, but Dale needs our support.
Can you chip in right now to help him? Any amount, from $5 or $10 to $100 or more will move Dale into position to defeat Jared Golden in November.
Let’s be clear, Jared Golden pretends to be one thing, but he is actually something quite different. Golden proved that when he voted to impeach President Trump.
Right now, we are in a position to do something about it. Your contribution of any amount, from $5 or $10 to $100 or more, will help us take back this seat.
I, for one, will be extremely proud to send Dale Crafts to Congress.
Please join me by chipping in right now to support him and restore honesty to this seat in Congress.

"Friends,
In the interest of keeping you informed, today our team is scheduled to begin scanning petitions at the Secretary of State’s office in order to mount the challenge to ensure thousands of signatures of registered Maine voters that were certified by their town clerks are counted toward our Repeal RCV effort.
Unfortunately, this process has been delayed by the Secretary of State, but we anticipate that if we can get them scanned and reviewed today, we will have time to do the proper review before the deadline.
Under state law, we have ten days to file a legal challenge to ensure these signatures are counted. The Secretary of State made his decision last Wednesday at 5PM, providing us no advanced notice.
That same evening we said we wanted to get in and scan the signatures.
Here we are.
While the state has wasted tens of thousands of dollars on other processes, we have been waiting and assembling our team.
I just wanted you to know what is going on now, and to assure you we are going to fight to see that these certified signatures that were thrown out by Secretary of State Dunlap are counted.
That process, while delayed, begins today.

They thought they had us.
Janet Mills and the liberal Democrats in the State Legislature threw everything at us to force Ranked Choice Voting onto this year’s Presidential Election.
First, they used last minute shenanigans to add it to Presidential elections thinking we would be caught off guard.
Then came the Coronavirus and Governor Mills weaponized the vast, unchecked powers she had grasped during the coronavirus pandemic to specifically exclude our efforts to collect signature from her emergency Notarization rules. Everyone else was granted the special power to notarize documents except us.
However, we persevered. With 500 petition circulators collecting 72,000 signatures from more than 450 Maine cities, towns, and plantations in all 16 Maine counties; we marched into the Maine Secretary of State’s office last week to turn in our signatures.
Now, with the certification of our signatures likely coming within in a few weeks, we will have stopped the Ranked Choice scheme from interfering in this year’s election.
At least that is what is supposed to happen.
But a group of liberals are also still trying to defeat us in court.
Despite losing the battle over signature collection, a hoard of liberal lawyers controlled and backed by powerful swamp-dwelling cronies are now trying to also stop us in court. They are trying to get the courts to throw out our signature gathering effort and thrust Ranked Choice Voting back into this year’s Presidential election.
Make no mistake—they will fail in this effort just like Gov. Mills has failed our State, if we continue to have your help.
And, when we do we will need your help more than ever to let Mainers know the truth about what Rank Choice Voting is —and what it is not—with a strong media campaign to win the referendum in November.
You see, under the law, our signatures and defeating the lawsuit will get this repeal placed on the November ballot. By placing the repeal on the ballot, we temporarily stop its impact by removing it from the Presidential election this year. However to permanently rid Maine of this scheme for Presidential Election we must win the vote in the fall.
Here are just some of the facts people need to know about:
*RCV is NOT a more fair or equal process. It allows some voters to get multiple votes while some only get one vote.
*RCV does NOT create majority winners. The ballots of voters who voted for eliminated candidates and left other columns blank are not counted in the final tabulation.
*RCV does NOT make elections more civil or reduce negativity.
*RCV does NOT increase participation. It actually suppresses the vote.
*RCV is NOT simple. Maine’s own experience shows a much higher rate of voter error and spoiled ballots.
*RCV costs our cities, towns and state more money than traditional elections.
*RCV has already been found unconstitutional in state general elections. All Maine elections should be run consistent with the same principle.
Please consider contributing, here, now, today to help us fully defeat Ranked Choice Voting.
Time is of the essence. Thank you for your support.

"Alex,
I hope you had a warm and joyous Thanksgiving!
Today is ""Giving Tuesday"" – a day where Americans give back to groups that work for worthy causes.
In the past year, we have stood up for freedom, prosperity and our children and grandchildren’s future like no other organization in Maine. Just recently we collected thousands of signatures to make sure President Trump would be on Maine’s 2020 ballot.
We are working to oppose new gas taxes and new toll booths that would hurt Maine drivers. We killed off a 40 cent per gallon tax on gas and heating oil earlier this year. We stood up for our Constitution and we have defended our President against the never ending witch hunts manufactured by Democrats.
We believe, based on solid data, that we are in position to reclaim Maine's Second Congressional District, deliver electoral college votes from Maine for President Trump and put the brakes on the radical Janet Mills / Sara Gideon liberal agenda that has taken over the Maine Legislature.
Speaking of Sara Gideon, we will be on the front lines in 2020 exposing her extreme liberal agenda and the harm she would do in the U.S. Senate.
Will you support us with a donation right now for Giving Tuesday?
We feel like every day here in Maine we give you everything we have – but it does cost money. Even a donation of a few dollars makes a difference.
Very soon we will announce our next big project and we will, once again, be taking the fight to the radical left to protect Maine values.
Please consider a Giving Tuesday donation to support our continued work.
Your support, whether it is $5 or $500, helps us continue our work and encourages the whole team as we confront the aggressive socialist agenda that has grown so pervasive in Augusta.
Thank you for all that you do, and thank you for giving back on Giving Tuesday.
Please click here to make your Giving Tuesday contribution and keep our team going strong.

"Alex,
Late yesterday we found out that the city of Portland was going to block our Repeal RCV signature gatherers from all voting locations today. After a good-faith effort to work things out, I went and filed in the Cumberland County Superior Court for a restraining order against the city of Portland.
Our Repeal RCV circulators have just as much right to be there and give Portland voters the same opportunity to sign as anywhere else.
And you know what? We won. The court issued a temporary restraining order against the city to make them allow their own people to sign our petitions at polling places.
We had to scramble, but we got circulators out at key locations in Portland.
I’m telling you this for two reasons.
1) This is not easy work. We have to be ready to fight for everything we get. I am ready, every day, to fight for you.
2) This costs money, and time, and takes a tremendous amount of effort.
It’s not every day you have to go to court to prevent a major city from silencing their own people.
So, after this massively successful effort with signature gatherers at over 200 locations across Maine, I want to ask you to help replenish our funds and help us move on to the next step in the fight to Repeal RCV.
Today was the first win in our fight to Repeal RCV but it won’t be the last. I’m ready to fight every day to get this job done and Repeal RCV.
Please click here right now and donate $10, $25, $50 or more to help us keep growing.
I would love to end this day with a commitment from hundreds of supporters to show my team we are on the right track.
Thank you to all of you, the volunteers, drivers, organizers and those who signed. We are on our way.

"setting the table for a roaring 2020
Alex,
We are closing in on having signature gatherers at more than 200 locations on Super Tuesday to collect signatures to Repeal Ranked-Choice Voting. We have training events, GOTV and canvassing operations happening across the state constantly.
More than 350 people have volunteered in the last three weeks to help with RCV or other activities. Our candidates are qualifying for the ballot using the infrastructure we’re able to provide with your support.
We are setting the table for a huge 2020!
Now, we have a final push to get petitions out to all our volunteers, to ensure our candidates are all qualified for the ballot and that we field candidates everywhere in the state.
We need to begin advertising to get our message out on repealing ranked-choice voting and we have to make sure President Trump continues to stay in position to defeat socialist Bernie Sanders, Mike Bloomberg or whatever extreme liberal ends up with the nomination after this Democrat chaos is over.
This election is setting up to give us an incredible opportunity. We believe we can grow President Trump’s support and win statewide. Some of the work President Trump has done for the Maine people is amazing. We need to tell that story.
We can reclaim the legislature and stop Janet Mills’ destructive agenda. We will hold Sara Gideon accountable for the corrupt nature of her leadership PAC and her tremendous hypocrisy.
And we will protect one person, one vote with a repeal of this wrong-headed Presidential RCV bill. We have seen in Iowa and then in Nevada, Democrats can’t even make RCV work in their own party.
Can you chip in some amount right now to help us work through all these things in the next two weeks? Between Super Tuesday (March 3) and the candidate deadlines on March 15, we will not get any rest, but so much critical work for Maine’s future will be accomplished.
We have a donor willing to match our donations over the next few days, so your donation will have twice the impact if you can make it right now.
Please, help us continue our work toward a Roaring Republican 2020 and thank you for all that you do.

"Alex,
I write to give you a quick, positive update and ask for your help today as our state continues to suffer under the ‘stay at home’ order.
First: Positive Update.
Our amazing volunteers have continued to send in petition sheets full of notarized and certified signatures to Repeal RCV. The virus may have slowed our operation down, but it has not stopped us.
We are closing in on our end of April goal right now and putting a plan in place to finish up collecting signatures in May - whether we can continue collecting signatures through traditional methods or alternatives we will put in place.
Thank you to those of you who have volunteered your time and energy to help us in this effort. Again, you are AMAZING and virtually every day we are inspired by the signatures that keep coming in.
Second: What you can do to Help.
If you have notarized and certified petition sheets that are ready to submit, please send them to us at as soon as possible to this address:
Maine GOP
9 Higgins Street
Augusta, ME 04330
We will gladly send you a couple more blank sheets to continue collecting once this stay at home period has been lifted.
If you have petition sheets that are not notarized and certified, hold on to them for now, but please send Ben Hincher a quick email ( [[URL REDACTED]] ) telling him how many signatures you have and where, so we can log it in on our petition tracker.
By helping us collect all this information on where we have signatures you are helping us fine tune our plans for finishing up our work. We have lost time, but we are ready to finish the job, one way or another. A key piece of this is also knowing where we can find the most productive regions to focus on in May.
Thank you for all that you do, and for your support as we continue to work through this challenging time. We are keeping you all in our prayers.
Please stay safe and healthy and God bless you.

"Alex,
We are fighting hard to repeal Ranked Choice Voting for this year’s Presidential election and you need to know how this week’s developments may jeopardize this work.
First, the Maine Legislature has adjourned a month early. The coronavirus situation offered a reason to cut the legislative session short. Not only does this mean that some politicians seeking higher office will start their campaigns early, but it forces us to turn in our 63,000 signatures a month earlier than planned.
Second, our original plan included collecting signatures at town meetings and at polling places during the June primary. But Governor Mills has declared a State of Civil Emergency, giving her sweeping powers—including the power to reschedule town meetings and run the June primary by absentee ballot only, if she chooses.
As you know, when the Democrats in the Legislature passed the bill to force ranked choice voting in presidential elections, Janet Mills found a clever way to keep ranked choice voting out of her party’s primary.
Now Janet Mills has a way to make it harder for us to repeal ranked-choice voting in not only presidential primary elections but in future November presidential elections as well.
Complicating the process even more, social distancing means we must take extra precautions when we collect signatures.
We cannot wait until we know how Governor Mills will choose to run the June elections. That will be too late.
We now only have 90 days to collect signatures, and the clock is ticking.
We can do this.
We’ve drawn up a new game plan, and we are putting it in motion, but it’s going to cost money.
We have taken this fight to keep ranked choice out of the presidential elections seriously. Our team is working hard, and we gathered a lot of the signatures we need on Super Tuesday. But it is not nearly enough.
This is a central, critical piece of our mission for the entire 2020 election cycle. You know what is at stake.
Extreme, liberal special interests who spent millions of dollars pushing Ranked Choice Voting onto Maine will do anything they can to keep this system in place for this year’s Presidential election.
In the past week, many things have changed.
However, the principal of one person, one vote should not change in the face of any crisis.
Help me meet this new challenge. Your donation right here, right now will put needed resources into this central piece of our 2020 election effort. Contribute here.
This is a very special request.
I need your help with a donation of $25 for us to buy packages of pens, $50, $100, $250 or more to help us cover team travel as we now have to work even harder to get to the locations necessary to get signatures.
You can contribute right now, here.
Time is literally of the essence.
Every dollar contributed will help us get this done and fight back against ranked choice voting. Please contribute here.
We must protect Maine’s Presidential elections and turn the tide on ranked-choice voting.
Thank you for all that you do.

"Alex,
I have some good news – important news.
Success is within our grasp on the signature gathering phase of ranked choice voting. This is critical because it stops the Democrat’s attempt to put RCV in place for this year’s Presidential ballot. And, it gives us a shot at eliminating it for Presidential elections all together.
When we began our fight to repeal ranked choice voting for the Presidential election last January, we expected the Democrats and their big-money out of state backers would try to stop us, but we were confident that we could meet any challenge because of the importance of our fight and the dedication of you and our team.
We knew it would be a grind. We were prepared for Democratic Party and liberal groups to tell people not to sign our petition, and they have. We knew they would go further – and they did. They sued use in court trying to stop even the gathering of signatures.
On Super Tuesday in March, we had to walk into court and sue the City of Portland just to collect signatures in at polling locations like liberal groups had done for years. By early that afternoon, we had won, and we made up for lost time by calling supporters back to the polls and collecting thousands of signatures in the remaining hours the polls were open.
But then the pandemic and the Governor’s Executive Orders threw new and unexpected obstacles in our path. The Mills administration coronavirus dictates had made gathering signatures ALMOST impossible.
When Mills issued an executive order allowing almost all notarized documents to be done electronically, she specifically exempted the petitions we had to process.
Like every business, we have been hampered by having staff work from home and the limitations on the number of people, both staff and volunteers, we’re allowed to have in our office. But like many businesses and organizations, we worked to figure it out.
Hard work and perseverance – coupled with your support – is paying off.
Despite all of these obstacles, volunteers and activists continued to process the signatures they had collected. Slowly but surely they were sent in – thousands of them. Each week our piles grew higher and higher.
We developed a schedule of town office closures and availability so we could safely and accurately get petition signatures certified by election clerks.
Now, after weeks and weeks of legal work, our signature gatherers have been designated as essential workers as this work falls under the Constitutional requirements for an election effort. They are back and up and running, not just on the phone, but safely gathering petition signatures.
And, that’s not all. We have developed new creative – and safe – plans to gather more signatures in the coming weeks.
I am happy to report that right now, today, we are on the right trajectory and glide path to make this happen. Against overwhelming obstacles, if we can complete our plans we should have a victory of the signature gathering phase which will halt RCV for this year’s Presidential election and give us a shot at defeating it permanently on the ballot this fall.
Now we need your help – today – to help move our final plans forward.
We can move forward with our new, creative plans to gather even more signatures with your help now, today.
A contribution to help us with postage, deliveries and new materials here today will help us make it over the top.
We have a plan, and it is working. Please consider making a contribution, here, now, today to help us defeat Ranked Choice Voting.
Sincerely,
Dr. Demi Kouzounas
Chair
Maine Republican Party
P.S. The millions of out-of-state dollars which have flowed into Maine to thrust Ranked Choice Voting on the public have never been challenged. We are now challenging them. We are fighting back. They didn’t expect we would have the perseverance and will to stop them. But we are working everyday to make it happen. Please help us by making a contribution of some amount, here, now today: donation link.

"New Trump Campaign Ad Highlights President Trump's Achievements for American Seniors, Contrasting with Joe Biden's Far-Left Healthcare Agenda
The Trump Campaign today launched a new television ad contrasting President Trump's many achievements for American seniors, including protecting social security, lowering drug costs, slashing Medicare premium costs, and defending private insurance with Joe Biden’s decades-long record of trying to cut seniors' benefits as a Washington politician. While Joe Biden has made a career pursuing a far-left agenda that caused insurance premiums and drug prices to skyrocket, President Trump has always stood by America's most vulnerable. The choice for America's seniors is clear: only President Trump can stand up to socialism and deliver inexpensive, quality healthcare to the American people.
The Trump Campaign will expand the President’s victory map from 2016, and is strategically placing ads to reach the right people with the right message. In recent weeks, the campaign has expanded its paid media efforts to voters in key battleground states. This ad is part of this week’s eight figure ad buy and will run on national cable and in key broadcast markets in Maine, Arizona, Pennsylvania, Florida, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Georgia, Minnesota, Michigan, and Nevada.

Good news! After days of refusing to follow the lead of President Trump and more than half of the governors in the United States, Governor Janet Mills has announced she will extend the deadline for Mainers to file state income taxes until July 15th.

Finally! Governor Mills Folds, Extends State Income Tax Payment Deadline to July 15, 2020
STATEMENT FROM MPBP FROM EARLIER TODAY
Governor Janet Mills Refuses to Provide Tax Filing Relief to Struggling Mainers and Job Creators
Said she is ""disappointed"" over federal action providing relief as more than half the states follow the feds’ lead
AUGUSTA – One of Maine’s largest citizen activist organizations, Maine People Before Politics, is bringing attention to the fact that Janet Mills has to date sidestepped the issue of providing tax filing relief in Maine.
The Trump Administration extended the April 15 tax-filing deadline to July 15 to give people and businesses more time to prepare and pay their taxes and to use that cash to pay their workers instead of filling government coffers. At least 26 states have moved their dates to July 15, including California, Connecticut, and North Carolina.
Workers are losing jobs and businesses are closing, many of those closures per the order of Governor Mills. Yet Janet Mill stated in a press conference Tuesday that she was ""disappointed"" the President moved the IRS tax deadline.
Maine Revenue Services requires tax filers to pay taxes owed by April 15, any payments after that date are subject to interest and penalties, even if an individual filer takes advantage of an extension.
""A tax payment and filing delay like that of the federal government would allow businesses to keep employees paid with the funds which would otherwise go to the tax payment, and hardworking Mainers who owe taxes can use that money during a trying time to make ends meet,"" said Julie Rabinowitz, Director of Policy and Communication for MPBP.
When Governor LePage left office, Maine had a roaring economy, with the lowest unemployment rate in decades and record tax revenue that continued to exceed projections. MPBP calls upon Governor Mills to make the right decision by prioritizing Maine people in this financial crisis.
""Now is the time for Maine to join other states and the federal government in moving the tax filing deadline. It is a moment for leadership,"" added Rabinowitz.
Maine People Before Politics has raised alarms over the last year about spending levels in state government. Just last week, the Legislature passed $73 million more in state spending in the supplemental budget, more than half of which had nothing to do with coronavirus response or health care, based on revenue projections that will likely now never be realized.

"Are you ready to elect Republicans up and down the ticket in 2020!?
In the next few weeks, Republicans in cities and towns across Maine will gather to hold our biennial party meetings, known as caucuses.
It is an important opportunity to connect with other Republicans in your area, jump in and serve as a local Republican party officer, hear from candidates for office locally and in some cases candidates and campaign staff for federal candidates.
You also can become a delegate to the Maine Republican Party State Convention on May 1st and 2nd, where Republicans from across the state will hear speeches from all of Maine’s top Republicans candidates and other top speakers. At the convention, we also will vote on the party platform and support our President, Donald J. Trump as he moves into the most important Presidential election in our lives.
It all starts with your local caucus.
I’m reminded of a question someone asked many years ago as we were all organizing in an election:
""Can you win your street, your neighborhood or your town?""
That is what this is all about. Victory in 2020 is not just one big national message and battle, it is a street-by-street, neighborhood-by-neighborhood and town-by-town competition for the hearts of voters.
Our current caucus schedule is live online and you can look and see where and when your town’s caucus is being held.
Click here for caucus schedule.
If your town has already held their caucus, or if there is no caucus scheduled yet, please email Kim Pettengill at [[URL REDACTED]] and we will connect you to the appropriate local contact to ensure you can still participate in your local Republican Party and the convention, if delegate spots are still open.
All politics is local – and you joining our team, in whatever capacity you can, will be a critical piece of the puzzle for President Trump and all of our candidates in 2020.
Please, join us in the upcoming election. The future of our Republic, and our freedom and prosperity is at stake.

"Alex,
At the end of the week, we will be turning in thousands of your signature to qualify President Donald J. Trump for Maine’s ballot. We could not have done it without you. This push was so successful, we actually collected more signatures than we can legally submit.
For that process, many people stepped up and made donations to help us make this a winning effort all around.
Now, as we prepare to wrap this all up and move forward, our eyes are once again on the big goals.
On Wednesday, we will be rallying in Bangor to tell Rep. Jared Golden not to vote in support of impeachment again. The evidence is clear – or rather, the lack of evidence is clear.
All Adam Schiff and Nancy Pelosi have is a basket of unproven accusations. They have decided to put all the work of the people of the United States on the back-burner to try to overturn an election.
While we continue that work, we also need your support in reaching our year-end goals.
We are about 45 individual donations away from meeting our year end goal. While we appreciate larger donations, whatever you can afford to chip in right now will help us meet our goal.
Meeting this goal is part of continuing to maintain our status as one of the top start parties in the nation as we report to our national allies. As one of the swing states needed to put President Trump over the top in 2020, we have to be able to show him we are strong and the people are behind him.
Can you chip in right now to help us meet our year end goal and show President Trump’s team the strength of our resolve?
The do-nothing Democrats are moving forward with their sham impeachment today. They have changed the rules because they can’t win the election.
But they can’t stop you from supporting us, and they can’t stop us from speaking out in defense of President Trump. They also can’t stop us all from making Jared Golden and their Presidential candidate pay the price in 2020 for this witch hunt.
Please, if you can chip in right now to help us reach our goal and put up big numbers to close out the year, go here right now.
The President relies on us to speak up and defend him, and we rely on you to stay strong. You can chip in right now and help us reach our goal. Keep us in the top level of state parties in swing states with your support.
Thank you for all that you do.

The results are in! Dale Crafts is now the Republican candidate for Maine's Second Congressional District. Now that the people of Maine have spoken, it is time for all of us to rally behind Dale and get to work to unseat Jared Golden.
While congratulations are in order for Dale, I also want to thank Adrienne Bennett and Eric Brakey for a hard fought primary race. All of our candidates worked hard to earn Mainers votes, and I am confident they will work just as hard to make sure Dale is elected in November.
Over the last two years it has become abundantly clear that Jared Golden has no interest in representing Maine's Second Congressional District, a +10 Trump district in 2016. Instead, Jared Golden has fought the President at every turn, including voting to wrongfully impeach the President and voting against the historic USMCA trade deal. While Jared Golden campaigned as a ""moderate"", he has been nothing but a rubber stamp vote for Nancy Pelosi and D.C. Democrats, earning him the title of most partisan member of the Maine Delegation.
As your next Congressman, Dale Crafts will fight to uphold the values of Maine's Second Congressional District and will always work for you, not D.C. Democrats.
As you read this, millions of dollars of out-of-state money is pouring into Jared's campaign. Can we count on you to help combat this flood of out-of-state money and chip in to support Dale's campaign?
Every dollar in this nationally targeted race is critical. Don't delay, donate NOW.

"Alex,
I write to you to encourage you to vote Yes on Question 1 this Tuesday, March 3rd.
This is a referendum to preserve the religious and philosophical exemptions in Maine's vaccination law. This is a serious issue that requires us to look at how Maine balances the protection of the rights of Maine people vs. any measurable benefit to public health.
Maine's vaccination rate is among the highest in the nation under the existing law that voting YES on Question 1 will keep in place.
Sadly, there are a lot of scare tactics at play. Here is my perspective.
As a Christian who served my country and defended our Constitution in the U.S. Army, and as a doctor who performs a significant amount of care at no charge to help low-income Mainers, I will be voting Yes to preserve the exemptions and keep Maine on track with the law as it has existed, and worked, for decades.
RELIGIOUS EXEMPTION: The religious exemption exists to protect the natural, God-given rights of the people of Maine. It is not something that the narrowest of a majority in the Maine Legislature should be allowed to take away, PERIOD.
If they succeed at this, what else will they take away? The faith and deeply held beliefs of any American should not be up for negotiation in a legislative body.
MAINE IS IN A GOOD PLACE: If this law is repealed, nothing will change from the way things are today. Our children will continue being vaccinated. Our children will continue being healthy and living full, normal lives. Maine's vaccination rates are above the national average and Maine is among the best states in the nation, according to numerous government sources.
PARENTAL RIGHTS & INFORMED CONSENT: The rights of loving parents to care for their children as they see fit should be sacred. We should never allow the state to decide it knows better than parents. Under this law, parents are denied the flexibility they desire to even spread out vaccinations over a longer period of time.
SLIPPERY SLOPE: In other states, we have seen that once mandates are taken away, bureaucrats and politicians sweep in and try to impose more mandates, add even more requirements and continue to push their agenda.
This is not a hypothetical slippery slope argument. This is a slippery slope reality we are already watching states slide down. For these reasons and more, I ask you to go vote Yes on Question 1.
Restore the religious exemption. Protect parental rights and informed consent. Restore Maine law to what has worked for decades.
Our God-given rights should not be for sale to the highest bidder in the Maine Legislature or Blaine House.
Reminder:
Yes = Religious freedom, parental rights, informed consent
No = Government overreach
God Bless You, and don't forget to vote on Tuesday!
Sincerely,
Dr. Demi Kouzounas

"In the interest of sharing information, I am forwarding an important update from Senator Susan Collins.
-Chair Dr. Demi Kouzounas
Responding to the Coronavirus Pandemic
Sen. Collins' COVID-19 Resource Guide
This is an incredibly stressful time for individuals, families, workers, and small business owners due to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Congress, on a bipartisan basis, has proceeded with an initial three-phase response to this public health and economic crisis:
Phase I, signed into law on March 6, allocated $8.3 billion in federal funding to help address the immediate needs of public health agencies to fight the virus.
Phase II, signed into law on March 18, provided more than $100 billion to improve access to COVID-19 testing, bolster unemployment and food assistance, expand paid sick leave, and assist states as they respond to the public health crisis.
Phase III, signed into law on March 27, provided $2 trillion in emergency assistance to further protect the health of the American people and support our economy. Included in the new law is a $377 billion economic relief program for small businesses that I co-authored, which aims to keep workers paid and employed. The law also allocates much-needed funds to support our hospitals and health providers; purchase personal protective equipment for doctors, nurses, and first responders; and promote vaccine development.
To help Mainers understand how these new laws will impact you and your families, and to share resources that are available to help Mainers stay safe and secure during this crisis, I have put together a Resource Guide. This site provides information on the new loan forgiveness program for small businesses, rebate checks for individuals, unemployment insurance enhancements, and key investments to support our frontline response to meet the health and safety needs of Mainers during this crisis.
All across the country, Americans are stepping up in response to the COVID-19 pandemic sweeping our nation. Doctors and nurses are working endless hours and putting themselves at risk to care for the surge in patients. Manufacturers, including many in Maine, are working overtime and retooling their product lines to make medical testing swabs, ventilators, and personal protective equipment. Truckers are going above and beyond, missing time with their families, so that they can deliver goods needed to restock depleted grocery store shelves. People are looking out for their neighbors and making personal sacrifices to help reduce the virus’ spread.
Every day, more small businesses are forced to close their doors. Every day, Americans are losing their jobs and their income. Every day, medical professionals are increasingly overwhelmed by the exponential rise in cases.
My top priority remains to help keep Mainers as safe and as healthy as possible, and I remain committed to providing Maine with the resources it needs to keep up the fight.
Please visit the Resource Guide to learn more about the assistance available to individuals, families, employees, and small businesses.
As always, my staff stands ready to help Mainers as they deal with federal agencies. To speak with a member of my staff during this crisis, please contact any of my Maine Constituent Service Centers listed below, or click HERE to submit a request.

Don't be fooled, I believe President Trump and Republicans will win big on November 3rd.

Right now, Dale needs our help.
Can I count on you to chip into his campaign? Dale is being out spent 4-1 and yet he is climbing in the polls. His message is resonating with Mainers across the 2nd district, because they realize we need to send someone to Washington that has the life experience, business experience and legislative experience.

While we find ourselves going through the process of changing the date of the Maine Republican Party State Convention due to the Coronavirus pandemic, we must still vote to elect our National Delegates and National Alternate Delegates to the National Convention by May 2 in accordance with our official filing with the Republican National Committee.
Because this deadline is immovable, we will be conducting the election of Delegates and Alternates to the National Convention using the same procedures utilized by the Maine Secretary of State for overseas ballots in state elections. This will include a mail or email ballot with privacy covers.
All PAID State Delegates to the State Convention will automatically receive a ballot. Maine Republican Party Convention Rules govern this election process.
There is an application attached below and a small application fee to run for National Delegate or Alternate. Any Republican in Maine is entitled to place their name on the ballot. If you are thinking about attending the National Convention as a National Delegate or National Alternate Delegate, here is some information:
The convention will be held in Charlotte, NC from Monday, August 24 through Thursday August 27. Applicants will be responsible to pay for their own travel to the event, lodging and any meals. The Maine Republican Party will reserve and make available a block of rooms at a hotel in the region.
Candidates for National Delegate and National Alternate Delegate should understand that their candidate applications will be submitted for matters of eligibility by the Maine Republican Party and for review and security reasons to national stakeholders responsible for the successful management of the national convention.
The deadline for receiving applications is Wednesday, April 8th. If you want to have your name on the ballot, please fill out the information below. You can send it to Maine Republican Party, 9 Higgins Street, Augusta 04330.

First, I want to sincerely say thank YOU. My Senate colleagues and I were only able to ensure a conservative majority on the Supreme Court and confirm Justice Barrett because of your incredible support.
Unfortunately, this fight is far from over. Democrats raised over $1.5 BILLION last Quarter, and Senate Republicans just made ourselves their top target with this week’s confirmation vote. Can we count on you to rush a donation right now to help defend our Senate Majority?
Chuck Schumer is already considering plans to pack the Court with liberal activists in response to Justice Amy Coney Barrett’s confirmation if he wins control of the Majority in November. We can’t sit back now – the Senate and Supreme Court are still in danger of a Democrat takeover.
We only have 5 DAYS left to fight back and defend our majority in the Senate! Can I count on you to rush resources Republicans need to win?
RUSH $250 NOW

My opponent just smashed every previous Senate fundraising record when he brought in over $57 MILLION over the past 3 months. I got news for you, this green wave coming from the Left is happening in battlegrounds states all across the country.
Time is running out. We are in the FINAL days of this race to protect our values and our future. The stakes have never been higher.
Your support is essential to continuing this fight to the end. Can you pitch in $25, $50, $70, or any amount before midnight tonight to defend the Senate?
Thank you,
Lindsey Graham

This is my last email to you before the all-important End of Month deadline! This is the most important deadline yet, and Martha STILL needs to raise $173,992 to reach her goal!
This is coming down to the wire, and there’s no time to waste, so I’ll be blunt. Martha’s race is in a dead heat. Control of the White House and Senate will be decided in Arizona, and if we don’t have the resources to compete in this state, we could lose in November.

Fellow Conservative,
* Defunding the police.
* Raising taxes on the middle class.
* Job-killing, socialist policies like the Green New Deal
* Packing the Supreme Court

My opponent has endorsed Joe Biden and was endorsed by his running mate Kamala Harris. He has raked in $38.7 million last Quarter and is one of the best-funded Democrats in the nation.
We are less than 1 week from Election Day, and millions will be poured into Arizona to turn it and the Senate blue. Can you help me fight back? Donate ANY amount to help me reach this important goal!
We are hanging by a thread right now. We’ve been outraised and outspent, but this race is still a dead heat. Democrats think their massive war chest can turn this battleground blue. We need to send a LOUD message and show we’re ready to fight!
Don’t be a bystander this election. This is the top battleground and if you don’t defend this must-win state, Democrats will have a path to taking the White House and Senate. Pitch in now to stop a liberal takeover and help us reach our $150K goal!

Your support is essential to continuing this fight to the end. Can you pitch in $25, $50, $70, or any amount before midnight tonight to defend the Senate?
Thank you,
Lindsey Graham

Just a quick reminder that the Libertarian Party of Maine will be holding an online convention on...
Saturday, April 18, 11:00 AM EDT.
*Why an online convention? Can't it wait until the COVID-19 situation is over?
In order for the LPME to elect its eight delegates to send to the national convention, we can only do these elections via state convention. Since the national convention is scheduled for May 21-25 in Austin, TX, we have to give enough time for our elected delegates to prepare.
*Will there be anything else at this online convention besides electing delegates?
No. Speeches, and other important announcements will be saved for another day, when we can meet in person. This convention is really just about national delegate election.
*Can I run for delegate to the national convention?
YES, IF...
-You're registered to vote in Maine, and
-You're a dues-paying member of the Libertarian Party of Maine OR the national Libertarian Party.
*I don't want to be a delegate, but can I vote for delegates?
Yes, same criteria. However, you MUST LET US KNOW IN ADVANCE, by 6:00 p.m. the night before (Friday, April 17).
*Why in advance?
We only have 50 slots available for our online meeting. You must reserve yours by contacting us at [[URL REDACTED]] We will check to make sure you are registered as a member of LPME or LP national. Once that is confirmed, we will send you a link to the online convention.
*What if we don't have more than eight people running for delegate?
We will simply declare the docket as confirmed for the delegates. We will determine who will get any vacant delegate seats prior to the national convention.
*Will we hold a regular, in-person convention?
YES, at least we hope so. We have a special in-person convention tentatively scheduled for Saturday, June 6. The site will be determined, but may do it outside this year!
*I have another question. Whom do I contact?
Me. [[URL REDACTED]]

""A Week From Election Day, Control Of The Maine Senate
Too Close To Predict"" - Maine Public (October 27, 2020)
It's not often that the media reports on state senate level races, but this week both Maine Public and NewsCenter Maine reported on the close races that will determine who will control the Maine State Senate for the next two years.
Despite Maine Senate Republicans being outspent 4 to 1, party operatives on both sides believe the state senate races are too close to call and could come down to 100 or even 10 votes.
Your vote and financial support at any level could be the determining factor!

"Maine Democrats' attack insultsevery military veteran who has left their home state to serve our country and moved home again.
Maine Democrat Mailer Attacks Colonel Duncan Milne,
Maine Senate Candidate, For Military Service
Maine Democrats are attacking Republican State Senate candidate and retired Marine Colonel Duncan Milne for his military service.
Attacking a retired Colonel or any Mainer who has moved out of state to serve our nation, and then moved home to Maine, is despicable.
Maine Democrats are so scared of losing their majority in the Maine Senate that they have stooped to a new low by attacking active service members, veterans, and their families for moving away to serve our nation.
Below is the absurd attack mailer they sent out to households across Waldo County where Col. Milne is running for State Senate. To read our full response, click here.
We want to send a clear message to Colonel Milne, and all members and families of the Armed Forces to know we support them. Can you help us send this message today?
With less than 60 days, the time to get our message out is now.

"Ethics Commission Unanimously Dismisses Complaint Against
Rep. Trey Stewart, candidate for Maine Senate District 2
Today, the Maine Ethics Commission unanimously voted to dismiss a complaint filed against Representative Trey Stewart of Presque Isle, who is seeking election to the Maine Senate.
Before even giving the Commission a chance to review the complaint, the Maine Democratic Party spent over $20,000 attacking Representative Stewart in an effort to smear his reputation.
Political campaign stunts must be put to rest!
Can you chip in $10 to help us get Trey Stewart's positive message of jobs, family, and future out to the voters of Aroostook County?
Voters deserve to have honest dialogue about the issues that candidates represent, not lies and negative ads about candidates in attempts to smear their reputations and pull attention away from the policy debates that matter.

"It's only July & Democrats are already spending BIG to hold onto their majority.
Friend,
I am pleased to share that the primary election is behind us. It was confirmed in a recount today that State Senator Kim Rosen won her primary!
Unfortunately, while we had to focus on primaries, Maine's Senate Democrats were able to get a head start on the November election.
From May 14 - June 4, Senate Democrats spent $147,900!
That is a lot of money for state senate races - and they spent that in less than one month. Can you imagine what they will spend between now and Election Day?
We have a great slate of candidates who have been working hard to help us take back the majority. But with less than 100 days until the November election, we need your help!
With your help, I believe we have a good chance at taking back the majority.

"Out of staters are buying Maine elections. See for yourself!
Friend,
Troy Jackson just released a campaign fundraising report for August 18 - September 30 and  70% of the Maine Senate Democrats campaign funding came from OUT OF STATE donors.
Senate Republicans only need 4 seats to take back the Maine Senate.
Republicans are up against unprecedented funding and we need your support of any amount now if we are going to win back the Maine Senate.
If you're like us, you are likely asking yourself why a Texas couple sent $50,000 and a Chicago consultant sent $15,000 to the Maine Senate Democratic Campaign.
Most of Maine's State Senate races don't even spend $50,000 the entire election!
Those are just two examples of the money flooding into Maine from out of state. In total, State Senate Democrats received more than $378,000 in less than two months from OUT OF STATE donors!

Candidate Spotlight:
Gabe Perkins
Alex,
We're excited to introduce you to Maine Senate candidate Gabe Perkins. Gabe is a fifth-generation native of the Bethel area. Growing up in a working-class family in Oxford County, Gabe quickly learned the values of hard work and service. After graduating from the University of Maine at Farmington, Gabe was called home to Bethel to serve the community that raised him.
Gabe has spent his professional career bettering communities in Oxford County. He was a founding board member of Mahoosuc Pathways and, since 2014, has served as the Executive Director. In that time, he has led the organization’s efforts to steward and develop trails at 21 locations in nine communities throughout Oxford County.
Gabe holds a degree in Environmental Policy and Planning from the University of Maine at Farmington. He is Vice President of CORE, a Senior Fellow in the Environmental Leadership Program, and an alumnus of the Community Practitioners Network. He can sometimes be found patiently renovating his grandparents’ old home on Mason St. with his wife, Jessie, dog Champ, and cat Indiana Jones.
""He has a natural ability to build coalitions and he will bring his listening skills to Augusta to get results for Western Maine.""
\- Jeffrey Sloan, Bethel
Gabe has dedicated his entire career to increasing the quality of life in Oxford County. He is running for office to serve his community, to bring local voices to state government, and to make sure Maine works for all of us.
He is running for Maine Senate District 18: Albany Township, Andover, Bethel, Buckfield, Byron, Canton, Dixfield, Gilead, Greenwood, Hanover, Hartford, Hebron, Lincoln Plantation, Livermore, Livermore Falls, Lovell, Magalloway Plantation, Mexico, Milton Twp., Newry, North Oxford Unorganized Territory, Peru, Roxbury, Rumford, South Oxford Unorganized Territory, Stoneham, Stow, Sumner, Sweden, Upton, Waterford, West Paris, and Woodstock.

"Local officials have a lot of power on issues of reproductive health.
Great News from the
Supreme Court
Alex,
As we approach the end of the month, I wanted to make sure that you know about the incredible news out of Washington. Today, the Supreme Court struck down a Louisiana law restricting abortions. That's great news and comes on the heels of a number of favorable rulings from the Supreme Court.
It was the state legislators in Louisiana who passed the original restrictive law in 2014. That was 6 years ago. Local officials play an outsized role in reproductive healthcare. Fortunately for Maine, with our Democratic Majority, we recently passed 6 bills EXPANDING access to reproductive healthcare. With our Majority, we also passed bills to help ensure pay equity and first in the nation paid time off.
That's why campaigns like ours are so important. We must protect our Democratic Majority and keep making progress on issues that are important to women and all Mainers.
But the road to victory is challenging, particularly so in the time of COVID-19. We cannot rely on our tried and true door to door campaign strategy. We must invest more in online organizing tools and digital advertising if we're going to reach the Mainers we need to vote for us.
With the end of the quarter fast approaching, our goal this month is to raise $20,000 for our Digital Fund. We have just 2 more days to hit our goal. So far, we've raised $14,143 towards that effort. If we're going to hit our goals and reach voters, we need your help.
Can you chip in $35 or more right now to help us hit our goal?
Thank you for everything that you do.

"Alex,
The Maine GOP is attempting a People's Veto of the new Ranked Choice Voting (RCV) law. Senate Democrats passed this law in August, making Maine the first in the nation to use RCV to choose a president.
While the process to qualify a People's Veto for the ballot is difficult, one thing is clear. The Maine GOP wants to undo the important work that the Senate Democrats did last session.
We must protect our incumbents if we're going to maintain our majority in 2020. If we don't, the Republicans will try and turn back the clock to the LePage era. They'll roll back our expansion of reproductive healthcare. They'll roll back the Green New Deal. They'll roll back the progress we've made on fixing our healthcare system. They have the State Senate in their crosshairs and will do anything they can to win in November.
Can you rush a contribution of $3 or more right now?
We need to make sure we have the resources to protect our incumbents and keep our majority in Augusta.
Thanks for all that you do.

"Alex,
The response that we've received to this email that we sent yesterday has been overwhelming. Many, many people are asking how they can help make sure that Larry Lockman doesn't get elected.
We'll be blunt.
When everyone's attention is, justifiably, on critical issues like COVID-19, small campaigns like ours suffer. We have to keep boots on the ground, the lights on, and the fight going while our Senators pass emergency legislation and respond to constituent's immediate needs during the crisis. We must keep our Democratic majority and defeat extremists like Larry Lockman.

Your support will keep our grassroots staff employed and make sure that Democrats win in November.
Thanks for all that you do.
Stay safe.

Alex,
Republican state Rep. Larry Lockman sent a scorching 3,000-word email attacking Gov. Janet Mills for her efforts to address the COVID-19 pandemic. In the email, Lockman called Mills’ stay-at-home order “house arrest,” “soft despotism” and “martial law lite,” declaring that “progressives see the pandemic as an opportunity to fundamentally transform Maine and America into a police state where citizens shut up and do what they’re told by the ‘experts.'” Not only that, but Lockman targeted Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention head Dr. Nirav Shah, whom he calls an “incompetent” who is making too much of the pandemic. Mainers know that Lockman is wrong, and we have the chance to defeat him in November.
Lockman is blatantly spreading misinformation against basic public health regulations like social distancing and shelter-at-home while diligent Mainers are working to flatten the curve. This is dangerous.
Our campaign team is hard at work right now. We’re going to do everything we can to keep our democratic majority. Candidates like Lockman have no place in our State Senate. Sign up now to join the team that will keep Lockman out of our State's Capitol!
We'll be watching Lockman very, very closely over the next few months. You can expect updates from us whenever he is in the news.
We're hard at work, making sure that we have the candidates and resources to defeat extremists like Lockman.

Dear Alex,

"Remembering Ruth Bader Ginsburg
Dear Alex,
When I heard the news of the passing of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, I was devastated, as we all were. I spent much of the weekend reading “My Own Words,"" a collection of Justice Ginsburg's writings and speeches that she curated. Her words were her power. I joined a small group of activists to organize a vigil last night in her honor.
At the vigil, I read a passage from her opening statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee for her confirmation hearings.
“The Justices do not guard constitutional rights alone. Courts share that profound responsibility with Congress, the president, the states, and the people. Constant realization of a more perfect Union, the Constitution’s aspiration requires the widest, broadest, deepest participation on matters of government and government policy.”
In other words, we, the people, must advance and defend the Constitution and the Bill of Rights for all people. We the people are the final check in the balance of power, and it is our duty, our responsibility to keep our democracy alive. We do so for ourselves, we do so for the next generation.
In these trying times, I'm reminded why our state politics are so important. In 2018, unlike the rest of the country, Maine codified the protections of Roe vs Wade in state law.
If the Supreme Court can't protect us, we need strong state legislatures that will protect our rights. I'm committed to investing this year to make sure we keep a strong Democratic Majority in the State Senate.
Tonight, I will be speaking, along with Senator Cathy Breen and others, at another vigil to honor Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and advance the work toward justice. I invite you to join us at 7:00 pm in the courtyard between the State House and the Cross Building.
Sincerely,
Senator Shenna Bellows

Protect Our Majority with

Right now, we have a solid majority in the State Senate. Democrats control 21 of the 35 seats. In 2018, each of our candidates knocked on nearly 10,000 doors.

"Collins Held Fundraiser During Trump's Visit
Dear Alex,
At the exact same time Trump fanned the flames of discontent by visiting Maine on Friday, Susan Collins held an exclusive, high dollar fundraiser with her corporate donors.
While Susan Collins claims to be ""the most bipartisan US Senator,"" she spends her time in DC fundraising for the Maine Republican Party. Susan Collins knows that her reelection is highly dependent on down-ballot support and will use her PAC to try and win.
Susan Collins: Stop talking out of both sides of your mouth. You can't be ""independent"" and use your dark money to influence Maine elections for Republicans.
Maine Senate Democrats know how to win. In 2018, our candidates flipped 114 municipalities red to blue. The path to victory for Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell goes straight through Maine. That's why Trump was here. That's why Susan Collins is raising money for her PAC.

The Maine State Senate is the ONLY place the Maine GOP has any chance of taking back power. Governor Mills is not on the ballot and the Maine House is unlikely to flip given the current makeup.
There are 35 Senate seats. Democrats control 21. Control of the Senate has flipped 4 times in the past decade. If Democrats lose the majority in the Senate, the GOP will block any additional progress that we need to make on issues critical to all Mainers.

"Say Goodbye to
Matt Pouliot
Dear Alex,
We're just over a week away from election day. There are many competitive races. Among them is District 15, where our candidate, Kalie Hess, is giving incumbent Republican Matt Pouliot a run for his money. Defeating an incumbent is a hard task. But Kalie is more than up to it.
Pouliot has failed his constituents and all Mainers. He has voted against:
Broadband investment
Improving teacher pay
Better vaccine laws
Equal pay for equal work

"Democrats work hard and get things done
Dear Alex,
We’re just 35 days away from the election, and the difference between the Democrats and the Republicans in the Maine State Senate could not be more clear. With a Democratic majority, we were able to tackle real challenges that everyday Mainers face.
Reducing the cost of prescription drugs
Reforming medical billing
Equal pay for equal work
Paid time off
Property tax relief
Working towards energy independence
Yet there is still so much more we need to do. When it was time for the Legislature to reconvene, Maine's GOP Senators refused. We have very strong candidates that are challenging Republican incumbents. We have the opportunity to expand our Democratic Majority. We need your help to boost our candidates and make sure they win.
We’re just one day away from the end of the month and the end of the 3rd quarter. We’ll know very soon how much our GOP opponents have raised from their corporate allies. We need to match them dollar for dollar, but we can only do that with the help of our grassroots allies. The money we raise today is going straight out into the field to support our candidates.
Can you help us hit our 3rd quarter goal with a contribution of $25 today?
Thank you for all that you do.

"State Legislatures can protect us when the Supreme Court won't
Dear Alex,
Like you, I'm very disappointed about the confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court. I followed the hearings and confirmation vote closely. Now that she's confirmed, it's certain that the court's balance is skewed for decades. I fear what the future may hold for some of our most fundamental rights and values.
With a 6-3 right-wing activist Supreme Court, state legislatures are the ONLY line of defense against the role-back of many previous Supreme Court rulings.
* Roe v. Wade could be overturned, pushing the question of abortion back to the state level.
* Federal protection of marriage for all could be lost, making it an issue determined state by state.
* Non-discrimination laws for LGBTQ and persons of color could be rolled back, leaving only state protections.
* Affordable Care Act protections for preexisting conditions and insurance coverage could be lost, leaving it in the hands of the states.
* Fortunately, with Democratic Majorities, the Maine Legislature has enacted laws in these critical areas.
That’s why our campaign to keep a Democratic Majority in the State Senate is so important. Depending on the outcome of the Federal elections, we could face 4 more years of Trump in the White House, a Republican Senate that will rubber-stamp his actions, and a Supreme Court that has no interest in holding him accountable to the law.
I know you’re receiving countless solicitations. I assure you that your dollars go the furthest right here in Maine. We don’t have a huge budget, but the money we spend has an outsized impact up and down the ticket.
Can you help us make sure we have a strong Democratic Majority to protect against an uncertain Supreme Court future? Click here to give $25 or more.

GOP Targets Maine Senate
Alex,
The Maine State Senate is THE TOP TARGET for the Maine GOP. They have nowhere else to go. They don't have any chance to flip the House. Janet will be in the Blaine House for 2 more years.
The only place they can be competitive is the Senate. They have candidates registered to challenge our vulnerable incumbents across the state. That's why we've been building our campaign for months. Because of your support, last fall, we hosted incredible town halls and house parties. We've hired great staff who are ramping up our efforts.
Our Senate Democrats won't stop fighting for Maine, but they can't do it without all of us working together.
We have just 8 months to make sure that our candidates win. That's why we're asking you to commit to supporting our campaign. Our By the People monthly giving program is the best way for you to help.
This special group of donors agrees to support us with a monthly gift of $20.20.
This ongoing support means that we have to spend less time fundraising and more time organizing, campaigning, and winning. The end of the month is only days away and we need your support today!

Clean Election Candidates
Dear Alex--
Clean Election candidates need your help.
Democratic Senate candidates are registering to run and many have begun their work to qualify for the ballot and Clean Elections funding.
Candidates need to collect 175 five dollar contributions from their district to receive public funding.
We have strong Democratic leaders running for Senate across Maine this year, and many of them need your help to qualify for Clean Elections. The Clean Election Act gives our tireless Democratic leaders the resources they need to be competitive this November, but first they need to demonstrate significant grassroots support by collecting over 175 five dollar contributions.

"Your Internet Privacy Protected
Dear Alex,
This month, Maine became the first state in the nation to prohibit your internet service provider from selling or sharing your personal information. I introduced this groundbreaking internet privacy law because I believe what you do online – whether it’s emailing a loved one, banking, or telehealth – is your business. Your data shouldn’t be up for sale to the highest bidder. Now it won’t be. Maine’s law is a huge step forward for privacy and a model for the rest of the country.
But big telecom isn’t giving up on trying to defeat us and to repeal this law. This month their lobbyists are attending fundraisers for Republican Senate candidates. That would be illegal if the legislature were in session, and my Republican colleagues know that. But big telecom will do everything to stop me and defeat the Senate Democrats who stand up for your rights over corporate profits.
We need your help to fight the big-money sale of our private data to the highest bidder. Can you make a contribution of $5, $50, or $500 to fight back against big telecom?
Thank you for being a partner in this work to advance civil liberties. As Democrats, we’ll always stand up for your rights to privacy and security.
Take care,
Shenna
P.S. Maine Public reported that the fight over this law was “intense – and expensive,” reporting that opponents spent over $181,000 in efforts to defeat it. We’re concerned that now the law’s opponents are preparing to attack us. Can you donate today to show your support for internet privacy and the Senate Democrats who champion it?

"PRESERVING A DEMOCRATIC MAJORITY
Alex,
I wanted to make sure that you had heard about our great candidate in southern Maine. Farmer and small business owner Stacy Brenner recently kicked off her campaign. Brenner is the founder and owner of Broadturn Farm in Scarborough.
While it may be bittersweet news because Senator Linda Sanborn is not running again, we're incredibly excited to have Stacy throw her hat in the ring. She recognizes the importance of agriculture as an economic driver in the state of Maine and is committed to supporting and expanding farmland preservation.
“I’ve spent fourteen years in this community and have had the honor of getting to know many members through our work at Broadturn Farm, which sits at the intersections of Buxton, Gorham, and Scarborough. Now is the time for leaders to step forward and that’s why I’m excited to launch my campaign for State Senate and begin listening and responding to the needs of its constituents.” - Stacy Brenner
Brenner is exactly the type of progressive leader who will help us protect and expand our Democratic majority in the Senate.
For months, we have been hard at work, recruiting candidates and building our campaign. Our goal for last year was to make sure that we have candidates just like Stacy across the state. Now it's time to make sure they win.
With campaigns ramping up all across the state and nation, we're going to need to make sure we have the resources to run strong campaigns in competitive districts like this one.
Can you pitch in $5 or more so we can win these races and continue to move Maine in the right direction?

OUR PLAN HAS
CHANGED
Alex,
Everything about our campaign plan has changed. How are we going to reach voters if we cannot knock on doors? Typically, our candidates would canvass 10,000 households between now and election day. That's unlikely to happen. We need to invest in social media, digital advertising, and other online resources to reach voters.
That's why we've created our Maine Senate Democrats Digital Fund. Every month between now and election day, our goal is to raise $10,000 to help make sure we have the resources to fund our online efforts. So far this month, we've raised $3,480 towards that effort.

"Alex,
I wanted to share with you the results of last night's Democratic Senate primaries. There were 6 races and a total of 12 candidates who threw their hat in the ring. Primary races are an important part of strengthening our democratic ecosystem. We offer a sincere thank you to all of the candidates that put their lives on hold to run for public office.
We congratulate Bev Uhlenhake (SD 8), Joe Baldacci (SD 9), Senator Shenna Bellows (SD 14), Representative Mattie Daughtry (SD 24), and Representative Anne Carney (SD 29) on their victory yesterday. There is one Democratic primary still to be decided in SD 11 - Waldo County. We'll be sure to share the results of the likely ranked-choice runoff once it occurs.
We must now turn our full attention to November. The Maine GOP is going to pour everything they have into flipping the State Senate. It is the only chance they have to seize any power in Augusta. We must not let that happen.

"There are more Democratic Women running for State Senate then ever before.
Proud to be running alongside these women
Alex,
This is big, so I'll be quick: For the first time in history, the majority of candidates running for the Maine Senate are women. Almost 100 years since the first woman was elected to the state senate in 1927, we are still working to bring gender parity to the upper chamber in Augusta.
We have our work cut out for us, but I'm feeling energized and inspired by 21 nurses, business owners, union members, and leaders who have chosen to continue their service in the public arena.
Support our women candidates
I'm ready to dig my heels in and do what it takes to get these women elected, but we don't have much time.
We know because of the unique position these women are in, they need extra resources to give them the platform they deserve.
Maine Senate Democrats are $2,873 short of our $10,000 April budget goal. We can't afford to fall behind. Can you give $25 or whatever you can to support the women of the Maine Senate?
Give $5 now
Give $10 now
Give $25 now
Give $50 now
Give $100 now
I won't forget sitting in the Senate Chamber when I was in the minority. Despite everything we did, the ERA, Reproductive Healthcare funding, and equal pay legislation failed on party-line vote.

"Maine approves double-digit rate cuts for Affordable Care Act insurance
Alex,
The Maine Bureau of Insurance announced a likely 13.1% decrease in the cost of ACA healthcare coverage next year. This announcement is great news for Mainers struggling with the outrageous costs of health care all across our state.
Whether it’s the criminally high costs of prescription drugs or crushing insurance premiums, Senate Democrats have been steadfast in their commitment to make health care accessible and affordable for all Maine people. We’re not afraid to push back against abuses in our health insurance industry or call out corporate greed, especially when Mainers’ lives are on the line.
Since we secured a Democratic Majority in the Senate, we've championed sweeping healthcare reforms. We're delivering on the promises we made during the 2018 election.
Now, we need to make sure that we can keep our Majority. The election is only 63 days away. It's the last day of August. Campaign season is in full swing. Can you chip in to help hit our end of the month goal? We can't do it without you.

"Alex,
This week, State Senate candidate Larry Lockman advocated blocking refugee resettlement in Maine, claiming immigration to our state has been nothing but bad. In the audience was Angela Okafor, a Bangor City Councilor, an immigrant from Nigeria and a small-business owner who said, ""So to stand here and say that we come here to burden the community, that is an insult on ourselves,"" she said. ""And I am here to diffuse that."" *
Lockman has pushed his xenophobic, racist policies on the Maine House of Representatives for eight years. Now, he wants a bigger platform in the Maine Senate. We cannot let him win. He is exactly the sort of candidate that will turn back the clock to the LePage era and undo all the progress that we've made since Democrats took the majority in the Senate.

"100 Years Since the 19th Amendment
Pin by Marie K on Feminism in 2020 | Women right to vote ...
Dear Alex,
Yesterday, we celebrated the 100th anniversary of the ratification of the 19th Amendment, extending voting rights to women in the United States. But, there is still so much more we must do. In reality, countless women of color wouldn’t be granted the same right for decades. We must be mindful of our sisters and neighbors who still face disenfranchisement and discrimination.
Today, our work continues. With a Democratic Majority in the State Senate, we were able to make great progress on issues that matter to women all over the state, expanded access to reproductive healthcare, equal pay for equal work. Yet, there is still so very much we must do to achieve full equality for all.
That's why this upcoming election, particularly at the state level, is so important. If we're going to keep working towards equality, we need to send our great Democratic women candidates to Augusta.
There are just over two months until election day. Can you make a symbolic contribution of $100 to recognize the 100 years that have passed since women earned the right to vote?
Together, we are making a difference.

Candidate Spotlight:
Chloe Maxmin
Chloe Maxmin \(@chloemaxmin\) | Twitter
Alex,
We're excited to introduce Representative Chloe Maxmin, candidate for Maine Senate District 13. Chloe grew up on her family's farm in Nobleboro and is running as a Clean Elections candidate. For as long as she can remember, she has cared so deeply about her community and knew that she would devote her life to serving it. She went to Lincoln Academy for high school and Harvard for college. The day after she graduated, she moved back to build her life in Maine.
She has worked with people across Maine, New England, and the country for fifteen years to call on our political system to fight for us and with us. Folks struggle every day with rising healthcare costs, declining school funding, property taxes, student debt, a changing climate, and more. She believes that our politicians need to stand up for us.
She has represented House District 88 (Chelsea, Whitefield, Jefferson, and half of Nobleboro) since 2018. When she was elected, she promised to represent, to be accessible, to be honest, and to be in the community instead of getting stuck in Augusta.
Chloe has spearheaded the COVID-19 response in her community. Her campaign has shifted all of their grassroots volunteer efforts towards ensuring that everyone in District 13 has the support that they need to get through this crisis.
She and her campaign volunteers are phone banking (from home) to reach out to our senior citizens, especially those who live alone, to make sure that they are okay, and ensure that they will have access to the resources that they need in the coming weeks, like food, insurance/healthcare access, pharmacy runs, and someone to call if they're lonely or need anything at all.
About
Chloe has done incredible work in the Legislature so far, and we think that State Senate is the best place for her to continue standing up for Mainers. She's running to represent Senate District 13: Alna, Boothbay, Boothbay Harbor, Bremen, Bristol, Damariscotta, Edgecomb, Hibberts Gore, Jefferson, Louds Island, Monhegan Island Plantation, Newcastle, Nobleboro, Somerville, South Bristol, Southport, Waldoboro, Washington, Westport Island, Whitefield, Windsor, and Wiscasset.

"The Corruption Stops Here
Alex,
Maine's Republicans are racking up the ethics complaints. Susan Collins is accused of helping her husband make massive amounts of money through her elected office as a US Senator.1
And Republican State Senate candidate Trey Stewart is accused of using thousands of dollars in political contributions to buy new tires and clothing.2
It's time to elect leaders that are working for Mainers rather than themselves. Under Democratic leadership, the Maine Senate passed a package of bills to reform and improve campaign finance and ethics regulations. That package included: LD 54 - reduced the influence of lobbyists, LD 76 - extended the waiting period before legislators may be paid lobbyists, LD 256 - banned the use of leadership PACs for personal profit, and LD 1902 - reformed PAC regulations.
Now is when our candidates need your support the most. We're only 49 days out from the election. Help us amplify our message and makes sure we maintain a solid Democratic Majority in Augusta. We need to stop the corruption and elect honest leaders.

"Breaking: Ranked Choice Voting secure for

Late yesterday the U.S. Supreme Court rejected Republicans' latest attempt to block Ranked Choice Voting for the Presidential Election. This was after a protracted battle waged by the Maine Republican Party as they attempted a People's Veto of the law passed in 2019.
I want to make sure that you know that Maine Senate Democrats are champions of Ranked Choice Voting. In 2019, President Troy Jackson made sure the Senate voted to use RCV for the Presidential Election.
Ever since Poliquin lost to Golden in an RCV recount, the Maine GOP has been on a scorched earth campaign to block its further use. This failed last-ditch attempt to block RCV confirms what we all know; the Maine Republican Party is out of touch with Maine's voters.
If the GOP flips the Maine Senate, you can be sure that RCV will be one of the first things on the chopping block. We need your help to secure our Democratic Majority. Our candidates face tight races, and we'll use your support to make sure that they win.

"All our work could be undone after the November election. That's why our campaign staff is hard at work right now. We're looking at our end of the month fundraising numbers and could use your help.
LOOKING AHEAD
Alex,
I have no doubt that Mainers feel better about their future today than they did before we won in 2018. Since Democrats took control of the State Senate, we've made real progress on issues that matter. Property tax relief. The cost of prescription drugs and healthcare. Looking out for workers and small businesses. Protecting families. Working towards energy independence.
All our work could be undone after the November election.
That's why our campaign staff is hard at work right now. We're looking at our end of the month fundraising numbers and need your help to keep this campaign on the right track. We've raise $5,120 since yesterday and we've almost hit our goal.

We can't afford to have the GOP turn back the clock.
Take care.

"Susan Collins' DIRIGO PAC Spends Big in Maine Senate Races
Alex,
Susan Collins sent $5,000 from her PAC to support Republican State Senate Candidates. She knows what we know. Down ballot candidates drive voter turnout.
Collins' DIRIGO PAC has supported some of the most extreme, right-wing candidates Maine has ever seen. Candidates like Rep. Larry Lockman, who uses his Maine First Project to spew hate and vitriol.
Collins is in the fight of her political career and is funneling money to the state senate races that are key to her staying in office. Our campaign cannot survive without grassroots donors just like you. We need your help to fight back against Susan's corporate dollars.

"Senate District 22: Durham, Greene, Leeds, Lisbon, Litchfield, Sabattus, Turner, Wales, and Wayne.
Candidate Spotlight:
Martha Poliquin
Alex,
We're excited to introduce Martha Poliquin, candidate for Maine Senate District 22. Martha is a 33 year resident of Lisbon where she lives with her husband Joe and 98-year-old father, Richard. She is the mother of three grown children, Matthew, Katherine, and Emily, who graduated from Lisbon High School. She learned the importance and value of serving her community from her parents, who taught her ‘if you can, you do’. She knows that public service is about using your time, energy, and heart to help make life better for the people around you.
Her commitment to our community has always been about providing opportunities for children and families. Her involvement includes being a Girl Scout troop organizer and troop leader, Cub Scout Pack 109 Den Leader, a volunteer in Lisbon schools, Lisbon Recreation Ski Program volunteer, MTM Parent Action Group, serving on the Lisbon School Committee 1995-2001, Literacy Volunteers, Lisbon Performing Arts Center Initiative.
As a School Nutrition professional with over 23 years of experience in Maine schools, Martha's mission and passion is to provide our children with healthy school meals. She is a member of the Maine School Nutrition Association and Maine Farm-to-School Network (serving on the Leadership Council). She wants to bring these experiences and ties with our community and state to the Maine Senate.
As Board Chair, she led the Lisbon School Board through a school construction project to close two aging elementary schools and build Lisbon Community School. As co-chair of the Lisbon/MSAD 75 Consolidation Committee, she helped the Lisbon School Department navigate the potential consolidation with MSAD 75, with the ultimate decision for Lisbon to stand alone and remain independent. She knows how to listen and work to find solutions to difficult problems.
Martha's experience and dedication to serving Maine's children is exactly what we need in the Maine State Senate. She's running to represent Senate District 22: Durham, Greene, Leeds, Lisbon, Litchfield, Sabattus, Turner, Wales, and Wayne.

"Campaigning in the time of COVID-19 is a whole new ballgame.
Campaigns will be Different
Alex,
I'll get right to the point. Campaigning this year will be different. Democratic Senate candidates won't be knocking on doors like usual. We are going to have to spend more money on digital organizing and advertising.
We have a great plan to make sure we reach voters, but it's going to be far more expensive than it has been in the past. That's why we've created the Maine Senate Democrats Digital Fund. Every month we need to raise $10,000 to fund our digital efforts. We're close to hitting our monthly goal, but I need your help to push us past the finish line.

GOP Wires $25,000 to Maine
Alex,
On Friday, we told you how our opponents, the Maine Republican Senate Majority, have already spent nearly $15,000 supporting their candidates. On Saturday, their national partner, the Republican State Leadership Committee, wired them an additional $25,000.
We already thought that the Maine State Senate was a top GOP target. NOW WE KNOW.
Thousands of dollars are going to be spent to flip the Senate back to GOP control. It's likely that they could do it; the Senate has flipped 4 times in the past decade.

I'll make this quick. If you're anything like me, I'm sure you're trying to wrap up work so that you can get outside, enjoy our great state, and this warm weather.
I just wanted to make sure that you had seen this email from Troy. I'm 100% focused on fundraising right now. I know that over the next month, money will flow in huge amounts from national sources to our opponents. The attacks on our hard-working candidates are going to be unrelenting.

""In logging, I was never hired to do half the job, nor was I able to pick and choose which parts of the job I wanted to do. The same is true for the Legislature.""
Alex,
The hypocrisy from my Republican colleagues is really getting old. After months of playing politics and calling for the Legislature to reconvene, Republicans ultimately refused to do their jobs and blocked a special session.
I'll get straight to the point; Republicans are playing politics about going back to work because they think it'll help them in November.
Right now, there are measures to support Maine businesses who stepped up to produce PPE during this crisis, help families access clean drinking water, and ensure people can afford their prescription drugs. We also have the opportunity to deliver targeted relief to small businesses and families that have been hit incredibly hard by this unprecedented crisis.
It's only 95 days until election day. The Republicans are following the Trump playbook. Make a lot of noise, get a lot of press, but don't actually do anything.
I'm fighting to elect real champions who want to show up for working-class Mainers.
I wouldn't ask if it wasn't important - right now is when we need it most in order to amplify our message. Can you chip in $25 before our midnight deadline?
In solidarity,
Troy

"Alex,
He will not give up.
Larry Lockman lost his Republican primary election for Senate District 8 by roughly 60 votes. He's not willing to accept the result and has requested a recount.
That recount is TODAY.
Like his boss, President Trump, he is not willing to accept reality or the peaceful transfer of power our democracy relies on.
The only thing standing between another overt racist and bigot in the Maine Senate is the protection of 60 votes.
We need the manpower to watch this recount closely.

Some of our elected officials are fomenting discontent and unrest by organizing protests in Augusta. The real leaders are helping to address the needs of our state's most vulnerable.
Leaders like Kalie Hess. Right now, Kalie is helping to organize a statewide effort to distribute more than 40,000 toothbrushes, floss, and toothpaste to kids who receive free and reduced meals across the state.
Kalie has dedicated her career to public health and is exactly the sort of person we want leading the way. She has worked to help reduce youth substance use, create healthier public spaces, help people get health insurance, improve health center operations, and design transportation systems that work for people.
She volunteers with Augusta’s bicycle and pedestrian safety group, Augusta Age-Friendly, Viles Arboretum, and is on the board of Community Housing of Maine. Kalie is dedicated to making sure people can get and afford the medical care they need, protecting Maine’s environment, building strong communities, and addressing Maine’s workforce needs.

"5 Candidates
Receive Endorsement
Alex,
I'm very excited to share that Future Now Fund has endorsed 5 Democratic State Senate Candidates.
In 2018, Future Now Fund helped make Maine a Democratic trifecta. But there are five Democratic senators representing districts Donald Trump won in 2016. To make sure Maine only moves one way—forward—we have to invest to defend and grow these new majorities.
Maine is the ultimate example of the power of state legislatures. Just a year ago, the state was best known for the extremist politics and Trumpian behavior of Paul LePage. Now, the Democratic-controlled legislature is delivering to help people get healthy, stay healthy, and lead better lives.
* Fought to ensure workers get a fair shot with bills implementing paid sick leave and ending the gender wage gap.
* Pursued innovative health care initiatives to bring down drug costs and prohibit insurance companies from discriminating against pregnant women.
* Invested in Maine's infrastructure by expanding rural broadband and funding much-needed repairs for roads and bridges.
* Pushed for universal pre-K and innovative ideas to bring down the cost of college.
* Implemented Medicaid expansion, with 10,000 Mainers gaining health care coverage in its first three months.
Future Now knows how important it is to maintain our Democratic Majority. That's why they've endorsed Senate President Troy Jackson, Rep. Chloe Maxmin, Sen. Ned Claxton, Stacy Brenner, and Joe Rafferty.

Dear Alex,
I am gravely concerned about the days ahead, particularly when it comes to supporting our teachers and children. The US Senate has adjourned without considering additional economic relief for our struggling families. CARES Act funding is drying up, and the pandemic is surging. That is the price of failed leadership.
Never has it been more clear to me that we need good leaders in Augusta. We need steady hands and clear heads to steer us through the next 2 years. If Republicans flip the Maine State Senate, you can be sure we'll face obstruction just like we're seeing Washington.

"EVERY VOTE MUST BE COUNTED
Dear Alex,
Donald Trump and his Republican Party are willing to sow unrest by declaring victory before every vote is counted. This will have a profound impact on the very fabric of our democracy. In Maine, our State Senate races are often determined by less than 500 votes, and we don't have to look very far back at all to see how close they can be.
In 2014, Democratic Senator Cathy Breen was declared the victor on election night by 32 votes. After a recount, her opponent was declared the winner by 11 votes and sworn into office. Yet, because we had the resources to challenge that recount, after a 5-hour hearing and meticulous inspection of the ballots, Senator Breen was proven to be the winner.
You can't make this stuff up. We must have the resources to make sure every vote is counted correctly. We cannot begin to imagine what sort of shenanigans will be pulled by the Republicans.

doesn't get it

First: Dana Dow calls for the legislature to return to strip Governor Mills of her emergency powers, putting federal funding for PPE and testing for frontline workers in jeopardy.

Today: He finally admits his calls were just a political stunt. “It was a bit of a shot across the bow,” he said. “Maybe through the bow.”

"Mike Pence, Trump's top Surrogate, will be in Maine Monday
🚨BREAKING🚨:
Mike Pence will Campaign in Maine on Monday
Dear Alex,
We know national Republicans are targeting Maine. That's why Pence is visiting on Monday. The path to victory on a state and national level goes straight through our Maine Senate races. Susan Collins knows. Trump knows.
Not on our watch.
That's why an anonymous donor has agreed to match all contributions to our campaign before Pence visits at noon tomorrow. They understand the stakes. We need to have strong campaigns from the bottom up. Last election, Maine Senate candidates turned 114 municipalities red to blue. That's exactly the down ballot support that all Democratic campaigns need to win in November.
Help make sure our Senate Democrats have the resources to maintain our majority and STOP THE RED WAVE from sweeping away all the progress we've made since the last election.
Your contribution will be matched dollar for dollar until noon tomorrow. Can you help with $20.20 or more right now?
Thanks for all that you do.

"Momentum seems to be on our side.
Alex,
I wanted to make sure this email didn't get lost in your inbox. The CNN model is exciting news, and we're just hours away from the end of the quarter. I want to make sure we maximize the matching gift opportunity.
Our State Senate is THE battleground in Maine State politics. Control has flipped between GOP and Democratic control four times in the last decade.
Nowhere does your contribution go further. We have a small budget (particularly compared to the US Senate race), and every single dollar counts. Control of the State Senate means the difference between continuing to make progressive change or gridlock in Augusta.
Your gift now means we will have double the resources to make sure we win in November.
Thanks,
Julia Brown

New Polling Data is Good News for Democrats
Alex,
I'll be honest; some days are better than others.
CNN's new model predicts Republicans ""to suffer a 'historic defeat' in November"" because the national response to COVID19 and unemployment has been an embarrassment.
Folks are looking for leadership in DC, and again find themselves on their own. Here in Maine, over the past two years, we've been working to fix the mistakes of the LePage administration. The best way to make sure things keep moving in the right direction is to keep and possibly expand our Democratic Majority.
I've made a career representing those of us who feel overlooked and forgotten. I'm able to do that because I'm one of those forgotten folks too.
That's why when we get good news, I have to share it with a supporter like you.
Models and polling mean one thing: We have a pathway to victory. Now we must put in the work.
I've never been one to take a victory lap. When we get good news, we double down.
That's why every gift given until the end of the day will be matched.
I hate to ask, but I know this is what it takes to win. Can you rush a $10 contribution ($20 value) before our midnight deadline? We must keep our momentum going.
Take care,
Troy

"\- Koch Brothers funnel $500,000 to Maine Senate races \- 5 senate seats flipped blue to red \- Democrats lose the majority \- Corporate interests dominate Maine state politics
It Happened
File:Red [[URL REDACTED]] - Wikipedia\- Koch Brothers funnel $500,000 to Maine Senate races
File:Red [[URL REDACTED]] - Wikipedia\- 5 senate seats flipped blue to red
File:Red [[URL REDACTED]] - Wikipedia\- Democrats lose the majority
File:Red [[URL REDACTED]] - Wikipedia\- Corporate interests dominate Maine state politics
It reads like a bad dream. But that's exactly what happened in 2010. The Koch Brothers spent $500,000 to flip the Maine Senate. Democrats lost 5 seats and the majority. And it could happen again.
If we lose the majority, our progressive agenda grinds to a halt. Corporate special interests get exactly what they want. The GOP can't flip the Maine House. Governor Mills isn't on the ballot. So they're going to pour every cent they have into flipping the Maine Senate.
It's daunting, but we have people just like YOU on our side. Every dollar we raise from grassroots donors helps us stand up to the Koch Brothers. We cannot do it without you.
That's why we're asking for your help today. Can you chip in with a contribution right now?

"Campaign Year Begins
Alex,
We've been laying the plans for a win in 2020 for months. Because of your support, this fall, we hosted incredible town halls and house parties. We've recruited great candidates who are kicking off their campaigns all across the state. Our staff is ramping up our efforts.
I won't stop fighting for Maine, but I can't do it without all of us working together.
We have just 10 months to make sure that our candidates win. The Maine Senate is a top Republican target and they're going to do everything they can to defeat us. We're asking you to commit to supporting our campaign. Our By the People monthly giving program is the best way for you to help.
This special group of donors agree to support us with a monthly gift of $20.20.
This ongoing support means that our candidates have to spend less time fundraising and more time organizing, campaigning, and winning. The end of the month is only days away and we need your support today!

"Moving in the Right Direction
Alex,
I'm proud to say that Senate Democrats have been at the forefront of putting our state back on track after 8 years of the LePage administration. The state of our state is strong.
Under Democratic leadership we:
✓ Delivered on Property Tax Relief
✓ Passed Pay Equity Bill
✓ Expanded Access to Reproductive Healthcare
✓ Banned Foam Containers and Single-Use Plastic Bags
✓ Created First-in-the-Nation Paid Leave
✓ Banned Conversion Therapy
✓ Protected Internet Privacy
There is still so much to do. That's why we're ramping up our campaign in advance of the 2020 election. We need to protect our majority if we're going to keep making progress. With just 11 months left, we cannot do it without you.
We're building a people-powered, grassroots campaign one donor at a time. If you haven't supported us yet, now would be a great time to get on board.
Can you pitch in so we can win across the state in 2020 and continue to move Maine in the right direction?

"The Republican State Leadership Committee wired the Maine Republican Senate campaign $25,000.
Grassroots Counter to GOP Investment
Alex,
Earlier this month, we told you how the Republican State Leadership Committee wired our Senate GOP opponents $25,000. We set an ambitious goal of matching that amount by the end of the month from grassroots donors just like you.
The good news is that we've made incredible progress towards that $25,000. So far, we've raised $22,347. We're so close to hitting our goal, but we need your help.
We already thought that the Maine State Senate was a top GOP target. NOW WE KNOW.
Thousands of dollars are going to be spent to flip the Senate back to GOP control. It's likely that they could do it; the Senate has flipped 4 times in the past decade.

"Democrats put Patients First
I'm excited to share this with you, Alex.
People across this state are tired of being screwed by our dysfunctional healthcare system. I know, because I am too.
That's why today we announced a package of new legislation that will shake up our healthcare system. We're calling it the Patients First health care package.
The Patients First health care package:
➔ Gives Mainers an advocate on their side when they go up against big insurance companies;
➔ Clamps down on abusive billing practices that nickel and dime Maine families at the worst times of their lives;
➔ Protects Mainers from spending their life savings on life-saving medication.
I won't mince words. What we were able to do today was only possible with a Democratic majority. We're putting people first and we're making real progress on issues that matter. That's why we are hard at work, right now, building our campaign so that we can win again in November.
I wouldn't ask if it wasn't important. We cannot win without you. Can you chip in $5, $10 or $25 today?

Alex,
Breaking news...Republican absentee ballot requests are higher then ever before. They're fired up, and with Trump on the ballot in November, our path to victory is becoming less clear. Even more concerning, serious Republican challengers have filed to run all across the state.
Our Democratic Majority hangs in the balance.

I NEED YOUR HELP
Alex,
You've heard from State Senator Shenna Bellows.
You've heard from Executive Director Julia Brown.
Now I'm reaching out.
Here's some of what we've accomplished with a Democratic Majority:
✔Increased funding for our rural hospitals and ambulance services
✔First in the nation paid sick leave for Maine workers
✔Solidified protections for pre-existing conditions
✔Responsibily put more money in the Rainy Day Fund than any administration before, preparing us for crisises like COVID-19
But our work is far from done. We need to send responsible leaders back to Augusta this November.
I won't beat around the bush. We're still short of our April fundraising goal.
We still have $1,776 left to raise in order to hit our goal of $10,000.
There's a few hours left, can you rush a contribution of $25?

"Maine is Trump's Path to Victory
Alex,
Maine is again in Trump's crosshairs. Lara Trump, his daughter-in-law, is scheduled to be in the state as part of the ""Women Vote Trump"" bus tour. This is the 2nd Trump visit in just over a month.
Why? Because it's an essential part of his path to victory. Maine is also critical for the GOP to maintain a Republican Majority in the US Senate.
Stop them in Maine and close their path to victory.
Lara Trump and other surrogates are already making waves with this visit. They misled a local business when scheduling an event, and the business closed for the day when they don't want to be associated with the campaign. The ""Women Vote Trump"" bus tour has now relocated at an INDOOR venue, further proof of Trump's disregard for public health.
Let's send the whole Trump family a message. Maine women (and men) don't want you here! We're not voting Trump, and we're not voting Collins.
Victory for Democrats starts here.
Down ballot Democratic Senate candidates are driving turnout, building local capacity, and will keep Maine blue.
Can you chip in $20.20 right now to show Trump and his family that they're not welcome?

"Breaking: Court Upholds
Ranked Choice Voting for
Presidential Election
Dear Alex,
Yesterday the Maine Supreme Court ruled that we will use Ranked Choice Voting for the Presidential Election. This was after a protracted battle waged by the Maine Republican Party as they attempted a People's Veto of the law passed in 2019.
Maine Senate Democrats are champions of Ranked Choice Voting. Senate President Troy Jackson made sure that this most recent expansion of RCV was passed and signed into law.
RCV has long been the boogeyman of the GOP. This latest attempt to block RCV confirms what we all know; the Maine Republican Party is out of touch with Maine's voters.
If the GOP flips the Maine Senate, you can be sure that RCV will be one of the first things on the chopping block. We need your help to secure our Democratic Majority. Our candidates face tight races, and we'll use your support to make sure that they win.

into our State
Alex,
I can barely look at anything online without seeing an ad for Trump, Collins, or their conservative allies. And we're still more than 4 months away from election day. The political noise is just going to keep getting louder.
In the grand scheme of things, our campaign to keep a Democratic Majority in the State Senate is relatively small. We don't have a multi-million dollar ad budget. We need to make sure our messaging reaches voters.
Help us cut through the noise
We may be small, but local candidates have the biggest impact on the lives of Mainers. That's why our campaign is by the people and for the people.
Here's what our State Senate majority accomplished so far for Mainers:
Blue check mark - Transparent PNG & SVG vector fileTook concrete steps to address climate change
Blue check mark - Transparent PNG & SVG vector fileFirst in the nation paid time off
Blue check mark - Transparent PNG & SVG vector fileEnacted equal pay for equal work
Blue check mark - Transparent PNG & SVG vector filePassed a package of 6 reproductive health bills
Blue check mark - Transparent PNG & SVG vector fileDirect relief to property taxpayers

"Collins Supports Extremists
Alex,
We have to hand it to Senator Collins; she's been able to pull the wool over our eyes and pretend to be moderate for decades. But when the going gets tough, and we need a leader, she has failed. To defeat Susan Collins, we have to look at every facet of her strategy and work harder and smarter.
What has become abundantly clear, is that Susan Collins needs significant organic support from down-ballot state senate candidates. At a local GOP meeting in Bristol this year, she said that the Republican's path to maintaining control of the US Senate is through the ME State Senate.
Susan Collins has been building a down-ballot strategy for years. Her Dirigo PAC has supported some of the most conservative, extreme Republican candidates in the state. She has endorsed candidates like Larry Lockman, who in the midst of the worst global pandemic in over 100 years, continues to undermine our state's efforts to save lives.
Collins knows that her path to re-election is through embracing the far right of the Republican Party. This can have profound implications on our State Senate campaigns. Her PAC has MILLIONS OF DOLLARS that has gone to support far-right, anti-choice, anti-LGBTQ legislators.
Help us out-smart Susan Collins, keep Maine Blue, and keep our democratic ecosystem healthy.

"$75,000 to Flip the Senate
Dear Alex,
I feel like a broken record. Since January, I've been saying that the Maine State Senate is a top target for national Republicans. The most recent campaign finance report confirms it. The GOP establishment in Washington has ALREADY sent $75,000 to be spent in Maine on State Senate races.
There are 8 open seats in the Maine Senate. The GOP has to win just 4 of those to flip the chamber. That is exactly what has happened every single time Democrats have had a majority in the past decade. The attacks are coming. We cannot let them take the Senate and block our progressive agenda for the next two years.
Now is the most critical time. We're just 66 days away from election day. The funds we're able to raise now will inform everything that we're able to do over the coming weeks. With the end of the month fast approaching, I'm working as hard as I can every single day to make sure we have the resources to win.
Can you help us keep our Democratic Majority with an end of the month contribution of $20 right now?

"Defeating Republicans
ONE AT A TIME
Alex,
I have great news to share. Rising star Rep. Chloe Maxmin announced that she is taking on career politician Dana Dow, the GOP's Senate Minority Leader.
Rep. Maxmin was first elected in 2018 and flipped House District 88 red to blue for the first time in recent history. Chloe earned national attention for her house race, receiving endorsements from President Obama and EMILY's List.
This year Dana Dow led his party's efforts against pay equity and to roll back reproductive healthcare funding. It's time to kick out the GOP's LePage era allies like Dow and replace them with progressive Democrats.
Rep. Maxmin is an energetic, progressive leader who will help expand our Democratic majority in the Senate.
For months, we have been hard at work recruiting, candidates and building our campaign. Our goal for last year was to make sure that we have candidates just like Rep. Maxmin across the state. Now it's time to make sure they win.
With campaigns ramping up all across the state and nation, we're going to need to make sure we have the resources to run strong campaigns in competitive districts like this one.
Can you pitch in $5 or more so we can win these races and continue to move Maine in the right direction?

"""In logging, I was never hired to do half the job, nor was I able to pick and choose which parts of the job I wanted to do. The same is true for the Legislature.""
Alex,
The hypocrisy from my Republican colleagues is really getting old. After months of playing politics and calling for the Legislature to reconvene, Republicans ultimately refused to do their jobs and blocked a special session.
I'll straight to the point; Republicans are playing politics about going back to work because they think it'll help them in November.
Right now, there are measures to support Maine businesses who stepped up to produce PPE during this crisis, help families access clean drinking water, and ensure people can afford their prescription drugs. We also have the opportunity to deliver targeted relief to small businesses and families that have been hit incredibly hard by this unprecedented crisis.
It's only 95 days until election day. The Republicans are following the Trump playbook. Make a lot of noise, get a lot of press, but don't actually do anything.
I'm fighting to elect real champions who want to show up for working-class Mainers.
I wouldn't ask if it wasn't important - right now is when we need it most in order to amplify our message. Can you chip in $25 before our midnight deadline?
In solidarity,
Troy

Alex,
In 2018 Senator Ned Claxton was a canvassing dream come true. He and his campaign knocked on 13,546 doors in the summer and fall before the election. And he won by the narrowest of margins. In the current environment, knocking on doors like that is just not possible.
That's why we're diverting precious resources into digital organizing, social media, and other online tools. We have an ambitious goal of raising $10,000 every single month to fund those efforts. We're making progress towards this month's goal, but we're still short.

"Maine's Legislature
Could Flip
Dear Alex,
538 just announced: Republicans have only one realistic chance of ending a Democratic trifecta: by flipping either Maine’s state Senate or state House.
We cannot let that happen. If we lose the Senate, the GOP will grind our legislature to a halt. As our state continues to battle and recover from this pandemic, we need good leadership in state government.

"Lepage returns to Augusta, but doesn't leave his car. 'The perfect metaphor' for Republican leadership.
'The Perfect Metaphor for Republican Leadership'
Alex,
LePage, who spent 8 years decimating Maine's public health system, recently returned to Maine and attended an anti-lockdown protest in Augusta. But he remained inside his luxury car. It was called ""the perfect metaphor for Republican “leadership” - talk to the Pro-Virus protesters you stoked up FROM INSIDE YOUR OUT OF STATE LEXUS, then drive away.""*
Senate Democrats recognize the need for strong public health systems. In 2017 we overrode LePage's veto of a bill to fund public health nursing. Since taking the majority, we have expanded access to healthcare, passed paid time off, and introduced the 'Patient's First' slate of bills.
Before the legislature adjourned, Senate Democrats passed emergency legislation to fund the state's response to COVID-19. Since then, your Senators have been working tirelessly, with their efforts entirely focused on constituent services: navigating the unemployment system, supporting businesses & local government, and making sure that their communities have what they need.
That is what real leadership looks like. Senate Democrats are standing up for Mainers, not stoking fear. We need to make sure we keep our Democratic Majority in November. We're counting on your help. We can't do it without you.

"Ignoring Public Health and
Out in Force
Alex,
We have heard dozens of reports from across the state that Republican State Senate candidates were out knocking on doors this weekend. The Press Herald printed a scathing article yesterday about recent GOP campaign events (even with Donald Trump Jr!) that flaunted orders prohibiting indoor gatherings of 50 or more people.*
With the recent news about President Trump's hospitalization we can't help but ask: Do the Republicans care about the health and safety of the public?
Rest assured that Democrats are taking every precaution possible to protect themselves and their communities. We need to make sure we have the resources to cut through the noise and make our message heard by voters. The money we raise now is going straight out into the field to support our candidates.
Can you help our campaign with a contribution of $25 today?

"We Can't Back Down
Dear Alex,
""Democrats have won back over 450 seats and 10 state chambers in the Trump era.""* That includes our Maine State Senate. In 2018, our campaign benefited from broad Democratic reinvestment in state legislative races.
More importantly, our campaign has been rebuilt from the bottom up. In the midst of the worst economic crisis that we've seen in generations, our donor base is stronger and more diverse than ever. Mainers, just like you, recognize the critical importance of good leadership in Augusta.
I want to make sure that it stays that way. We need your support to keep our Democratic Majority in the Senate. We are just 64 days away from the election, and we're up against our end of the month deadline. We need to raise $2,387 more before midnight if we're going to hit our goal and have the funds needed to win.
Can you chip in $10 right now to help put us over the top?

"RESOLUTION:
A DEMOCRATIC MAJORITY
Alex,
We've been laying the plans for a win in 2020 for months. We're recruiting 35 great candidates. We're building our campaign staff and infrastructure. Because of your support, this fall we hosted incredible town halls and house parties all across the state. Now, we're just days away from the end of the year.
I won't stop fighting for the Maine Senate, but I can't do it without all of us working together.
We have just 10 months to make sure that our candidates win. The Maine Senate is a top Republican target and they're going to do everything they can to defeat us. We're asking you to commit to supporting our campaign. Our By the People monthly giving program is the best way for you to help.
This special group of donors agree to support us with a monthly gift of $20.20.
This ongoing support means that our candidates have to spend less time fundraising and more time organizing, campaigning, and winning. The end of the year is only days away and we need your support today!

"Broadband Internet
Alex,
At town halls all across the state, I've heard time and time again that high-speed, reliable internet is a critical piece of infrastructure for growth and development. Senate Republicans have refused to take action on this critical issue. In August, they blocked a bond that would have provided broadband funding.
I'm tired of Maine being left behind. I want a bold new Maine that includes reliable high-speed internet.
That's why Senate Democrats have introduced a bill that would provide $15 million to help build broadband infrastructure in rural Maine communities. Making sure that all Mainers have access to high-speed internet is essential to growing our economy statewide. This bill is just the first step in the right direction.
Standing up to Republican obstructionism is why it is so important to maintain our Democratic majority in the Senate. Many of us are facing Republican challengers. The Senate Democratic Campaign Committee is 100% dedicated to making sure that we win in November.
Can you help make sure that we have the resources to win and elect Democrats that will stand up to Republican obstructionism? Our rural communities can't afford to be left behind.

"The Best Laid Plans
Dear Friend,
Republicans spend $2,000,000 and flip the Maine Senate. That's what the headline could be on November 4th. They have flipped the Senate twice in the past decade. Their national partners have already signaled early investment in our state.
We know that Trump and Mitch McConnell are already spending big here. You see the ads every single day on TV. Their investment in our state can have a profound impact on down ballot races like ours.
We must be ready for any and all attacks. We have a great plan in place to defend our incumbents and to hopefully expand our majority. But if the National Republicans invest, like we think they will, everything could change.
That's why your support right now, at the end of the month and the end of the quarter, is so important. We've nearly hit our goal. Let's make sure we have the resources ready to counter their attacks.

"State Legislatures can protect us when the Supreme Court won't
Dear Alex,
If you’re anything like me, you’ve been following developments around the Supreme Court vacancy very closely. You’ll likely know that Trump has nominated Judge Amy Coney Barrett. She is a favorite of right-wing extremists and, if confirmed, will skew the balance of the court for decades.
In a 6-3 conservative justice future, state legislatures will be the ONLY line of defense against the role-back of many previous Supreme Court rulings.
* Roe v. Wade could be overturned, pushing the question of abortion back to the state level.
* Federal protection of marriage for all could be lost, making it an issue determined state by state.
* Non-discrimination laws for LGBTQ and persons of color could be rolled back, leaving only state protections.
* Affordable Care Act protections for preexisting conditions and insurance coverage could be lost, leaving it in the hands of the states. Fortunately, with Democratic Majorities, the Maine Legislature has already made them into law in our state.
That’s why our campaign to keep a Democratic Majority in the State Senate is so important. Depending on the outcome of the Federal elections, we could face 4 more years of Trump in the White House, a Republican Senate that will rubber-stamp his actions, and a Supreme Court that has no interest in holding him accountable to the law.
I know you’re receiving countless solicitations. I assure you that your dollars go the furthest right here in Maine. We don’t have a huge budget, but the money we spend has an outsized impact up and down the ticket.
Can you help us hit our end of the month fundraising goal with a contribution of $50 today?
Take care,

Donna Bailey
Alex,
We're excited to introduce you to Maine Senate candidate Donna Bailey. Donna is serving her second term in the Maine House of Representatives, representing part of the City of Saco. She currently serves as the House Chair of the Judiciary Committee. Donna graduated from Bates College and was inspired to pursue a legal career by NH Representative Hilda Brungot, her maternal great aunt, who served the longest of any woman in any State legislature.
Donna earned her Law degree in 1986 from the University of Maine School of Law. Her legal career began in real estate law and in 1991 went into private practice where she pursued her career representing clients in State Courts. Donna has served on the Saco Planning Board, Zoning Board of Appeals and as York County Probate Court Judge in the past. She is currently a Mayoral appointee to the Saco Senior Tax Abatement Committee.
Donna developed a strong work ethic at a young age, nurtured and inspired by her mother and grandfather, who worked hard their entire lives in the local mills and factories. She has dedicated her professional and public career to making our state a better place to live. We look forward to Donna bringing that work ethic to the Maine State Senate.

"Candidate Spotlight:
Stacy Brenner
Alex,
We're excited to introduce Stacy Brenner, the Democratic Senate candidate for District 30: Gorham, part of Scarborough, part of Buxton. Stacy is an organic farmer and small business owner who co-founded and now operates Broadturn Farm in Scarborough. She spent her early working career as a nurse-midwife, tending to the births of hundreds of babies at Mercy Hospital in Portland. She is a board member of Maine Farmland Trust and Board Vice-President of the Maine Organic Farmers and Gardeners Organization (MOFGA).
Stacy recently dusted off her nursing license to take a job as a midwife. She went back to work because she was worried about a nursing shortage due to COVID-19. She also looked for a job because, like countless others in Maine, her family needed to find a consistent source of income. With the wedding and summer camp season grinding to a halt, the potential for a complete loss of income from her farm business started to seem real.
Stacy’s strengths rest in her dedication to building meaningful relationships with people in her community. She understands that the first step in creating connection is by listening to the concerns of constituents. When elected, Stacy will collaborate and engage with local community members to help build a strong, inclusive, prosperous Maine.
We're excited to have Stacy running and can't think of a better person to represent Gorham, Scarborough and Buxton.

"LePage just won't go away
Alex,
Did you see that article in the BDN? Paul LePage Looms Large Over Mainers Slate of Republican Legislative Primaries*
“LePage formally endorsed Lockman at a Brewer event last summer. Rep. Larry Lockman, R-Bradley, who has a history of incendiary comments, including a letter from the 1990s asking why rape is not legal since abortion is and saying in 2018 that Democrats are waging a “ war on whites.”
I won't mince words: I won't let Florida resident Paul LePage influence one more Maine voter. He had eight years too long to defund our schools and hospitals. Two elections too long sow hate and division.
His influence can swing critical down ballot purple districts. That's why it's my mission to drown him out with positive Democratic messaging about our legislative accomplishments.
I’m donating $10 every day between now and the July 14th Primary to spite the former Governor and build our positive messaging campaign.

"Alex,
The 2nd quarter reports are out. Republicans have ALREADY spent $14,485 supporting their candidates.
We’ve said it before, and we’ll say it again. Susan Collins and her special interest groups know that down ballot candidates drive turnout for the top of the ticket.
That’s why in every competitive district, the Republican State Senate candidate has publicly endorsed Susan Collins.
So far, they’ve used Collin’s fundraising schemes to invest early in their incumbents. In the last quarter alone, they spent $14,485 supporting candidates. So now we’ve set an ambitious goal to raise $14,485 by the July 14th primary.
We’re not going to let them get the fundraising advantage.
On Wednesday, we rolled out our positive messaging campaign. Today, we’re setting a goal.

New Polling Data is Good News for Democrats
Alex,
I'll be honest; some days are better than others.
CNN's new model predicts Republicans ""to suffer a 'historic defeat' in November"" because the national response to COVID19 and unemployment has been an embarrassment.
Folks are looking for leadership in DC, and again find themselves on their own. Here in Maine, over the past two years, we've been working to fix the mistakes of the LePage administration. The best way to make sure things keep moving in the right direction is to keep and possibly expand our Democratic Majority.
I've made a career representing those of us who feel overlooked and forgotten. I'm able to do that because I'm one of those forgotten folks too.
That's why when we get good news, I have to share it with a supporter like you.
Models and polling mean one thing: We have a pathway to victory. Now we must put in the work.
I've never been one to take a victory lap. When we get good news, we double down.

"Alex,
Republicans made a lot of noise clamoring to reconvene the legislature. But when it's time to vote, they REFUSED TO RESPOND. When the going gets tough, we cannot count on Republican leaders like Trey Stewart and Dana Dow.
Image may contain: text
Our Democratic Senators are taking the lead. For months they've tirelessly worked on behalf of constituents; helping navigate the unemployment system, supporting businesses, and making sure municipalities got the resources they needed. Now, when it's time to go back to work, Democrats are ready.
Republicans: Get your head out of the sand and
get back to work!
When I don't work, I don't get paid. We need to replace these GOP lawmakers with hardworking Democrats. Can you support our Democratic Majority with a contribution of $67, symbolic of the 67 Republicans who refused to respond?
Thanks for all that you do.

"Staff in the Field
Alex,
Republicans are challenging our incumbents across the state. Our path to victory in 2020 is becoming less clear. That's why we're hiring and deploying staff in competitive districts. But we need to hire at least two more staff than we had budgeted.
We have an end of the month fundraising goal of $10,000. If we raise that much we can hire at least one of the two additional field organizers we're going to need in the competitive districts.
We cannot let the Republicans take back the Senate and undo all the progress that we've made.
Can you rush a contribution before the end of the month?

"Anonymous donor to match all gifts before Trump's visit.
Alex,
Trump is coming to Maine on Friday. We don't want him here.
LePage was back in Maine a few weeks ago, fomenting unrest and spurring on protesters in Augusta. Trump is planning on visiting our state even after Gov. Mills raised serious security concerns.
After 8 years under LePage and 3 with Trump in the White House, Mainers know the price of reckless leadership.
We need measured, thoughtful leadership in these challenging times. The Maine Senate and our Democratic Majority is a top target for Republicans on both a state and national level. Susan Collins has acknowledged that State Senate races could directly impact her race, and in turn, control of the US Senate.
That's why an anonymous donor has agreed to match all contributions to our campaign before Trump visits on Friday. They understand the stakes. We need to have strong campaigns from the bottom up. Last election Maine Senate candidates turned 114 municipalities red to blue. That's exactly the down ballot support that all Democratic campaigns need to win in November.
Your contribution will be matched dollar for dollar. Can you help with $20.20 or more today?
Take care,

"Overwhelming Response
Double Matching Gift
Dear Alex,
In less than 24 hours, President Trump will bring his vitriol and divisive message to Maine.
Yesterday, we had a generous anonymous donor agree to match all contributions before he arrives. They have been overwhelmed by your support.
Today, they're so impressed that they've agreed to double their matching gift if we hit 250 donors by the time Trump arrives. Right now, we're at 153.
Can you help us unlock this incredibly generous offer with a contribution today? Your support will be matched 2 to 1. $10 becomes $30. $50 becomes $150. $100 becomes $300.
I can't tell you how much this means to our campaign. You know that the Maine Senate a top target of national Republicans. Every dollar we can raise today means we can spend more time organizing and less time fundraising.
Click here to help hit our 250 donor goal and unlock the 2 to 1 match.
Thanks for your continued support.

"We Need Sound Leadership
Alex,
GOP Minority Leader Dana Dow is undermining public health. He just said, ""we learned to live with HIV"" and so should learn to live with the deaths caused by COVID19. He wants to strip Governor Mills of her emergency powers.
We don’t need legislators in Augusta who can’t understand the basic differences between HIV and COVID19. Putting aside the blatant disrespect that Dow has for the nearly 800,000 Americans that die each year from HIV/AIDS, this is dangerous.
Support our Democratic Majority
Our Democratic leaders value public health. With the majority, they have passed legislation supported by sound science and reason.
With Democrats in charge:
\- Expanded access to Medicare
\- Increased funding for our rural hospitals
\- Passed first in the nation paid sick leave
\- Solidified protections for pre-existing conditions
\- Strengthed immunization requirements for our schools.
This is why majorities matter. Dana Dow's views have no place in Augusta. We don’t need politicians who are willing to play politics with people's lives.
Our campaign needs your help to win. Click here to rush a contribution of $5, $10, $25 or more.

"A Majority Lost
Alex,
After a year of incredible progress in Augusta, it is almost unthinkable to consider that we might lose our Democratic majority in 2020.
WE CANNOT LET THAT HAPPEN.
The Maine GOP is targeting the State Senate with everything that they have. It is the only place that they have an opportunity to gain power. If they win, we can expect 2 more years of LePage era obstructionism.
We are doing everything we can to keep our majority.
As we close out the year, our team is hard at work. Incumbents are building their campaigns. We are recruiting and training our candidates. Our SDCC staff has built a framework for success and a path to victory.
Support our campaign before the end of the year!

"Mike Pence, Trump's top Surrogate, will be in Maine today.
Pence at Dysart's Today
MATCHING GIFT
Dear Alex,
The Maine Senate and our Democratic Majority is a top target for Republicans on both a state and national level. Susan Collins has acknowledged that State Senate races could directly impact her race, and in turn, control of the US Senate. That's why VP Mike Pence is campaiging at Dysart's near Bangor today.
Northern Maine could be THE CRITICAL DISTRICT of this election. And your Maine Senate Democratic canidates are hard at work. From Allagash to Auburn, Bethel to Belfast, Caribou to Calais, and every city and town across the state, our campaign has the proven track record of turning out voters for Democrats.
That's why an anonymous donor has agreed to match all contributions to our campaign before Pence visits at noon. They understand the stakes. We need to have strong campaigns from the bottom up. Last election, Maine Senate candidates turned 114 municipalities red to blue. That's exactly the down ballot support that all Democratic campaigns need to win in November.
Help make sure our Senate Democrats have the resources to maintain our majority and STOP THE RED WAVE from sweeping away all the progress we've made since the last election.
Your contribution will be matched dollar for dollar until noon. Can you help with $20.20 or more right now?
Thanks for all that you do.

“Every day in Augusta we hear politicians talk about supporting Maine businesses and workers but when push comes to shove, it looks like it’s all empty promises. This bill was about rewarding companies that do right by the state and the hardworking people who live here. Too many Canadian companies are getting away with taking jobs away from Mainers and not paying their property taxes. It’s just not right.""
-Pres. Troy Jackson
Friend,
Despite prior bipartisan support, Republicans flip-flopped and voted against ""Hire Maine"" legislation. This bill was intended to make sure tax dollars didn’t go to companies that put hiring foreign workers ahead of Mainers. Maine workers and businesses deserve better.
That's why we are hard at work, building our campaign so that we can win in November.

"Maine Senate District 29: South Portland, Cape Elizabeth, and part of Scarborough.
Candidate Spotlight:
Anne Carney
Alex,
We're excited to introduce you to Maine Senate candidate Anne Carney. Anne is currently the Maine House Representative from Cape Elizabeth, where she and her husband David Wennberg have made their home and raised their family since 1988. Anne graduated from the University of Maine School of Law, cum laude, in 1990. She received a B.A. from Haverford College and has a Masters of Theological Studies from Harvard University.
Anne practiced employment, civil rights, and municipal law at Norman, Hanson & DeTroy, LLC, for 16 years, representing businesses, individuals, cities, and towns throughout Maine in state and federal court litigation. She then served as an in-house volunteer attorney with Pine Tree Legal Assistance for 8 years, providing pro bono legal representation to low-income Mainers, fighting for people who have no access to our legal system: women sexually assaulted at work, migrant farmworkers subject to terrible conditions, people who lost work because of their religion or because they were pregnant.
""Anne Carney is just the person we want in the Maine State Senate. She’s already doing important work to protect our families, our future, our environment, and our education.""
-Tom Blake, Former Mayor of South Portland
Anne’s service as a volunteer lawyer for Mainers unable to afford legal representation shows her dedication to the underserved. She has the legal expertise and leadership skills to make a significant impact that benefits Mainers throughout the state in the State Senate.
She is running for Maine Senate District 29: South Portland, Cape Elizabeth, and part of Scarborough.
Help us secure our Democratic majority and support candidates just like Anne all across the state.

"Alex,
In the midst of the worst global pandemic in over 100 years, Republican State Rep. Larry Lockman continues his work to undermine our state's efforts to save lives. Lockman and other extremists are now organizing an IN PERSON PROTEST and asking people from across the state to gather in front of the Blaine House to protest shelter-in-place and social distancing orders.
This is dangerous.
Mainers know that Lockman is wrong, and we must make sure that he isn't elected to the State Senate in November. Our Democratic Senators are spending countless hours every single day, helping constituents and Maine businesses in this time of great uncertainty.
Help make sure that we maintain our Democratic Majority.
Lockman is blatantly spreading misinformation against basic public health regulations. Diligent Mainers are working to flatten the curve while Lockman sows doubt with our hardworking medical and public health experts.
Politicians like Lockman have no place in our State Senate. When someone puts the safety of Mainers at risk, we don't just talk about it. We act.
That's why we've launched the ""Stop Lockman Fund"".
Every time he spreads lies, I'll put $10 into the fund. Can you do your part?
Quick Give $10
Quick Give $25
Quick Give $50
Quick Give $100
We have no choice but to defeat extremists like Lockman.
Thanks for all that you do.
