Burgum Caved on Public Health Order Within Hours; Already Brushed off Paid Leave
BISMARCK, ND — Gov. Burgum’s administration made it a day before rescinding an order that would require close contacts of those who have tested positive for COVID-19 to quarantine. The original order brought North Dakota in line with Center for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines. The state is facing our worst week of COVID-19 outbreaks yet, and leads the nation in per capita cases.
The order was rescinded at the request of North Dakota Republican legislative leaders. Burgum’s refusal to listen to public health experts has cost him two top public health officials since the pandemic began. Earlier this year, Gov. Burgum and Republican leadership also dismissed calls for an Emergency Paid Leave program that would make it financially feasible for North Dakotans to quarantine when necessary.
Rep. Gretchen Dobervich, Chair of the Dem-NPL House Caucus, and a public health professional said:
“This rollback further confuses what exactly the governor expects North Dakotans to do to reduce the surge of COVID-19 across our state and further politicizes a deadly public health crisis. Quarantine, isolation, and physical distancing are centuries-old, evidence-based, public health strategies that reduce risk of infection. We introduced emergency paid leave and other proposals to make it possible for North Dakotans to quarantine without sacrificing their financial stability. Gov. Burgum and the NDGOP shot them down without consideration. COVID-19 is real, serious, and preventable. For the sake of our lives and livelihoods, it is time the governor and Republican leadership treat it that way.”
The Democratic-NPL Party Chairwoman Kylie Oversen said:
“For just a moment, Gov. Burgum indicated he was willing to take advice from public health experts as North Dakota suffers through our worst COVID-19 week yet. But in only a few hours, he caved to just a bit of criticism. His governing is becoming erratic at a time when North Dakotans need clarity and transparency, so we can make the best decisions for our families and communities. Dem-NPL legislators offered solutions like emergency paid leave to make quarantine more viable for North Dakotans, but he ignored them. These guidelines came from the CDC, not from either party, and finding solutions shouldn’t be partisan either.”

Dem-NPL Statement on Emergency Commission's Covid-19 Spending Recommendations
BISMARCK, ND — The Emergency Commission held a specially scheduled meeting Tuesday to make recommendations on more than $524 million in CARES Act money to the Office of Management and Budget as well as millions in other federal money and expenditures. The Legislative Budget Section committee will vote on the allocation on Friday. North Dakota is receiving more than $1.25 billion in federal covid-19 relief funding.
House Minority Leader Josh Boschee and Senate Minority Leader Joan Heckaman, both members of the Budget Section, released the following statements:
House Minority Leader Josh Boschee said:
“We support the commission’s recommendation because we know public employees need funding now and we support the work they’re doing to manage the crisis. But when North Dakota spends hundreds of millions of dollars, we need to ensure the public is able to provide input as part of the process, so we can have a relief plan that works for all North Dakotans. We need to take care of our small businesses and employers, but workers and families are the foundation of our communities and economy.”
Senate Minority Leader Joan Heckaman said:
“The reason we have three branches of government is to hold each other accountable. The reason we have local representatives from every county, town, and city is because each one has different needs and deserves a voice speaking on their behalf. Many small and regional nonprofits and agencies are doing a lot of work they wouldn't normally do, and they also should be at the table. More than a billion dollars in federal money requires greater and earlier input and transparency, so it’s allocated equitably.”

Only 10 days ago, the Dem-NPL announced the state party would cancel it’s in-person convention as part of the public health movement responding to the covid-19 virus and pandemic. Shortly after, Dem-NPL leadership and staff got to work transitioning to online events, such as virtual town halls, video addresses, social media engagement, and other forms of digital campaigning.

Congress: Zach Raknerud
State Treasurer: Mark Haugen

(An address from each candidate is available online at [[URL REDACTED]])
Voting kicked off Saturday with a live introduction from Chairwoman Kylie Oversen
“This has been quite an adventure of a week trying to navigate this new world we’re living in right now, and trying to find ways that we as Democrats, and really as North Dakotans, and Americans can all stay connected during this pandemic crisis and still engage in the business that is required of us.”
Oversen continued
“We know that especially during times of crisis like we’re in right now, having strong and steady leadership is so important. And the Dem-NPL is so proud to put forward a slate of candidates who are competent and talented and smart, and who are connected to their communities. They are excited to get to work for all of you representing this great state of North Dakota.”
Sen. Heidi Heitkamp recorded an address for the event as well
“Now more than ever it is crucial to be active and involved and willing to put the work in for our statewide and legislative candidates. As a many time former candidate, I know that the support of fellow Dem-NPLers and everyday North Dakotans always meant the world to me. We can in fact turn this around. We can in fact be part of solutions for our country, but we have to work for it.”

Raknerud and Dem-NPL Confront NoDak Delegation for Inaction on USPS
Over the weekend, Sen. Hoeven, Sen. Cramer, and Rep. Armstrong, defended President Trump's comments threatening to sabotage the United States Postal Service to limit mail-in voting.
Dem-NPL congressional candidate Zach Raknerud said, ""I wholeheartedly condemn President Trump's actions to slow (USPS) services and holding out relief funding for partisan reasons [...] Too many veterans in rural North Dakota rely on the Postal Service to deliver life-saving medication on time and at low cost. That's exactly what the USPS has done for generations."" Read more here. USPS recently gave North Dakota a ""heightened warning"" for possible delays related to mail-in ballots. Dem-NPL Chairwoman Kylie Oversen called on our delegation to stop playing the blame game and address the crisis. Read more here.

Dem-NPL Legislators and Candidates Condemn Closed Door CARES Act Process
As the Legislative Budget Section approved the last of $1.25 billion in COVID-19 relief, Democratic-NPL legislators and candidates condemned the six-member Emergency Commission for administering a closed-door process that left workers and families behind and more than 200,000 North Dakotans unrepresented. Read more here.
Dem-NPL House Minority Leader Josh Boschee said, “This process was developed to receive tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, a couple of million dollars at a time as budgets changed at the federal level came through. But we’re talking about $1.25 billion. Today it’s $319 million that we have an up-and-down vote on.” Melissa Gjellstad, District 42 Senate candidate said, “To our core issue: how this process has happened and how we can do better for North Dakotans in the future is, I think, the focus."" Read more here.
Kari Breker, Dem-NPL Senate candidate in District 16, which went unrepresented throughout the process, said, “There should have been an emergency legislative session to decide where this money should go. I think bringing everybody to the table instead of six white, affluent men making those decisions, we should have brought way more people to represent everybody in the state.” Read more here.
District 46 House candidate Ben W. Hanson criticized the lack of engagement or clarity from the Emergency Commission, explaining in an interview how the process has not been transparent or public. Hanson's district went unrepresented in the process, and he called for a special session early on. Listen here.
District 4 Senate candidate Lisa Finley-DeVille said: ""It's time for a bottom up approach, meaning give the power back to the people. Too few people are getting a say, and the people of our district deserve a voice. Not one legislator from District 4 spoke up for the people who need assistance and protection the most. Not one of them."" Read more here.
Social Security Turned 85 and Faces Attacks from Trump, Silence From Armstrong
Over 135,000 North Dakotans receive Social Security payments, with many recipients dependent on the program for their income.

NoDak Mail Sorting Machines Planned for Removal, Armstrong Votes Against USPS
BISMARCK, ND — As news broke that United States Postal Service sorting machines in Fargo, Grand Forks, and Bismarck were slated for removal, Rep. Kelly Armstrong voted against a bipartisan bill to support USPS and halt the mail slow-down felt nationwide.
Armstrong has both admitted the systemic problems at USPS and brushed off his constituents’ concerns over the removal of sorting machines, elimination of overtime, and other changes causing a mail slow-down. The Postmaster General is a GOP mega donor, and the president has specifically targeted USPS because of mail-in voting, without recognizing it as a necessity for people to receive life-sustaining prescription medication and lifeline for businesses, especially in rural North Dakota.
The Democratic-NPL Party Communications Director Alex Rohr said:
“Despite Rep. Armstrong’s finger-pointing speech before he voted against the bipartisan bill supporting USPS, the Post Office can and will deliver votes from members of both parties this fall. The bill would officially halt the planned removal of mail sorting machines, including the three in Fargo, Grand Forks, and Bismarck, to ensure North Dakotans have access to mail-in voting as an option. USPS shouldn’t be partisan. COVID-19 relief shouldn’t be partisan. But politicians like Rep. Armstrong are refusing to work collaboratively to solve real problems.
We urge voters to request their ballots now, make a plan, and to cast their vote for Zach Raknerud for Congress who won’t let partisanship get in the way of representing you.”

Burgum Oversees Closed CARES Act Process while Dr. Shelley Hosts a Nonpartisan Roundtable
BISMARCK, ND — Today, a group of six Republicans chaired by Gov. Burgum voted to spend $400 million of CARES Act money without any official public input. The group expects to allocate all $1.25 billion of federal money allocated to North Dakota to address the pandemic economy in the same manner. The Legislative Budget Section, which lacks representation for 14 entire districts, will now get an up or down vote.
Tonight, Dr. Shelley Lenz, the Dem-NPL candidate for governor, is hosting a nonpartisan Listening Session intended to gather input from residents all across the state. More information about the event can be found here.
Sen. Tim Mathern said:
“On the same day the governor ignored calls for a transparent legislative session for spending $1.25 billion to address the covid-19 economy, Dr. Shelley invited members of the public to share what they need to get through the pandemic. We need a leader who is listening, not a CEO telling us he knows best.”

Historic Native American Caucus Founded within Dem-NPL
BISMARCK, ND — This weekend, The North Dakota Democratic-NPL Party State Policy Committee unanimously approved an application to form the Native American Caucus. Prairie Rose Seminole, Dr. Twyla Baker, and Rep. Ruth Buffalo brought the application and are organizing the caucus to build long term political engagement within Indigenous communities and with the Dem-NPL.
All three women are members of the Three Affiliated Tribes. The caucus group is currently more than 40 members who are working on developing a governing structure that includes representation from the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa, Three Affiliated Tribes, and the Spirit Lake Nation as well as setting goals for future engagement. The meeting was held virtually Saturday because of COVID-19.
Rep. Ruth Buffalo represents District 27 in Fargo. She is originally from Mandaree and is the Dem-NPL’s DNC National Committeewoman. Buffalo said:
""This has been a long time coming. Diversity will only strengthen relationships across the state to address the issues that not only face our tribal communities, but our rural and urban populations. More native voices in the political landscape of North Dakota only deepens our understanding of one another, and there is value in knowing who our neighbors are and what impact public policy may have.""
Prairie Rose Seminole is a policy analyst at the Indigenous Environmental Network and program manager at Advance Native Political Leadership. She ran for House District 45 in 2010. Seminole said:
“We’re making a space within the Dem-NPL to house and nurture Native leadership in the state and to make introductions to the party and the platforms, but also to encourage our own leadership where Native North Dakotans can potentially run for office or be an organizer. There’s so much capacity in our community, but we need to build trust within the party.”
Dr. Tywla Baker is president of Nueta Hidatsa Sahnish College. Baker said:
""This will be a learning experience for our communities and for the Dem-NPL. There are different practices and approaches to democratic participation, and we want to establish a practice of building leadership beyond voter engagement. In the long term, we want to nurture relationships for strategic, years-long efforts for structural victories that improve peoples' lives and provide value in the political education needed for more relational governance in North Dakota and our tribal people.""

Gov. Burgum Must Refuse Support to Candidates Who Back Anti-LGBTQ+ Platform
BISMARCK, ND — The NDGOP Executive Committee disavowed an anti-LGBTQ+ portion of the party’s platform Monday only after receiving blowback in the press and from civil rights advocates. Similar language has been in the party platform since 2016 showing a consistent pattern of discrimination and exclusion.
Also, more than 700 North Dakota Republicans voted on this measure and passed it. The names of those individuals have not been made public. Generally, elected officials and candidates are likely to serve as delegates to party committees, so many active NDGOP legislators possibly voted on this measure or support it. As a major donor in his party, Gov. Burgum, and the other executive members, should refuse contributions and any support to any candidate who has not publicly disavowed this hateful platform.
The Democratic-NPL Party Chairwoman Kylie Oversen said:
“Actions speak louder than words, and NDGOP has shown through their actions, or failure to act before public pressure, that many are at best indifferent to LGBTQ+ rights. They made a positive step by denouncing this language, but any dollar spent supporting a candidate who holds these hateful views would completely invalidate their pearl clutching. North Dakotans and LGBTQ+ individuals deserve more than words to know their rights are protected and their lives valued, and we’re calling on the governor and executive committee to show they mean what they say.”

As a Senator and former attorney general for the largest state in the nation, Sen. Kamala Harris will be ready on day one to preside over the Senate and take over as commander in chief if called to do so. With issues as important as protecting social security and access to affordable healthcare at stake in this election, I’m thankful to support a leader who is committed to working families and an economy that works for all Americans.
We have a long way to go before our politics represent the reality of American life. Nowhere is that immediately clearer than the COVID-19 response that has had a devastatingly disproportionate impact on communities of color. As a result, Sen. Harris introduced legislation to address and combat disparities facing under-served communities, and she will continue that work in all facets of public policy.
We are excited to elect the first woman of color to the second highest office in the land. Senator Harris is living proof that representation in public life makes a difference. I’m looking forward to seeing her back on the debate stage.

Diverse Slate of Democratic-NPLers Engaged in Legislative Districts Statewide
BISMARCK, ND — The Democratic-NPL House and Senate Caucuses are excited to announce an energized and engaged slate of candidates running for office across North Dakota. The roster is one of the most diverse tickets in North Dakota history in regards to race, gender, sexual orientation, and geography.
The Democratic-NPL will field 55 legislative candidates, or 80% of the races on the November ballot. The percentage is on par with the 2018 ticket that defeated three incumbents, including the former House Majority Leader, and also swept a Grand Forks legislative district, while holding their own incumbent seats. Monday was the deadline to file for the June primary. The general election is November 3.
House Minority Leader Josh Boschee said:
“We’ve spent the last few weeks fielding calls from motivated candidates who are focused on finding solutions first and foremost for the issues facing their communities everyday, but also the new challenges of campaigning while keeping responsible physical distance. It’s encouraging to see so many candidates energized about prioritizing a North Dakota that works for all.”
Senate Minority Leader Joan Heckaman said:
“Whether it’s East or West, urban or rural, experienced representatives and newcomers are stepping up because their communities don’t feel listened to. This year’s Dem-NPL candidates bring a wide range of public service for local organizations and in elected office as well as a diversity of life experience that truly represents all of North Dakota.”

District 4 Rep Lives in Wyoming, Lawsuit Filed to Remove Him From the Ballot
BISMARCK, ND — Terry Jones, a legislator who is seeking reelection in North Dakota’s House District 4 does not reside in North Dakota and cannot be elected to the seat under the state’s Constitution. A lawsuit was filed this week by Kenton Onstad, a resident of District 4 and chair of the District 4 Democratic-NPL Party. The case follows precedent set by the North Dakota Supreme Court after the North Dakota Republican lawsuit to remove Travisia Martin, Dem-NPL candidate for insurance commissioner, from the ballot last month.
North Dakota law requires candidates for state legislature to be a resident for one year prior to the election, and more than 80% of North Dakotans believe a legislator should live in the district they represent. Jones is currently a registered agent of Jones Brothers Enterprises, LLC in Wyoming. To hold that position, he has asserted he resides in Wyoming repeatedly, as recently as this year, meaning he cannot meet North Dakota’s residency requirement. Jones also owns residential property in Wyoming. His legislative phone number has a Wyoming area code as well.
The Democratic-NPL Party Chairwoman Kylie Oversen said:
“Residents of District 4 deserve a representative who lives in and respects their community, and North Dakotans deserve legislators who live in our state. Jones is showing a flagrant disregard for North Dakota’s Constitution and the people who live in District 4, which includes the Fort Berthold Reservation. His name should be stricken from the ballot, so voters can elect someone to pass North Dakota laws who is actually willing to follow them.
The Dem-NPL has three dedicated candidates in District 4, Thomasina Mandan and Hunter Andes for House and Lisa Finley-DeVille for Senate, who are deeply connected to the district. They will be committed representatives for their community and will work for farmer and rancher rights, safe infrastructure, access to affordable healthcare, and strong support for education.""

Emergency Paid Leave Would Protect Workers, Businesses, Schools and Public Health
FARGO, ND — Rep. Karla Rose Hanson (D-Fargo) and Sen. Erin Oban (D-Bismarck) today proposed an Emergency Paid Leave Fund to protect workers as the coronavirus pandemic continues and cases rise in North Dakota. The Emergency Paid Leave Fund would use CARES Act funds to help workers stay home when they are sick with COVID-19 or after they have been exposed. The fund would serve as an important complement to recent efforts by the state to support businesses in their efforts to inspire and improve consumer confidence to return to the marketplace. View the full press conference here.
Rep. Karla Rose Hanson said:
“Whether people work at a business, in a school or a health care facility, they should be able to stay home when they are sick – for their own health and for the health of their co-workers and the public. However, far too many people go to work when they are sick,” said Rep. Karla Rose Hanson. “A paid leave program can help reduce the spread of infection and prevent outbreaks at places of work, schools and health care facilities like nursing homes and clinics.”
Sen. Erin Oban said:
“At a time when employers are asking workers to return to the workplace and workers are rightly asking for basic protections, too many North Dakotans will continue to face the difficult choice of staying home or receiving a much-needed paycheck because they lack paid time off or they’ve already used up their paid leave,” said Sen. Erin Oban. “Our paid leave program will help families, support North Dakota’s businesses and economy, help schools to safely stay open, and contribute to greater public health in managing this pandemic. It’s a win-win-win-win.”
Terri Hedman, a registered nurse and Senate District 46 candidate, said:
“The Centers for Disease Control and the ND Department of Health say to stay home if you are sick or if you’ve been exposed to someone with COVID-19,” said Terri Hedman, a registered nurse and candidate for state senate in Fargo. “People should not have to choose between their physical and economic well-being. A highly infectious disease in the workplace such as COVID-19 is a danger to many. As fall and winter approach, along with more indoor activity, infection rates will likely rise. Providing supplemental paid leave will help people make the right choice to stay home.”
How would the fund work?
* The proposal would use $20 million from the $1.25 billion in CARES Act funding that North Dakota has received. It would create a fund to pay qualified employees through their employers.
* Eligible workers would receive up to four weeks of pay, with a cap of $1,500 a week, if they are unable to work due to a COVID-19 diagnosis for themselves or a member of their household, or if they have been advised to quarantine due to close contact with a person who has COVID-19, or if their child’s school or daycare is closed due to the pandemic.
* The fund would be in effect through the end of the year due to the requirement to spend CARES ACT dollars in 2020.
* This supplementary leave will especially benefit employees who have already used all their employer-provided leave for the year, as well as employers such as schools that don’t qualify for federal tax credits for pandemic-related leave.
The six-member Emergency Commission is expected to meet again this summer to allocate the remaining $318 million of North Dakota’s CARES Act funding, which must be spent in 2020.
2021 Legislative Session
Hanson and Oban also announced that they plan to introduce a bill during the 2021 legislative session to address the long-term need for paid family leave beyond the pandemic crisis.
Oban said:
“This emergency paid leave fund addresses the immediate needs of families, schools and businesses caused by the pandemic,” Oban said. “But that impossible choice of collecting a paycheck or caring for yourself or a loved one was a problem that existed before the pandemic and it will continue after it. North Dakota working families deserve a long-term paid family leave solution, too.”

Third North Dakota Public Health Official Resigns as State Hospitals Near Capacity
For the third time since the COVID-19 pandemic began, North Dakota’s top public health officer resigned. Dr. Paul Mariani resigned Friday, the day after Gov. Doug Burgum rescinded a public health order that required close contacts of those who tested positive for COVID-19 to quarantine. The order, in place for a single day, put North Dakota in line with the Center for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines. Burgum rescinded the order after pressure from North Dakota Republican leadership.
At the same time, Burgum's administration has misled the public about capacity at hospitals while cases surge. Read more here. Dem-NPL Gubernatorial candidate Dr. Shelley Lenz said ""The numbers are abjectly wrong. Whether that’s incompetence or nefarious, either way the results are the same and people are dying.""
Dem-NPL Leg Candidates Will Protect Coverage of Pre-existing Conditions
This Tuesday, the Dem-NPL held a virtual press conference discussing the increasingly likely possibility that the Affordable Care Act could be overturned by the Supreme Court, and the effect that would have on people's healthcare coverage. As noted by D-46 Senate candidate Terri Hedman, guarantees of coverage for pre-existing conditions would be threatened, as ""The Republican lawsuit will take away these protections, and they have no plan for a [[URL REDACTED]] of us are at risk.""

President Trump's Supreme Court Nominee Threatens Affordable Healthcare
President Trump announced Amy Coney Barrett, who has a written track record of disagreeing with the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision upholding the Affordable Care Act, as nominee for the court. The announcement came before Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was buried. After a legendary career, Ginsburg became the first American woman to lie in state at the Capitol. The president, aided by North Dakota Republican senators, is committed to rushing the nomination in the limited time before the election. North Dakotans have already begun casting their ballots.
Dem-NPL Chairwoman Kylie Oversen challenged Senators Hoeven and Cramer to stand up for healthcare in North Dakota: “If approved before the election, this Justice will hold the fate of access to affordable healthcare in her hands in the middle of a public health crisis. She may decide whether thousands of North Dakotans with pre-existing conditions can keep their coverage. She may determine whether rural hospitals that provide necessary care to much of North Dakota now being hit by COVID-19 can remain operating.""

Dem-NPL Caucus Chair Gretchen Dobervich Challenge NDGOP Leadership for Ignoring Public Health Experts
As North Dakota remains top of the nation in COVID-19 cases per capita, and our hospitals fill up, we need to listen to the experts. Dobervich wrote: ""Neither North Dakota’s governor nor Republican legislative leaders are trained public health clinicians or medical doctors, so it is time they listen to the medical experts. COVID-19 is real, serious and preventable. For the sake of our health, it is time the governor and other Republican leaders treat it that way.""

NDGOP Floods Mailboxes with Mystery Donor Mailers; Gov. Outsources Campaign
BISMARCK, ND — Reports by KX News this week shed a little light on the piles of campaign mail stacking up in North Dakota mail boxes. The primary sources come from the dark money group “Brighter Future Alliance,” Gov. Burgum’s campaign, or the “Dakota Leadership PAC.” Burgum is the “Dakota Leadership PAC’s” biggest donor at just short of $3 million.
A report by KX News on Thursday showed that Burgum's campaign and PAC have foregone the many North Dakota printers he could have used in favor of a Minnesota business. The move is in direct contradiction with his Main Street Initiative. “Brighter Future,” a group with ties to Republican campaign advertiser Odney, has spent at least $253,000, according to KX. The dark money group is not required to report their donors, meaning North Dakotans do not know who is spending hundreds of thousands to influence our elections.
The Democratic-NPL Party Chairwoman Kylie Oversen said:
“I’m not sure which is more disrespectful of North Dakotans: flooding their homes with misrepresentative mailers without telling them who’s paying for the attacks, or sending what could be millions of dollars to an out-of-state business during a public health and economic crisis. The NDGOP is making it clear they’re only interested in a North Dakota that works for a few while our Dem-NPL candidates are running to build an economy that works for all.”

Revolving Door on Burgum’s Cabinet Swings Again Amid Crisis
BISMARCK, ND — The announcement that North Dakota Indian Affairs Commission Executive Director Scott Davis was put on administrative leave begs questions about what exactly is happening in Gov. Doug Burgum’s cabinet amid the COVID-19 crisis. The Davis report follows a pattern of departures this year that includes three chief public health officers resigning during the pandemic as well as exits by the leaders of the Department of Commerce and Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.
A leadership vacuum in public health and economic departments is especially alarming during the twin public health and economic crises of COVID-19. The vacant Indian Affairs position is worrisome as the pandemic has affected Native Americans disproportionately. With close quarters, correctional facilities, like nursing homes, have also faced frequent outbreaks nationally. NDDOCR recently reported an uptick in cases.
The Democratic-NPL Party Chairwoman Kylie Oversen said:
“It is certainly important to investigate any allegations of misconduct by any public official. But, with yet another cabinet member stepping away from their post, North Dakotans and public workers deserve to know what’s going on with their state leadership team. Every time the cabinet door swings around, it becomes clearer and clearer that Gov. Burgum’s leadership approach and unwillingness to take any decisive action is not working. His so-called “light touch of government” is hurting both lives and livelihoods. We need to elect leaders like Dr. Shelley Lenz, who will govern with transparency and collaboration, so we can get out of this pandemic and move on to an economic recovery that works for all North Dakotans.”

Dem-NPLers Call for Protections of Coverage for Pre-existing Conditions
NDGOP Attack on Access to Affordable Healthcare Continues
BISMARCK, ND — Dem-NPL Legislative Candidates today called for protections for coverage of pre-existing conditions no matter what happens in Washington, D.C. and in the November election. Currently, under the Affordable Care Act, insurance companies cannot charge higher rates or deny coverage because of a pre-existing health condition. COVID-19 is having long term consequences that will be considered pre-existing conditions. More than 20,000 people in North Dakota have tested positive for the virus.
While NDGOP leaders support the lawsuit to repeal the ACA, also part of the NDGOP platform, they have not introduced a solution to deal with the repercussions when tens of thousands of North Dakotans lose coverage, protections for pre-existing conditions are eliminated, and rural hospitals lose much-needed funding from Medicaid expansion. In the 2019 legislative session, the Dem-NPL introduced the Holman Amendment to protect coverage of pre-existing conditions regardless of the outcome. North Dakota Republicans stopped this bill from passing.
The press conference was broadcast on Facebook Live and can be viewed on the Dem-NPL Facebook page.
Terri Hedman, candidate for District 46 Senate, and a registered nurse, said:
“The bill would prevent any gaps in coverage that could threaten life or livelihood while also protecting the ability for people with pre-existing conditions to get coverage in the future. It’s a simple bill and a plan that will keep healthcare secure for tens of thousands of North Dakotans, which is especially important as we continue through the public health crisis.”
Krisanna Holkup Peterson is the District 32 House candidate, a paraprofessional for students with disabilities, and mother of a son with significant health needs. Holkup Peterson said,
“Mothers, fathers, grandparents, and other caregivers regularly have to work this hard and harder to access healthcare, and before the Affordable Care Act, it was even more expensive for people with pre-existing conditions because their care is often more specialized, harder to access, and more expensive. Protecting coverage for pre-existing conditions is an important step that should have already been taken.”
Jodi Meisch, House District 22 candidate, and an advocate for people who are deaf and hard of hearing, said,
“Providing assurance of coverage, regardless of medical history, is more than good policy for one of the most highly regarded states in our first world country. It is a human rights commitment that has provided positive outcomes for many years, and it would be a disservice to the American guarantee of life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness to eliminate it without a replacement plan. North Dakota’s entire population, especially those already excluded behind barriers to equality and accessibility, deserve to live without fear of exclusion, yet again, from accessible and affordable health care coverage.”
Alan Peterson is running for House District 26 against two of the Republicans who voted against protecting coverage for pre-existing conditions. Peterson, who talked about the challenges to access for affordable healthcare faced by rural North Dakotans, said,
“For farmers, who are independent business people, insurance is already expensive. One farmer from District 26 shared he pays $25,000 a year for health insurance. He’s not alone. But 33 Republicans voted against making insurance companies keep premiums affordable by not allowing extra charges for pre-existing conditions. My opponents in District 26 were two of the 33. The Affordable Care Act is at risk. We know that. Good leaders hope for the best, but prepare for the worst. This small assurance should have already been in place.”

North Dakota Delegation Must Firmly Denounce President’s Call for Election Delay
BISMARCK, ND —On Thursday, President Donald Trump tweeted the suggestion that the November 3 election be delayed. He does not have the power to do so. The president also disparaged mail-in voting, a process many North Dakotans, and the President himself, have used. There are both Republicans and Democrats speaking out against the president’s tweet. Sen. Kevin Cramer laughed it off.
The statement comes amid a troubling economic and public health crisis, slow and chaotic response from the president, and a lackluster recovery effort from the Republican Senate.
The Democratic-NPL Party Chairwoman Kylie Oversen said:
“The president is trying to distract from the economic collapse and public health crisis his administration has failed to manage. We cannot let him do that. North Dakotans deserve to know that our delegation in Washington will defend mail-in voting as an option we have had for years, a choice that is even more important during this public health crisis.
North Dakotans deserve to know the election date is set and that their congressmen will stand up for consistent and secure elections. We’re calling on Rep. Kelly Armstrong, Sen. Kevin Cramer, and Sen. John Hoeven to make a strong split with the president and make it clear the election will be November 3. Sen. Cramer’s decision to laugh off public concerns is frightening.”

MARK HAUGEN ANNOUNCES RUN FOR STATE TREASURER
BISMARCK, ND, 3/12/20 - This Wednesday, activist and philanthropist Mark Haugen announced his candidacy for the North Dakota State Treasurer race. A North Dakota resident for his entire life, Mark Haugen sees his candidacy as an opportunity to restore integrity and accountability to the office of Treasurer. Mark will ensure that taxpayer money is allocated correctly and transparently, and will keep communication with other government entities open to prevent unnecessary mistakes, big and small.
Careless accidents on the part of the current Treasurer have caused issues with serious repercussions in recent years. In 2017 it was found that multiple funds for education and infrastructure had been shorted a total of $262 million. In response, Kelly Schmidt, the current State Treasurer, cited direction from the Attorney General to pursue legislation to fix an ambiguity in state law that allowed for the error to happen. However once this legislation failed, no further action was taken by the Treasurer's office, resulting in the massive misappropriation of taxpayer dollars.
As Treasurer, Mark Haugen will not only seek to ensure that mistakes like these do not happen in the future, but will pursue better and more clearly defined procedures to make such massive errors impossible. Mark will strive to bring a culture of independence and integrity to the office of Treasurer, and will work tirelessly to keep taxpayer money safe and accounted for.
Mark Haugen lives in Bismarck with his wife Sharol, where he works as a student success adviser at the University of Mary. Before his current career, Mark worked for 34 years as a paramedic, and currently serves on the Board of Directors for the North Dakota EMS Foundation. He is also the co-founder of the Sarah Ann Haugen Paramedic Memorial Scholarship through Bismarck State College, which he and his wife started in memory and honor of their late daughter.

Nomination Threatens Preexisting Conditions, Rural Hospitals During Pandemic
BISMARCK, ND —  The Senate Judiciary Committee heard opening statements today regarding President Trump’s nominee for the Supreme Court, Amy Coney Barrett. Barrett has criticized the reasoning upholding the Affordable Care Act. If nominated, she would hear a case seeking to eliminate the ACA. Oral arguments are currently set for November 10.
The lawsuit is supported by the North Dakota Republicans who have made no plan to prepare for the fall-out, which would include tens of thousands of North Dakotans losing coverage for preexisting conditions during the pandemic. Those who have contracted COVID-19 will now be considered to have a preexisting condition. Eliminating the ACA would also mean North Dakota loses funding for Medicaid expansion, which has been crucial in keeping rural hospitals open. North Dakota is facing a hospital capacity crisis right now in part because of COVID-19.
The Democratic-NPL Party Chairwoman Kylie Oversen said:
“Confirming this nominee puts access to affordable healthcare at serious risk in North Dakota. While the NDGOP has fought against the ACA, they’ve made no effort whatsoever to prepare for the repercussions, even as a pandemic ravages our state. Judge Barrett’s confirmation would be a dangerous setback for North Dakotans with preexisting conditions who could lose coverage entirely while the COVID-19 virus leaves untold lingering effects on new North Dakotans every day. Rural hospitals, which rely on the ACA for funding, would be doomed, meaning life or death for North Dakotans who already have long drives for emergency care as the state faces a serious capacity crisis.”

Dem-NPL Candidates Call for Investments in Behavioral Healthcare Amid Pandemic
BISMARCK, ND — Today, a group of Dem-NPL legislative candidates called for strong investments in behavioral health services and a holistic approach to treatment and recovery that includes Prevention and Early Intervention, Real Time Services, and Supporting Recovery in every part of North Dakota. An investment in behavioral health improves the quality of life of North Dakotans, and also grows the workforce and the economy. The virtual press conference recording can be found on the Dem-NPL Facebook page.
A study from Kaiser Family Foundation showed that in 2019, more than one in ten adults reported symptoms of anxiety or depression. Now, it’s more than one in three. Further, 13% of adults have reported a new or increased substance use as a way to manage COVID-19-related stress while 11% reported thoughts of suicide. In recent years, North Dakota’s suicide rate has risen faster than almost any other state in the nation.
District 24 Sen. Larry Robinson, discussed how investing in behavioral health would benefit the public and private sector workforces, and the need for support in rural areas. Robinson said:
“When it knocks at your door, it’s a rude awakening, and you quickly find yourself searching for help, and advice, and direction, and support,” Robinson said. “The revolving door aspect of treatment, addiction, and so on has not worked, and we know that, and we’ve learned from that over the last number of years. This is not going to be an easy lift. We know that, but I think there’s increasing awareness across the state, private and public partnerships, private and public sectors, that this is an issue that must be addressed. The greater cost would be in not making those investments.”
Tracey Wilkie, a District 16 House candidate, who has worked for 25 years on the front lines of behavioral healthcare, said:
“As someone who has worked directly with people going through serious challenges my whole life, I can tell you behavioral health needs a holistic approach and that Prevention and Early Intervention is key to saving lives and livelihoods. These resources include supporting early screening, referral services, expanding local behavioral workforces, and strengthening economic support for families, all even more important as risks rise during the pandemic.”
Jackie Hoffarth, a District 18 House candidate, and a licensed social worker, discussed the need for real-time services, culturally responsive care, and diversifying the behavioral health workforce. Hoffarth said:
“We need to base funding off what people need and change the way we think about behavioral health, which means person-centered care that helps people set and meet goals they can accomplish today. It’s helping people meet their basic needs, treating them with dignity and trust over the choice in their own lives, and reducing stigma often associated within systems whose approach is often punitive rather than empowering. This is the path to a healthier North Dakota, not only at the individual level, but economically as healthy North Dakotans become productive employees who stay in the workforce and become part of our innovative fabric.”
Will Thompson, District 22 House candidate, discussed his personal experience with behavioral health, the need to eliminate stigma, and what that means in terms of setting priorities. Thompson said:
“I believe that mental health issues and substance abuse are going to be some of the greatest challenges my generation is going to face. So we don’t have time to wait. The legislature instituted an addiction treatment voucher that enabled people who couldn’t afford treatment to get care in their communities, rather than one of the few state facilities. It was a start, but the money ran out this year and right before the most critical time of the year - when the winter makes us feel trapped and the holidays bring challenging times for many people. The program froze during a crisis. We can’t let that happen again.”

Dem-NPL Statement on Plan to End Covid-19 Business Closures
BISMARCK, ND — Gov. Burgum today announced guidelines for certain businesses to re-open after being closed by his executive order related to the covid-19 pandemic. On the same day, the North Dakota AFL-CIO and related organizations put forward a proposal that puts worker safety at the forefront of any and all economic re-opening.
Dem-NPL Chairwoman Kylie Oversen said:
“As restaurant employees, barbers, and stylists head back to their jobs, while other workers are directed to work from home if possible, we need to recognize that all of us have a responsibility to them and each other. That means not only taking personal safety precautions, but also supporting paid family leave, so everyone can take time off when they’re sick or need to take care of a family member. Without these precautions and stronger policies in place, we’ll be back where we started.”

Emergency Responders And All Front Line Workers Deserve Our Support During Pandemic
BISMARCK, ND — As COVID-19 cases continue to rise and working families keep essential aspects of the state and economy in motion, we share a responsibility to support the nurses, firefighters, grocery store clerks, and every other worker on the pandemic’s front lines. While many like nurses face a shortage of personal protective equipment and N95 masks, others worry about what happens if they catch the virus.
Rep. Corey Mock, D-Grand Forks, has been working with the governor’s administration and the firefighters association to request an executive order for workers compensation coverage for medical personnel, police, fire, paramedics, volunteer emergency responders, and deployed national guard personnel for all COVID-19 related cases.
“While many of us are able to wait out the crisis, emergency responders are facing yet another daily risk. The least we can do is to make sure we take care of them if they get sick. Putting this important protection in place soon will mean not only earned and deserved compensation for emergency responders who contract COVID-19, but peace of mind that we have their backs.”
Equipment shortages
Many nurses are facing a shortage of personal protective equipment, including N95 masks. A coalition of North Dakota AFL-CIO, Minnesota Nurses Association, North Dakota Building Trades Unions, West Area Labor Council/Red River Valley, Northern Plains United Labor Council AFL-CIO, and the Red River Building Trades Council, are pulling together and asking for community support this weekend at equipment and donation drives in Fargo and Bismarck.
Rep. Ron Guggisberg, D-Fargo, and a fire captain, said supporting not only emergency workers, but all workers on the pandemics frontline is a shared responsibility.
“Anyone still going to work, especially those who are required to do so, deserve the proper safety equipment and protocols, so that they and their families can stay safe and healthy. We encourage all employers still in operation to make the appropriate equipment available, to use best safety practices, and to assure workers they will not be punished for disruptions related to COVID-19.”

The Democratic-NPL Party Chairwoman Kylie Oversen said:
“We are incredibly excited to have Mayor Pete join us for our Annual Governors' Dinner. Of course, we wish we could be holding the event in person, but continuing with physical distancing is the best decision for our candidates, supporters, and the public health. The switch to virtual campaigning is a challenge, but I’m proud of Dem-NPL ingenuity during this unprecedented time.”

Last year’s keynote speaker was champion bronc rider and former South Dakota state senator and gubernatorial candidate, Billie Sutton.

North Dakotans Deserve Transparency, Not a Twisted Message from NDGOP Officials
BISMARCK, ND — Sen. Kevin Cramer said he has no problem with the decision President Trump made to purposefully mislead the public regarding the threat COVID-19 posed on United States citizens. Recorded interviews by Bob Woodward and The Washington Post revealed that President Trump knew COVID-19 was deadly and far more harmful than the flu, despite telling the public the exact opposite.
Rep. Kelly Armstrong, who is up for reelection down ballot of President Trump, refused to recognize the harm caused by the President's decision to mislead the public during a pandemic, even as North Dakota’s infection rates rank near the top in the nation.
A recent Associated Press report also showed that Gov. Burgum, too, used a far different tone in private than in public. On the same day he emailed staff saying “our house is on fire” and pressed a “sense of urgency and action,” he visited Washington, D.C. and all but declared victory over the virus and the economic downturn caused by the chaotic response. Burgum has lost two top public health officials during the pandemic.
The Democratic-NPL Party Chairwoman Kylie Oversen said:
“North Dakota’s COVID-19 recovery relies on everyone being able to make the best decisions for ourselves, our families, and our communities. For that to work, our elected leaders need to be at the forefront of this pandemic and economic collapse with transparency, honesty, and frankness. North Dakotans deserve the truth.”

Rep. Schneider and Dem-NPL Call for Executive Moratorium on Evictions and Rental Fees
FARGO, ND — For many North Dakotans, rent is due in only a few days even though many are suddenly without work or a paycheck because of COVID-19 disruptions. Some landlords have been proactive in providing relief and many utilities have promised not to shut off their services. Other landlords sent out letters directing renters that regardless of illness or lost employment, rent is still due on April 1. Some of these letters directed renters to choose between online-only payments or paying a new credit card charge while also saying they will delay maintenance services as a COVD-19 prevention measure.
Today, Rep. Mary Schneider, D-Fargo, sent a letter to the governor respectfully urging him to sign an executive order temporarily halting evictions, foreclosures, utility shut-offs, and related late fees and interest. The moratorium would create consistency for North Dakotans and correlate with directives from President Trump as well as bipartisan initiatives at the city, county, and state levels nationwide.
This call follows leadership by advocates and organizers like High Plains Fair Housing Center who are working to protect the significant number of North Dakotans who are at risk. Over 44% of Cass County residents are renters (2017 American Community Survey - US Census). Statewide, in 2017, 37% of citizens rented, according to the American Community Survey (US Census).
Rep. Mary Schneider, whose constituents are particularly vulnerable during this crisis, said in her call to the governor:
“Through no fault of their own, people have lost their jobs, had their paychecks eliminated or reduced, and have limited or no resources to withstand the crisis. They are petrified about losing their housing and having to find alternative and affordable shelter during a pandemic—or possibly becoming homeless. They are additionally afraid of not being able to recover financially from extra costs, fees, deposits, and penalties from late payments and court actions, even after they are working again. When those folks asked me what I was going to do about their desperate circumstances, I said I would ask you to help.”
The Democratic NPL-Party Chairwoman Kylie Oversen, whose law practice includes social security disability and employment law, said:
""The Governor constantly says that we need to focus on Facts over Fear. Right now, it is a fact that our neighbors are losing their jobs and won't be able to pay their rent when April 1 rolls around. It is a fact that too many working families are worried about losing their shelter at a time when they need it most.""
""Many of my clients are constantly at risk of losing their homes under normal circumstances. Now, when facing a global public health crisis, the risk is even greater and more alarming. We urge the Governor to take immediate action to ensure all North Dakotans can at least rest assured that they won't be evicted and left without their basic need of shelter.""

Healthcare Professional Announces Candidacy for Insurance Commissioner Amid COVID-19
BISMARCK - Travisia Martin, a healthcare professional with over 40 years of experience, officially announced her campaign for North Dakota Insurance Commissioner today. Martin, who lives in Bismarck, is the first African American woman to seek a statewide office in North Dakota’s history. The North Dakota Democratic-NonPartisan League Party (ND Dem-NPL) officially endorsed Ms. Martin at its statewide convention on Saturday, March 21, 2020.
“We are excited to support Travisia’s historic campaign,” stated The Democratic-NPL Party Chairwoman Kylie Oversen. “With her extensive healthcare background, Travisia is dedicated to supporting and improving the Affordable Care Act (ACA) while addressing the lack of providers across the state in critical, mental, and general healthcare. She is determined to uphold the Insurance Department’s commitment of ‘vigorous consumer protection efforts.’ We look forward to helping her become the state’s next Insurance Commissioner.”
Ms. Martin has worked as a Critical Care Respiratory Specialist for more than four decades. She’s travelled to all 50 states including Hawaii, Guam, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Canada, serving in hospitals and has seen firsthand how being uninsured or underinsured creates a significant threat to the health and well-being of all citizens. In hospitals throughout North Dakota, she has witnessed how a shortage of providers due to lack of funding in rural and tribal areas means access to healthcare is far different from one community to the next.
Travisia Martin stated, “Now more than ever we must elect officials who understand what happens when healthcare workers and patients don’t get the resources they need. We have to recognize that disbanding the ACA would be a disaster for thousands of North Dakotans who would lose protections for preexisting conditions or who live in rural communities where hospitals would be forced to shutter.
I’ve spent my whole career on the front lines of healthcare. I’ve worked with the richest and the poorest patients, and we have to address the healthcare crisis many North Dakotans faced long before this pandemic.
Regardless of the party you identify with, we’re all touched by illness and we all have a responsibility to care for the most vulnerable. This is a bipartisan issue where we all need to come together for the greater good. I want to make sure our families and our neighbors have access to healthcare, and I’m committed to leading the conversation about how to make that a reality for all North Dakotans while developing a strategy for implementation.”
The ACA is still under attack, as are its protections for preexisting conditions and support that keeps rural hospitals open for daily care and emergencies. And, with the current state of emergency due to the coronavirus pandemic, things are going to get worse before they get better.
“Naturally, people are scared because we have never seen anything like this disease before. I am committed to not only providing HOPE to North Dakotans during the COVID-19 global pandemic, but for many years to come. I am asking for your support and would be honored to have your vote as North Dakota’s next Insurance Commissioner,” said Martin.

Former Commerce Head Calls Failed Audit “Netflix-Grade Content,” Blasts State Auditor
BISMARCK, ND — In a meeting with the Legislative Audit and Fiscal Review Committee Thursday, former Commerce Commissioner Michelle Kommer blasted auditor Josh Gallion for abusing his office and wasting “likely hundreds of thousands of dollars” in order to “make a stage for himself.” Kommer spoke at about 11:58 on the recording.
After the process, “he refused to meet with me,” Kommer said, adding that Gallion did not attend the exit meeting, a standard for professional conduct in auditing. Kommer said North Dakota statutes were “mocked” throughout the process. The auditor has a “character problem” and his work product is a “disappointment to the profession,” she said. The attack on her department stressed her staff and resulted in one member who is a combat veteran, having a relapse of post-traumatic stress disorder, she said. The auditor’s office should be one that “creates value instead of terror,” she said.
Patrick Hart, Dem-NPL candidate for auditor, said
“The auditor’s job is to ensure proper processes and procedures are followed to prevent, waste, fraud, and abuse of our tax dollars. My opponent abused his power to go around the law, avoided performing his duty, and sought to manipulate state law in some kind of political game to make headlines for himself. He hurt state employees and wasted tax dollars. The auditor should create value and engage with public employees, so our tax dollars are spent wisely. That is exactly why I am running.”
About Patrick Hart
Patrick Hart grew up on a farm in Pembina, North Dakota, where he learned his work ethic and commitment to integrity. He is a former auditor for the North Dakota Department of Agriculture and the North Dakota Public Service Commission. He is also a small business owner, serving as managing partner in a successful contracting business in Bismarck.

Sen. Cramer Should Fight For the Post Office, Rather than Insult Voters and Spread Rumors
BISMARCK, ND — Sen. Kevin Cramer insulted North Dakotans and other voters who want to exercise their right to vote by mail, which was widely available in North Dakota even before the pandemic when 33 of 53 North Dakota counties offered mail-in voting. The June primary, entirely vote by mail, saw a significantly higher than average primary turnout, according to Republican Secretary of State Al Jaeger who said of the primary “it was successful and it was secure.” Cramer said recently he has voted by mail.
Meanwhile, Cramer and Washington Republicans are weakening the United States Postal Service as the pandemic causes an increase in demand. Unnecessary cuts made by the new postmaster, a Republican appointee and a large campaign donor, have led to mail delays in larger cities that may affect North Dakota as the problem worsens. A Bismarck Tribune editorial “believes mail-in voting is the future of elections,” but that requires a robust Postal Service to get ballots out in time. The Post Office is an incredibly popular institution and favored by 91% of the United States population.
Dem-NPL Communications Director Alex Rohr said:
“Sen. Cramer thinks voting by mail is okay for him, but not everyone else? Instead of dismissing a right thousands of North Dakotans routinely exercise, he should be making sure vote by mail continues to be accessible by bolstering the U.S. Postal Service. The Post Office is an essential government service, necessary lifeline for rural North Dakotans, and an especially important resource during the pandemic.”
Cramer also made unsubstantiated claims about COVID-19 reporting. Recently, Forum News reported that North Dakota did not meet our own criteria for a green rating.
Rohr continued:
“North Dakota businesses and their workers as well as educators, students, and their families are relying on our leaders to give them the best information available, so they can make the best decisions for their communities and families. By spreading false information, Sen. Cramer is making an incredibly challenging situation even more difficult and betraying the public trust.”

The Wait Continues for Unemployment Benefit Payments
BISMARCK, ND — Today Gov. Burgum said unemployment benefit payments for those impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic might finally be sent to North Dakotans next week.
Last month, groups of distressed renters, advocacy organizations, nonprofits, and the Dem-NPL urged the governor to sign an executive order and moratorium on evictions, late rental fees, and foreclosures. Renters asked for security to know that they could stay in their homes through the pandemic and that they wouldn’t go into debt while they’re out of work through no fault of their own.
On March 30, Burgum declined this request and told renters they would be in better shape after federal relief programs took effect. During that time, many small business owners and independent contractors have been unable to access PPP loans and many others have been unable to receive unemployment payments leaving them worried about their financial security.
Democratic-NPL Chairwoman Kylie Oversen said:
“Job Service has a challenging job and we know they’re working hard with an outdated system, but many North Dakotans are hanging on by a thread. A month ago, the governor indicated support was on the way, but today he said to keep waiting. Our workers and families deserve something tangible.”

Dem-NPL Endorses New Insurance Commissioner Candidate, Petitions Supreme Court
BISMARCK, ND —  The Democratic-NPL Party Chairwoman Kylie Oversen and the party’s newly endorsed insurance commissioner candidate Jason Anderson filed a petition yesterday to the North Dakota Supreme Court challenging Secretary of State Al Jaeger’s refusal to replace the party’s candidate for insurance commissioner. Oral arguments take place September 2, 11 a.m.
The Supreme Court ordered Travisia Martin, the former Dem-NPL candidate for insurance commissioner, be removed from the ballot following a petition filed with the Supreme Court by the North Dakota Republicans. The court recognized that Martin was truthful about physically residing in North Dakota for the appropriate timeline to meet the election requirement of five years. Secretary Jaeger has refused to allow the Dem-NPL to replace the nominee whom Secretary Jaeger qualified to be on the June primary ballot. Martin received votes in the primary from more than 34,200 North Dakotans.
The Democratic-NPL Party Chairwoman Kylie Oversen said:
""In an oral argument hearing before the Supreme Court, it was observed that the NDGOP could have brought this lawsuit months earlier, but they delayed until the last minute tightening the timeline. North Dakotans deserve and expect to have the options they already voted for. The court overruled Secretary Jaeger twice last week, and we’re not going to take his word for it now.”
On Friday, the Democratic-NPL Party Executive Committee, pursuant to North Dakota law, voted to endorse Jason Anderson, an insurance professional from Fargo, to replace Martin as the Dem-NPL candidate for Insurance Commissioner on the ballot.
Anderson said:
“My number one job will be to make sure people have more options and better coverage, especially for those with preexisting conditions. Our insurance commissioner should be attracting companies to the marketplace to lower premiums and make healthcare affordable. Instead, he’s joined a lawsuit that would strip coverage for preexisting conditions from thousands of North Dakotans and eliminate funding for rural hospitals. People in this state are hurting, and I’ll bring to this office not only a strong understanding of the insurance industry, but also some much-needed humanity.”

* Raised on a ranch north of McHenry, ND
* Graduated Bismarck State College with a degree in business

Dem-NPL Disavows Libertarian Seeking Party Nomination and Who Protested Closure Orders
BISMARCK, ND — The Democratic-NPL Party condemns the actions of Roland Riemers, who is seeking the party nomination for Congress. It was reported that Riemers attended a rally calling on Gov. Burgum to rescind executive orders related to business closures and physical distancing to prevent the spread of covid-19. The rally ignored guidelines from medical professionals aimed at keeping North Dakotans healthy and safe.
Zach Raknerud earned the Dem-NPL endorsement by a vote of convention goers on March 21.
Dem-NPL Executive Director Michael Taylor said:
“Riemers words and actions are irresponsible and not representative of Dem-NPL values. We disavow his conduct and his campaign entirely.”

Words Aren't Enough for Those Facing Eviction and Late Penalties
BISMARCK, ND — The governor addressed evictions today, a concern for many North Dakotans. He has said evictions is the number one issue he’s heard about from constituents regarding COVID-19. He again chose not to issue a moratorium on evictions, foreclosures, and rental fees, despite calls from distressed renters, grassroots organizers, nonprofit advocates, and the Dem-NPL.
Without a moratorium on evictions, rental fees, and foreclosures, landlords can issue three-day notices that convince some tenants to leave their homes without anywhere to go when we're all being encouraged to stay inside. Rental fees and penalties will begin to accrue for people who have no options, putting them at risk of debt, through not fault of their own, long after the disaster is over. Policy considerations should also include rent assistance for tenants who are suddenly unemployed and bridge loans or grants for landlords who offer flexibility to struggling tenants.
The Democratic-NPL Party Chairwoman Kylie Oversen said:
“After weeks of calls by distressed renters making eviction the number one issue he’s heard about, it’s great to hear the governor finally addressing them directly and encouraging landlords to give flexibility. While he says the economic programs are soon to come, people are already facing potential eviction, and rental fees can still pile up. The analysis we heard today, though, shows a lack of understanding of what it’s like to live paycheck to paycheck, and we encourage the governor to take concrete action. Words aren’t enough.”

Access to Healthcare Endangered During Crisis After SC Confirmation and NDGOP Inaction
BISMARCK, ND — Last night, North Dakota’s senators moved the nation toward their goal of eliminating the Affordable Care Act with the confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court. Oral arguments over an anti-ACA lawsuit supported by NDGOP leaders, including Governor Burgum, are set for November 10. This lawsuit puts the ACA on the chopping block, along with its coverage for preexisting conditions and tens of millions of dollars in federal support for North Dakota’s hospitals, especially those in rural areas.
The lawsuit is supported by the North Dakota Republicans who have made no plan to prepare for the fall-out even as North Dakota is currently facing a hospital capacity crisis related to COVID-19. North Dakota Republicans even killed an attempt by Dem-NPL legislators to protect coverage of preexisting conditions in 2019. Prior to the ACA, only 22% of North Dakota Critical Access Hospitals had positive operating margins. By 2019, 50% had positive operating margins.
If the ACA is eliminated, North Dakota would lose:
* Protections for coverage of preexisting conditions for tens of thousands of North Dakotans.
* Roughly $10-20 million from a drug discount program for rural hospitals.
* About $25 million per year in subsidies for rural hospitals as Medicaid Expansion is also eliminated.
* Coverage for between 20,000-22,000 North Dakotans through Medicaid expansion.
The Democratic-NPL Party Chairwoman Kylie Oversen said:
“Senators Cramer and Hoeven put the healthcare of every North Dakotan in jeopardy by voting for a nominee that could wipe away the Affordable Care Act. That decision will cost North Dakota federal funds that are sustaining our rural hospitals, as we face a dangerous public health crisis that is straining our healthcare system and threatening our state budget. Their vote puts at risk the hundreds of North Dakotans per day now testing positive for COVID-19, as the virus and its after-effects become preexisting conditions. North Dakota Republican legislators and Gov. Burgum have made no plan for the fallout of this callous and rushed decision that could mean life or death as the pandemic ravages our state. This is irresponsible governing at its worst.”

Zach Raknerud Defends USPS as Rep. Armstrong Votes Against the Mail
Recently revealed documents from Postal Service administrators showed that there were plans to remove three mail-sorting machines in post offices located in Bismarck, Fargo, and Grand Forks. Public pressure stopped the intentional slow-down, and the machines will now remain. However, Rep. Kelly Armstrong has continued to dismiss legitimate public concerns over potential USPS cuts and even voted against a bipartisan bill to defend the USPS.
Dem-NPL Congressional candidate Zach Raknerud said, “To see such blatant evidence and to still take such a strong stance that there’s nothing below board occurring is incredibly disappointing to me."" Read more here. The Democratic-NPL also called out Armstrong for playing politics: ""USPS shouldn’t be partisan. COVID-19 relief shouldn’t be partisan. But politicians like Rep. Armstrong are refusing to work collaboratively to solve real problems."" Read more here.

D46 Dem-NPL candidate Ben W. Hanson responded to Kasper who almost certainly made up the hack. Listen to his interview on News and Views here.

Burgum’s Call for Cuts Contradicted by Raises to Some Agency Heads
BISMARCK, ND — As Gov. Doug Burgum has directed departments across the state to cut their budget proposals for the next biennium, the Industrial Commission – led by Governor Burgum, – also awarded significant raises to some agency heads. The story comes not long after reports the administration awarded bonuses in an inconsistent manner.
Rep. Pam Anderson, a member of the Interim Commerce Committee and Government Administration Committee, said:
“Giving significant raises to a few at the top while calling for cuts across the board sends a disrespectful message to the public employees who have been doing more with less since before the pandemic. Thousands of state workers have put themselves at risk to keep North Dakotans safe. If we’re going to give anyone raises it should be the people on the front lines.”

Next Emergency Budget Process Must Include Earlier Legislative and Citizen Input
BISMARCK, ND — The state of North Dakota released more than $541 million in budget requests for the Office of Management and Budget and other spending related to the state’s $1.25 billion in federal covid-19 relief funding.
Next week, the Emergency Commission will make a recommendation regarding the proposal to the legislative Budget Section, which will then vote on whether to allocate the money to the state.
House Minority Leader Josh Boschee and Sen. Minority Leader Joan Heckaman released the following statements.
House Minority Leader Josh Boschee said:
“State employees have done phenomenal work pivoting to disaster relief and we support their need for immediate funding. This sum is also comparable to an eighth of our entire General Fund budget and the next allocation could be even larger. Going forward, the public deserves a process with earlier input from legislators and citizens if we’re going to wisely and transparently budget hundreds of millions of dollars before the end of the year.”
Senate Minority Leader Joan Heckaman said:
“It’s incredibly important for us to support our economy and the businesses affected by the pandemic, and we also need to remember the workers and families who suffered hardship because of the fallout. There are nonprofits stepping up in big ways to aid people all over the state, and they should also be welcomed to the table in future discussions for spending relief funds.”

Mid-Pandemic Attack on ACA Threatens Protections for Preexisting Conditions, Rural Hospitals
BISMARCK, ND —  In the middle of the covid-19 pandemic and with cases rising in many parts of the country, the Justice Department sent a late-night brief to the Supreme Court asking to eliminate the entire Affordable Care Act. Without the ACA, thousands of North Dakotans would lose protections for preexisting conditions and our struggling rural hospitals would lose funding that kept them running even before covid-19 strained the healthcare system further.
An additional 10,000 North Dakotans lost healthcare coverage during the pandemic that is far from over. About 35,000 North Dakotans would lose coverage in total, according to a Center for American Progress report published this week. Medicaid expansion, which the ACA made possible, has helped stabilize rural hospitals that have faced financial struggles for years, and are necessary infrastructure in their communities.
Insurance Commissioner Jon Godfread and Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem support the lawsuit.
The Democratic-NPL Party Executive Director Michael Taylor said:
“Even amid one of the greatest public health and economic crises the country has ever faced, Godfread and Stenehjem remain committed to a lawsuit that would strip protections for preexisting conditions and doom rural hospitals that provide invaluable critical access care. Whether we see another covid-19 wave or not, this lawsuit puts access to healthcare in jeopardy for thousands of North Dakotans.”

Zach Raknerud Wins Dem-NPL Congressional Primary
BISMARCK, ND — Zach Raknerud secured the Democratic-NPL nomination for North Dakota’s congressional district tonight with a resounding victory. Raknerud was endorsed as the Democratic-NPL candidate for Congress at the virtual state convention in March.
Democratic-NPL Chairwoman Kylie Oversen said:
“As a working class, lifelong North Dakotan, Zach knows the struggles working families face every day with access to healthcare and opportunity. He will be a present, active, and vocal representative who stands up for justice and accountability. He will go to Washington with your interests and your goals in mind in contrast to our current representative who has been all-but silent during the national crisis and unrest.”
The election results also confirm the nomination of the Dem-NPL’s other six statewide candidates and 55 legislative candidates who will be on the ballot on November 3.
Oversen continued:
“Our candidates are incredibly excited and have been preparing for the run-up to November for months. During the covid-19 crisis, they have found new and creative ways to connect with voters who are ready for representatives dedicated to an economy and state government that work for all North Dakotans.”

Dem-NPL Statement on Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's Death and
Sen. Hoeven's Past Statements on Replacing a Supreme Court Justice
BISMARCK, ND — The Democratic NPL Party Chairwoman Kylie Oversen’s statement on the life and death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the plan by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to hold a vote on a nominee, directly contradicting his previous actions and words. Voting has already begun in several states:
The Democratic-NPL Party Chairwoman Kylie Oversen said:
“Justice Ginsburg is an iconic symbol in the ongoing fight for gender equality in our country. She started her legal career at a time when few women were in the field, and she excelled at every step of the way through steady perseverance. Her success came in spite of the numerous hurdles placed in front of her and all women seeking a new role in America. She never met a roadblock she could not leap over. And when she reached the other side, she turned around and worked to remove the obstruction, so the path was clearer for the rest of us.
Justice Ginsburg’s impression on our judicial system will be long-lasting and remarkable. While she did not always get it right, her stances on gender equality, on upholding voting rights and the rights of LGBTQ+ individuals, and on expanding access to healthcare made her a stalwart of progressive values. She was known for her fiery dissents, which she wrote with an understanding and vision that her words would lay the groundwork for the future of law in any given case.
While we deeply mourn her loss, Republicans across the country have already made it clear they are committed to hastily pushing through a new nomination, even though voting has already started in several states. Our own Sen. John Hoeven affirmed his position in 2016 that the “people should have a say” in naming a replacement for our nation’s highest court when an election is near.
Sen. Hoeven, do those sentiments remain now that you are on the other side of the vote? Do the American people still deserve a voice in this process? We demand that you, and Sen. Kevin Cramer, uphold the very principles that you and so many of your Republican colleagues asserted in 2016. Let the people have a say. There must be no confirmation vote on a Supreme Court nominee until after a new president is inaugurated.”

Fargo Forum Endorses Patrick Hart for Auditor
Just this morning, the Fargo Forum announced it has endorsed Patrick Hart for State Auditor because he will stop the grandstanding of the current auditor and end the waste, fraud, and abuse of our tax dollars.
The Forum wrote: ""He’s in private business, but has worked in auditing roles for the state Department of Agriculture and Public Service Commission and says he would take a less adversarial approach to the office. We hope he can restore the auditor’s office to the respected but low-key watchdog it had been for decades."" Read more here.

Council member Dr. Jim Brosseau stated, ""I think we should be asking what we can do to be of assistance in this pandemic, but like many of the others, I feel like we've been left out of the loop. I just sort of feel like the state Health Council has been forgotten, and if we do have a role to play, I think it has to be defined or redefined by the governor."" Read more here.

Listen to Public Health Experts and Support Small Business Owners, Workers, and Families
BISMARCK, ND — A group met at the capitol Monday to complain about executive orders mandating physical distancing measures enacted to slow the spread of the covid-19 pandemic. Their public gathering comes less than a week after a group of Republican legislators used their bully pulpit to try to push the governor toward rescinding these orders. Covid-19 cases are rising in North Dakota, and we learned Monday that three more people have died from the virus.
Dem-NPL Communications Director Alex Rohr said:
“It's time to listen to public health and medical experts who say we need greater testing capacity and consistent leadership from Washington. While we work together to flatten the curve, our congressional representatives and governor’s office must be more supportive of small business owners, workers, and families who are shouldering way too much of the pandemic’s economic burden. So far, too many people are left waiting, confused, and without assistance.”

(BISMARCK, ND) – Rep. Kelly Armstrong kicked off his re-election campaign Monday. The Dem-NPL Communications Director Alex Rohr gave the following statement:
""Family farmer bankruptcies are up 24% after an ineffective trade war. Prescription drug costs are skyrocketing. Now Washington may be cutting budgets for crop insurance, Medicare, and Social Security. Kelly Armstrong said he would stand up for farmers and seniors. He hasn't.

BISMARCK, ND — Gov. Burgum today announced his proposed budget guidelines for the 2021-2023 biennium. House Minority Leader Josh Boschee and Senate Minority Leader Joan Heckaman released the following statements.
House Minority Leader Josh Boschee said:
“North Dakota’s state employees have done an amazing job supporting our citizens through this crisis, although they didn’t always have the resources they needed for the job required of them. A promise not to cut any full-time state employees would show the gratitude they’ve earned. They deserve to know their jobs are secure, and they need to be included in developing solutions to the budget crisis we are facing.”
Senate Minority Leader Joan Heckaman said:
“Determining what programming is essential and what is optional will again be an incredibly challenging task because of forces outside of our control. It’s past time to learn the lessons of previous years and not only balance the budget, but to invest in North Dakotans in a way that diversifies our economy and supports existing industries, so we’re not in this position again.”

Now is Not the Time to Back Off Physical Distancing
BISMARCK, ND — A group of North Dakota Republican legislators called for Gov. Burgum to rescind or let lapse executive orders requiring business closures that were intended to prevent the spread of covid-19. On Wednesday, Burgum extended the orders. Meanwhile, one of the largest covid-19 clusters in the country is active in nearby South Dakota.
House Minority Leader Josh Boschee said:
“One of the largest covid-19 clusters in the country is breaking out one state away. It’s not the time to back off physical distancing. We will continue working with the governor to support the small businesses forced to close, like restaurants and coffee shops, as well as their employees and every worker in North Dakota making a sacrifice to save lives. Small businesses are the heartbeat of rural communities and we are making sure the state government supports them through the crisis and recovery, so that they can reopen and thrive when it is safe to do so.”

Gov.'s Response is Out of Touch with Working Families Suddenly Without Their Paychecks
BISMARCK, ND — Today the governor declined to issue a moratorium on evictions, foreclosures, and rental fees, despite calls from grassroots organizers, nonprofit advocates, and the Dem-NPL. His decision does not end the effort to aid those who are most affected by the pandemic’s economic disruptions.
Without a moratorium on evictions, rental fees, and foreclosures, some landlords will begin issuing three-day notices that convince some tenants to leave their homes without anywhere to go. Rental fees and penalties will begin to accrue for people who have no options, putting them at risk of debt long after the disaster is over.
There is still time for the governor to listen on the moratorium, but other policy considerations should include rent assistance for tenants who are suddenly unemployed and bridge loans or grants for landlords who offer flexibility to struggling tenants.
The Democratic-NPL Party Chairwoman Kylie Oversen said:
“The governor just said he expects working families to absorb the entire cost of the economic fall-out. Rent is due in two days and people aren’t getting paid. It’s not their fault, and they can be kicked out of their homes with only three days notice. At best, late fees will pile up that could set them back for years. The governor, who is a landlord himself, just told North Dakotans he has no understanding of the challenges they’re facing.”

Commission Makes $16 Million Gift to Oil, $0 for Sick Leave to Slow Pandemic
BISMARCK, ND — Today, the six-member Emergency Commission voted to allocate $221 million in returned CARES Act money meant to help North Dakotans through the COVID-19 pandemic and with the economic recovery. The allocation included a $16 million handout to oil companies, but $0 for an Emergency Sick Leave Fund that would help North Dakota workers stay home when they’re sick or quarantine without risking their financial security.
Paid Sick Leave is proven to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and other illnesses. Rep. Karla Rose Hanson and Sen. Erin Oban proposed an Emergency Sick Leave Fund, a data-driven solution to slow the spread of the virus and protect our economy. The all-Republican Emergency Commission refused to consider it, even though sick leave is proven to benefit workers, businesses, and public health.
Sen. Tim Mathern (Fargo) said:
“This money is supposed to help North Dakotans recover from the pandemic and support working families, not serve as another handout to an industry that is already at full workforce. This is more of the same insider spending that gave us the world-leading COVID-19 outbreak. It’s a misuse of taxpayer dollars in the middle of a crisis.”
Rep. Karla Rose Hanson (Fargo) said:
“Public health and a healthy economy go hand in hand. We proposed the Emergency Sick Leave Fund because paid leave is proven to slow the spread of disease, so we can have healthy workers, confident consumers, and a strong economy. We are seeing uncontrolled spread of COVID-19 in North Dakota, and families have burned through their employer or federal sick leave benefits. When people have no choice but to go to work when they’re sick or have been exposed, we risk further outbreaks and business closures.”

The Democratic-NPL Party Statement on the North Dakota Supreme Court Decision in Oversen, et al. v. Jaeger
We agree with former Chief Justice Gerald VandeWalle, the longest-serving chief justice in the state's history, in his dissent stating:
VandeWalle, Justice, dissenting.
I respectfully dissent. Section 16.1-11-18(6)(d), N.D.C.C., provides a vacancy can be filled if a candidate “[c]eases to be qualified to serve, if elected, as otherwise provided by law.” I believe the use of the term qualified in subdivision (6)(d) is ambiguous and a reasonable interpretation is that Martin was qualified when she was placed on the primary ballot by the Secretary of State. She subsequently ceased to be qualified when we determined she was not eligible to hold the office of insurance commissioner in our prior case. I would err on the side of placing a candidate’s name on the ballot when ambiguity exists in a statute. Therefore, I dissent.
Contact attorney David Thompson at 701-739-3257 with any questions.

Republicans Surrender to Covid-19 as Virus Rages in North Dakota
BISMARCK, ND — On Sunday, President Trump’s Chief of Staff Mark Meadows said “we are not going to control the pandemic” as North Dakota’s COVID-19 death toll continues rising and the state’s hospitals are pushed to capacity. Meadows’ CNN interview signaled defeat by the virus much of the world has slowed or at least partly contained. The U.S. Senate has also refused to move forward with an updated public health and economic relief package. The House passed two bills that have not received a vote in the Senate.
The Democratic-NPL Party Chairwoman Kylie Oversen said:
“Gov. Burgum spent much of his last press conference asking other North Dakotans to lead, a strong signal he’s not equipped for the job and doesn’t even want it anymore. Now, we’re seeing the White House surrender while their own staff faces an outbreak. Our senators haven’t even tried to reach a compromise across the aisle, so workers and small businesses can know their futures are secure and their families are safe. The true test of leadership is how you handle a crisis, and the North Dakota Republicans are showing they aren’t up to the task.”

Press Conference Thursday: Food Access and The CARES Act
BISMARCK, ND — On Thursday at 10 a.m., members of an Ad Hoc Committee on Food Access in North Dakota will hold a virtual press conference to propose allocating $53 million in CARES Act funding to address an ongoing need made worse by the covid-19 pandemic. As reported in multiple media outlets, Great Plains Food Bank has estimated a 44% increase in need network-wide.
The North Dakota Emergency Commission and Legislative Budget Section are expected to vote on spending a large potion of the state's $1.25 billion federal CARES Act funding this month. The Ad Hoc group’s proposal outlines ideas and initiatives to help assure that all citizens have access to food while also building up our infrastructure and supply chains across the state to support our family farmers and economy.
The virtual press conference follows a memo proposing a three-pronged approach to Assuring Access to Food sent by Sen. Kathy Hogan to Superintendent Kirsten Baesler, Agriculture Commissioner Doug Goehring, and Department of Human Services Executive Director Chris Jones.
Assuring Access to Food
* Enhance and strengthen the SNAP program for people with low incomes in North Dakota
* Address food supply/distribution disruptions that are impacting many communities
* Strengthen emergency food networks throughout North Dakota
Participants
Sen. Kathy Hogan represents District 21 in Fargo. She worked in human services for more than 40 years, including with a range of food security programs. She is a former director of Cass County Social Services.
Karen K. Ehrens, RD, LRD is a food, nutrition, and health consultant and advocate who works with The Creating a Hunger Free ND Coalition.

Raknerud Defends Social Security Against Threats by Trump, Silence by Armstrong
This weekend, the president issued an executive action that would defer the payroll tax that funds both Social Security and Medicare. The tax will still be owed, and both programs are at risk as the president vowed to make the cuts permanent. The order was part of a set of actions that fell woefully short of the COVID-19 relief package the GOP could have achieved by compromising across the aisle. Read more here.
On Sunday, Dem-NPL nominee for U.S. House, Zach Raknerud, said ""Social Security and Medicare must not only be protected, but expanded. They provide an invaluable service to the American people. Social Security can be used as a mechanism for paid family and sick leave. Medicare can be used to ensure zero Americans go without healthcare coverage. That is what I will fight for, while self identified 'Trump Republican' Kelly Armstrong will toe the party line come hell or high water.""
Sen. Cramer Insults North Dakota Voters and Spreads COVID-19 Rumors
Sen. Kevin Cramer insulted North Dakotans and other voters who want to exercise their right to vote by mail, which was widely available in North Dakota even before the pandemic when 33 of 53 North Dakota counties offered mail-in voting. The June primary, entirely vote by mail, saw a significantly higher than average primary turnout, according to Republican Secretary of State Al Jaeger who said of the primary “it was successful and it was secure.” Cramer said recently he has voted by mail.

CARES Act Funds Approved By Budget Section
BISMARCK, ND — The North Dakota Budget Section approved CARES funding Act today, enabling the administration to allocate more than $133 million, including support for medical assistance, childcare, education, and public transportation for rural areas.
House Minority Leader Josh Boschee said:
“The CARES Act was an important step in providing relief to North Dakotans, but there are gaps we’re going to need to figure out how to fill at the state level. We will continue to partner with constituents and the governor’s administration, and we encourage North Dakotans to keep speaking up for their needs.”
Senate Minority Leader Joan Heckaman said:
“These funds are essential to the operation of services to North Dakota citizens as their lives change during this pandemic. North Dakotans are strong people but nevertheless, when a tragedy strikes, the state government needs to do all it can to provide a safe environment for everyone. We need to be aware of changing circumstances and care for our friends and neighbors within the guidelines currently available.”

North Dakota Republicans Attack LGBTQ+ Rights
Last week, the NDGOP approved a host of resolutions in their party platform that contained ugly, divisive statements about the LGBTQ+ community. Many GOP leaders have since backtracked after much public outrage, but that just leads to more questions about why the language was approved in the first place.
Dem-NPL House Minority Leader Josh Boschee said, ""Statements like this by the majority party don't help when it comes to workforce recruitment or retaining the students we educate for 12-16 years [...] We see a lot of people leave the state because of bigotry like that.""

The delay in Operation Prairie Dog funding has hit rural North Dakota particularly hard with many vital infrastructure projects now delayed. The NDGOP has dismissed many of these problems. The Democratic-NPL House and Senate Caucuses, on the other hand, introduced a $1 billion infrastructure bond plan to help local governments access necessary infrastructure funds in June.

The plan would promote public health and economic recovery. Read more here.

Former HUD Secretary Julián Castro to Keynote Dem-NPL Burdick Dinner
BISMARCK, ND —  The Democratic-NPL Party announces that former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro will keynote the annual Burdick Dinner, Saturday, September 26. The event will be held virtually this year as part of ongoing COVID-19 prevention measures while maintaining a robust campaign schedule leading up to November 3.
Along with his work as HUD Secretary for President Obama’s administration, Castro was a 2020 Democratic candidate for president and is a former Mayor of San Antonio. His grandmother came to the United States when she was seven years old. His mother was the first Chicana to run for San Antonio City Council. His twin brother is U.S. Rep. Joaquin Castro, of Texas.
The Democratic-NPL Party Chairwoman Kylie Oversen said:
“We’re thrilled that Secretary Castro will join us for the annual Burdick Dinner, even if this year is a little bit different because of COVID-19. As a third-generation American and former U.S. cabinet secretary, he proves the American dream is achievable. He also has the wisdom and understanding to know that it’s not accessible for everyone. He has committed his life’s work to building infrastructure to help families get on their feet, so everyone has the opportunity to achieve.”
Oversen continued:
“Throughout his time as a Democratic presidential candidate, Secretary Castro shifted the conversation on a spectrum of issues, including systemic racism, a year before a police officer killed George Floyd in Minneapolis setting off protests around the world. Just this week, an officer shot Jacob Blake, a black man, in the back, setting off community unrest in Kenosha, Wisconsin. It’s long past time that Black Americans and people of color can feel safe going about their lives, and we’re thankful to Secretary Castro for his continued leadership to fight injustice.”
About the Burdick Dinner:
This is the 10th Annual Burdick Dinner, which was founded to honor the lives and service of Senators Quentin and Jocelyn Burdick and the lasting legacy of leadership they have had on the state of North Dakota. The event will be held virtually at 6 p.m. on Saturday, September 26. To order tickets, visit [[URL REDACTED]]

Press Advisory: Election Planning and Press Availability
BISMARCK, ND — With Election Day days away, members of the press are invited to schedule Election Night interviews in advance. While the Dem-NPL is not planning an in-person watch party because of the pandemic, candidates and party officials will be available to press in person and through video calls in Bismarck and in Fargo. Arrangements for interviews with legislative candidates may also be made individually.
Due to the increase in mail-in ballots, which must be postmarked by November 2, but can be received before the official canvass on November 9, some races may not have a clear winner on Election Night. The same goes for the national election, which has vote-by-mail counting deadlines that vary by state. It is possible that we may not have a clear presidential nominee on the evening of November 3 or even the morning of November 4. Throughout most of United States history, we did not know who won the presidency on the night ballots were cast.
Election Day breaking news or emergency media requests for the Dem-NPL should be directed to Communications Director Alex Rohr.
Election Night
* Dem-NPL statewide candidates will gather in Bismarck. Media may attend starting at 6:45 p.m. Masks are required and physical distancing will be practiced. Please RSVP to schedule interviews.
* Dr. Shelley Lenz for Governor
* Ben Vig for Lt. Governor
* Zach Raknerud for Congress
* Mark Haugen for Treasurer
* Patrick Hart for Auditor
* Casey Buchmann for Public Service Commission
* The Democratic-NPL Party Chairwoman Kylie Oversen, House Minority Leader Josh Boschee, and Rep. Karla Rose Hanson will be available for interviews starting at 6:30 p.m. at Red River Coffee in Fargo. Masks are required and physical distancing will be practiced RSVP required. No walk-in interviews allowed.
* The Democratic-NPL Party Executive Director Michael Taylor and Communications Director Alex Rohr will be at the Kennedy Center in Bismarck, and also available for interviews throughout the day.
* If you need assistance connecting with legislative candidates, contact Alex Rohr at [[URL REDACTED]], 434-473-1891.

HEROES Act Means Local Education Options, Food Access, Hazard Pay for Essential Workers;
HEALS Act Limits Local School Options, Adds Unrelated Spending, Gives a Free Lunch for Donors
BISMARCK, ND — Senate Republicans released the HEALS Act this week after letting the HEROES Act, passed by the House, sit un-debated or discussed for 10 weeks. The last-minute HEALS Act, supported by both North Dakota Senators, however, included $1.8 billion for a new FBI building that has nothing to do with pandemic relief. It also doubles the three-martini-lunch deduction for business meals, while eliminating food programs that would serve those in the greatest need. Food insecurity is rising across North Dakota. HEALS also leaves out hazard pay for essential workers, would slash the unemployment benefit offered to those out of work because of the pandemic, and ignores local governments.
The HEROES Act would award hazard pay for essential workers, bolster emergency food programs, provide much needed aid to city, county, and state governments, and offer resources for local school districts to open up with flexibility. By tying education funds to in-person mandates, the HEALS Act would use most of these dollars to take control away from our communities and from North Dakota.
The Democratic-NPL Party Chairwoman Kylie Oversen said:
“North Dakotans have stated clearly, we want to make decisions at the state and local level about how we open up our schools less than a month from now. The HEROES Act would offer not only resources for our students, teachers, and staff, but also support for childcare. Cases are rising, and North Dakotans need a program that works for us. We urge our congressional delegation to stop playing partisan politics with our lives and livelihoods.”
Oversen continued:
“Rather than award hazard pay to essential workers and bolster unemployment plans that keep people paying their rent, our Senators are backing a bill that includes $1.8 billion for a Washington office building and a free lunch for their donors. Workers and families are going hungry. They are out of work, and those that are still working are underappreciated and woefully under-protected. Our delegation needs to set aside their partisanship, their donor interests, and focus on dealing with an out of control public health crisis and an economy they watched crash.”

""House on Fire"" Email Shows Burgum Playing Politics with the Pandemic
Recent breaking news revealed a glimpse into Gov. Burgum's decision-making process regarding ND's ""Smart Restart"" plan. Even though public health officials had given clear warnings about the danger of reopening too early, Gov. Burgum ignored that advice and moved forward with reopening plans.
Gubernatorial candidate Dr. Shelley Lenz said in a statement, ""Right now we have a government in chaos. North Dakotans need leaders who will make and execute plans that reflect the best scientific data, expert advice, and collaboration to make things happen. We know that we cannot get on the road to economic recovery until we get the virus under control. So far we have seen no evidence that Burgum will put aside partisan politics to do what's best for our state.""

Dem-NPL Legislative Candidates Urge Action to Protect Educators, Support Staff
BISMARCK, ND — A group of Dem-NPL legislative candidates urged the governor today to take action to protect teachers, support staff, and students at all North Dakota K-12 schools and higher education institutions.
They urged Gov. Doug Burgum to build off executive orders he has issued since March extending workers compensation for specific essential workers who contract or are exposed to COVID-19 through the course of employment. This executive order would extend the previous orders to include teachers and support staff at North Dakota K-12 public schools and professors and support staff at universities and colleges. The order would include teachers, paraprofessionals, maintenance staff, kitchen staff, bus drivers, and all support staff.
It would also create a presumption that qualified employees contracted COVID-19 on the job, which would cut red tape and assure North Dakota workers access to benefits they deserve. The initiative would apply when all other COVID-19 benefits have been exhausted and only when telework is unavailable, meaning this wouldn’t apply if the individual can continue their work virtually.
Naomi Muscha, a retired teacher and current District 24 House candidate, said:
“Students, teachers and support staff are happy and thankful that schools are in session in North Dakota, some fully face-to-face and others with varying degrees of virtual classes. Adding this presumption would cut through red tape and give assurance to all school employees they can stay working and safe.”
Zachary Tomczik, a University of North Dakota law student and District 42 House candidate, said:
“If we are able to give our educators and support staff time to recover without worrying about their finances – they can leave when they need to and get better – to come back. This will keep the COVID-19 numbers down on campus and allow our university to continue the fight through these unusual times. As a city we cannot afford for the university to close its doors.”
Kari Breker, a former social worker, mother of school-age children, and District 16 Senate candidate, said:
“Ultimately, if parents aren’t at work, the economy grinds to a halt and stability of families suffer, and the crisis gets much worse overall. Parents need to know their children are safe and healthy and everything is being done to prevent the spread of the virus, but the expectations are high and the implementation is difficult. Making sure teachers, schools, and support staff have all the options available related to COVID-19, helps everyone make strong public health decisions, and will help assure parents that their kids are safe.”
John Pederson, Ph.D., professor of economics and history at Mayville State University and District 20 House candidate, said:
“If we have to stop teaching face to face, think of what happens to all the workers we have providing food to our students, faculty, and staff on campus. Supporting university and college workers and employees means supporting our communities and it means supporting our economy.”
Background on Gov. Burgum’s Executive Orders
Workers made eligible by previous Executive Orders: Paid or voluntary first responders, healthcare workers, funeral directors and others employed in a funeral home, individuals employed to provide direct care, treatment, and services to individuals with intellectual or developmental disabilities.

North Dakotans Deserve a Stronger Voice in Pandemic Recovery
BISMARCK, ND — The North Dakota Legislative Budget Section voted today to spend $406 million in federal CARES Act dollars for covid-19 relief. The Budget Section had only an up or down vote, and 14 districts or roughly 200,000 people were not represented in the process. They received a recommendation from the six-member Emergency Commission that plans to spend all $1.25 billion in federal money without a public process.
CARES Act money is meant to address the pandemic economy, which has put record numbers of people out of work, contributed to an oil crash, and hurt an already sluggish ag economy. Localities are told not to budget for Prairie Dog infrastructure projects they had planned on. Last week the Dem-NPL Joint Caucuses called for a special session to address these and other pressing needs statewide.
House Minority Leader Josh Boschee said:
“We have at least one more round of CARES Act funding to allocate, and we will continue to advocate for greater public input in how we spend it because every North Dakotan deserves a voice. Our local governments across the state are being told not to plan on long-awaited road and bridge projects because of the pandemic economy, and they should get a say through their elected legislators. We’re calling for a special session because among other proposals, we could pass a $1 billion infrastructure bond plan that ensures we invest in our communities and level out the bust and boom.”
Senate Minority Leader Joan Heckaman said:
“Many North Dakotans have long struggled with access to food whether it was because of income or infrastructure that left them in a food desert. The pandemic compounded this problem, and we’re hopeful the next round of CARES spending will include the proposal by the Food Access working group to address emergency food needs while also investing in infrastructure that supports family farmers and local economies.”

Terry Jones’ Wyoming Residency Considered By NoDak Supreme Court
BISMARCK, ND — The North Dakota Supreme Court today heard arguments on a petition showing that Terry Jones, running for reelection in legislative District 4, is ineligible to represent any legislative district in North Dakota. Kenton Onstad, a District 4 resident and Dem-NPL District 4 chair, filed the petition stating that Secretary of State Al Jaeger should remove Jones from the ballot.
As recently as this year, Jones was listed on state paperwork as registered agent of his business in Wyoming. Only Wyoming residents may be registered agents in Wyoming. North Dakota requires candidates to reside in the state for one year prior to being elected. The argument follows the recent precedent set by the North Dakota Supreme Court after the North Dakota Republican lawsuit to remove Travisia Martin, Dem-NPL candidate for insurance commissioner, from the ballot last month. Jones’ legislative phone number and fax machine have Wyoming area codes as well. He owns residential property in Wyoming.
The Dem-NPL has three candidates running in District 4, Thomasina Mandan and Hunter Andes for House and Lisa Finley-Deville for Senate, all who have deep ties to the district. Mandan and Finley-Deville are enrolled members of the Three Affiliated Tribes. Andes’ family has farmed in the region for generations.
The Democratic-NPL Party Communications Director Alex Rohr said:
“Terry Jones has repeatedly taken advantage of being a resident of Wyoming and has done so as recently as this year as the registered agent of the business that bears his name. He does not meet North Dakota's residency requirement and must be removed from the ballot for the sake of election integrity and the rights of District 4 residents who deserve a representative who actually lives in their community.”

ICYMI: NDGOP Won't Take Responsibility for Anti-LGBTQ+ Platform
Will Gov. Burgum Still Fund Anti-LGBTQ+ Candidates?
BISMARCK, ND — The North Dakota Republican Party recently passed a horrific anti-LGBTQ+ platform. While many members of the party have denounced it, few have stepped forward to say they support the initiative that included language repeating harmful and bigoted rhetoric.
After the resolution passed, no Republicans spoke up before news broke in the Fargo Forum. The discriminatory message has been included in the party platform since 2016. It has been removed from the party's website.
“Many LGBT practices are unhealthy and dangerous, sometimes endangering or shortening life and sometimes infecting society at large,” the platform reads.
North Dakota Republicans failed to step forward to eliminate the language before the resolution passed.
“A Burgum spokesman did not respond to a request for comment on whether the governor or his staff read the platform before voting on it and how Resolution 31 ended up in it,” said the story in the Huffington Post this weekend.
House Minority Leader Josh Boschee, the first openly gay lawmaker in North Dakota tweeted:
Despite expressing outrage, Gov. Doug Burgum, who is one of the NDGOP’s largest donors, has failed to refuse financial support to candidates and districts that are anti-LGBTQ+.
“They made a positive step by denouncing this language, but any dollar spent supporting a candidate who holds these hateful views would completely invalidate their pearl clutching. North Dakotans and LGBTQ+ individuals deserve more than words to know their rights are protected and their lives valued, and we’re calling on the governor and executive committee to show they mean what they say,” said Dem-NPL Chairwoman Kylie Oversen.
The platform received wide denunciation across the state of North Dakota, including op-eds from a broad coalition of LGBTQ+ advocates and other groups.
“How could Governor Burgum, the most powerful elected official in the state, not denounce this before it passed? Where were Senators Cramer and Hoeven, State Senator Wardner and State Representative Pollert, and the many other dozens of Republican elected officials? How could they not know about a resolution that contained such controversial, and cruel, language? What message does this send to our LGBTQ+ and Two Spirit youth?” Erin Pringle of Dakota OutRight and Barry Nelson of North Dakota Human Rights Coalition wrote in the op-ed.
Seventeen members of the NDGOP wrote a letter saying they support the resolution as written.
""Let us be very clear. This Resolution is not an expression of bigotry, and we reject any and all claims that attempt to mischaracterize it as such,"" the letter reads.

NDGOP ""Truth-Finding Mission"" Starts With Blatantly False Accusation
BISMARCK, ND — Last week Travisia Martin, Dem-NPL candidate for Insurance Commissioner, returned a letter and materials to the Secretary of State, including testimony from her partner that attest to her residency in North Dakota since 2015. The materials also include a rental agreement that shows Martin’s home in Nevada was rented and occupied by someone else.
On Tuesday evening, the North Dakota Republican Party put out a blatantly false press release claiming she had not responded. Martin received an email from Secretary Al Jaeger confirming receipt of her letter.
Communications Director Alex Rohr said:
“The NDGOP kicked off what they’re calling a ‘truth-finding mission’ by either failing to check a basic fact or by blatantly lying about Travisia’s response. That’s despicable. They owe her and North Dakota voters an apology for making this misleading accusation. Jon Godfread has a lot of questions to answer about his involvement.”
Rohr continued:
“Since moving to North Dakota in 2015, Travisia has spent countless hours in hospitals all across the state as a traveling respiratory therapist, and has continued to serve during the pandemic. As a frontline healthcare worker, she knows what it looks like when politics are placed ahead of good policy. In this case, the NDGOP makes it clear, they’d rather make stuff up than defend their fight to eliminate protections for pre-existing conditions.”

Paid Sick Leave Proven to Slow COVID-19
Emergency Commission Must Add Emergency Leave Fund
BISMARCK, ND —  A recent study by the journal Health Affairs showed that Emergency Sick Leave has helped limit the spread of COVID-19, a virus that is taking lives and harming livelihoods as North Dakota cases continue rising. The federal emergency paid leave program is set to expire Dec. 31 and has several gaps that limit access to it. With the Emergency Commission scheduled this week to reallocate unspent CARES Act dollars, Rep. Karla Rose Hanson (Fargo) and Sen. Erin Oban (Bismarck) renewed their call for an emergency paid leave fund that would support North Dakotans who need to stay home when they are sick or to quarantine without fear of losing their income. Paid leave is proven to help slow the spread of the virus while targeting economic assistance to those who most need it.
North Dakota is consistently at the top of daily per capita positive COVID-19 cases, deaths attributed to the virus are rising, and hospital emergency care and ICU beds are growing dangerously crowded. Against Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance, Gov. Burgum recently loosened quarantine guidelines for quarantining when both contacts wore a mask, calling his new policy “an incentive.” Paid Leave would be a realistic incentive for workers to not only get tested and comply with all safety guidelines but for employers to support both their employees and public health.
Rep. Karla Rose Hanson said:
“When people go to work sick, outbreaks occur, which is why paid leave plays such an important role in this pandemic. It makes it feasible for working families, those struggling the most in the COVID-19 economy, to follow public health guidelines that keep our communities safe and businesses open. It prevents North Dakotans from having to choose between paying their rent and potentially spreading a virus that has taken the lives of far too many North Dakotans already. Public health and the economy go hand in hand, and an Emergency Paid Leave Fund is a data-backed solution that unites the two.”
Sen. Erin Oban said:
“North Dakota is in the middle of a joint public health and economic crisis, and it’s clear that what we’ve been doing to date isn’t working. It’s time to reinvent how we respond to these crises and better target the use of these one-time federal resources. An Emergency Paid Leave Fund would fill existing gaps to support working people who make smart, selfless decisions to stay home when they test positive or are instructed to quarantine. It will save lives and livelihoods while supporting businesses, working families, and the economy. It’s time to stop blindly throwing money at the problem and strategically use tools like a paid leave fund that are proven to work.”

Emergency Commission Shorts Nursing Homes, Leaves Out Emergency Sick Leave
BISMARCK, ND — The Legislative Budget Section voted today to allocate the last of the $1.25 billion in federal COVID-19 relief funds. The $221 million had been returned from agencies after previous allocations. The budget section gets only an up or down vote, but Sen. Tim Mathern moved for $16 million in oil company subsidies to be voted on separately. The virus is getting worse every day in North Dakota. According to news reports, the oil industry already has reached it’s full workforce, which was the original reason for using CARES Act money to cap abandoned wells.
Those federal funds intended for public health and economic relief could have been spent on support for nursing homes and long term care facilities for staff and infrastructure to ensure in-person visitation in time for the holidays. Nursing homes and long term care facilities have seen more than half of all infections in the state. Emergency Sick Leave is also a proven method to slow down the virus while protecting workers, families, and businesses. The Emergency Commission has declined to consider it.
Sen. Tim Mathern said:
“The worldwide price of gas and oil determines the activity in the industry and there are other ways to spend that $16 million that are directly related to the coronavirus pandemic. The consequence of the pandemic will become much more dramatic as we go through this winter. Our first responsibility is to protect the lives and health of our citizens, and if we continue to have deaths and infections at the present rate, the entire economy across the North Dakota landscape is also going to struggle.”
House Minority Leader Josh Boschee:
“There is no other industry or business in the state right now that we’re providing direct payments for production purposes. The support we’ve been providing to small businesses and businesses through the state in every industry have been to help them to convert their facilities, help with staffing, with sanitation, PPE, to help the public have trust in our economy to mitigate the spread of our virus. To divert funds away from addressing the public health needs of citizens while this virus is peaking every day is irresponsible. Our nursing homes and long term care facilities also need more help while they face the worst of the pandemic. As we come to the holidays, we should use some of the funds to support workers at these facilities so they can find ways to enable in-person visitation, so we can all see our loved ones safely.”

Armstrong and Cramer Quiet as Administration Allows Bounties on American Soldiers
BISMARCK, ND — Days have passed since news broke that the President’s administration knew Russia was paying the Taliban bounties to kill American soldiers, and we have heard nothing from most of North Dakota’s congressional delegation. A recent report said that President Trump had been briefed as early as February.
North Dakota Democratic-NPL Chairwoman Kylie Oversen said:
“We haven’t heard a word from Kelly Armstrong or Kevin Cramer since this news broke days ago. You don’t get to wave the flag and say you support the troops, then sit by when they’re being targeted by a foreign adversary. Their silence reveals either a disheartening lack of compassion for American soldiers or a complete lack of courage to stand up to their party. When Americans are in danger, we expect our leaders to take action and hold the bad actors accountable.”

Supreme Court Nominee is a Threat to Rural Hospitals and Coverage for Pre-existing Conditions
BISMARCK, ND — Today, President Trump announced Amy Coney Barrett, who has a written track record of disagreeing with the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision upholding the Affordable Care Act, as nominee for the court. The announcement came before Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was buried. After a legendary career, Ginsburg became the first American woman to lie in state at the Capitol. The president, aided by North Dakota Republican senators, is committed to rushing the nomination in the limited time before the election. North Dakotans have already begun casting their ballots.
The court is scheduled to hear a case supported by North Dakota Republicans on whether the Affordable Care Act is still the law of the land. The Supreme Court has twice already upheld the Affordable Care Act as constitutional. The legislation enabled North Dakota to pass Medicaid expansion, ensuring coverage for thousands and provided much-needed funding to rural hospitals that were on the verge of collapse and are still at risk of closure, especially without these resources.
The Senate has also failed to pass any version of a COVID-19 relief bill since the pandemic began in March, despite ongoing public health and economic crises.
The Democratic-NPL Party Chairwoman Kylie Oversen said:
“If approved before the election, this Justice will hold the fate of access to affordable healthcare in her hands in the middle of a public health crisis. She may decide whether thousands of North Dakotans with pre-existing conditions can keep their coverage. She may determine whether rural hospitals that provide necessary care to much of North Dakota now being hit by COVID-19 can remain operating. Senators Cramer and Hoeven must put their partisan fealty aside, and take their duty to North Dakotans seriously. They must vote against any nominee who will limit access to affordable healthcare in North Dakota.”

Dem-NPL Caucus Welcomes Godfread’s Interest in Legacy Fund Investment;
Caucus Calls for Bipartisan Support for Community Investment in Upcoming Session
BISMARCK, ND —  In the 2019 legislative session, Sen. Joan Heckaman introduced SB 2276, a bill that would have dedicated 5% of the investments made on behalf of the Legacy Fund to the Bank of North Dakota for a revolving loan fund to address community needs. On Monday, Insurance Commissioner Jon Godfread re-introduced the same concept to the State Investment Board.
If Heckaman’s bill had been approved, funds already invested in other state and national infrastructure portfolios could have been used to support North Dakota’s childcare centers, nursing homes, bringing natural gas to a community, and more. For the 2019-21 biennium, it would have generated an estimated $200 million for the revolving loan fund, and shored up communities that are having to now raise taxes. The bill passed in the Senate but was defeated in the NDGOP-controlled House by one vote.
Senate Minority Leader Joan Heckaman said:
""I am certainly pleased to see Commissioner Godfread's proposal to the State Investment Board to prioritize more Legacy Fund investment in North Dakota-based projects to benefit our communities and help diversify our state's economy. Last session, SB 2276 gained quick support from the private sector and passed the Senate. Unfortunately, the House bill missed by a single vote. The proposal would be one step to building a balanced economy that works for all North Dakotans, and I’m encouraged to see bipartisan support growing for the idea.”
House Minority Leader Josh Boschee said:
""Democratic-NPL legislators have been supportive of investing a greater share of the Legacy Fund principal into projects that move North Dakota forward, while also providing a strong, sustainable return on the investment. This would provide opportunities to invest in our state's roads, bridges and water projects while keeping property taxes and special assessments low for property owners. And even more excitingly, provide additional state support to the development of well-vetted, private infrastructure that benefits economic diversification throughout North Dakota.""

Food Access is a Start, but Emergency Commission Falls Short for Workers and Families
BISMARCK, ND — Today, the six-member Emergency Commission voted to spend the last of North Dakota’s $1.25 billion in federal CARES Act money intended for COVID-19 relief. The small group allocated the allotment without any public input or broad legislative input. The result leaves out important and popular initiatives that would support workers, families, and the people most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The vote today included some progress on food access funding called for by a working group and Dem-NPL legislators, but failed to include an Emergency Paid Leave Fund that would serve workers, families, and small businesses. The Legislative Budget Section, which leaves 14 districts or roughly 200,000 people unrepresented in the process, will take an up or down vote next week.
Sen. Kathy Hogan, a member of a food access work group that proposed a $53 million plan for emergency and sustainable food programs, said:
“We are pleased that we have had an opportunity to present important proposals that address food access and to see money for refrigeration for food banks, expanded online SNAP purchasing, and the expansion for FEMA and CARES Act dollars for shelf-sustainable food at Great Plains Food Banks included in the Department of Agriculture funding. But we are disappointed that the administration hasn't done more as emergency food aid from Washington has stopped. Today’s funding is a beginning, but only a beginning.”
Rep. Karla Rose Hanson, who called for CARES Act money to be used for an Emergency Paid Leave Fund to benefit workers, families, and small business, said:
“It’s disappointing to see Gov. Burgum fail to seriously consider Emergency Paid Leave for North Dakota workers. This proposal is good for public health, good for families, and good for businesses. People who are sick or exposed to COVID-19 are asked to stay home, but many have to prioritize their paycheck so they still go to work. Paid leave would help businesses avoid outbreaks and keep their doors open, and it would help control the spread of the virus in our state.”
House Minority Leader Josh Boschee said:
“Without a formal process, we sought to create public debate about important issues workers and families are facing, and there are certainly portions of this budget that will benefit many North Dakotans. But because most of our Republican colleagues abdicated their legislative authority to the governor’s office, the process, and the resulting recovery plan is flawed. We cannot leave out 14 districts and more than 200,000 people and expect to have a recovery plan that works for all North Dakotans.”
Senate Minority Leader Joan Heckaman said:
“The budget included important contributions for cities and counties whose budgets are being strained by the pandemic. But there should have been a formal public process that gave every community a seat at the table, so we can make sure tax dollars are spent fairly across the state.”

Spread of Misinformation About Covid-19 ""Treatment"" by NDGOP Rep is Irresponsible
FARGO — After being exposed by The Dickinson Press for spreading misinformation about the covid-19 virus and pandemic, Rep. Luke Simons has failed to remove his misleading social media post. He did not respond to multiple requests for comment from the reporter, according to the Press’ article.
The North Dakota Health Department and Attorney General's Consumer Protection Division have warned North Dakotans about scams like this that prey on unsuspecting and anxiety-ridden people who are concerned about their health and the health of their loved ones.
A statement from The Democratic-NPL Party House Minority Leader Josh Boschee:
“At a time when there is already confusion and concern about our health and safety, Rep. Simons is declaring there are covid-19 'miracle cures,' a claim that goes against medical professionals from around the world. This is absolutely irresponsible and legislative malpractice at its worst.”

As GOP Leaders Refuse to Support Paid Sick Leave, Millions Are Given to Oil Companies
In spite of advocacy on the part of Dem-NPL leadership, and even studies showing how effective Paid Sick Leave policies are at helping stop the spread of COVID-19, the NDGOP leadership has refused to allocate any money for Paid Sick Leave to support workers affected by COVID. Sen. Tim Mathern of Fargo, “This money is supposed to help North Dakotans recover from the pandemic and support working families, not serve as another handout to an industry that is already at full workforce. This is more of the same insider spending that gave us the world-leading COVID-19 outbreak. It’s a misuse of taxpayer dollars in the middle of a crisis.” Read more here.
Dr. Shelley Lenz Takes on Gov. Burgum's Failed Leadership in Debate

This lawsuit puts the ACA on the chopping block, along with its coverage for preexisting conditions and tens of millions of dollars in federal support for North Dakota’s hospitals, especially those in rural areas. NDGOP has made no plan to address any of these issues. Read more here.

Poll Shows North Dakotans Agree with Dem-NPL Approach to Legacy Fund Spending
A recent survey conducted by WPA Intelligence found that nearly 79% of North Dakotans agreed with the idea that the Legacy Fund should be invested inside North Dakota, a position the Dem-NPL has taken for years in spite of GOP obstacles. Dem-NPL House Leader Josh Boschee, “North Dakotans are sending a strong message they’re unhappy with the way NDGOP has used Legacy Fund earnings to backfill the state budget rather than invest in North Dakota, leaving us reeling in another bust. We’ve been listening to North Dakotans, which is why we introduced a Legacy Fund plan that invests in our people, towns, and counties first.I t would help working families stay employed, boosts natural business growth, and encourages a diversified economy that works for all North Dakotans while investing in the talent and resources that make us great.""

NDGOP Legislator With Fever Bypasses Temp Check At COVID-19 Safety Meeting
Republican Sen.

President Joins Cramer With Attack on Social Security, Armstrong Silent Again
BISMARCK, ND — This weekend, the president issued an executive action that would defer the payroll tax that funds both Social Security and Medicare. The tax will still be owed, and both programs are at risk as the president vowed to make the cuts permanent. The order was part of a set of actions that fell woefully short of the relief package the GOP could have achieved by compromising across the aisle.
The House passed the $3.4 trillion HEROES Act almost three months ago. The Senate proposed the $1 trillion HEALS Act days before important portions of the CARES Act were scheduled to run out, including the $600 unemployment benefit. Last week, House Democrats offered to meet in the middle. The president left D.C., and his advisors walked away from the negotiating table.
Dem-NPL Communications Director Alex Rohr said:
‘“The president’s reckless plan puts Social Security and Medicare, which thousands of North Dakotans rely on, at serious risk during a national crisis. His promise of permanent cuts would break the most revered compact between the U.S. government and its citizens, who have paid into these programs for decades. Sen. Cramer spoke in favor of cutting Social Security, but we’re not hearing anything from Rep. Armstrong. Since he apparently doesn’t want the job, we need to elect Zach Raknerud who will fight for North Dakotans, young and old, to have access to healthcare and benefits they’ve already paid for.”
Rohr continued:
“The president is unilaterally cutting unemployment benefits for people out of work through no fault of their own and passing costs onto the state of North Dakota. This unfunded mandate wouldn’t be happening if Republicans in Congress had done their homework and compromised. This nation is in a serious economic and public health crisis. Our leaders need to start acting like it.”

Senate Fails to Hold a Fair Trial
(BISMARCK, ND) – The Democratic-NPL Party made the following statement about the Senate's failure to hold a fair impeachment trial.
Dem-NPL Communications Director Alex Rohr said:
“The United States only works when the branches of government act as proper checks and balances against each other. The Senate has entirely failed its duty to check the president. Senator John Hoeven and Kevin Cramer voted no today without hearing witness testimony. They abandoned their oaths of impartiality and failed North Dakota.”

Dem-NPL Legislators Call for Special Session Amid Covid-19 Economic Fall-Out
BISMARCK, ND — The Dem-NPL House and Senate Caucuses called today for a special session to ensure that the remainder of $1.25 billion in CARES Act funding is allocated fairly across North Dakota and to address the pandemic economy. Four Dem-NPL Legislators presented a $1 billion transportation bonding bill that would ensure counties, townships, and cities get the $230 million Prairie Dog funding they had planned on while freeing up $770 million for infrastructure projects statewide. The bonding infrastructure plan also frees up money for priority needs that cannot be bonded for, like education, human services, and other government functions as the state faces likely budget cuts.
The North Dakota Emergency Commission is expected to vote on spending $400 million of the $1.25 billion federal CARES Act funding on Thursday with a Legislative Budget Section meeting following next week. The Budget Section only has an up or down vote, which means six members of the same party are determining how to spend $1.25 billion, compared to the state’s $4.8 billion general fund spending. Fourteen districts have no representative in this process.
Sen. Tim Mathern said:
“No formal process for public input exists for spending $1.25 billion in federal money, compared to our general fund appropriation of $4.8 billion. Fourteen districts are completely left out of the process. Citizens deserve to be involved in how we spend this money to recover from the pandemic. Legislators have a responsibility to do our job in restarting our faltering economy.”
Sen. Larry Robinson said:
“The depressed ag economy is being compounded by serious road conditions throughout the state. In our particular area of the state we have road conditions that are in such disrepair that our farmers can’t get to their fields to harvest the 2019 crop so they can put in the 2020 crop. This is a high, high priority, and our farmers are asking for help. They need it now.""
Rep. Marvin Nelson said:
“We have to smooth out the boom and the bust. The state needs to have construction going when the rest of the economy is down, like now. We are behind the times and we’re building up this need for construction. This boom and bust is killing contractors, it’s cheating the public out of getting good value for their money. We need to do this bonding now to be responsible.”
House Minority Leader Josh Boschee said:
“The bonding bill is a way for us to save cash, to use smart investments when interest rates are low and to benefit our cities, our townships and our counties that were counting on Prairie Dog funding. It’s the right time, it’s the right opportunity. North Dakota has the tools to do this to make sure we make this money work best for our communities and for our citizens.""

Sen. Tim Mathern represents Senate District 11 in Fargo. Mathern is a member of the Budget Section and Appropriations Committee. He is Director of Public Policy at Prairie St. John’s.

NDGOP Leaders Fail to Hold Reps Accountable for Hate-Posting
BISMARCK, ND — Within only a week two NDGOP representatives were caught posting hateful memes to their social media feeds. Rep. Rick Becker compared Black Lives Matter to the KKK, and stood by his post in media reports. Rep. Jim Kasper posted racist and sexist memes, including one calling Sen. Kamala Harris a “hoe.” Kasper said he was hacked, the same excuse he made in January after posting similar content. He provided no evidence, but Republican leadership backed the ridiculous excuse. NDGOP leaders have been silent on Becker.
The NDGOP House Caucus and all NDGOP leaders must denounce Becker and Kasper who have not even hinted at an apology. Kasper’s running mate, Rep. Shannon Roers Jones, is the House Majority Caucus Leader.
The Democratic-NPL Party Chairwoman Kylie Ovesen said:
“You can’t say you’re pro-life and pro-liberty and not want to work against the inequity and injustice that black Americans are still facing after centuries. Rep. Kasper made up a lazy excuse and Rep. Becker is standing by his post. The rest of the NDGOP leaders seem resigned to stand by and do nothing. We’re calling on NDGOP leaders to denounce them, and show they believe in a North Dakota that works for all.”

Democratic-NPL to Host Virtual State Convention
BISMARCK, ND — In light of the necessary cancellation of the North Dakota Democratic-NPL State Convention, the party has chosen to conduct its convention business virtually. Below is an outline of the tentative plan and schedule:
* The Dem-NPL is committed to meeting its obligations to our delegates, candidates, and supporters and ensuring that everyone has a voice in our nominating process and in conducting other convention business.
* Through a virtual process, we will be endorsing candidates for statewide office, electing our DNC Committeeman and Committeewoman, and electing delegates to represent our state at the Democratic National Convention in July. Our Platform and Resolutions Committee will conduct the business of drafting and approving a Platform at a later date.
* The Dem-NPL staff and leadership is working closely with each District Chair to ensure all delegates and alternates are properly registered and credentialed prior to any votes being taken.
* All candidates (for statewide office, DNC committee member, and national delegate) have been given the opportunity to create and submit a video or a written statement announcing their candidacy. These videos will be posted on the Dem-NPL website and will be made available to all delegates and the general public. In addition, the candidates for statewide office are organizing a ""virtual townhall"" that will allow supporters from each District to meet and ask questions of the candidates. This townhall is scheduled for Friday - details forthcoming. Finally, the Dem-NPL has also created a private Facebook group that allows delegates to digitally interact with candidates over the week.
* On Saturday, through the Simply Voting platform, delegates will be certified and allowed to cast their ballot electronically for all of the aforementioned candidates. The Dem-NPL anticipates releasing results from these elections on early Saturday evening.
'While we are all facing uncertain times as our communities and world continue to manage the COVID-19 pandemic, the Dem-NPL remains committed to promoting an open, transparent process and encouraging full participation in our democracy and in the business of our party,"" said Kylie Oversen, Chairwoman of the North Dakota Democratic-NPL. ""We wish to reiterate our thanks for the patience our delegates, candidates, and supporters have shown as we navigate these new circumstances.""

NDGOP Reps for 200,000 Remain Silent as Last of $1.25 Billion Relief Spent
BISMARCK, ND — The Legislative Budget section passed the final $221 million in federal CARES Act money today, the result of agencies returning previous allocations. The budget section only gets an up or down vote after the six-member Emergency Commission, all Republicans, is largely in control of the process that is closed to public debate and input.
About 200,000 North Dakotans in 14 legislative districts are left completely unrepresented in the process that has included $0 for an Emergency Sick Leave Fund and insufficient resources for nursing homes and long term care as North Dakota continues near the top of the world in per capita COVID-19 cases. Districts: 3, 4, 6, 13, 16, 19, 21, 25, 26, 34, 41, 42, 43, 46 are not represented in the process. NDGOP legislators for these districts have failed to represent their communities by declining to advocate for a special session or any other process, that would allow their constituents to be represented in the recovery plans.
Lisa Finley-Deville, District 4 Senate candidate, said:
“Remember, not one District 4 legislator is advocating for the people who need assistance and protection from COVID-19 the most. Native Americans are 3.5 times more likely than any other population to contract COVID-19. We can no longer be an afterthought. When will we be a priority? The state should have also added a stronger investment into first responders like EMS and fire departments early in the pandemic because they have been struggling in rural communities like ours, including Fort Berthold for a long time. We will be a priority only when we elect legislators who actually represent our communities.”
Kari Breker, District 16 Senate candidate, said:
“There should have been an emergency special session to decide where that money went, so every district would have had a say. Our district didn’t get a voice, and none of our representatives said anything while just six men ignored a proposal for an Emergency Sick Leave Fund that would help working families stay home when they’re sick or need to quarantine without losing a paycheck. We could have used more of this money to help get the virus under control at nursing homes and long term care facilities, so we can see our family members for the holidays. But again, too few people were at the table.”
Adam Fortwengler, a District 42 House candidate, said:
“In Grand Forks, 20% of our neighbors live in poverty, more than 10% are without health insurance, more than 10% are food insecure, 40% cannot afford a $400 emergency, and 40% can barely afford their rent or mortgage. This was all before the pandemic, which has strained the lives of working families even further as people struggle to maintain employment while keeping their families safe. But my opponents stood by silent while their party leaders short-changed our neighbors. That’s unacceptable.”
Ben W. Hanson, a District 46 House candidate, said:
“Major budgetary decisions are still being made within days of an election with no input from the full legislature or the public. Once again, only a select few are able to even propose how North Dakota spends hundreds of millions of dollars. I called for a special session shortly after the pandemic began, but my opponents either lacked the motivation or vision to understand why we needed to act as a legislative branch before COVID could ramp up like this. That’s unacceptable. This kind of sit-by-and-wait mentality needs to change.”

Dem-NPL Leg Candidates Urge Action to Protect Educators, Support Staff
Four Dem-NPL legislative candidates urged the governor today to take action to protect teachers, support staff, and students at all North Dakota K-12 schools and higher education institutions.
“Ultimately, if parents aren’t at work, the economy grinds to a halt and stability of families suffer, and the crisis gets much worse overall. Parents need to know their children are safe and healthy and everything is being done to prevent the spread of the virus, but the expectations are high and the implementation is difficult. Making sure teachers, schools, and support staff have all the options available related to COVID-19, helps everyone make strong public health decisions, and will help assure parents that their kids are safe,"" said District 16 Senate Candidate Kari Breker. Read more here. She was joined by Naomi Muscha D-24 House, Zachary Tomczik D-42 House, and John Pederson D-20 House.
Dr. Shelley Lenz Calls Out Gov. Burgum for Leadership Failure as COVID-19 Rises
Numerous national research groups have stated that the COVID-19 situation in North Dakota is far worse than Gov. Burgum's administration is making it seem, with the positivity rate rising an entire percentage point over the past week.
Dem-NPL Gubernatorial candidate Dr. Shelley Lenz said in response, “I don’t think he knows what to do. We need a control and command strategy. ... It’s not just masks vs. non-masks. It’s (Burgum) not understanding how to lead through a common crisis which affects everything. It’s about sticking your head in the sand and wrapping your arms around a federal government that is not going to have a command and control strategy.”
Dr. Shelley Lenz Launches New Campaign Ads

Grand Forks County has been leading the rest of the state for new cases in recent weeks, yet Grand Forks Republicans still chose to host large public gatherings where few masks were worn and no social distancing was observed.

Dem-NPL Statement on Coal Creek Station Plant Retirement
BISMARCK — Great River Energy announced today it would close McLean County’s Coal Creek Station plant in 2022, although a sale to another coal operator may be in the works.
House Minority Leader Josh Boschee and Senate Minority Leader Joan Heckaman released the following statements.
House Minority Leader Josh Boschee said:
“Great River Energy has been an amazing partner to our state with the investments they continue to make in their all-of-the-above energy portfolio. Market demands for low-priced natural gas and consumer demand for renewable energy drive these decisions. So regardless of whether North Dakota can secure a buyer and keep this important community driver open, we must work together to secure good jobs, help diversify the local economy, and support the workers, their families, and communities directly impacted.”
Senate Minority Leader Joan Heckaman said:
“Hopefully, a new company will be able to keep this plant operating and its workers employed. At the same time, our response should involve preparations and investments that ensure this community and every other in North Dakota will always have opportunities for good-paying jobs and fulfilling work. Companies like Great River Energy have and will continue to be major assets to North Dakota, but we need to be investing in a diversified economy.”

Rep. Eidson to Step Down; District Committee to Fill the Seat by Oct. 21
BISMARCK, ND — On Thursday evening, District 43 Rep. Matt Eidson submitted his letter of resignation, which goes into effect September 30. He followed up with a statement via social media stating personal reasons for resigning and asking journalists not to contact him. Media requests may be directed to the Dem-NPL.
Eidson has represented District 43 since the 2018 election. He served in the United States Marine Corps from 2008 to 2015. He served on the House Finance and Taxation Committee and Energy and Natural Resources Committee. He advocated tirelessly for more effective services and funding for college students and veterans
Rep. Corey Mock, Grand Forks said:
“This is truly a bittersweet moment. Rep. Matt Eidson is a highly respected man of service, who built outsized influence over these past two years. Republicans and Democrats alike admired his principled work-ethic. It goes without saying that his absence will be noticed and his perspective will be missed.
It's personally difficult news for me as I've become close friends with Rep. Eidson. Since he was elected we've encouraged each other to learn new skills and grow professionally, holding each other accountable as we set goals for ourselves. I know our friendship will not fade as he moves on, but positive influences like Rep. Eidson are a rare find.
I know -- without a doubt -- the decision to move away from North Dakota and live closer to family was difficult. But it was undeniably the right choice as he focuses on his health and future service to our country. We're a better and stronger community thanks to Rep. Eidson's short tenure in the legislature, and I know he'll be following our progress closely in his next chapter.”
House Minority Leader Josh Boschee said:
“As a freshman legislator, Rep. Eidson instantly earned the respect of legislators from both political parties based on his ability to work towards solutions that benefit all North Dakotans. When he spoke on the House floor, the Chamber went silent. Everyone would stop what they were doing to hear him speak. He was a man of service, and his leadership will be missed. We wish him well and welcome him back to North Dakota any time.”
District 43 Chair Kaye Carlson said:
“The people of District 43 will miss Rep. Eidson. He was dedicated to serving our district well. We wish him all the best and are appreciative of all he has done for us. Our District has until October 21st to fill Matt's position. District 43 has many qualified candidates. We will be able to complete the interview process and have someone appointed within that time frame.""

Legacy Fund Poll Shows NDGOP Voted Against Vision Shared by North Dakotans
Dem-NPL Caucus Resumes Call for North Dakotans First Investment Plan
BISMARCK, ND — A recent survey conducted by WPA Intelligence backs up major reform proposals introduced by the Dem-NPL joint caucuses during the 2019 legislative session and in interim committees, in particular a revolving loan fund for community needs (SB 2276) as well as a Legacy Fund plan to Invest in North Dakotans First. The WPA Intelligence survey said 79% of North Dakotans want the Legacy Fund invested inside the state.
Republicans have had almost 10 years since the foundation of the Legacy Fund to make a plan to invest in North Dakota, but they’ve done little more than use interest to backfill the budget as an afterthought. The result is that the legislature has to respond to a second likely budget shortfall since 2016.
SB 2276 (2019)
* Introduced by Senate Minority Leader Joan Heckaman in 2019, SB 2276 would have dedicated 5% of the investments made on behalf of the Legacy Fund to the Bank of North Dakota for a revolving loan fund – or $200 million over the biennium – for community needs ranging from child care services to natural gas infrastructure.
* It would have shored up communities now having to raise taxes, invested in local economies, and created property tax relief.
* The bill gained immediate traction with the private sector and passed the Senate.
* NDGOP House Republicans killed it.
A Legacy Fund That Invests in North Dakotans First
* The plan would return 20% of Legacy Fund earnings into the principle for investment while creating targeted spending on priorities that put North Dakotans First and help build an economy that works for all.
* House MInority Leader Josh Boschee and Heckaman introduced it in the interim Legacy Fund committee early this year before the pandemic.
* Proposed funds
* Workforce Development and Lifelong Education Fund
* Research and Innovation Fund
* Regional Economic Development Infrastructure Fund
* Student Lunch Support Fund
* Highway Tax Distribution Fund
* Human Services & Health Stabilization Fund
* ND Arts & Culture Endowment Fund
Senate Minority Leader Joan Heckaman said:
“If SB 2276 had passed, we would already be investing Legacy Fund earnings directly into North Dakota to help plug gaps in our economy by supporting child care centers, nursing homes, and bringing natural gas to communities that need it to grow. These investments would have helped ease the burden on working families and communities, especially in rural areas, hit by the economic downtown and lagging state funding. Let’s invest in North Dakotans first, so we can build a legacy that works for all of our state.”
House Minority Leader Josh Boschee said:
“North Dakotans are sending a strong message they’re unhappy with the way NDGOP has used Legacy Fund earnings to backfill the state budget rather than invest in North Dakota, leaving us reeling in another bust. We’ve been listening to North Dakotans, which is why we introduced a Legacy Fund plan that invests in our people, towns, and counties first. It would help working families stay employed, boosts natural business growth, and encourages a diversified economy that works for all North Dakotans while investing in the talent and resources that make us great.”

Patrick Hart for Auditor Calls for Audit into Corrupt CARES Act Spending
Dem-NPL candidate for State Auditor Patrick Hart was recently interviewed by Tyler Axness on Afternoons Live to discuss his campaign and his call to audit CARES funding and how NDGOP officials have awarded lucrative contracts to party operatives.

Dem-NPL, Tribal Leaders, and Joe Biden Campaign Hold Native Issue Roundtable
Last week, representatives from every tribal nation in North Dakota came together to voice their concerns to Joe Biden's presidential campaign. Indian Country has been hit particularly hard by both the coronavirus pandemic and the downturn in oil development, yet President Trump has done little to reach out and help alleviate their concerns. Joe Biden's campaign, on the other hand, is taking proactive steps to give Tribal Nations a seat at the table and ensure that their perspective is heard. Read more here.
Dr. Shelley Made a Plan While Gov. Burgum Made Excuses
Dem-NPL gubernatorial candidate Dr. Shelley Lenz's campaign was recently highlighted in several different news articles - such as this one from the Minot Daily News that covers the five different candidates currently running for governor.
The Dickinson Press also published an overview of her campaign and why she is running to unseat Gov. Burgum. Lenz said, “(Burgum) didn’t understand that the way we support our oil industry — and the same with our ag industry, but I’m out west — is through thriving communities, and stable communities. What does that take? That is child care, health care, education, rent. … You invest in things that bring stability to a community, which is the working families.”
Zach Raknerud Fights for Working Families, While Armstrong Remains a Partisan
The Minot Daily News recently published an article about the race for North Dakota's At-Large congressional district featuring three candidates, incumbent Rep. Kelly Armstrong, Libertarian Steven Peterson, and Dem-NPL candidate Zach Raknerud.
Several main planks of Raknerud's platform are highlighted, including his positions on coronavirus relief, childcare costs, and universal healthcare. Raknerud said, “We are really hamstringing entrepreneurship in this country because people are stuck at jobs that they loathe because it provides them health care coverage and they can’t risk it. If we had Medicare cover everybody as a baseline, it would really open up our economy in a big way, where folks could take the leap of entrepreneurship.” Read more here.

Historic Native American Caucus Founded Within Dem-NPL
This weekend, The North Dakota Democratic-NPL Party State Policy Committee unanimously approved an application to form the Native American Caucus. Prairie Rose Seminole, Dr. Twyla Baker, and Rep. Ruth Buffalo brought the application and are organizing the caucus to build long term political engagement within Indigenous communities and with the Dem-NPL.
District 27 State Rep. Ruth Buffalo said, “This has been a long time coming. Diversity will only strengthen relationships across the state to address the issues that not only face our tribal communities, but our rural and urban populations. More native voices in the political landscape of North Dakota only deepens our understanding of one another, and there is value in knowing who our neighbors are and what impact public policy may have.” Read more here.

Pete Buttigieg to Keynote Dem-NPL Virtual Governors’ Dinner
BISMARCK, ND — The Democratic-NPL Party is excited to announce former Democratic presidential candidate and former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg will keynote the 3rd Annual Governors’ Dinner. The event is May 28 at 5 p.m. and will be held virtually for the first time as part of continued physical distancing efforts. The full speaker lineup will be forthcoming.
The Democratic-NPL Party Chairwoman Kylie Oversen said:
“We are incredibly excited to have Mayor Pete join us for our Annual Governors' Dinner. Of course, we wish we could be holding the event in person, but continuing with physical distancing is the best decision for our candidates, supporters, and the public health. The switch to virtual campaigning is a challenge, but I’m proud of Dem-NPL ingenuity during this unprecedented time.”
About Mayor Pete:
Pete Buttigieg has served as two-term mayor of South Bend, Indiana and was a Democratic candidate for president of the United States in 2020. A graduate of Harvard University and an Oxford Rhodes Scholar, Buttigieg enlisted in the U.S. Navy Reserve and became a lieutenant when he was deployed to Afghanistan in 2014. In April 2019 he announced his candidacy for president and in February 2020 won the Iowa Caucuses, becoming the first openly gay person to ever win a presidential primary or caucus.
About the Governors' Dinner:
The Governors' Dinner was first held in 2018 as a fundraiser and campaign event for statewide candidates, including former Sen. Heidi Heitkamp. Jodi Gillette, former Senior Policy Advisor for Native American Affairs under President Barack Obama, was the first keynote speaker. Last year’s keynote speaker was champion bronc rider and former South Dakota state senator and gubernatorial candidate, Billie Sutton.

Sen. Cramer Tells North Dakotans to “Bite the Bullet” Amid Pandemic’s Economic Fall-Out
BISMARCK, ND — In an interview with CNBC, Sen. Kevin Cramer suggested North Dakotans should “bite the bullet” with cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. These programs literally hold up many communities, especially in rural America, even when the nation is not in the middle of a pandemic that will have economic repercussions that last for years.
Democratic-NPL Party Chairwoman Kylie Oversen said:
“Social Security keeps people in their homes. Medicare ensures seniors can go to the doctor, and Medicaid is almost single handedly keeping rural hospitals open. If Kevin Cramer has his way, his constituents will feel the impact more than most. Kevin Cramer has once again shown that he has no idea what real people are facing — his government paycheck and taxpayer funded healthcare is secure no matter what.”

BREAKING: NDGOP Fined by Federal Election Commission As Pay-to-Play Scandal Continues
BISMARCK, ND — The North Dakota Republican Party will pay an $8,000 fine to the Federal Election Commission for failing to disclose campaign expenditures in the 2016 cycle, putting the party’s current campaign expenditures into question. The agreement was posted by a Business Insider reporter Friday afternoon on Twitter.
The news comes as Rep. Kelly Armstrong, Sen. Kevin Cramer, and Sen. John Hoeven, are drawing questions for using their official power to secure $1.7 billion in federal contracts for Fisher Industries. The North Dakota-based company came under fire from the president for building a privately funded border wall that is already eroding. Armstrong and Cramer both received significant campaign contributions from Fisher, a company with a history of shady business dealings.
The Democratic-NPL Party Chairwoman Kylie Oversen said:
“The FEC fines alone demand serious scrutiny into ongoing NDGOP finances. But three of the state’s top Republicans are also entangled in a pay-to-play scandal that is about to take the American taxpayers for $1.7 billion. NDGOP and its leaders are showing an alarming pattern of corruption by misusing public and private funds. The swamp is getting worse.”

Gov. Burgum Dodges the Facts While Dr. Shelley Lenz Follows the Data
As the COVID-19 situation in North Dakota grows more perilous, it's clear that Gov. Burgum is not even following the state's own guidelines for crisis response. Burgum has shown himself to be a weak leader in a time where North Dakota desperately needs a strong one. Dr. Shelley Lenz, on the other hand has outlined clear plans that would drastically improve the situation. Lenz said, ""This crisis is unprecedented in our recent history. COVID-19 does not discriminate. It is not political — and the response must not be political. Our response must be driven by data from reliable, neutral sources and must evolve as new information emerges."" Read more here.

As NDGOP's Gallion Draws Ire from State Employees, Patrick Hart Promises Value-Added Auditing
Former Commerce Commissioner Michelle Kommer blasted State Auditor Josh Gallion in a meeting with the Legislative Audit and Fiscal Review Committee recently, criticizing his antagonistic approach to the job and his abuse of the office for personal gain.
Patrick Hart, Dem-NPL candidate for State Auditor, said, “The auditor’s job is to ensure proper processes and procedures are followed to prevent, waste, fraud, and abuse of our tax dollars. My opponent abused his power to go around the law, avoided performing his duty, and sought to manipulate state law in some kind of political game to make headlines for himself. He hurt state employees and wasted tax dollars. The auditor should create value and engage with public employees, so our tax dollars are spent wisely. That is exactly why I am running.” Learn more here.
Mark Haugen's Reputation for Integrity and Trust Is Making Inroads Across the Aisle
Dem-NPL State Treasurer candidate Mark Haugen's campaign has been gaining attention from not only Dem-NPLers, but also Republicans, as he has managed to land several high-profile endorsements from prominent conservative leaders.

Legislative Candidates Emphasize Mental Health Focus for Next Session
Last week, Dem-NPL candidates Sen. Larry Robinson, Tracey Wilkie, Jackie Hoffarth, and Will Thompson discussed the lack of funding for behavioral health support. Improving service access and quality will be top priorities for the Dem-NPL caucus in the upcoming session, as the COVID-19 pandemic has also had a tremendously negative effect on many people's mental health and well-being. District 24 Sen. Larry Robinson stated, “When it knocks at your door, it’s a rude awakening, and you quickly find yourself searching for help, and advice, and direction, and support. The revolving door aspect of treatment, addiction, and so on has not worked, and we know that, and we’ve learned from that over the last number of years."" Read more here.

Republicans Move for Hypocritical Power Grab After Justice Ginsburg's Death
Longtime Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg sadly passed away this weekend, leaving behind a remarkable judicial legacy. Read a statement from Dem-NPL Chairwoman Kylie Oversen here.
Within an hour, Senate Republicans went on the offensive directly contradicting their words and actions from 2016 when they refused to even consider President Obama's Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland, claiming the appointment should not be considered in a presidential election year. At that time, Sen. Hoeven said voters should have say. However, both he and Senator Cramer have shamelessly changed their position, demonstrating once again that their hypocrisy and lack of integrity know no bounds.
Dem-NPL District 4 Takes Rep Terry Jones to Court Over His Wyoming Residency
District 4 Dem-NPL Chair Kenton Onstad recently filed a lawsuit against Rep. Terry B. Jones, showing that his status as a registered agent for a business in Wyoming, which requires a declaration of residency in that state, means he is not eligible to serve in the ND House or run for state representative. If the Dem-NPL's lawsuit is successful, it could clear the way for Hunter Andes and Thomasina Mandan, the Dem-NPL candidates in District 4.
LGBTQ+ Individuals Are Leaving North Dakota Because of Bigotry As Expressed in NDGOP Platform
A recent survey reported on by the Grand Forks Herald showed an unfortunate reality for the state of North Dakota, which is that LGBTQ+ individuals often feel unwelcome and ostracized, spurring them to move out of state. As it has been a goal of North Dakota policymakers for decades to encourage youth to both stay and move to the state, this is a troubling problem. The report comes not long after the NDGOP's platform made headlines for being so bigoted, no one wants to even admit who wrote it.
District 18 Senate candidate Kyle Thorson said of his experience growing up in the closet in rural North Dakota, “I truly, truly believe that’s one of the biggest reasons people leave the state. They don’t find people who either support them or make them feel welcome, and it’s super hard to build community.”
Dr. Shelley Lenz Proposes COVID-19 Management Plan
Dem-NPL Gubernatorial nominee Dr. Shelley Lenz recently put forth a COVID-19 management plan that she would put into place if elected, emphasizing the importance of public health expertise in decision making and promising a response focused on health, not political pressure. Dr. Shelley said, ""The response must not be political. Our response must be driven by data from reliable, neutral sources, and must evolve as new information emerges.""

As COVID-19 Outbreak Intensifies, Gov. Burgum Fails to Acknowledge the Severity
Currently, North Dakota does not meet our own criteria for Low Risk, but Gov. Burgum has refused to move the dial even as we're considered by independent standards to be in the red zone. Local schools, small businesses, and families are making complicated decisions, and we hope the governor isn't using the pandemic to play politics.
Dem-NPL Gubernatorial nominee Dr. Shelley Lenz stated, ""Burgum is using an arbitrary measure that he made up himself. He has no clear criteria from moving it one level to another. It’s meaningless like a marketing gimmick."" Read more here.
HEROES Act Would Serve Workers, Give Local Options for School Openings
After letting the House HEROES Act sit for 10 weeks without any discussion or debate, Senate Republicans unveiled the HEALS Act, a last-minute bill that includes provisions such as $1.8 billion for a new FBI building, eliminating food programs while doubling the three-martini lunch deduction for business meals, and slashing unemployment to workers affected by the pandemic. The HEROES Act includes hazard pay for essential workers who have been risking their safety and health over the course of the pandemic. HEALS does not. Read more here.
Dem-NPL Congressional candidate Zach Raknerud stated, ""The HEROES Act would go a long way toward protecting workers across the board. [...] Those who are risking exposure to COVID-19 in order to maintain our way of life should be protected and compensated in a way reflective of that.” Zach also described the HEALS Act as just ""another gift wrapped for the donor class.” Read more here.
NDGOP Leaders Refuse to Take Responsibility for Anti-LGBTQ+ Platform
The North Dakota Republican Party made national news this weekend with a story in HuffPost about their refusal to take responsibility for their horrific anti-LGBTQ+ platform. Read more here. Party leaders who finally denounced the platform should have spoken up before the resolution passed or before the Fargo Forum broke the news. They failed to do so, as written in an op-ed penned by leaders of several LGBTQ+ advocates and other organizations. Read more here.

Emergency Commission Plans Gift to Oil Industry While Pandemic Response Lags
BISMARCK, ND — The Emergency Commission is scheduled to meet Friday morning to begin allocating $221 million in returned CARES Act money intended as public health and economic relief from the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated by the lagging response by Republican leaders. The current CARES Act proposal by Gov. Burgum’s administration would allocate another $16 million to oil companies, which, according to news reports, already have their workforce at full strength.
Burgum’s purported reasoning for spending $66 million in federal relief funds to cap abandoned oil wells was maintaining their workforce. Meanwhile, North Dakota’s hospital beds are at capacity, and the state is telling those who test positive for the virus to perform their own contact tracing. The North Dakota National Guard is being used to inform those who test positive because of a backlog.
Sen. Tim Mathern, Fargo, said:
“Oil companies are already back to a full workforce, so giving them $16 million is a just handout and an incredible misuse of tax dollars that could help small businesses or independent contractors struggling to stay open or working families barely able to afford rent. The Emergency Commission’s plan is more of the same response that gave us the highest number of per capita COVID-19 cases in the world and has pushed our healthcare resources past their limit. If they’re using the National Guard to notify people they have COVID, it’s worse than we’re being told. More of the same isn’t getting it done, and it’s not serving the North Dakotans who need the most help.”
Rep. Gretchen Dobervich, Fargo, said:
“Our healthcare system is overburdened and as COVID-19 cases continue rising, we can expect it to get even worse. Now individuals who contract a debilitating disease are being told to do their own contact tracing. We have a chance to use this money to save lives, and that means investing in data-driven programs like an emergency sick leave fund that will keep workers employed and enable them to make safe and smart decisions to quarantine without financial risk to their families or their employers. We need to support public health because these essential workers deserve far more support than they’re getting as they work day in and day out to serve the public through this crisis. What we’ve been doing isn’t working.”

Dr. Shelley Embraces Collaboration, While Burgum Shuts Out Critical Voices
BISMARCK, ND — Today, Dr. Shelley Lenz, candidate for Governor, and Ben Vig, candidate for Lieutenant Governor, released a comprehensive and collaborative COVID-19 Crisis Management Plan and governing structure, including an equal relationship between the governor, state legislature, and tribal nations.
A key component of the Lenz-Vig plan would be to convene a special session of the legislature, a call made this year by Dem-NPL legislators, and supported by some Republicans, that went unheeded by Gov. Burgum and NDGOP leadership.
A recent Associated Press report also showed that Gov. Burgum used a far different tone in private than in public when talking about the state's pandemic environment. On the same day he emailed staff saying “our house is on fire” and pressed a “sense of urgency and action,” he visited Washington, D.C. and all but declared victory over the virus and the economic downturn caused by the chaotic response. Burgum has lost two top public health officials during the pandemic.
The Democratic-NPL Party Chairwoman Kylie Oversen said:
“Where Gov. Burgum has chosen to shut out critical voices, losing two top public health officials in the process, Dr. Shelley would embrace collaboration. Where the governor has warped the risk-level to meet his political needs, Dr. Shelley will follow the facts. We need a governor who leads with transparency and who listens to experts, so we can get the virus under control and begin an economic recovery that works for all North Dakotans.”

Food Access Group Calls for $53 Million From CARES Act For Emergency Need and Infrastructure
BISMARCK, ND — An Ad Hoc Committee on Food Access in North Dakota called today for $53 million in federal CARES Act funding to address ongoing food insecurity made worse by the covid-19 pandemic. Members of the group presented a three-pronged approach that included extending SNAP program benefits needed immediately while investing in local infrastructure and supply chains that support family farmers and our economy.
The North Dakota Emergency Commission and Legislative Budget Section are expected to vote on spending a large portion of the state's $1.25 billion federal CARES Act funding this month. As reported in multiple media outlets, Great Plains Food Bank has estimated a 44% increase in need network-wide. The virtual press conference Thursday followed a memo proposing a three-pronged approach to Assuring Access to Food sent by Sen. Kathy Hogan to Superintendent Kirsten Baesler, Agriculture Commissioner Doug Goehring, and Department of Human Services Executive Director Chris Jones.
Assuring Access to Food
* Enhance and strengthen the SNAP program for people with low incomes in North Dakota
* Address food supply/distribution disruptions that are impacting many communities
* Strengthen emergency food networks throughout North Dakota
Sen. Kathy Hogan said:
“North Dakota has an amazing State Mill and Elevator. We have strong cooperatives that process sugar and grains. Based on these models, we need to look at the entire food chain to help our farmers and other partners produce the foods we need and the whole world will need.”
Karen K. Ehrens said:
“North Dakotans have a long history of neighbor helping neighbor. What if we can use this time and resources available to meet the need for food now, and also use those resources so they will also be of help in the future?’
Jacqueline Lormé:
“The hunger is enough to break your heart when you hear a child say ‘I’m hungry,’ but it’s also affecting the health of my neighbors. It’s a full circle. If you don’t have access to food, you can’t be healthy. If you can’t be healthy, you can’t work productively.”
Rep. Ruth Buffalo said:
“Some of our tribal nations are already short-staffed and underfunded. They were already operating in crisis mode, but when the pandemic hit, it crippled many tribal programs. We have an opportunity to strengthen food sovereignty and partnerships among Tribal Nations. Many communities within tribal nations across North Dakota have started a record number of gardens. Partnerships are so important with local and tribal entities to help improve food access, transportation, and the quality and affordability of food.”
Participants
Sen. Kathy Hogan represents District 21 in Fargo. She worked in human services for more than 40 years, including with a range of food security programs. She is a former director of Cass County Social Services.
Karen K. Ehrens, RD, LRD is a food, nutrition, and health consultant and advocate who works with The Creating a Hunger Free ND Coalition.
Jacqueline Lormé lives in the Madison neighborhood in North Fargo and has personally experienced the food crisis and sees how it affects her own neighborhood. She is a graduate of the Culinary Institute of America.
Rep. Ruth Buffalo represents District 27 in Fargo, is an enrolled member of the M.H.A. Nation, and is originally from Mandaree. She is a public health professional and educator.

USPS Gives NoDak a ‘Heightened Warning’ for Mail-in Ballot Delays
BISMARCK, ND — North Dakota is one of the states that received a “Heightened Warning” for mail-in ballot delays from the United States Postal Service, according to recent news from The Washington Post. That warning means delays are expected to a degree that could disenfranchise voters in North Dakota. The 33 of 53 counties that relied on mail-in voting before the pandemic were primarily rural. The House is returning to Washington to investigate the slow-down influenced by the GOP mega-donor who was named Postmaster General.
The president has said he refuses to compromise on COVID-19 relief if it includes support for the Post Office because he doesn’t want to increase mail-in voting, a right he takes advantage of himself. When asked by a reporter about the president’s confessed attempt to sabotage the Postal Service to suppress mail-in votes, North Dakota’s delegation defended the president and pointed fingers. Rep. Armstrong said he is on a relevant committee, but that they have done nothing to address long-standing needs facing USPS.
The Democratic-NPL Party Chairwoman Kylie Oversen said:
“The U.S. Postal Service is vital to hard-working Americans who rely on it for so many critical services, including voting by mail. If we’re already being warned about mail-in delays for the November 3 election, what does that mean for our neighbors who rely on USPS for life-sustaining prescription drugs and to pay their bills on time right now?
USPS is a hallmark of America, and an essential government service. We need to defend it and fully fund it. Full stop. I’m calling on Sen. Kevin Cramer, Sen. John Hoeven, and Rep. Kelly Armstrong to step the heck up already and to stop playing the blame game. What are you doing to ensure your neighbors back home can continue to rely on USPS? What are you doing to ensure all Americans can cast their ballots, regardless of who they are voting for?”

Oil Response Must Focus on Families, Small Businesses, and Communities that Rely on Industry
BISMARCK, ND — North Dakota is facing possibly unprecedented budget challenges as the oil market crashed this week. The plunge follows an international price war as well as dropping oil use during the covid-19 pandemic.
The energy industry has been integral in creating good-paying jobs and funding for North Dakota’s roads, schools, and other infrastructure projects.
Senate Minority Leader Joan Heckaman said:
“We’re committed to finding solutions that focus on the families, small businesses, and communities who rely on the energy industry for good-paying jobs. The industry has been a partner for years and we will continue to work together. We also should acknowledge the need to grow and diversify our economy and budget sources, so that we don’t face a storm like this one again.”

Sen. Hoeven Owes Answers to North Dakotans Over Stock Purchase and COVID-19 Briefing
BISMARCK, ND — Just days after he received a briefing on the COVID-19 virus and the U.S. response to what would become a pandemic, Sen. John Hoeven invested between $100,000 and $250,000 into health sciences stock, according to a news report by CNBC. The fund owns shares in pharmaceutical developers and medical device manufacturers, CNBC said.
Several members of the U.S. Senate are under scrutiny related to the information they received about COVID-19 and subsequent investment decisions. The CNBC story leaves two questions unanswered that could indicate whether Hoeven acted improperly.
Hoeven has not yet provided documentation for the following questions, according to CNBC:
* When did Hoeven’s financial advisor suggest he make the stock purchase?
* When did he decide to purchase the stock?
Dem-NPL Communications Director Alex Rohr said:
“If there’s nothing to hide, Sen. Hoeven should have no problem producing proof for his assertion that he acted above board. North Dakotans deserve transparency from their elected officials, especially during times of crisis.”
Rohr continued:
""While it was becoming clear we were at risk of a global pandemic, Sen. Hoeven was apparently worried about his own financial well-being, rather than preparing for the lost jobs, school closures, and gaps in childcare his constituents are dealing with now.""

Dem-NPL Leadership Calls on Governor To Hold His Party Accountable
GRAND FORKS, ND — House Minority Leader Josh Boschee and Senate Minority Leader Joan Heckaman both spoke in a press conference at University of North Dakota's Wilkerson Commons following Governor Burgum's State of the State address.
The Dem-NPL House and Senate leadership called for the Governor to hold his party accountable to fulfilling many of the initiatives he talked about today, including meeting behavioral health needs, maintaining quality education, and investing in infrastructure projects — issues the Dem-NPL has prioritized for years.
The Governor made a point of saying North Dakota needs to leave the status quo behind. But, he failed to use that idea to hold his own party accountable for voting against the interests of their constituents. Also missing from the address was a clear long term tax plan that would organize the complicated tax code that changes every few years because of tweaks at the legislature.
House Minority Leader Josh Boschee said:
“As the leader of his party, he has a lot to do to bring his fellow Republicans along. He can’t support candidates who aren’t supporting the vision he’s presenting, much of which we agree with. There are too many idealogues who are voting for their self-interest versus what’s best for their communities and North Dakota. Voters in rural communities are paying for services that exist, but they don’t have access to them. That needs to change.”
Senate Minority Leader Joan Heckaman said:
“The reality is that taxes have gone up in most communities. The political subdivisions have had to pick up the burden and put it on their local taxpayers. That’s one of the reasons we’re looking at a longer term tax plan rather than just come every session and move some tax higher, some tax lower, put a new tax in, take an old tax out. There’s so many taxes out there that we need to consider, but I don’t see a long term vision for North Dakota right now.”

Dem-NPL Statewide Candidates Plan Virtual Town Halls After Convention Goes Digital
BISMARCK, ND — Five candidates seeking The Democratic-NPL Party endorsement for statewide races will host live town halls Friday from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. The town halls will give delegates to the state convention an opportunity to talk to statewide candidates for public office seeking endorsements.
The statewide candidates organized the event independent of the Dem-NPL Party. They will hold seven town halls on the hour starting at 8 a.m. with delegates divided into regions, so everyone has a chance to interact.
Patrick Hart, who is seeking the Dem-NPL endorsement for state auditor, said:
“Our intention with the town hall is to actually talk to delegates in a true back and forth way. This event is designed to make up for the personal interactions candidates and delegates would have had during an in-person convention.”
Press are invited to log into the virtual town hall, but will not be permitted to ask questions during that time as the process is meant to create space for delegates and candidates to interact. Please RSVP to [[URL REDACTED]] to receive the dial in information. All media requests are subject to approval by Dem-NPL staff or the policy committee.
Candidates participating
Shelley Lenz is running for Governor
Zach Raknerud is running for U.S. House
Mark Haugen is running for State Treasurer
Patrick Hart is running for State Auditor
Casey Buchmann is running for Public Service Commission

Dem-NPL Leadership Introduces Plan for Responsible Investment of Legacy Earnings
WATFORD CITY, ND — The Democratic-NPL Leadership introduced a plan for responsible investment for Legacy Fund earnings during the Legacy Fund Earnings Committee meeting Thursday. The plan will stabilize the state budget by preparing for the reality of fluctuating commodities while supporting our economy by investing in North Dakotans first.
House Minority Leader Josh Boschee and Senate Minority Leader Joan Heckaman presented the plan, which saves for the future and serves the needs of now, such as highway and economic development infrastructure, public health and human services, and student lunch support. The plan would also support the working families who make business growth possible, through programs like childcare, paid family leave, skills training, and prek-12 education.
The plan uses a five-year rolling average of the Legacy Fund’s earnings, which will allow North Dakota to better prepare for each biennium, rather than using the Legacy Fund as a catch-all after the fact. That formula estimates a 5% return. The first 20% of those available funds will be transferred to the principle for savings, leaving 80% of the total earnings available for investment into the state’s priorities.
House Minority Leader Josh Boschee said:
“Our citizens are our most important resource and when we invest in them, we know that our families are stronger, our communities are resilient, and our state is more competitive. The common thing we hear from industry leaders and employers is they want an educated and skilled workforce, and this plan will allow us to do a better job of investing in North Dakotans first.”
Senate Minority Leader Joan Heckaman said:
“The cuts made after the Republican majority failed to plan ahead hit rural communities with aging infrastructure the hardest. By investing in healthcare, natural gas, economic development, and education infrastructure, we serve the needs of today while building resilient communities.”
Estimated Earnings Invested/Approximated Money Available June 30, 2021
* Workforce Development and Lifelong Education Fund: 10%, $42 million
* Research and Innovation Fund: 15%, $63 million
* Regional Economic Development Infrastructure Fund: 15%, $63 million
* Student Lunch Support Fund: 10%, $42 million
* Highway Tax Distribution Fund: 25%, $105 million
* Human Services & Health Stabilization Fund: 15%, $63 million
* ND Arts & Culture Endowment Fund: 10%, $42 million

DEM-NPL NAMES NEW EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR
BISMARCK — The Democratic-Nonpartisan League Party Policy Committee voted unanimously Saturday morning to name Michael Taylor as the Executive Director. Taylor most recently worked as the Caucus Director for the House and Senate Caucuses where he crafted policy and strategy to support Dem-NPL legislative efforts. He first joined the Dem-NPL as an intern in 2016 before being hired as a field organizer and then Operations Director in 2017. Taylor also worked as the legislative assistant for the House Minority leader during the 2019 legislative session.
Taylor said:
“I’m excited to continue the ground-up approach guiding the Dem-NPL. That vision and the focus on communities across North Dakota helped us secure legislative gains during the 2018 election. Our volunteers, district leaders, and staff across the state are building a strong bench of candidates who are making the issues that affect North Dakotans our top priorities.”
Dem-NPL Chair Kylie Oversen said:
“Michael brings a wealth of knowledge about North Dakota, the legislature, and the issues facing communities across the state. He has consistently been a reliable, trustworthy, and dedicated staff member who understands the importance of electing candidates who work to build a North Dakota that works for everyone.”

Burgum Delay Tactics Put Public Schools At Risk
(BISMARCK, ND) – The Democratic-NPL Party released the following statement in response to Gov. Burgum’s request to reconsider Land Commissioner Jodi Smith’s plan to collect unpaid natural gas royalties. The Land Board met Thursday.
Communications Director Alex Rohr said:
“The courts told the Land Commissioner she can collect unpaid bills. The Land Board approved a plan to do it, but after hearing from lobbyists, Gov. Burgum started the delay tactics. He’s putting tens of millions of dollars owed to public schools in jeopardy. North Dakotans deserve a governor who keeps his word and stands up for public schools.”

Governor's COVID-19 Childcare Plan Must Look Out For Childcare Workers
BISMARCK, ND — The Democratic-NPL Party Joint Caucuses encourage North Dakotans to participate in the governor’s call for input as the administration develops a plan to address childcare shortages related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Please reach out to the Department of Human Services with your concerns, questions, and personal experiences by phone at (701) 328-2310 or email [[URL REDACTED]]
Sen. Kathy Hogan, the Dem-NPL Joint Caucus Lead on Human Services said:
“Childcare providers are some of the lowest paid employees in North Dakota while providing a service that is now more critical than ever. They often don’t have health insurance and are feeling very vulnerable right now. We encourage the governor to make sure the economic and health needs of childcare workers and all working families are included in this plan.”

Martin's Residency Information Submitted to Secretary of State Last Week
BISMARCK, ND — Last week, Travisia Martin, the North Dakota Democratic-NPL Party candidate for Insurance Commissioner, returned a letter and testimony to the Secretary of State of North Dakota, Al Jaeger, explaining her residency status here since 2015. The NDGOP on Tuesday put out a press release making incorrect statements that were contrary to these facts. Secretary Jaeger confirmed this morning that he received her email last week.
The materials included testimony and other documents that show she has resided in North Dakota with her partner since moving here in 2015. The letter also explained her decision to vote in the presidential election in Nevada in 2016.
Travisia Martin said:
“The truth of the matter is that as a traveling healthcare provider, I spent significant time all over the country prior to 2015. An injury left me unable to work during that year, and I made the decision to move to North Dakota to be with my partner Dale permanently. I have been proud to call this place my home since then.”
Martin continued:
“I did vote in Nevada in the 2016 general election. However, this was solely because of my unfamiliarity with voting requirements in North Dakota. I did not know whether I would be eligible to vote here yet, and I admit that I failed to do the necessary research to answer that question. Rather, because I wanted to be absolutely sure that I could exercise my right to vote, I went ahead and voted in Nevada because I felt more confident I would be eligible there. It was simply a desire to make sure my voice was heard in the electoral process.”
To follow up
Martin is working today as a frontline healthcare worker, and will be available to press Thursday from 1-3 p.m. via phone at 702-443-0171.
