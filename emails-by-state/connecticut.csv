PRESIDENT TRUMP: “Today, every patriotic American heart beats in solidarity with the incredible people of New York and New Jersey.”

PRESIDENT TRUMP: “The USNS Comfort, which is in New York – there’s been a lot of publicity about that coming in. That was not supposed to be for the virus at all, under any circumstances. But it looks like more and more we’re going to be using it for that.”
PRESIDENT TRUMP: “Tomorrow, we’ll deliver an additional 600,000 N95 masks to New York City to take care of the needs of the public hospital system.”

SUPPLIES OF CRITICAL MEDICAL EQUIPMENT
PRESIDENT TRUMP: “Since last Sunday, cargo planes have delivered almost – listen to this – 300 million gloves, almost 8 million masks, and 3 million gowns. And many more fully loaded cargo planes are right now on the way.”
VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: “Governor Inslee today announced that they were sending 400 ventilators back to the strategic national stockpile, and those will be deployed at the point of need.”
REAR ADM. JOHN POLOWCZYK: “The air bridge, we had three additional flights come in today, bringing a million gowns, 2.8 million N95 masks, 2.8 million surgical masks, 11.8 million gloves, 18.6 thousand gowns on three flights. And that material will be pushed out across the nation, and delivered to hospitals, nursing homes across the country.”

PRESIDENT TRUMP: “I can report today that the United States has now tested and given results, gotten results of 1.67 million people, that’s far more than any other country’s been able to do.”

"Help me END Nancy Pelosi's Majority
View this email in your browser
Alex --
Do you know what stands between Nancy Pelosi and the speaker's gavel?
I DO.
Jahana Hayes mislead Connecticut voters, using her very first vote to make Pelosi the most powerful person in Congress.
END PELOSI'S MAJORITY
That's one of many reasons we need to make her a one term representative.
Will you help make it happen?
As I crisscross the fifth district, I hear frustration from so many voters. They are sick of a broken system in Washington that leaves We The People stuck with the tab for their failure.
As a junior groupie to ""The Squad"", Jahana Hayes has proven to be just another rubber stamp for every left wing nightmare you can think of. From the Green New Deal to Endorsing ""Nonviolent"" RIOTS, Defunding The Police, and even Government Run Healthcare, the AOC-Hayes-Pelosi Wish List is one Connecticut families just can't afford.
STOP THE SQUAD
That's why I need your help to stop it, right away!
I'm working day and night to get the message out about my solutions to the mess Jahana Hayes and Nancy Pelosi are causing in Congress. But I need a strong Get Out The Vote machine to make sure that we have our say on November 3rd.
If you rush a contribution of $10, $25, even $50 or more to this link by midnight tonight, my campaign will be able to deploy extra staff and resources into the field to make sure ballots are being counted correctly, shenanigans are stopped at the source, and the people of our district get to have their voices heard in this critical election.
Don't you think that Connecticut deserves at least ONE vote against the extreme left in Congress, Alex?
I need your investment in this fight if we are going to make it happen. Thanks for your support!

Safely Opening Up Our Country Again is Critical for the Wellbeing of the American People
PROMOTING THE WELLBEING OF ALL AMERICANS
* For the wellbeing of all Americans, it is critical that we move towards safely reopening the country as soon as we are able.
* It is vital that we consider the toll a long-term shutdown would have on Americans’ health and wellbeing.
* Estimates suggest a clear increase in suicides and opioid deaths as the unemployment rate rises.
* Many Americans have had to forego important preventative health services like breast cancer screenings.
* Americans across the country have made hard sacrifices to slow the spread and save lives. Now we must honor their sacrifices by moving toward a safe reopening.
SAFELY REOPENING THE COUNTRY
* President Trump and his Administration are committed to helping provide states with the information and resources they need to safely reopen.
* The President has laid out a phased approach under the Opening Up America guidelines that will enable to states to reopen based on the situation on the ground.
* President Trump’s efforts to ramp up testing across the country have built up enough testing capacity to enable states to move toward phase one of reopening.
* Recently, multiple states have reported their testing capacity has now outpaced demand.
* The Trump Administration has launched Operation Warp Speed, a historic effort that is working to develop therapeutics and vaccines in record time.
* The President’s mobilization of the private sector has provided states with critical medical supplies – including ventilator supplies that exceed demand.

Good afternoon,
The Trump Administration continues to take sweeping but necessary steps to address the COVID-19 epidemic, including:
* The President announced he is extending CDC guidelines for 30 days to slow the spread of the virus.
* The President signed the CARES Act, providing unprecedented and immediate relief to American families, workers, and businesses.
* President Trump declared a national emergency, inviting States, territories, and tribes to access over $42 billion in existing funding.
* President Trump signed initial legislation securing $8.3 billion for coronavirus response.
* President Trump signed an executive order giving the DoD and DHS the authority to activate the ready reserve components of the armed forces to assist with coronavirus response.
* In January, President Trump reacted quickly to implement travel restrictions on travel from China, buying us valuable time to respond to the virus. The President has announced further travel restrictions on global hotspots, including Europe, the United Kingdom and Ireland, and Iran.
* The FDA has issued emergency approval for multiple new commercial coronavirus tests, including some that deliver results to healthcare providers within minutes.
Please see below for highlights of yesterday’s Coronavirus Task Force Briefing. Also, see the attached briefing charts displayed by Dr. Deborah Birx and Dr. Anthony Fauci.
Yesterday President Trump issued major disaster declarations for Montana and Ohio.
Today the President receives his intelligence briefing and later participates in a phone call with military families on COVID-19 response. Members of the Coronavirus Task Force hold a press briefing at 5:00pm ET.

## Over the Next 26 Days...
It's ALL About Digital Content
###
Dear Alex --
Between now and Election Day, all of the 2020 action that matters is happening online.
With hundreds of thousands of ballots being sent across the state as you read this email, there is no time to waste. That's why Connecticut Republicans are leaping into action with the most aggressive and targeted digital voter contact campaign EVER!
We have mobilized our digital and data team to target 8 key State Senate races, along with 29 key State House races which are all up for grabs on November 3rd.
Because of the support of investors like you, we are raising the resources to make:
300,000 Live Voter Calls
745,000 Voter Robocalls
600,000 Get Out The Vote Texts
1,250,000 Digital Ad Impressions
750,000 Absentee Ballot Reminders
That's the good news, Alex.
The BAD NEWS is that if our most dedicated supporters like you refuse to answer this call, Republicans are destined to fall short of every one of our benchmarks.
With so many races expected to come down to razor-close margins this year, I hope I don't have to explain how important it is that we meet or exceed our fundraising and digital targets, starting by midnight tonight!
So please, choose your preferred investment opportunity by clicking one of the buttons above or through this link to make sure Connecticut Republicans have the resources it will take to fight and win the most high tech election in history.

##
Republicans Are Running Out of Minutes to Win!
### Dear Alex --
Last week I told you how crucial our digital investments have been in the 2020 election. NOWHERE have these investments been more important than our voter contact mobile app!
In October ALONE -- our volunteers used 125,000 voter contact minutes on behalf of our local candidates, targeting districts where marginally higher Republican turnout can flip a very close election in our favor. That's half of what we purchased for the whole year!
Now our volunteer army needs YOUR help before they can reach this many more voters:
FUND 5OO VOTER CONTACTS
FUND 1,OOO VOTER CONTACTS
FUND 2,OOO VOTER CONTACTS
I never thought it was possible that we could use One Quarter Million pre-paid voter contact minutes before Election Day. But people are so hungry to Take Back Connecticut, we have expanded our map and are now competing in every corner of the state!
Our digital voter contact campaign is fueled by grassroots enthusiasm, Alex. . . but it isn't free.
Your Connecticut Republican Party has provided this resource to every GOP campaign, and we pay for it with individual investors like you who want to see Republicans compete and win.
We need an additional 100 supporters to chip in $50 right away, before our talk time expires on Sunday.
If we fail to reach this goal and the phone lines go silent, I'm afraid the Democrats will maintain their one party power grip in Hartford and keep Connecticut blue this year.
Will YOU fuel our final digital campaign this year?
Sincerely,
J.R. Romano, Chairman
Connecticut Republican Party
P.S. -- I just received a report that 28,740 Republicans have yet to return their absentee ballots! With just 5 days to go before the votes are counted, we have no time to waste reminding these voters how important their voices are in this election. Don't you agree?

## Connecticut Republicans Launch
Citizen Voter Fraud Task Force
Southington, CT – This afternoon, Connecticut Republican Party Chairman J.R. Romano issued the following statement announcing the organization of a new Citizen Voter Fraud Task Force:
""Decades of irresponsible Democrat leadership has created a voting system full of irregularities and bad data that ends today.
""Our voter rolls are a mess, with dead and moved voters remaining eligible to vote for years. Now Secretary of the State Denise Merrill has made an already bad system even worse by unilaterally sending tens of thousands of absentee ballot applications to voters across the state.
""Our state party headquarters has been inundated by confused voters wondering whether the absentee ballot application they received was legitimate, whether the polls remain open on Election Day, and whether they should vote in person or mail the request, or both. Denise Merrill has created chaos and confusion exactly when our citizens need it least.
""This reckless experiment will have serious consequences in November, when many elections are are expected to be razor close. Secretary Merrill is already casting doubt over the integrity of the results by overwhelming vote counters with questionable absentee applications and ballots,
""Republicans are taking democracy directly to the people of Connecticut.
""With today's formation of the Citizen Voter Fraud Task Force, we are empowering individuals to stop their votes being cancelled out by illegitimate ballots. Working in tandem with our local Republican Town Committees, we are dedicated to ensuring the integrity of Connecticut elections.
We are urging citizens to report any and all irregularities through our free Ballot Integrity Alert System online or by texting FRAUD to 555888, our new text hotline.
Now Connecticut voters can fight voter fraud in real time, absolutely free and without the hassle of government red tape.
""Denise Merrill clearly doesn't take her job seriously, but Connecticut Republicans do. Today we are empowering the people of our state to ensure that our elections are fraud free.""

# Mr. Weld and Mr. De La Fuente:
PLEASE WITHDRAW!
SOUTHINGTON– Chairman J.R. Romano has issued the following statement & call to action for Presidential candidates Bill Weld and Rocky De La Fuente in regards to Connecticut's Presidential Preference Primary to be held April 28:
""President Trump has called on all Americans to unite and come together. In that spirit of putting our community first, I am asking the remaining candidates challenging President Trump for the Republican nomination to submit in writing to the Connecticut Secretary of the State a letter stating withdrawal from the Connecticut Presidential Preference Primary.
""Both candidates are mathematically out of the running for the nomination and forcing Connecticut residents to the polls is an unnecessary risk. By eliminating the need for a primary it would also save money for local municipalities who are dealing with added cost to sterilize public spaces.
""To Bill Weld and Rocky de la Fuente: taking a stand for your fellow Americans means withdrawing immediately.""

September 11th is a solemn day of remembrance for Americans from all walks of life.
On this day, as we mourn the loss of our loved ones, we also honor the veterans, active duty and first responders who put their lives on the line every day in the call of duty to our nation and her people.
This year, we hope you will give back in service or with a charitable contribution to a patriotic foundation like the Tunnel To Towers Foundation to honor our heroes.
In addition to providing homes to the families of fallen heroes, Tunnel To Towers goes above and beyond in remembrance of the 2,977 lost on September 11, 2001 with ceremonies in New York City, Shanksville, PA, and the Pentagon in Washington. The Foundation is committed to ensuring people NEVER FORGET and is doing all it can to ensure America honors the 9/11 fallen.
Please join Connecticut Republicans in honor of the great men and women who have served so bravely, on 9/11 and everyday.
God Bless America!

Good afternoon,
The Trump Administration is working around the clock to deliver CARES Act funding with unprecedented speed and accuracy to local governments, small businesses, and working Americans impacted by the coronavirus epidemic. Yesterday, the Department of the Treasury launched a web portal to facilitate the disbursement of CARES Act funding to State, Local, and Tribal governments.
Additionally, the Treasury Department released an updated Paycheck Protection Program FAQ Sheet. President Trump continues to call on Congress to replenish the Paycheck Protection Program that is supporting hundreds of thousands of small businesses and millions of Americans.
Finally, this week alone over 80 million eligible Americans are set to receive direct payments– providing immediate economic relief for families during the coronavirus outbreak.
Today, the President participates in a meeting with recovered COVID-19 patients and later leads a meeting with Healthcare Executives. Members of the Coronavirus Task Force hold a press briefing at 5:00pm ET.

President Trump is Providing Regulatory Relief to Jumpstart the Economy and Get Americans Back to Work
________________________________
Today, President Trump signed an executive order that will help slash red tape in order to revitalize the economy and get Americans back to work.
· The President is directing agencies to use all emergency authorities to swiftly identify regulations that can be rescinded or temporarily waived to promote job creation and economic growth.
o Agencies have used these emergency authorities to fight coronavirus, and now we will use them to revitalize our economy and lift up our country again.
o The Trump Administration will utilize the same determination to jumpstart the economy that it has used to combat the coronavirus.
· The President’s order asks agencies to speed up the rulemaking process by moving proposed rulemakings to interim final rules with immediate effect – saving years in some cases.
· President Trump has long made deregulation a major pillar of his pro-growth policies, freeing up small businesses and entrepreneurs to create jobs and drive economic growth.
The President is providing regulatory relief for American businesses as they work to recover from the impact of the coronavirus.
· The President is directing agencies not to over-enforce when a business is working in good faith to follow the law.
o This discretion will especially benefit small businesses, who are fighting to recover from the impact of this pandemic.
· The President’s order establishes a “Regulatory Bill of Rights,” a set of 10 basic principles of fairness to govern the administrative enforcement and adjudication process.
o These principles will help give businesses the confidence they need to invest and grow as we recover as a nation.
Deregulation has played a key role in the Administration’s coronavirus response, and we will look through the hundreds of actions taken already to see which ones can be made permanent.
· President Trump and his Administration have taken over 600 regulatory actions to combat the coronavirus, including many suspensions, waivers, enforcement discretion, and more.
· The Administration will look at ways to make many of these actions permanent.
President Trump is Demanding Accountability and Reform at the WHO
________________________________
The President has released a letter to the WHO laying out the findings of the investigation into the organization’s failures in responding to the coronavirus.
Throughout the course of the investigation, the Trump Administration found repeated missteps by the WHO in responding to the coronavirus pandemic.
* As a result of the investigation, President Trump will permanently cease all U.S. funding to the WHO and reconsider our membership in the organization if it does not commit to major substantive reforms within the next 30 days.
* President Trump will not allow American taxpayer dollars to finance an organization that is clearly not serving America’s interests in its present state.
The WHO jeopardized the lives of millions around the world during by spreading bad information.
* The WHO ignored credible reporting about the virus spreading in Wuhan, including evidence that indicated human-to-human transmission.
* The WHO has repeatedly made grossly inaccurate or misleading claims about coronavirus, including spreading Chinese disinformation.
* This includes spreading Chinese disinformation denying human-to-human transmission and downplaying asymptomatic spread.
* Even after the outbreak became too large to ignore, the WHO failed to press China to quickly admit medical experts to begin studying the origins of the virus, resulting in weeks of delays.
* By the time the WHO acknowledged this was a pandemic, the virus had already killed more than 4,000 people and infected more than 100,000 people in at least 114 countries.
The WHO has extensively praised China, while inexplicably criticizing the actions of other countries appropriately trying to respond to the virus and save lives.
* The WHO’s alarming bias toward China has become even more abundantly clear over these past months.
* The WHO offered praise for China’s strict domestic travel restrictions, but inexplicably argued against President Trump’s travel restrictions on China – an action that saved countless lives.
* Throughout this crisis, the WHO has continuously praised China for its alleged “transparency,” despite abundant evidence suggesting they were misleading the world.
* The WHO was aware of Chinese authorities carrying out a campaign of forced quarantines, evictions, and mistreatment of Africans in China but said nothing.
* To this day, the WHO has not publicly called on China to allow for an independent investigation into the origins of the virus, despite an endorsement of such an investigation from its own Emergency Committee.

"A note from the desk of Chairman J.R. Romano
View this email in your browser
### Dear Alex,
As tonight begins, Jewish families gather to celebrate Passover and to relive the Exodus from Egypt. Tonight, for all faith traditions in America, the story of Passover has a new relevance as we recall the Jews sheltering in their homes as the Angel of Death passed over these homes to visit the plague on the first born of Egypt. Tonight, all of us are sheltering in our homes, to wait for a modern plague in our midst to pass.
We wish a Chag Pesach Someach, a Joyous Passover, to all our Jewish friends and family, and we all pray for a return to life without threat. May all the ill have a Refuah Shleimah, a full and speedy healing, and may we all be blessed to gather and rejoice without measure and fear, and to do so soon.
Sincerely,
J.R. Romano
State Party Chairman

"Do YOU Support the Police? I DO!
View this email in your browser
Dear Alex,
My name is Kat Goulart, and I'm running to be the next State Representative in the 39th House District, representing New London.
I've worked for years at the local level to restore accountability to government and I will bring that to Hartford.
My years of work in the area of police and community relations are in stark contrast to my two opponents:
One, a police officer who voted FOR the ""police accountability"" bill...
The other, a paid employee of an anti-police activist group!
I believe supporting public safety is key to keeping our communities safe, and it is among my priorities to oppose legislation that makes it harder to recruit and keep good officers. In fact, the Connecticut State Police Union recognized this and endorsed me over my opponents!
>> SUPPORT MY CAMPAIGN <<
By electing Republicans in our cities, we can help reverse the damage done by years of liberal spending. I support policies that will make Connecticut more affordable, such as smart fiscal planning and saying ""NO"" to new taxes and tolls.
Democrat overreach has only been further exacerbated by Covid-19 and Lamont's continued executive orders. Being a State Representative means more than just collecting a paycheck \-- we need someone who will stand up and fight for our freedoms, and I'm ready for the job!
My campaign needs help from good people like you, who also believe Connecticut can be a better place to live and raise a family.
Your contribution will allow the campaign to send a mailer comparing my record of fighting for safer communities and supporting law enforcement to that of my opponents. I appreciate your support!
Together, we can take back Connecticut!
Thanks for your support,
Kat

Alex --
In just 10 hours, we will close the history books on 2019 forever!
But before we do, we want to thank supporters like you for all that we accomplished this year. We flipped two long held Democrat seats in special elections, stopped tolls, fought back against even higher taxes, and much more.
Looking forward to 2020, we have even more excitement ahead! That's why we need dedicated Republicans to roll up your sleeves one last time before the ball drops over Times Square, and chip in with one last investment in Republican Victory.
Will you help us welcome the new year with a contribution of $20 or more before midnight?
Thanks for being one of the very first investors in 2020 Victory. We can't do it without you.
Happy New Year!
Connecticut Republicans

Bill Weld suspended his campaign.
Rocky REFUSED.
WE NEED YOU TO TAKE 3 MINUTES OUT OF YOUR DAY TODAY AND
CALL ROCKY (858) 569-9000
Tell him he needs to drop out for the safety of al CT residents.

Alex --
Aren't you sick and tired of Democrats finding ways to cheat?
After forcing President Trump into a fake Republican Primary this year, Secretary of the State Denise Merrill is up to shenanigans again. This time Joe Biden's top Connecticut election rigger is using taxpayer funds to create a tsunami of questionable absentee ballots this November.
But Alex, Connecticut Republicans are fighting back!
The Ballot Integrity Fund
Will Help Connecticut Republicans:
* REGISTER 4,877 New Voters
* ENSURE Registrars Clean Up Voter Rolls
* ESTABLISH Absentee Ballot Protection Program
* PROTECT OUR FAIR ELECTIONS!
FIGHT VOTER FRAUD
Democrats know that Joe Biden doesn't have the policies or the stamina to go toe to toe with President Trump in a fair fight.
That's why they are pulling out all the stops, doubling down on the lessons they learned rigging the system for Crooked Hillary four years ago and adding new surprises. Make no mistake: Flooding states with untraceable absentee ballots is a key part of Democrats' 2020 strategy!
I've run the numbers with my legal team, and we need to raise $75,000 in the next month to beef up our elections integrity operations.  In your zip code alone, that means we need 29 new donors at $50 a piece or 58 new donors at $25!
Can I count on you to be one of those core contributors by pledging your support of $50 or at least $25 right away?
I cringe when I think about Joe Biden becoming our 46th president . . . But it could happen if we allow the Democrats to pull off their new election scam.
Please help us fight back, starting today.

Good morning,
Below is update on President Trump’s historic actions to ramp up production of ventilators and distribute them where they are needed most.
MESSAGE OF THE DAY | President Trump Took Action to Rapidly Distribute Ventilators and Save Lives
____________________________________
SAVING AMERICAN LIVES
* Thanks to President Trump’s unprecedented action, no American who has needed a ventilator has gone without one so far.
* Ventilator production continues to ramp up nationwide to ensure we have the supplies needed to face this crisis and are more than prepared for the future.
DISTRIBUTING VENTILATORS TO HARD HIT AREAS
* Early on, President Trump directed his administration to move heaven and earth to make sure ventilators got to where they were needed most.
* Recently, the Administration worked with the private sector on a system to allow hospitals to lend ventilators directly to other hospitals that need them.
* Now, hard hit states like New York, California, and Washington have actually been able to send excess ventilators to other states that need them.
* New York announced yesterday it would be sending 100 ventilators to Michigan and 50 ventilators to Maryland.
RAMPING UP PRODUCTION
* As President Trump stated this week: “Last year, America manufactured, from a dead start, 30,000 ventilators. And this year, the number will be over 150,000 ventilators.”
* President Trump effectively used the Defense Production Act, spurring a massive mobilization by the private sector to produce ventilators.
* Thanks to the President’s efforts, GM announced the first ventilators have been completed at its plant in Indiana – shipping 600 ventilators this month with thousands more to come.

Alex --
My finance team just gave me a disturbing piece of info.  I just got an updated list of Charter Members and I didn't see your name on the list. Did yours expire?
I'm going to be updating President Trump's campaign tomorrow morning, and I know he will be disappointed if we don't show strong numbers out of Connecticut.  As I write you this note, we are at least 39 short of where we need to be by tomorrow.
Let me tell you why this is so important Alex.
Charter Memberships are the tip of the spear, President Trump's most ardent and enthusiastic supporters from the Constitution State. With his birthday coming in just a couple of days, I know he'd be honored if you would chip in $45 to show our 45th president that you have his back in the upcoming critical election.
President Trump will read about his most dedicated supporters from Connecticut on his birthday, June 14th. Will your name be on the list?

Alex, did you see this email (below) about activating your Digital Membership?
The Trump campaign has asked us to raise $23,000 this month to beef up our digital operations, post new ads supporting the president, and identify voters that support the MAGA Agenda.
Look, I'm not going to sugar coat this. We aren't even CLOSE to making our benchmark.
Can I count on you to renew your 2020 Digital Membership before midnight so that when I speak with the campaign tomorrow a.m., I can tell the team that supporters like you are stepping up to get our digital operations back on track?
Here's the link to chip in:  [[URL REDACTED]] The average digital gift has been $35, but if you can do more it will make a big deal to the president and help us close the gap before we run the numbers again.
Thanks so much for your steadfast support!

Dear Alex,
David X. Sullivan won the Republican Nomination to run for Congress in Connecticut's 5th District last week. The vote was overwhelming. Unanimous, in fact!
David is a former career Federal prosecutor with a sterling reputation. He served Connecticut for 30 years, protecting us from drug dealers and fraudsters alike.
Now he has set his sights on removing Democrat socialist Jahana Hayes from office.
Will you join David today by chipping in $10, $25, $50, $100, or any amount you can by clicking here?
Here’s how David describes his mission:
“I am running against Jahana Hayes,
but it is really a war against Socialism.”
David will work hard to protect our future and build a strong America. Click here to learn more about his campaign against Jahana Hayes, Nancy Pelosi, AOC and The Squad.
You can help David win this critical battle by donating here.
Any amount will help – $10, $25, $50, $100 or more. I suggest $17.76 because David is fighting to preserve our hard-fought liberties. You’ll be hearing much more about David in the coming weeks. I guarantee you’ll want to support David. Please help him now – so he can help all of us in Washington, D.C.!

View this email in your browser
Good morning,
Yesterday, President Trump—joined by SBA Administrator Jovita Carranza, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, and other members of the Coronavirus Task Force—announced details of the $350 billion Paycheck Protection Program to assist small businesses in keeping their workforce employed during the COVID-19 epidemic. Specifically, the Paycheck Protection Program:
* Provides nearly $350 billion in loans to small businesses.
* Certain non-profits, self-employed individuals, and independent contractors are also eligible for these loans.
* Small businesses can qualify for a loan of up to $10 million, based on their payroll expenses.
* If an employer maintains their workforce, the SBA will forgive the portion of the loan used to cover the first 8 weeks of payroll and certain other expenses.
* The Administration is working with banks so small businesses will be able to go directly to their local lenders to access these loans.
* Offers enhanced Economic Injury Disaster Loans for businesses that are facing a loss of revenue as a result of the coronavirus.
* SBA’s Economic Injury Disaster Loans can provide up to $2 million in long-term, low-interest loans to help small businesses overcome a loss of revenue due to the coronavirus.
* Small businesses are eligible to apply for an advance of up to $10,000, providing rapid assistance to help them cover critical expenses.
* SBA has streamlined the application process for these loans to make it easier for small businesses.
* Allows small businesses to still receive financial relief through the SBA’s traditional loan programs.
* Small businesses can access SBA’s 7(a) loan program, which provides loans of up to $5 million to cover eligible expenses.
* SBA’s express loan program offers qualified loans up to $350,000.
* Through the SBA’s Community Advantage loan pilot program, mission-based lenders can assist small businesses in underserved markets with loans of up to $250,000.
* The SBA provides export loans to help small businesses achieve sales and respond to challenges such as the coronavirus that impact trade.
Yesterday, President Trump invoked the Defense Production Act to increase the number of N95 masks produced by 3M. The President separately issued a memorandum to expand production of ventilators by several other companies. The President also issued major disaster declarations for the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Virginia, U.S. Virgin Islands, and Tennessee.
Today, President Trump participates in a roundtable with energy sector CEOs. Members of the Coronavirus Task Force hold a press briefing at 5:00pm ET.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT: J.R. Romano ([[URL REDACTED]])
DATE: June 29th, 2020
## Condemning The Democrats
HARTFORD –
Over the past few years our society has been taking a step back and identifying sources of institutional racisms. Society has placed a high value on correctly labeling historical figures, events, and institutions in order to bring to light years of oppression towards people of color.
With such a history State Central Member Dennis Swanton introduced a resolution that will be voted on in the July 2020 State Central meeting condemning the history of the Democratic Party. Democrats have had a willful blindness to their own history. We demand the Party change its name.
“We believe it is vital that every citizen know the truth about the so-called party of inclusion and acceptance. If we are to hold Christopher Columbus accountable over 500 years after the fact, it is our duty and moral obligation to hold the Democratic Party accountable. As recently as 1977 Joe Biden sought the support of segrationalists. Biden Has publicly stated that 'you ain’t black' unless you support the Democratic Nominee. Statements like this bring back the ugly imaginary of political cartoons like 'Of Course He wants to vote Democrat Ticket'"", stated Chairman JR Romano.
The Resolution outlines the Connecticut Republican Party’s belief the Democratic Party should change its name. Now is the time to address the hundreds of years of racial oppression, violence, and multiple violations of human rights.
We deem it necessary that the Democratic Party change its name due to the Party’s long tragic legacy denying Americans basic human rights including but not limited to:
* Democrats blocked the first attempt to ratify the 13th Amendment in 1863
* Democrats unanimously voted against the 14th Amendment giving former slaves citizenship
* Democrats unanimously voted against the 15th Amendment giving former slaves the right to vote
* Democrats instituted Jim Crow laws across Democrat led states, preventing African Americans the right to vote.
* Democrats held the longest filibuster in U.S Senate history to block the civil rights act 1957
This list is just a small sample of Democratic Party history. “Democratic Parties around the country have been stripping buildings, monuments, and pictures from government halls, yet the atrocities rest with the Democratic Party as a whole. To kill the serpent you need to strike at the head” stated Chairman JR Romano.

Good afternoon Alex,
As you know, our citizens are best served when response is locally executed, State managed and Federally supported. The Federal government scales best practices, coordinates key priorities, provides regulatory flexibilities, guidance, and key resources to supplement, but not replace, private sector, local, and State resources.
Below, please see a chart provided by FEMA detailing the amount of supplies that have been delivered to Connecticut as a result of the Trump Administration’s Project Airbridge program:

DATE: October 31, 2020
## SOTS Voter Suppression
SOUTHINGTON– Chairman of the Connecticut Republican Party JR Romano demands Deputy Secretary of the State Scott Bates clairify his statements on provisional ballots.
""It is disgusting to me that the Deputy Secretary of the State is using his position to suppress voters. In discussions with Registrars and Moderators ahead of the Election Tuesday, Mr. Bates said that if a voter refuses to wear a mask, they can be issued a provisional ballot"" Romano said. ""What voters may not know is provisional ballots only cover federal races so they will not be allowed to vote in our state and local races, many of which can be decided by a handful of votes.""
Bates remarks can be found here: [[URL REDACTED]]
""We learned that Scott Bates is no stranger to doing political favors for his partisan allies when the Port Authority scandal came out. He paid partisan allies significantly more than fair market value for pictures. He is playing his games and threatening to suppress hundreds if not thousands of voters by giving unclear and untrue guidance days before an extremely important election"" Romano continued.
If a voter appears at the polls without a mask, there must be steps taken to ensure the voter has the ability to vote for ALL races on the ballot. Steps can include asking the voter to get a mask, providing the voter a mask, providing the voter an opportunity to vote outside or in a separated area - nowhere should a maskless voter be provided a provisional ballot.

Chris Murphy is at it again!
Now he's literally blaming President Donald Trump for the Coronavirus, telling Fake News CNN's Anderson Cooper:

* The Administration is delivering shipments of Remdesivir for hospital patients in need across the country.
MEDICAL SUPPLIES

* The President launched Project Airbridge to bring in supplies from all over the world and get them to the frontlines.
* President Trump effectively leveraged the Defense Production Act to secure massive amounts of needed supplies.

This Sunday evening, Jewish people around the world begin the holiest day of the year - Yom Kippur. Yom Kippur or the Day of Atonement, is a day of prayer, fasting, and repentance. Yom Kippur provides the opportunity to reflect upon our lives over the past year, to ask God to forgive us for any sins or transgressions we may have committed, to reconcile past differences directly with others and to commit ourselves to renew our lives for the coming year with purpose, good works and love for each other. Sunday night is also called “Kol Nidre” which means “All vows,” after a beautiful, melodic prayer chanted three times at the beginning of the service asking God to release us from vows made in the year just past, especially if unfulfilled.
As the Jewish Community gathers either in synagogues or this year, in their own homes, let us all, as Americans, consider what each of us might do to strengthen our own families, our own communities, and our nation to help make this world a better place. Let us pray together with one voice for the spiritual, physical and economic recovery of our country and our world.
On this holy Day of Atonement, may we be provided an opportunity to draw nearer to God through the practice of “teshuva,” which means repentance, in accordance with the words of Leviticus 16:30: “For on this day shall atonement be made for you, to cleanse you; from all your sins shall ye be clean before the Lord.”
On behalf of Connecticut Republicans, we send our best wishes for a meaningful Yom Kippur and a G’mar Chatima Tova. “May you be inscribed in the Book of Life.”
Sincerely,
JR Romano Leora R. Levy John Frey
Chairman National Committeewoman National Committeeman

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT: J.R. Romano ([[URL REDACTED]])
DATE: October 15, 2020
## Horrendous Response
Southington– Chairman of the Connecticut Republican Party J.R. Romano calls on Democrat First Selectwoman Catherine Iino and prominent Democrats in the area to take a stronger stand against continuous, harrassing and threatening behavior of her political ally.
""The immediate response from Tim Withington after he was put on blast for his threatening messages to all members of the Republican Party, not just me, was one of arrogance and of someone who was upset he was called out for his threats"" Romano stated. ""This is not an isolated incident with Mr. Withington, he has been sending harrassing messages for over a year; however, he has crossed a line.""
The messages began in December of 2019 and have occurred intermittendly since then. Some messages have been included below to showcase the harrassment is real and Tim Withington has a hatred for the Republican party and its members as a whole.
""First Selectwoman Iino's response is weak and protects a member of her party, a donor to her party. Mr. Withington didn't offer an apology, he offered excuses and said he was sorry that the Party was 'miffed' at him. This pattern of behavior and unhinged rhetoric is not the proper actions of someone who should be serving all residents in an Emergency Management position. I continue to call on Connecticut Democrats, Christine Cohen, Christine Goupil, and First Selectwoman Catherine Iino to condemn this behavior and demand a removal from office"" Romano concluded.
Catherine Iino's response can be found in the Hartford Courant article here: [[URL REDACTED]] These are not personal notes to Chairman Romano as the First Selectwoman implied, they are directed at the greater Republican Party and the millions of members of the party.
## Unnecessary Threats
Southington– Chairman of the Connecticut Republican Party J.R. Romano announced today the party received a threatening message from Mr. Timothy Withington who also serves as the Emergency Management Director for the Town of Killingworth.
""The media and democrats have been whipping their supporters up over a volunteer recruitment email the Connecticut Republican Party sent out last week. Democrats have created a false narrative to score political points that now has their party members making threats"" said Chairman Romano.
The conversation is included in the below screen shots:
""We hope the town would reconsider such a position for Mr. Withington who has failed to demonstrate the ability to protect all members of his community"" continued Chairman Romano. ""We are calling on the Connecticut Democratic Party, Senator Christine Cohen, Candidate for State Representative Christine Goupil, and First Selectwoman Catherine Iino to condemn these threats.""

"Support Republican David X. Sullivan's Campaign Today!
View this email in your browser
Dear Alex:
David X. Sullivan, one of my closest and dearest friends, is running for Congress in the 5th Congressional District of Connecticut.
I have known David for more than 30 years. He is a distinguished former career federal prosecutor. I can tell you he has a sterling reputation as someone who works hard and wins.
This is a race Republicans must win. Our entire Democrat delegation in Washington is far too partisan. We need representation in Washington from a common-sense Republican like David. He is committed to solving the problems we face, and will work across the aisle when needed to reach solutions that benefit Connecticut.
>> CHIP IN NOW <<
David’s opponent and the Washington Democrats won’t go easily. They are raising money and are well organized. But David’s message is compelling. He is focused on leading us out of this pandemic, restoring our lost jobs and re-igniting our economy.
David needs to get his message out via mail, radio, television – that all requires funds.
If we invest in David’s campaign now, before the end of the current reporting period at midnight tonight, David can show Republicans in Washington that has the local support needed to win.
We are a party who helps one another. Let’s do our part now to help David. Please click here to make a contribution to David X. Sullivan’s campaign today. Let’s send David to Washington!
Thank you!

COVID-19: Important Resources for State, Local, and Tribal Officials
· Guidelines for Opening Up America Again: On Thursday, April 16, President Trump and the White House Coronavirus Task Force unveiled new guidelines (download here) for the reopening of America. Developed by the top medical experts from across the Government and based on verifiable metrics regarding the situation on the ground, the guidelines outline a phased return to reopening and include specific steps for State, Local, and Tribal officials to follow in tailoring their response. The guidelines also set clear benchmarks on new cases, testing, and hospital resources for States to meet to proceed toward a phased reopening. In the days and weeks ahead, the Administration plans to continue robust coordination and outreach with State, Local, and Tribal leaders as we collectively work to reopen the country.
· Coronavirus Guidelines for America: On Tuesday, March 31, the White House announced updated Coronavirus Guidelines for America (Español), extending social distancing efforts through April 30. On April 3, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued guidance recommending individuals wear cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g. grocery stores and pharmacies, particularly in areas of significant community-based transmission. On April 8, CDC also provided guidelines regarding when people in critical infrastructure roles can return to work after being exposed to a confirmed or suspected case of COVID-19. Additional information on critical infrastructure below.
· Up-To-Date Information: The most up-to-date, verified information and guidance can be found via the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Coronavirus Disease 2019 website – [[URL REDACTED]] The Coronavirus Task Force holds frequent briefings, which can be viewed live here.
· COVID-19 Response and Recovery Primer: Response and recovery efforts are locally executed, state managed, and federally supported. It is important that requests for assistance, including for critical supplies, get routed through the proper channels as soon as possible. Learn more about the response and recovery process via this important resource – Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic: Response and Recovery Through Federal-State-Local-Tribal Partnership. FEMA’s public assistance guidance for COVID-19 response efforts can be found here. Guidance for Tribal Governments can be found here.
· Critical Infrastructure Workforce Guidelines: On March 16th, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued updated critical infrastructure guidance in response to the COVID-19 emergency. DHS continues to work with stakeholders in the critical infrastructure community to update the advisory list if necessary as the Nation’s response to COVID-19 evolves. The guidance, and accompanying list, is intended to help State, local, tribal and territorial officials as they work to protect their communities, while ensuring continuity of functions critical to public health and safety, as well as economic and national security. The list is advisory in nature and is not a federal directive or standard.
· Rural Resource Guide: USDA and Federal partners have programs that can be used to provide immediate and long term assistance to rural communities affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. These programs can support recovery efforts for rural residents, businesses, and communities. USDA developed a resource guide for State, Local, and Tribal leaders, and other stakeholders.
· Coronavirus Fact vs. Myth: Rumors can easily circulate within communities during a crisis. FEMA setup a website to help the public distinguish between rumors and facts regarding the response to the coronavirus pandemic.
· Fraud & Scam Protection: The Department of Justice is remaining vigilant in detecting, investigating, and prosecuting wrongdoing related to the crisis. Find out how you can protect yourself and helpful resources on DOJ’s Coronavirus Fraud Prevention website. The Federal Trade Commission has also established a website with helpful information to help consumers avoid coronavirus-related scams.
· Social Media Resources: Download the Apple COVID-19 Screening Tool. Follow the White House on Twitter and Facebook. Also follow HHS (Twitter/Facebook) and CDC (Twitter/Facebook) You can also find informational videos from Coronavirus Task Force members on mitigation, social distancing, etc. on the White House’s YouTube page.
· Mental Health Resources: Natural disasters – including such pandemics as the coronavirus outbreak – can be overwhelming and also can seriously affect emotional health. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration’s (SAMHSA) Disaster Distress Helpline – 1-800-985-5990 (or text TalkWithUs to 66746) – provides 24/7, 365-day-a-year crisis counseling and support to anyone who is seeking help in coping with the mental or emotional effects caused by developments related to the coronavirus pandemic. Learn more about the Disaster Distress Helpline here.
· Addiction & Substance Abuse Resources: The COVID-19 pandemic has created countless challenges for those delivering care to our most vulnerable populations. People with Substance Use Disorder (SUD) and Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) are especially at high risk suffering complications from COVID-19. The White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), which leads and coordinates the development, implementation, and assessment of U.S. drug policy, released a fact sheet that contains information on Federal actions to expand telemedicine and e-prescribing, to increase flexibility for treatment with methadone and buprenorphine, to improve access to prescribed controlled substances, and to expand assistance to rural areas.
· Administration Actions and Federal Agency Resources: [[URL REDACTED]] is cataloging all U.S. government activities related to coronavirus. From actions on health and safety to travel, immigration, and transportation to education, find pertinent actions here. Each Federal Agency has also established a dedicated coronavirus website, where you can find important information and guidance.

## Who? What? Where? When?
Southington – Chairman J.R. Romano today asked the White House to investigate the circumstances that led to the meeting Senator Chris Murphy had with the Foreign Minister of Iran.
""I have asked President Trump and the White House to look into how Chris Murphy arranged his meeting with Iran. Where are the texts or emails that set up the meeting, will these correspondences be released and who started the communications, and who overheard the discussion, what was said, were there aides present?"" Romano said.
""We have a need to see further details on this meeting - which will shine a light on Chris Murphy's potential violation of the Logan Act. Chris Murphy is always very quick to point out injustices he sees and while he currently doesn't have a home in Connecticut, he certainly resides in a big glass house.""

## Connecticut Republicans ""Hero"" Ad Shines a Light on Democrat Anti-Cop Legislation
Southington, CT – This afternoon, Connecticut Republican Party Chairman J.R. Romano issued the following statement regarding the CTGOP's new ""Hero"" ad, blasting Democrats for their dangerous anti-cop legislation:
""This is the video that everyone needs to see before they cast their ballot. Connecticut Democrats are literally making our communities less safe, creating needless victims. Bad legislation hurts good cops. It also hurts victims, when seconds matter and nobody is there to answer the call.
""Less than 24 hours ago, Connecticut Republicans sent a preview of our new ""Hero"" ad, asking digital followers to help us show voters the violent truth about anti-cop Democrat legislation before it's too late.
""Enthusiasm for this message has been off the charts,"" said Romano. ""In less than 24 hours, we are already halfway to our goal of running this ad statewide. But if we are going to reach voters in communities across Connecticut effectively, we still need more grassroots investors to step up this week. If we fail, the silence will be deafening to victims of domestic abuse, assault, rape, and any imaginable situation where a person needs a law enforcement officer to arrive swiftly and act without hesitation.""
""Democrats are hiding their radical agenda behind the term ""Police Accountability"". Today we ask, Who will hold the Democrats accountable when our local beats find it impossible to recruit and retain good cops? If not the voters, then whom? If not now, then when? We must act before it is too late by voting the supporters of this radical anti-cop legislation out of office in this election.""

What You Need To Know | The United States Has Built The World’s Leading Coronavirus Testing System
________________________________
“We built the most advanced and robust testing anywhere in the world, and we’ve done more testing than any country anywhere in the world.” – President Trump
President Donald J. Trump is working tirelessly to ensure that every State, territory, and tribe has the resources they need to meet their testing goals.
· The Administration is sending $11 billion to help States, territories, and tribes meet the testing goals set out by their Governors and tribal leaders.
· The Federal Government will be sending approximately 12 million swabs to States over the course of May to supplement private sector resources.
· President Trump is also working to ensure manufacturers are producing enough testing supplies – such as reagents and extraction kits – to support our robust testing system.
· The Administration has partnered with leading retail companies as well as local independent pharmacies to increase access to testing for Americans in more communities.
o By the end of this week, more than 300 retail testing sites will be operational to serve Americans in 47 states and D.C., prioritizing access in underserved communities.
As a result of President Trump’s leadership, the United States has become the world’s leader in coronavirus testing.
· President Trump revolutionized our testing system and, in partnership with Governors, scaled up testing across the country to unprecedented levels.
· More than 9 million tests have now been completed in the United States – by far the most in the world – and this number will soon surpass 10 million.
o Last week, as many as 314,000 Americans were tested a day.
· The United States is testing more than every country on Earth, including South Korea, Japan, the United Kingdom, and Italy.
· In May, every single State will be able to test more people per capita than South Korea has tested per capita in four months since the outbreak began.
President Trump has led an unprecedented effort to quickly develop more innovative, high-quality, and reliable tests.
· The Trump Administration is leveraging the power of the private sector to accelerate research and development of innovative diagnostic tests.
· Already, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted 92 emergency use authorizations for coronavirus tests – more authorizations than for H1N1, Avian flu, MERS, Ebola, Enterovirus, and Zika combined.
· The FDA’s quick authorization of tests created by companies such as Roche, LabCorp, Abbott Labs and many others have greatly increased America’s testing speed and capacity.
o These efforts have allowed Americans to receive testing results in as little as five minutes, or collect a sample for a test within the comfort of their own homes.
· New antibody tests, antigen tests, point-of-care nucleic acid testing, and genomic sequencing technologies are under development, which will enhance our coronavirus monitoring efforts.

THE GREAT AMERICAN COMEBACK
· As President Trump laid out, Friday, June 5, 2020 marked a monumental day for our country as we begin to lead the greatest comeback in American history.
o PRESIDENT TRUMP: “Today is, probably, if you think of it, the greatest comeback in American history, but it’s not going to stop here.”
· May’s jobs report smashed expectations, showing millions of jobs gained and the unemployment rate dropping when all the experts predicted the worst.
o PRESIDENT TRUMP: “They thought the number would be a loss of 9 million jobs, and it was a gain of almost 3 million jobs.”

o PRESIDENT TRUMP: “Manufacturing, which we had up to 600,000 jobs prior to the plague, manufacturing rose to 225,000 jobs.”

REBUILDING AND RENEWING OUR ECONOMY
· President Trump brought our economy to historic highs before the coronavirus and he is the only one that can do it again.
o PRESIDENT TRUMP: “We had the greatest economy in the history of our country. We had the greatest economy in the history of the world. And that strength let us get through this horrible pandemic.”
o PRESIDENT TRUMP: “We’re going to be back there. I think we’re going to actually be back higher next year than ever before. And the only thing that can stop us is bad policy.”
· President Trump has taken decisive action to help families hurt by the coronavirus and get Americans back to work.
o PRESIDENT TRUMP: “I want to finish by saying to save the economy, we passed several critical legislation, totaling many trillions of dollars. … We’re set up to do more, if we want. I think we should.”
o PRESIDENT TRUMP: “We made Americans sure of themselves, and we took care of families, we gave benefits, and we sent $1,200 to every individual making less than $75,000 and 4,000 -- almost -- dollars to every family of four earning less than $150,000.”
· To build on these efforts, President Trump signed legislation on Friday, June 5, 2020 making important changes to the Paycheck Protection Program – which has helped save tens of millions of jobs already.
o PRESIDENT TRUMP: “Now, I’m going to sign legislation to make important changes to the PPP that will especially help restaurants, hotels, and other businesses that have been very hard hit by the virus. This is going to make it 24 months.”
Council on Economic Advisers – Trouncing Expectations by 10 Million Jobs, the Labor Market’s Comeback Has Begun
________________________________
The Bureau of Labor Statistics’ May Employment Situation report shows that the United States economy added 2.5 million jobs last month, and the unemployment rate fell from 14.7 percent to 13.3 percent.
Employment increased significantly in leisure and hospitality (1.2 million), construction (464,000), education and health services (424,000), retail trade (368,000), and manufacturing (225,000). These job gains surprised forecasters, given many States were only beginning to reopen their economies during the reports’ survey reference periods (the week/pay period that includes May 12). The median of all private sector forecasts predicted 7.5 million job losses in May and an unemployment rate of 19.2 percent.
Rapid job growth as the coronavirus is contained and States open up should not come as a surprise. A poll conducted from April 27 through May 4 asked laid-off workers if they expected to be rehired by their most recent employers after State stay-at-home orders are lifted. The vast majority of laid-off workers (77 percent) said it was likely that they would be rehired by their most recent employers. This survey result is echoed in May’s employment data, just as CEA explained it was in April’s data.
There were 15.3 million people on temporary layoff in May, in addition to an estimated 4.9 million people who had temporarily lost their jobs but were counted as employed but “not at work for other reasons.” Including all those who were potentially on temporary layoff, 78.2 percent of unemployed persons in May were on temporary layoff—well above the 13.3 percent average over the 12 months before this March.
Beyond workers remaining attached to their employers, another sign that job growth will continue is May’s jump in average weekly hours—indicating pent-up demand. Increasing hours can be a sign that employers need to hire more workers to meet this demand. For all private sector employees, average weekly hours increased by 0.5 to 34.7 hours—the highest level since the series began in 2006. For production and non-supervisory employees, this measure increased by 0.6 to 34.1 hours—the highest level in 19 years.
Further job losses were expected in the May report because initial Unemployment Insurance (UI) claims, though falling, remain elevated. Yesterday, the Department of Labor reported that 1.9 million people filed initial UI claims in the week ending May 30. Even with 4.6 million initial claims over the two weeks ending May 23, the number of people receiving UI, as measured by continuing claims, declined by 3.4 million over that time. As the figure below shows, weekly continuing claims have tracked the number of unemployed persons reported in the monthly Employment Situation report, assuming a constant rate of change between the months.
By May 23, the gap between weekly continuing claims and cumulative initial UI claims since the beginning of COVID-related job losses had grown to 19.6 million. Some of this difference may be accounted for by individuals applying for traditional UI instead of the new Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program, either by mistake or because of State requirements. However, the widening gap between initial UI claims and continuing claims, along with the 2.5 million jobs added in May, show that laid off Americans are returning to work.
For workers to count as unemployed, they must have searched for work during the last four weeks or be on temporary layoff. If neither of these apply, the worker is counted as out of the labor force. States waived the traditional work search requirement for UI, so some workers on UI who do not expect to be called back to work may not count as unemployed. Yet the labor market flows for May show that there was not an elevated level of workers dropping out of the labor force directly. Flows from employment to not in the labor force were 4.4 million from April to May, in line with the average over the 12 months before this March (4.7 million). Furthermore, from April to May, 2.8 million more people moved from unemployment to employment than moved from employment to unemployment.
Other, more rapid indicators of labor market strength show the economic recovery has accelerated since mid-May. Gasoline demand has recovered over half of the loss from its pandemic-low, indicating Americans are driving more. Workplace visits are up more than 40 percent from its pandemic-low. And, as the figure below shows, 73 percent of small businesses are now open—up from its pandemic-low of 52 percent right before the April report’s reference periods.
While May’s jobs report is unquestionably positive news for America’s economic comeback, there is still much more room to grow. Three months ago in February, the unemployment rate was 9.8 percentage points lower (3.5 percent) and there were 19.6 million more jobs. But the economy beating expectations by 10 million jobs and the unemployment rate falling instead of rising show that the transition back to strong economic growth began earlier than many expected. With more States easing restrictions on work, strong attachments between laid off workers and their employers, and growing labor demand, there is much reason to expect the American economy to add even more jobs in June.
What You Need To Know – President Trump’s Paycheck Protection Program is Delivering for Small Businesses and Workers
________________________________
Friday, June 6, 2020, President Trump signed legislation enacting important changes to the Paycheck Protection Program that will provide more flexibility and relief for small businesses.
· The Paycheck Protection Program Flexibility Act signed into law by the President includes key changes to help small businesses, such as extending the time they have to use the funds to 24 weeks.
o PRESIDENT TRUMP: “I'm going to sign legislation to make important changes to the PPP that will especially help restaurants, hotels, and other businesses that have been very hard hit by the virus.”
o SECRETARY MNUCHIN: “I want to especially thank the Senate and the House for working with us in another example of overwhelming bipartisan support that is helping American business and American workers.
o SECRETARY MNUCHIN: “[President Trump] invited in leaders from the restaurant industry and the hotel industry. These are two areas that had been especially hard hit. The restaurants’ number-one ask was extending the PPP for 24 weeks, and this legislation delivers on this.”
Friday, June 6, 2020, jobs report showed, PPP is delivering real results in helping small businesses stay on their feet and keep workers on payrolls.
· THE WASHINGTON POST: “It was, as economist Chris Rupkey emailed, the ‘biggest forecast miss of our life.’ What the heck happened? In short, give some credit to the government relief efforts, especially the Paycheck Protection Program, for bringing back jobs.”
· THE NEW YORK TIMES: “More than half of the month’s job gains — 1.4 million — were in restaurants and bars, many of which received assistance under the government’s Paycheck Protection Program. Friday’s report suggests that program, along with other elements of the government’s response, helped offset at least some of the economic damage caused by the shutdown, which should allow for a faster rebound.”
· CNBC: “’The good news is this looks like this was rehiring people coming off the temporary unemployment,’ said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton. “It’s also the PPP [Payroll Protection Program]. Those PPP jobs are also coming through in leisure and hospitality.”
· BLOOMBERG: “Economists’ models probably failed to fully take into account the government’s relief response, specifically the Paycheck Protection Program that provides firms funding to keep workers on staff.”
· FIVE THIRTY EIGHT: “Almost 50 percent of the job gains for the entire economy were in the leisure and hospitality sector, which had cratered in March and April. This suggests that government efforts may have protected jobs — particularly through the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), which allowed small businesses to receive forgivable loans if they spent the money on direct expenses like payroll — and that the first few weeks of states’ reopening allowed some workers to return to their jobs.”
· MARKETWATCH: “[Senior Research Analyst at Beacon Policy Advisor Ben Koltun] also noted that Friday’s jobs report can be attributed to the government intervention so far, such as the Paycheck Protection Program and the government transfers to buoy personal income.”

David Defeated Goliath . . .
David X. Sullivan Will, Too!
Alex --
Connecticut Democrats and their allies in the media are trying to paint a David vs. Goliath theme in our 5th District race for Congress.
But they are forgetting one key fact: David defeated Goliath!
HELP DAVID WIN!
And history is repeating itself this cycle! Here are the key facts why David X. Sullivan can win this 5th District race:
1) The only poll in the 5th District race shows David X. Sullivan leading his extreme Far Left opponent -- by an incredible 55/42 spread!
2) David's first video message was incredibly effective! (See the video here.) And it struck a raw nerve -- so much so that the CT media are now scrambling to defend his opponent's indefensible comment on rioting.
3) Every single dollar raised through this link will be applied immediately to David's digital media effort. At a cost of less than $.10 per view, your donation will help get this video in front of hundreds of undecided voters for just pennies per message.
4) Just this week, two knowledgeable, independent political observers said the 5th District is competitive and winnable for Republican David X. Sullivan!
>> WATCH DAVID'S MESSAGE <<
Watch David's video here \-- and see for yourself why his opponent is running scared.
Please help David in his campaign to defeat his extreme Far Left opponent and win this war against socialism.
He has the right experience to protect our future! All he needs is a few dollars to spread his message across the district.
Please chip in NOW to help David X. Sullivan beat the left wing media Goliath!

Good afternoon,
This weekend, President Donald Trump made individual calls to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, President Andrzej Duda of Poland, President Moon Jae-in of South Korea, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador of Mexico, and King Hamad bin Isa Al-Khalifa of the Kingdom of Bahrain. President Trump reaffirmed his commitment to work with these nations and others to battle the COVID-19 epidemic.
On Friday, President Trump and Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue announced the creation of the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program (CFAP). This $19 billion immediate relief program will provide critical support to farmers and ranchers, maintain the integrity of our food supply chain, and ensure every American continues to receive and have access to the food they need.
Last night, the Treasury Department and Customs and Border Protection issued a joint Temporary Interim Final Rule providing importers, who have faced a significant financial hardship due to the outbreak, with the option for a 90-day deferment period on the payment of duties, taxes, and fees.
Today, members of the Coronavirus Task Force hold a press briefing at 5:00pm ET.

HIGHLIGHTS | President Trump and the Coronavirus Task Force Update Americans on Response Efforts
________________________________
TESTING
PRESIDENT TRUMP: “America continues to make steady progress in our war against the virus. As of today, we have tested 4.18 million Americans, that’s a record anywhere in the world.”
PRESIDENT TRUMP: “The United States has now conducted more total tests than all of the following nations combined: France, the United Kingdom, South Korea, Japan, Singapore, India, Austria, Australia, Sweden, and Canada. And our testing is expanding very rapidly by millions and millions of people.”
PRESIDENT TRUMP: “[Tomorrow], the President and Vice President will lead a call with our nation’s governors from FEMA headquarters with the nation’s governors to review what more they can do and do together to develop locally tailored testing strategies, working very hard with governors now on testing.”
PRESIDENT TRUMP: “Many governors are still relying on their state laboratories rather than the full and much larger capacity that is available to them – as an example, commercial laboratories like Quest and LabCorp.”
PRESIDENT TRUMP: “You must remember, that the governors wanted to have total control over the opening of their states, but now they want to have us, the federal government, do the testing. And again, testing is, is local. You can’t have it both ways. Testing is a local thing.”
VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: “A month ago, we had done 80,000 coronavirus tests in America. This weekend we cleared more than 4 million and we’re currently testing more than one million Americans a week. We fully expect to actually have tested more than 5 million before the end of this month.”
SUPPLIES OF MEDICAL EQUIPMENT
PRESIDENT TRUMP: “We’re close to finalizing the second partnership through which a U.S. manufacturer would convert its existing plant to produce over 10 million additional swabs per month and we should be ready to announce this in a very short period of time.”
PRESIDENT TRUMP: “We also are going to be using and we’re preparing to use the Defense Production Act to increase swab production in one U.S. facility by over 20 million additional swabs per month.”
PRESIDENT TRUMP: “We’re working with the world-class team at Oak Ridge National laboratory to use its injection molding capacity to potentially produce over 10 million collection tubes per week.”
PRESIDENT TRUMP: “My Administration continues to execute our massive military operations to supply our hospitals with equipment they need, and beds if necessary but it looks like we’re totally covered on beds. We have plenty of beds.”
PRESIDENT TRUMP: “The federal government is currently procuring more than 100,000 ventilators through new production or purchases, with thousands already delivered.”
PRESIDENT TRUMP: “I want to thank the Dynamic Ventilator Reserve because what they’ve done is incredible, that’s a capital D.V.R., by the way, an innovative public-private partnership … We’re gaining access to up to 65,000 additional ventilators in hospitals across the nation that can be redeployed very quickly to areas with the greatest need when they’re not in use, and we right now have almost 10,000 in our reserve.”
PRESIDENT TRUMP: “Through the Project Airbridge, we’ve completed 64 flights carrying over 600 million pieces of personal protective equipment, such as gloves, gowns, and other medical gear, with 50 more flights scheduled in the very near future.”
PRESIDENT TRUMP: “FEMA is working to commit another $384 million to produce another 64 million gowns … I want to thank America’s textile manufacturers for their partnership in this remarkable undertaking. Two U.S. companies, Hanes and Standard Textile, are on track to produce 5 million gowns by the end of the month.”
PRESIDENT TRUMP: “Honeywell is hiring more than 1,000 American workers to produce 20 million masks per month -- 20 million masks a month. Thanks to the Defense Production Act, we’ll be receiving another 40 million masks over the next few weeks. … This production is, in addition to the 55 million N95 masks my administration has already distributed. Plus we ordered – and it’s coming in soon – 500 million masks.”
PRESIDENT TRUMP: “We have secured nearly four times as many N95 masks in recent weeks as we would in the entire healthcare industry during a typical year.”
PRESIDENT TRUMP: “This pandemic has underscored the vital importance of reshoring our supply chains and bringing them back into the United States, where they belong – where they should have never left.”
VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: “5,528 military personnel have been deployed across 24 hospitals and facilities and 28,700 National Guard are on duty.”
VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: “At the present moment, we have more than 9,055 ventilators on hand. We actually added 91 ventilators to that supply because of the production that the President and our task force at FEMA has activated. In the next seven days, we’ll be adding 576 ventilators to the strategic national stockpile.”
RESUMING ELECTIVE SURGERIES
PRESIDENT TRUMP: “CMS is finalizing new guidelines for doctors and patients to resume elective surgeries.”
PRESIDENT TRUMP: “As long as the rate of infections remains low in a community, we want patients to be able to go to their doctors, get clinically tested, and have worked on, surgeries.”
PRESIDENT TRUMP: “If your doctor believes you need a treatment in person, you can get a treatment now. You can and should get a treatment now. We are asking that healthcare facilities have plans in place to keep patients safe during their visit.”
CMS ADMINISTRATOR VERMA: “We are issuing guidelines today about how we can reopen the healthcare system. So, these are recommendations around phase one. … Healthcare officials across the country, and healthcare systems, need to decide what services should be made available. And ultimately, doctors and patients need to make decisions about their healthcare services. We want to make sure that systems are reopening so they can stay open and doing that in a very measured way.”
PRECAUTIONS IN NURSING HOMES
CMS ADMINISTRATOR VERMA: “Today, we are announcing that we are requiring nursing homes to report to patients and their families if there are cases of COVID virus inside the nursing home. We are also requiring nursing homes to report directly to the CDC when they have cases of COVID virus.”
CMS ADMINISTRATOR VERMA: “FEMA’s also working on a plan to make sure that nursing homes have the supplies that they need.”
CMS ADMINISTRATOR VERMA: “Just last week, we increased the reimbursement in the Medicare program for high-throughput tests and we are also paying for labs to go to out to nursing homes to collect samples. And that’s going to really support efforts on nursing homes in order to isolate patients.”
NEW TREATMENTS AND THERAPEUTICS
PRESIDENT TRUMP: “We’ve launched an unprecedented effort to develop new treatments and therapies to battle the plague.”
PRESIDENT TRUMP: “We have some things that are looking good. Really looking good. We call [it] COVID Treatment Acceleration Program. We’re accelerating all of these great companies that are looking and we have government agencies looking too, NIH. This extraordinary program is slashing red tape to speed and development and to – rival – and, and if you look, if you look at what we are doing in terms of the speed, it is unrivaled.”

* The President took action so his Administration could waive certain laws and regulations in order to give healthcare providers maximum flexibility.
* CMS issued regulatory changes to help increase hospital capacity, expand the healthcare workforce, and cut paperwork so doctors can focus on patients.
* The Administration lifted HIPAA penalties to enable healthcare providers to expand telehealth access for patients.
* President Trump directed his Administration to build emergency medical sites in hot spots across the country, including a hospital at the Javits Center.
* The President deployed the USNS Comfort and USNS Mercy to help support hospital capacity in hard hit states.
Millions of masks, face shields, gowns, gloves and other personal protective equipment have been distributed across the country.
* PRESIDENT TRUMP DURING YESTERDAY’S BRIEFING: “FEMA and HHS have directly distributed 11.7 million N95 respirators…26.5 million surgical masks, 5.3 million face shields, 4.4 million surgical gowns, and 22.6 million gloves. 22.6 million gloves.”
We had conducted 1.79 million tests as of Monday, far more than any other country.
* ADMIRAL GIROIR: “As the President said, 1.79 million tests have been done. And this does not count the hundreds of thousands of tests that are done within hospitals that are now currently not reporting. So I'm sure we're well over 2 million. That inspector general report was done here -- 23rd and 24th -- during our ramp-up period, quite a long time ago.”
Despite what the report says from weeks ago, testing has significantly expanded, backlogs are getting taken care of, and we have deployed rapid result tests across the country.
* Testing is expanding across the country and backlogs are being taken care of.
* ADMIRAL GIROIR: “There was clearly -- and it's hard to interpret the report because it mixes up all kinds of things -- but clearly, there was complaints by some hospitals of a backlog. Probably had sent out tests. And that is true. There were several days of backlog at some of the major labs that have been taken care of. We know now that the ACLA labs now have a 24- to 48-hour turnaround. “
* Hospitals have access to rapid testing that can deliver results in minutes.
* ADMIRAL GIROIR: “They're doing well over 100,000 tests a day. We now have the Abbott machine; that's point of care. That's 18,000 of those instruments throughout the country. The Cepheid machine is now all across the country with a 45-minute turnaround on.”
* We are providing 24 hour support to hospitals who may have testing issues.
* ADMIRAL GIROIR: “We have worked directly with many of the hospitals that have their own laboratory-derived tests. Some of those really, quite frankly, didn't understand the regulatory freedom they have to use other different kinds of instruments or different kinds of reagents…Like they do now. And I'm on the phone with them all the time to make sure that everything is clear. We have a 24-hour call number. But that's what it was there for.”

DATE: May 22, 2020
## TRUE RACISM: Why Joe Biden's Revealing, Unnerving Statement Matters!
Southington, CT – This afternoon, Connecticut Republican Party Chairman J.R. Romano released the following statement regarding Democrat Presidential Candidate Joe Biden's racist remarks about black Trump voters:
""Today, Joe Biden accidentally revealed his feelings toward black voters with minds of their own. With his statement that, ""If you have a problem figuring out whether you’re for me or Trump, then you ain’t black"", Biden finally let slip long held Democrat ideology that minorities 'belong to' the Democrat Party.
As a concerned citizen, I demand to know the following: Do Ned Lamont and the Connecticut Democrat Party agree with Joe Biden's racist comments? Do Democrats share Biden's assertion that supporting President Trump makes someone less-black?
Today's latest Biden gaffe is especially alarming in light of previous statements that ""Poor kids are just as bright as white kids."" and ""You cannot go to a 7-Eleven or a Dunkin' Donuts unless you have a slight Indian accent.""
Considering the Democrats and media's long history of smearing President Donald Trump by baselessly crying racism again and again, I know they will stand beside me in outrage over Joe Biden's insensitive and racially divisive comments today. I hope Democrats in Connecticut and across our nation take this moment to search their souls, as it reveals not just an insensitive comment, but a perverse ideology that has trapped minority voters in an abusive relationship with Democrats like Joe Biden for decades.
The more the American people learn about Joe Biden, the clearer it becomes that he is unfit in every way to be our next president.""

MESSAGE OF THE DAY | President Trump is Committed to Protecting the Health and Safety of Our Seniors
________________________________
PROTECTING OUR SENIORS & NURSING HOMES
* Under President Trump’s leadership, the Administration has taken steps to protect senior citizens, people with disabilities, and those with preexisting conditions during the coronavirus pandemic.
* To protect seniors, the President directed Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to raise the infectious disease standards at nursing homes across America.
* CMS has conducted target inspections throughout the healthcare system, ensuring that residents susceptible to serious complications are protected.
* CMS announced requirements for nursing homes to inform residents and their families when COVID-19 cases arise in their facilities.
* President Trump is delivering critical supplies and assistance for our seniors during the pandemic.
o The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced nearly $1 billion in grants to assist older adults providing services such as home delivered meals and care services in the home.
o President Trump signed legislation that provides free coronavirus testing through Medicare and Medicaid.
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS ALWAYS FOUGHT FOR AMERICA’S SENIORS
* Throughout President Trump’s administration he has worked to provide America’s seniors with better healthcare and lower drug prices.
* The President has fought against the radical Medicare-for-None policies which would jeopardize seniors’ benefits.
* Last year, the President signed an order to improve and protect Medicare for our Nation’s seniors, maximizing their choice and ensuring access to quality care.
* President Trump has taken action to drive down drug prices for our seniors and is committed to ending the scourge of surprise billing.
Small Businesses Across the Country Are Receiving Critical Support from the Paycheck Protection Program
________________________________
UNPRECEDENTED SUPPORT FOR SMALL BUSINESSES
* President Trump fought to secure additional funding for the Paycheck Protection Program and provide additional support to small businesses.
* PRESIDENT TRUMP: “Last week, Congress answered our call to replenish the program and I was honored to sign an additional $320 billion for American workers into law. At least $60 billion reserved for community financial institutions, including those that serve minority and distressed communities.”
* After only 24 hours of PPP relaunching with the second round of funding, nearly $50 billion was distributed to small businesses.
* PRESIDENT TRUMP: “In the first 24 hours of the second round of funding, we’ve handled over 30% more loans than any previous day of the program. So far, we’ve processed an amazing 450,000 loans, totaling over $50 billion.”
* The Administration is providing unprecedented support to small businesses through multiple loan and grant programs.
* SECRETARY MNUCHIN TO SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS: “Your stories are the stories of the 60 million American workers that are going to have the benefits of the close to $1 trillion that the President and Congress have invested in small business to protect you and put you back to work. That’s over $650 billion in the PPP, that’s over $300 billion in disaster loans, and that’s over $20 billion of grants.”
SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS SEE A REAL IMPACT
* The Paycheck Protection Program is all about supporting small businesses and helping keep workers employed.
* ADVISOR TO THE PRESIDENT IVANKA TRUMP ON PPP: “It's about your businesses thriving and growing within your communities. It's about your workforce, who each of you cares very dearly about.”
* As small business owners attested yesterday, the Paycheck Protection Program is providing a lifeline of support during this challenging time.
* Amy Wright from Bitty & Beau’s Coffee: “Bitty & Beau’s Coffee is more than a coffee shop; it's a human rights movement. We employ 120 people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. And for most of them, it's their first paying job, which made the decision for us to temporarily close all five of our shops especially difficult. But thanks to the Paycheck Protection Program and the incredible team at Live Oak Bank, all 120 of our employees are back on the payroll today and working from home, writing handwritten notes that we include with each online order we ship.
* Brandon Hutson, President of Ed and Jim's Body Shop: “I would like to take the opportunity to thank President Trump for quickly signing the PPP into action. Because of this program, Ed & Jim’s is able to rehire all of our furloughed employees and provide them with a paycheck starting this week. This program has given our small business the funds needed to operate and maintain through this crisis.”
* Tony Stafford, Chef and Founder of Ford’s Fish Shack: “With the help of the PPP loan and the success of the PPP loan that we were able to get, I’m going to be able to keep that promise [to rehire workers] and bring every one of those employees back.”
* * *
What You Need To Know | 10 Facts the Media Won’t Tell You About The President’s Coronavirus Response
________________________________
President Trump has taken swift and unprecedented action to save lives and protect the American people from the coronavirus.
1\. The President’s early actions to respond to the coronavirus were critical.
· DR. BIRX: “It’s clear that the early work of the president, both with travel restrictions and the ability to quarantine, has bought us the time and space to have this task force be very effective.”
· DR. FAUCI: “One of the things we did right was very early cut off the travel from China to the United States … Our shutting off travel from China and more recently travel from Europe has gone a long way to not seeding very, very intensively, the virus in our country.”
2\. The President cut off travel from China – where the virus originated – before there was a single known death in the U.S.
· On January 31st, President Trump announced sweeping travel restrictions on China to help slow the spread of the virus within our country.
· The mainstream media immediately criticized this important action:
o VOX: “The evidence on travel bans for diseases like coronavirus is clear: They don’t work”
o CNN: “The US coronavirus travel ban could backfire. Here's how”
o BUZZFEED NEWS: ""[B]arring foreign travelers from China, along with making U.S. citizens self-quarantine at home ... likely violated civil rights laws, without leading to any real lowered risk of a U.S. outbreak.""
3\. In his State of the Union address, President Trump promised to “take all necessary steps to safeguard our citizens from the virus.”
· As soon as his address concluded, Pelosi ripped up the speech.
· During the Democrats’ response, Governor Whitmer never once mentioned coronavirus.
4\. While President Trump requested billions of dollars to combat coronavirus, Nancy Pelosi was urging people to congregate in Chinatown in San Francisco.
· Nearly a month after President Trump announced travel restrictions on China, Pelosi encouraged Americans to congregate in Chinatown.
o PELOSI: “[W]e do want to say to people ‘Come to Chinatown, here we are — we're, again, careful, safe — and come join us.'”
5\. The United States has conducted far more tests than any other country.
· Starting from scratch, the United States has now performed more than 5.7 million tests – far more than any other country.
o The U.S. is now averaging over 200,000 tests per day.
6\. The United States’ fatality rate has remained one of the lowest in the world among the countries that have been most affected.
· PRESIDENT TRUMP: “Thanks to our aggressive campaign against the virus and the extraordinary talent of our medical professionals, our mortality rate remains roughly half of that of many other countries and one of the lowest of any country in the world.”
· DR. BIRX: “Thank you for the work that you’re doing to protect Americans and give us one of the lowest mortality rates in the entire world.”
7\. Due to the President’s efforts, we will produce numerous times the amount of N95 masks in the coming months than typically used in an entire year.
· President Trump leveraged the Defense Production Act and reached an agreement with 3M to produce 166.5 million masks over the next three months.
· Our healthcare industry typically uses around 25 million N95 masks per year.
8\. Over a 100 day period, the Administration is procuring three times the number of ventilators than the U.S. typically produces in a year.
· The Administration is procuring 100,000 ventilators in 100 days – three times more than the U.S. normally produces a year.
· States that previously feared a severe ventilator shortage – such as New York – are sending ventilators to other states and back to the national stockpile.
· The President’s efforts have ensured that every American who needs a ventilator must not go without one.
9\. The United States is bringing a coronavirus vaccine to trial at record speed.
· A phase one trial for the coronavirus vaccine began less than three months after the virus’ genetic sequence was identified.
· Dr. Fauci noted that this trial was launched “in record speed.”
o FAUCI: “Going into a Phase One trial within three months of getting the sequence is unquestionably the world indoor record. Nothing has ever gone that fast.”
10\. President Trump secured the largest economic relief package in our nation’s history.
· President Trump provided more than $2 trillion in funds to provide emergency relief to families and small businesses impacted by the coronavirus.
· Alongside direct funding, the legislation enabled the Federal Reserve the ability to access up to an additional $4 trillion to provide liquidity in the economy.

"Republicans Just EXPOSED The Bad News Blackout
View this email in your browser
Alex --
Senator Ted Cruz just announced that the Senate Judiciary Committee is dragging in the CEO of Twitter to testify about their outrageous Bad News Blackouts to protect Joe Biden!
""This is Election Interference and we are 19 Days out from an election. It has no precedent in the history of democracy.""
-Senator Ted Cruz
>> Watch The Video <<
Liberal media titans aren't even bashful about their news blackouts, Alex!
That hasn't stopped Connecticut Republicans from shining a spotlight on the real radical agenda of the Democrats all along your ballot, but we need your help to keep going strong through Election Day!
Now we know more clearly than ever that their media allies are working overtime to get Democrats elected at the state level, in Congress, and even circling the wagons around Joe Biden's corrupt family empire.
WE HAVE TO KEEP FIGHTING BACK!
With just 19 days to go before it's too late, your Connecticut Republican Party is using our resources to keep this election fair and free by:
*** Training volunteers to root out Election Fraud
*** Registering and Mobilizing Republican Voters
*** Calling out Corrupt and Radical Democrats in all corners of our state
With FIVE Congressional elections up for grabs on November 3rd, you can bet that Connecticut media is all in, protecting incumbent Democrats from answering tough questions about Joe Biden, Media Bias, Election Fraud, and more!
They are betting the farm on good people like you sitting down, shutting up, and accepting their corrupt games.
>> FIGHT BACK <<
For our future's sake, I'm betting and hoping that you'll stand up and fight back.
Could you chip in to this fight, before it's too late?

View this email in your browser
Alex --
I'm running against Connecticut's most notorious Do-NOTHING Congressman, John Larson.
My community experience has taught me how bloated, invasive government kills the Can-Do entrepreneurial spirit which fuels small businesses and the American Dream itself! That's why I'm working overtime to take Connecticut's 1st District back for The PEOPLE.
This campaign is built on three main pillars:
1) GROWING The Economy
2) INVESTING in Families and Education
3) IMPROVING Public Safety
>> Count Me In, Mary! <<
Here's what I WON'T Do . . . I will NEVER defund our First Responders, threaten your Second Amendment rights, or subsidize Sanctuary Cities!
But with your help, I WILL go to Washington to WORK for YOU!
My opponent has NOTHING to show for over 20 years in office, except for special interest giveaways and more debt! We don't need swampy seat-warmers like John Larson. We need a representative with a real Can-Do Attitude and fire in the belly to get the job done.
That's why I'm asking you to help me TODAY!
>> I Can Help, Mary! <<
I'm meeting voters across the district every day, but what I really need is a strong Get Out The Vote MACHINE. This ensures we have the resources to Call, Text, Mail, Email and Knock in every community, so every voter has their say at the polls on November 3rd.
Don't you agree that it's beyond time Connecticut has at least one vote against the radical left's agenda? John Larson doesn't have the guts to Say NO to AOC and the radical left, but I DO and I WILL if you put me on the job as your voice in Congress.
Here's the deal, Alex. I don't have to out-raise or out-spend my opponent. I just need to hit my goal of raising $25,000 over the next 15 days to keep my digital campaign breaking through the media filters and directly targeting the voters it will take to put us over the top on Election Day.
Will you help me by chipping in with your own contribution of $25, $50, even $100 or more right away?
Your contribution today puts us closer to pulling the plug on the Washington Swamp and sending John Larson to the private sector, where he'll have to learn what a real job looks like.
We can do it together, but I cannot do it alone.

Southington – Chairman J.R. Romano today released the following statement in light of Senator Mae Flexer soliciting donations for her job from lobbyists:
""In light of the explosive report by Daily Ructions, Mae Flexer must return all lobbyist money she raised for her nonprofit. She pledged to honor the intent of the state lobbyist ban and is always the first to call out hypocritical behavior but she used her role as the Chairman of the General Assembly's joint committee on General Administration & Elections to leverage more money to pay her salary. Mae Flexer needs to return the money she raised from lobbyists and resign her position as Chairman of GAE for blurring state ethics rules.""

What You Need To Know | President Trump is Strengthening Our Domestic Industrial Base
________________________________
Today, President Trump took action to strengthen our nation’s domestic industrial base and ensure we have the supplies we need to confront the coronavirus.
* Through a new executive order President Trump is working to reduce our dependence on foreign countries to provide supplies needed to protect Americans during this time of crisis.
* The President is directing the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) to offer financial assistance to key industries producing goods needed to combat the coronavirus.
* The Administration will provide financial assistance to help onshore U.S. supply chains and bolster our independence in healthcare, manufacturing, and technology.
* The President has also directed DFC to invest in innovative projects around the world to ensure critical industries are moved away from strategic competitors and to our allies.
* Too many critical industries are located in countries that do not align with American interests.
* These efforts will strengthen U.S. supply chains and make sure that America is well equipped with the vital resources we need.
President Trump is working to bring back American manufacturing and promote American independence.
* The coronavirus has demonstrated what President Trump has long stated: we need to increase domestic production and reduce foreign dependence.
* The United States has lost too many companies—specifically manufacturing firms—to overseas markets, hampering our ability to ramp up production in areas of need.
* Since taking office, President Trump has worked tirelessly to bring American manufacturing jobs back from overseas and strengthen our nation’s supply chain.
* In 2017, President Trump took action to strengthen enforcement of “Buy American” laws, to promote American industry.
* The President has implemented tariffs to protect American steel and aluminum manufacturers, which are vital to our national security.
* The President negotiated historic trade agreements which will provided fairer markets for American manufacturers.
* President Trump has taken a stand against China’s unfair trade practices after years of Washington looking the other way.
President Trump Is Ensuring We Have The Strong National Stockpile And Industrial Base Needed To Meet Any Challenge
________________________________
President Trump is working to ensure a fully stocked, resilient national stockpile and a domestic industrial base capable of meeting any future challenge.
· President Trump and his Administration are releasing a plan to restructure the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS), implementing lessons learned from recent pandemics.
· Our next generation SNS will be improved by increasing supplies of critically-needed items, integrating predictive analytics to determine needs, leveraging technology to provide real-time visibility of supply chains, and reducing dependency on foreign supplies.
· Additionally, President Trump is signing an Executive Order providing the authority to ensure America is producing critical goods necessary to build up our strategic stockpiles.
o Under the order, the United States International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) will provide financing to key industries producing vital goods and services.
· With the health and security of our Nation as the primary goal, this order will secure our supply chain and make our country more independent, self-sufficient, and resilient.
· The President’s actions will protect the American people, make sure our Nation is more prepared, and prime our industrial base to respond to any future challenge.
President Trump is determined to address the challenges and stockpile deficiencies uncovered during the initial coronavirus response.
· During the coronavirus pandemic, the Trump Administration found that the Nation’s stockpile was insufficient.
· Previous SNS inventories lacked the breadth and depth to respond to pandemic demand, only stocking 28% of needed items and containing less than a month’s supply of key items.
· Under the former system, the ability to determine what products were most needed, rapidly replenish items, and target the distribution of critical products to high-need areas was lacking.
· Since less than half of personal protective equipment (PPE) is manufactured in North America, our supply chain was extremely vulnerable to foreign production interruptions.
· The coronavirus pandemic exposed the need to increase domestic production and reduce foreign dependence on items critical to our Nation’s health and national security.
Under President Trump’s leadership, the Administration has successfully procured and delivered supplies to Americans in need.
· President Trump and his Administration, in collaboration with manufacturers, have worked tirelessly to ramp up production and delivery of critical medical supplies across the Nation.
· The President launched Project Airbridge to bring supplies from all over the world to support America’s frontline healthcare workers.
· The Administration partnered with the private sector to secure donations and production of PPE and other medical supplies.
· President Trump effectively leveraged the Defense Production Act to mobilize our country and secure massive amounts of PPE and ventilators.
· Thanks to President Trump’s efforts and the power of the private sector, every American who has needed a ventilator has had one.

Good morning,
This 4th of July weekend, President Trump delivered a unifying message to the American people celebrating American independence and greatness.
On Friday, July 3, the President paid homage to some of our country’s great leaders beneath the shadows of Mount Rushmore in South Dakota. In his remarks, President Trump emphasized law, order and patriotism and defended traditional American principles – liberty, freedom, honor, bravery and spirit – that are now under “radical and unprecedented assault” (see WSJ Editorial Board: Trump at Mount Rushmore). The President cast a unifying message for all Americans based on our shared history and values stating, “From this night and from this magnificent place, let us go forward united in our purpose and re-dedicated in our resolve. We will raise the next generation of American Patriots. We will write the next thrilling chapter of the American Adventure. And we will teach our children to know that they live in a land of legends, that nothing can stop them, and that no one can hold them down. They will know that in America, you can do anything, you can be anything, and TOGETHER, we can achieve anything,” the President stated (see full remarks here – video; transcript – additional excerpts below).
President Trump also announced an Executive Order establishing a statuary park – National Garden of American Heroes – honoring many of our country’s great citizens, including John Adams, Alexander Hamilton, Thomas Jefferson, Martin Luther King, Jr., Abraham Lincoln, Frederick Douglas, Dolley Madison, Betsy Ross, Harriet Tubman, and George Washington. “America owes its present greatness to its past sacrifices. Because the past is always at risk of being forgotten, monuments will always be needed to honor those who came before,” the President stated.
On Saturday, July 4 at the Salute to America, President Trump – joined by front line workers and their families, including law enforcement, doctors, nurses, and others, as well as members of the military and their families – spoke to the tremendous courage and spirit of the American people in our collective fight against COVID-19 just as our forefathers did in the right to secure our independence. “Throughout our history, our country has been tested and tried – but we have always fought to victory. Whenever our way of life has been threatened, our ancestors have responded with the same resounding answer as those first patriots who fought for independence: We are Americans, and we never back down, we never give in, and we never give up, and we will never yield [in] defense of our nation. We love our nation. We will only fight to win (see full remarks here – video; transcript). Also see Presidential Message on the 244th Anniversary of the Adoption of the Declaration of Independence.
Excerpts from President Donald J. Trump’s Remarks at South Dakota’s 2020 Mount Rushmore Fireworks Celebrations (as prepared)
…
There could be no better place to celebrate America’s Independence than beneath this majestic monument to four of the Greatest Americans who have ever lived! Today, we pay tribute to the exceptional lives and extraordinary legacies of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, and Teddy Roosevelt. I am here as your president to proclaim before the country and the world: This monument will never be desecrated, these heroes will never be defaced, their legacy will never be destroyed, their achievements will never be forgotten, and Mount Rushmore will stand FOREVER as an eternal tribute to our Forefathers and to our FREEDOM!
…
Our Founders launched not only a revolution in government – but a revolution in the pursuit of justice, equality, liberty and prosperity. No nation has done more to advance the human condition than the United States of America. And no people have done more to promote human progress than the CITIZENS of our great nation.
…
Yet as we meet here tonight, there is a growing danger that threatens every blessing our ancestors fought, struggled and bled to secure.
…
Our nation is witnessing a merciless campaign to wipe out our history, defame our heroes, erase our values, and indoctrinate our children. Angry mobs are trying to tear down statues of our founders, deface our most sacred memorials, and unleash a wave of violent crime in our cities.
…
We will EXPOSE this dangerous movement, PROTECT our nation’s children, END this radical assault, and PRESERVE our beloved American Way of Life!
…
This movement is openly attacking the legacies of every person on Mount Rushmore. […] Before these figures were immortalized in stone, they were American giants in full flesh and blood, gallant men whose intrepid deeds unleashed the greatest leap of human advancement the world has ever known. Tonight, I will tell you and, most importantly, the youth of our nation, the true stories of these great men.
…
We will state the truth in full, without apology: We declare that the United States of America is the most just and exceptional nation ever to exist on earth.
…
Those who seek to erase our heritage want Americans to forget our pride and our great dignity, so that we can no longer understand ourselves or America’s destiny. In toppling the heroes of 1776, they seek to dissolve the bonds of love and loyalty that we feel for our country, and for each other.
…
They would tear down the beliefs, culture, and identity that have made America the most vibrant and tolerant society in the history of the earth.
…
My fellow Americans, it is time to speak up loudly and defend the integrity of our country! It is time to summon the bravery and determination of our American ancestors. It is time to plant our flag and protect the greatness of this nation, for citizens of every race, in every city, and every part of this glorious land. For the sake of our honor, for the sake of our children, for the sake of our union, we must protect and preserve our history, our heritage and our heroes.
…
Here tonight, before the eyes of our forefathers, Americans declare again, as we did 244 years ago: we will not be tyrannized, we will not be demeaned, and we will not be intimidated! We will proclaim the ideals of the Declaration of Independence—and we will never surrender the spirit and the courage and the cause of July 4th, 1776!
…
Uplifted by the titans of Mount Rushmore, we will find unity that no one expected; we will make strides that no one thought possible. This country will be everything that our citizens hope, and that our enemies fear—because we will never forget that American Freedom EXISTS for American Greatness.
…
Excerpts contd.
Let us also send our deepest thanks to our wonderful Veterans, law enforcement, first responders, and the doctors, nurses, and scientists working tirelessly to kill the Virus.
…
We gather tonight to herald the most important day in the history of nations: July 4th, 1776. At those words, every American heart should swell with pride. Every American family should cheer with delight. And every American patriot should be filled with joy. Because each of you lives in the most magnificent country in the history of the world—and it will soon be greater than ever before!
…
Our Founders launched not only a revolution in government – but a revolution in the pursuit of justice, equality, liberty and prosperity. No nation has done more to advance the human condition than the United States of America. And no people have done more to promote human progress than the CITIZENS of our great nation.
…
It was all made possible by the courage of 56 patriots who gathered in Philadelphia 244 years ago and signed the Declaration of Independence. They enshrined a divine truth that changed the world forever when they said: “All Men Are Created Equal!” These immortal words set in motion the unstoppable march of freedom. Our Founders boldly declared that we are ALL endowed with the same divine rights –given to us by our CREATOR in Heaven. And that which God has given us, we will allow NO ONE to take away.
…
No movement that seeks to dismantle these treasured American legacies can possibly have a love of America at its heart. No person who remains quiet at the destruction of this resplendent heritage can possibly lead us to a better future.
…
We are proud of the fact that our country was founded on Judeo-Christian principles, and we understand that these values have dramatically advanced the cause of peace and justice throughout the world.
…
We believe in equal opportunity, equal justice, and equal treatment for citizens of every race, background, religion and creed. Every child, of every color – BORN AND UNBORN – is made in the holy image of God.
We want free and open debate – not speech codes or cancel culture.
We embrace tolerance – not prejudice.
…
We will never let them rip America’s heroes from our monuments, or from our hearts. By tearing down Washington and Jefferson, these radicals would tear down the very heritage for which men gave their lives to win the Civil War; they would erase the memory that inspired those soldiers to go to their deaths singing these words of the Battle Hymn of the Republic: “As He died to make men Holy, LET US DIE TO MAKE MEN FREE, while God is marching on!” They would tear down the principles that propelled the abolition of slavery in America and, ultimately, around the world—ending an evil institution that had plagued humanity for thousands of years. Our opponents would tear apart the very documents that Martin Luther King used to express his Dream, and the ideas that were the foundation of the righteous movement for Civil Rights. They would tear down the beliefs, culture, and identity that have made America the most vibrant and tolerant society in the history of the earth.
…
My fellow Americans, it is time to speak up loudly and defend the integrity of our country! It is time to summon the bravery and determination of our American ancestors. It is time to plant our flag and protect the greatness of this nation, for citizens of every race, in every city, and every part of this glorious land. For the sake of our honor, for the sake of our children, for the sake of our union, we must protect and preserve our history, our heritage and our heroes.
…
We must demand that our children are taught once again to see America as did Reverend Martin Luther King, when he said that the founders had signed “a promissory note” to every future generation. Dr. King saw that the mission of justice required us to fully embrace our founding ideals. He called on his fellow citizens not to rip down their heritage, but to LIVE UP to it.
…
From this night and from this magnificent place, let us go forward united in our purpose and re-dedicated in our resolve. We will raise the next generation of American Patriots. We will write the next thrilling chapter of the American Adventure. And we will teach our children to know that they live in a land of legends, that nothing can stop them, and that no one can hold them down. They will know that in America, you can do anything, you can be anything, and TOGETHER, we can achieve anything.
Uplifted by the titans of Mount Rushmore, we will find unity that no one expected; we will make strides that no one thought possible. This country will be everything that our citizens hope, and that our enemies fear—because we will never forget that American Freedom EXISTS for American Greatness. Centuries from now, our legacy will be the Cities we built, the champions we forged, the good that we did, and the monuments we created to inspire us all.

Alex, we are SO CLOSE!
I just heard from Chairman Romano that even though we had an overwhelming response to the CTGOP's all new Ballot Integrity Fund, we still need another 41 contributions by midnight to reach our benchmarks for the Q2 Fiscal Quarter ending TONIGHT!
Could you act now and become one of those donors that puts us over the top before midnight?
This new action fund will mean for the first time ever, we truly have the resources to fight back against Democrats playing games in our elections.
Thank you for acting right away!

Original Message Below
FIGHT VOTER FRAUD
Alex --
Aren't you sick and tired of Democrats finding ways to cheat?
After forcing President Trump into a fake Republican Primary this year, Secretary of the State Denise Merrill is up to shenanigans again. This time Joe Biden's top Connecticut election rigger is using taxpayer funds to create a tsunami of questionable absentee ballots this November.
But Alex, Connecticut Republicans are fighting back!
The Ballot Integrity Fund
Will Help Connecticut Republicans:
* REGISTER 4,877 New Voters
* ENSURE Registrars Clean Up Voter Rolls
* ESTABLISH Absentee Ballot Protection Program
* PROTECT OUR FAIR ELECTIONS!
FIGHT VOTER FRAUD
Democrats know that Joe Biden doesn't have the policies or the stamina to go toe to toe with President Trump in a fair fight.
That's why they are pulling out all the stops, doubling down on the lessons they learned rigging the system for Crooked Hillary four years ago and adding new surprises. Make no mistake: Flooding states with untraceable absentee ballots is a key part of Democrats' 2020 strategy!
I've run the numbers with my legal team, and we need to raise $75,000 in the next month to beef up our elections integrity operations.  In your zip code alone, that means we need 29 new donors at $50 a piece or 58 new donors at $25!
Can I count on you to be one of those core contributors by pledging your support of $50 or at least $25 right away?
I cringe when I think about Joe Biden becoming our 46th president . . . But it could happen if we allow the Democrats to pull off their new election scam.
Please help us fight back, starting today.

View this email in your browser
GET INVESTED!
Contribute to our US Senate Nominee Fund
Alex,
Dick Blumenthal is an embarrassment to our state.
Can you believe it? Instead of doing his job for the people of Connecticut, Blumenthal is trolling Trump.
While President Trump's administration is hard at work protecting Americans from Coronavirus, Blumenthal has taken his usual position -- in front of the cameras, spreading drivel and disinformation!
There's only one way to end the madness and Drain the Swamp: Dick Blumenthal has to go!
But how will we ever get rid of bad actors like Dick Blumenthal, if we cannot gather the resources to properly fund a US Senate campaign?
NOW WE CAN!
Connecticut Republicans have launched our own US Senate Nominee Fund, setting aside a special pool of money for the purpose of sending a REPUBLICAN to the US Senate.
This Senate Nominee Fund is a totally new, completely different tool for our US Senate nominee (whomever they are), an immediate cash infusion to take the fight to the Democrats and potentially flip another Senate seat RED.
Alex this is a game changer! Will you be an early investor with a commitment of $25 or more, right away?
If you are sick and tired of Blumenthal's blathering & blustering, we need you to act now!
Help strengthen our GOP Senate Majority.
Help send President Trump more allies.
Help us Drain The DC Swamp!

In Flanders Fields
by: John McCrae
In Flanders fields the poppies blow
Between the crosses, row on row,
That mark our place; and in the sky
The larks, still bravely singing, fly
Scarce heard amid the guns below.
We are the Dead. Short days ago
We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,
Loved and were loved, and now we lie
In Flanders fields.
Take up our quarrel with the foe:
To you from failing hands we throw
The torch; be yours to hold it high.
If ye break faith with us who die
We shall not sleep, though poppies grow
In Flanders fields.

Alex, Our communities are under attack!
Across America, rioters have taken the streets, putting residents and even law enforcement in serious danger. Without swift action, it is only a matter of time before Connecticut starts to look like Chicago, Portland, Minneapolis and NYC.
But Connecticut Democrats are doing NOTHING to stop lawbreakers and EVERYTHING to undermine our heroes serving on the front lines to keep our streets safe.
We are calling out elected Connecticut Democrats who remain silent on issues of public safety!
>> CALL THEM OUT <<
The media won't ask Democrats the questions, so Connecticut Republicans WILL!
Over the next three weeks, we are activating a massive response team of concerned citizens calling and texting weak Democrat officeholders, demanding they take a public stand on:
* DEFUNDING the Police
* IGNORING Rule of Law
* RISKING Your Family's Safety
But we can't do any of it without your help!
Our citizen outreach plan is projected to cost over $12,750 which means we need to gather precious resources right away to call out Democrat officeholders.
With your help, we'll put Democrats on the record.
Their voices may be silent, but their horrible policy priorities speak volumes.
Don't let Democrats hide in their basements like Joe Biden, avoiding scrutiny from concerned citizens!
>> CALL THEM OUT <<

Did you see Chairman Romano's email Alex?
With just a week to go before Election Day, Connecticut Republicans are working overtime to contact as many voters as possible in targeted districts across our state!

Alex -- Everywhere you go across Connecticut, you can see and feel record enthusiasm on our side.
But liberals want revenge, Alex! And they are doing whatever it takes to sneak their puppet Joe Biden into the White House to authorize the most radical left wing agenda in history.
The Washington Swamp is fully mobilized, waiting for patriotic men and women like you to sit back and let them pop champagne on Election Day. You won't let that happen, will you?
I'M READY TO FIGHT BACK
Republicans can achieve victory on November 3rd, ONLY if we are INVESTED and READY to take the fight to the Democrats.
When Liberal Insiders attack President Trump,
they are really attacking YOU!
I have authorized my team to completely empty out the store to channel our record breaking momentum, Alex. I want every supporter across Connecticut to step up and show off their Trump 2020 pride as we race down the final stretch of this historic campaign!
I'M READY TO MAKE HISTORY
So I'll close this important note by asking you this: Are you proud to be a Trump supporter? Are you willing to speak up for the achievements we made together? Are you invested in the fight against socialism and corruption?
If you answered YES to any one of those questions, then please stand up and help us make history by chipping in to support Team Trump Connecticut's VICTORY operations through this link.
Your support today means we can engage and mobilize voters across Connecticut between today and November 3rd. And you can look back at this moment and say, ""I helped when it mattered most.""
THANK YOU!
J.R. Romano, Chairman

GET INVESTED
Contribute to our US Senate Nominee Fund
Alex,
While President Trump is hard at work on behalf of the American People, America's two worst senators are equally busy grabbing headlines for all all the wrong reasons.
This week we learned Chris Murphy probably violated the Logan Act when he snuck behind the State Department's back to conduct his own foreign policy blitz with Iran.
To end the madness, we have to Drain The DC Swamp of bad actors like Chris Murphy and Dick Blumenthal!
GREAT NEWS \-- Connecticut just launched our US Senate Nominee Fund, setting aside a special pool of money specifically for the purpose of sending a REPUBLICAN to the US Senate to replace these swamp creatures.
Will you be an early investor with a commitment of $25 or more, right away?
This special fund is dedicated to one cause: WINNING!
But we can't do it without you.
Help strengthen our GOP Senate Majority.
Help send President Trump more allies.
Help us Drain The DC Swamp!

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT: J.R. Romano ([[URL REDACTED]])
DATE: February 14, 2020
## Another Hyper-Partisan Move by Denise Merrill
SOUTHINGTON – Secretary of the State Denise Merrill has placed herself in the center of Republican Party business by mandating a Presidential Preference Primary.
""In 2016, Denise and I had a conversation about who was going to be allowed on the ballot. This year, she hasn't allowed party leaders the courtesy of determining our own candidates and unilaterally placed losing candidates on our ballot out of her hatred for the President"" Chairman J.R. Romano said.
""If Denise wants to really do her job, she should clean up the crooked party boss structures in our cities interfering in our elections. A partisan Democrat should have no business determining our Republican nominees and I am encouraging all Republicans to pick up the phone and call her ((860) 509-6200) and tell her to do her job not promote her pettiness which will impact local town budgets"" Romano continued.
The CT Presidential Preference Primary is scheduled for Tuesday, April 28, 2020.

"ACTION ALERT: Special Election Mobilization
View this email in your browser
### Dear Alex --
Do you ever park your car in town? Or take your laundry to the laundromat or dry cleaner? Do you ever decorate or improve your home?
If you do these or many other routine activities, ""New Tax Ned"" Lamont and his big taxing allies in the legislature just made your life more expensive.
Starting on January 1, a slew of new tax hikes came into effect in Connecticut, hitting Nutmeggers even harder!
Haven't you had enough?
>> HELP US GET OUR MESSAGE OUT
With three Special Elections ahead, taxpayers have a real opportunity to get rid of the big tax & spenders in Hartford!
That's why we have launched an ambitious text message survey campaign, finding the voters that are fed up with Democrats on issues like the Grocery Tax, Tolls, Forced School Regionalization and new tax hikes that are crushing our families.
Republicans need to mobilize 5,000 voters in targeted town across our state over the next week on issues they care about most.
Will you answer our call to action with a generous contribution of $10, $25, $50 or more right away?
Chip in $10 to reach 50 VOTERS
Chip in $25 to reach 125 VOTERS
Chip in $50 to reach 250 VOTERS
Chip in $100 to reach 500 VOTERS
Chip in $250 to reach 1,250 VOTERS

Alex --
I'm overwhelmed by the response we got from supporters last week!
With January Special Elections coming quickly, I'm doubling our goal and need to raise another $5,000 this week to reach voters this week.
If you haven't already chipped in, please rush your contribution of $25, $50, or even $100 right away.
Together, let's win the upcoming Special Elections and take away three rubber stamp allies from Ned Lamont.
Are you in it to win?

### Dear Alex --
How would you like to help us take 3 rubber stamp allies away from Ned Lamont?
Now you can! The governor's office has announced Special Elections to fill three vacancies in the legislature.
That means there are three opportunities for supporters like you to help send REPUBLICAN champions to Hartford and fight back against Lamont's big spending, big taxing agenda!
Republicans can sweep these Special Elections, but only if we are able to reach the key swing voters so critical in recent victories.
That's why we are launching an ambitious text message survey campaign, finding out voters' positions on issues like the Grocery Tax, Tolls, Forced School Regionalization and a slew of other out of touch proposals that the Democrats are trying to force on our communities.
>> HELP US GET OUR MESSAGE OUT <<
Our goal is to reach 5,000 voters in targeted town across our state over the next week on issues they care about most.
Will you answer our call to action with a generous contribution of $10, $25, $50 or more right away? With your help, Republicans will have the ability to cut through the media filter and reach uncommitted voters directly.

"Shining a Light on Joe & Kamala's Socialist Vision
View this email in your browser
Alex --
Tonight America will start to see the real faces of American socialism. . .
With the radical Democrats kicking off their virtual 2020 Convention, the contrast between their vision and ours will quickly come into focus as Americans choose our path forward for the next four years.
The 2020 Democrat Starting Lineup includes:
* Sore Loser John Kasich, seeking revenge from his 2016 defeat
* Failed Governor Andrew Cuomo, who has presided over mass exodus and total chaos
* Radical Tyrant Gretchen Whitmer, who's radical stay at home order faced total backlash
* Crazy Bernie Sanders, with ideas so wild that the Dems had to steal the nomination from him AGAIN!
... and this is just the first day of their convention Alex!
It is hard to over-exaggerate how much trouble America will be in if these big government radicals are allowed to come back into power and run our entire nation.
Alex if Joe Biden and Kamala Harris win on November 3rd, then YOU lose.
>> DON'T LET THEM WIN <<
We need 45 Trump supporters to sign on before Day 1 of the Democrat Socialist Convention goes off air tonight!
* LIMITED TIME OFFER *
EXCLUSIVELY for email subscribers like you: Answer this call to action right away with a minimum contribution, and we will rush you a brand new Trump 2020 Bumper Sticker to show the world you oppose the far left agenda being rolled out by the Democrats this week.
So please, chip in $10, $25, even $45 to show our 45th President Donald J. Trump that you have his back in the urgent campaign to stop socialism and Make America Great Again!
Take a stand before the Dems go off the air tonight.

### Dear Alex --
Sometimes it is hard to over-state the urgency of decisive action. This is one of those times.
Connecticut Democrats recently pushed through a radical anti-police bill that will make it harder to RECRUIT and RETAIN good cops on the beat in our communities.
How did they do it? Massive majorities in the legislature.
How can we stop them? Take AWAY their majorities by shining a light on their radical anti-cop policies.
SHINE A LIGHT ON DEMOCRATS
Between now and Election Day, Connecticut Republicans are planning to GO LIVE with our new ""Hero"" ad to show voters EXACTLY what is at stake if Democrats continue their choke hold on power in the state legislature.
Alex, In order to get this ad on air,

For victims counting the seconds until a hero arrives, this ad cannot wait to air.
Will YOU be their hero by answering this call to action, right away?

What You Need To Know | President Trump’s Coronavirus Response Efforts
________________________________
President Trump and his Administration are working every day to protect the health and wellbeing of Americans and respond to the coronavirus.

* President Trump declared a national emergency, inviting States, territories, and tribes to access over $42 billion in existing funding.
* President Trump signed initial legislation securing $8.3 billion for coronavirus response.
* President Trump signed the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, ensuring that American families and businesses impacted by the virus receive the strong support they need.
* To leverage the resources of the entire government, the President created a White House Coronavirus Task Force to coordinate response.
* The Vice President named Dr. Deborah Birx to serve as the White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator.
* At the request of President Trump, FEMA is leading federal operations on behalf of the White House Coronavirus Task Force.

* The President has approved numerous major disaster declarations for impacted states and territories.
* Through the CARES Act, we more than doubled the funds available through the President’s Emergency and Disaster Declarations to help State, local, and tribal leaders effectively respond.
* The Administration is covering costs of deploying National Guard units to assist with response efforts in hard hit states, while ensuring governors remain in command.
* The President has held multiple teleconferences with our nation’s governors to coordinate response efforts and offer his full support.
TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS
* In January, President Trump reacted quickly to implement travel restrictions on travel from China, buying us valuable time to respond to the virus.
* The President has announced further travel restrictions on global hotspots, including Europe, the United Kingdom and Ireland, and Iran.
* American citizens returning from travel-restricted countries are being routed to specific airports, where they can be screened and isolated as needed.
* The United States reached mutual agreements with Mexico and Canada to restrict non-essential travel across our northern and southern borders.
* The Administration announced it will expeditiously return aliens who cross between ports of entry or are otherwise not allowed to enter the country, as the facilities in which these aliens would be held cannot support quarantine for the time needed to assess potential cases.
* The Administration raised travel warnings to their highest level for other hot spot locations, like Japan and South Korea.
* The President has expanded airport screenings to identify travelers showing symptoms and instituted mandatory quarantines.
* The State Department issued a global level 4 travel advisory, urging Americans to avoid all international travel due to the coronavirus outbreak worldwide.
* The State Department has worked to safely repatriate thousands of Americans from around the world.
EXPANDING TESTING ACCESS
* The FDA has issued emergency approval for multiple new commercial coronavirus tests, including some that deliver results to healthcare providers within minutes.
* The FDA has authorized a coronavirus antibody test, which will help identify Americans who have recovered and enable researchers to better understand their immune response.
* The President secured legislation that will ensure Americans are able to be tested for free.
* The Administration is working with state and local partners and the private sector to open up drive-through testing sites.
* HHS authorized licensed pharmacists to order and administer coronavirus tests.
* The Administration worked with Apple to launch an app and website to help Americans determine if they should seek care for coronavirus, and provide them guidance on next steps.
* HHS is providing funding to help accelerate the development of rapid diagnostic tests for the coronavirus.
* The FDA cut red tape to expand testing availability.
* The President named Admiral Brett Giroir – the Assistant Secretary for Health and head of the Public Health Service – to coordinate coronavirus testing efforts.
* The FDA empowered states to authorize tests developed and used by laboratories in their states.
* The Department of Defense has set up more than a dozen coronavirus testing sites worldwide.
* The President signed legislation requiring more reporting from state and private labs to ensure our public health officials have the data they need to respond to this outbreak.

HIGHLIGHTS | President Trump and the Coronavirus Task Force Provide an Update to Americans
________________________________
RE-OPENING THE COUNTRY SAFELY
PRESIDENT TRUMP: “Following the release of our reopening guidelines, governors across the country are looking forward to phase one and announcing plans for an economic resurgence.”
PRESIDENT TRUMP: “During this time, Americans must maintain strict vigilance and continue to practice careful hygiene, social distancing, and the other protective measures that we have outlined, and that everyone’s become very familiar with. We continue to be encouraged that many of the areas hardest hit by the virus appear to have turned the corner.”
PRESIDENT TRUMP: “Recent deaths are down very, very substantially. You can compare that with their peak not so long ago, and you have numbers of 30%, 25%. And Detroit, as an example, it’s down over by over 50% - congratulations. And in New Orleans, where they’ve done a terrific job, they’re down 65%.”
PRESIDENT TRUMP: “30 states have just one case or less per 1,000 people. Far fewer cases per capita, as an example, than Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Ireland, Switzerland, Singapore, Belgium, Spain, Norway, the Netherlands, Austria, Sweden.”
WORKING WITH GOVERNORS ON TESTING
PRESIDENT TRUMP: “Earlier today, Vice President Pence spoke with governors from all 50 states about our unified effort to defeat the virus … Prior to the call, we provided each governor with a list of the names, addresses, and phone numbers of the labs where they can find additional testing capacity within their state.”
PRESIDENT TRUMP: “Similar to the situation with ventilators, states need to assess their complete inventory of available capacity. Some states have far more capacity than they actually understand.”
VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: “Governors are continuing to expand testing and we assured them that we’re going to continue to work in every way to support their efforts to do just that.”
TESTING UPDATE
PRESIDENT TRUMP: “To date, the United States has conducted millions more tests than any other country. You can add them all up and they don’t catch us. And our numbers are doubling almost on a -- certainly on a monthly basis, but almost on a weekly basis, we’re moving very rapidly.”
PRESIDENT TRUMP: “We’ll be doubling our number of daily tests if the governors bring their states fully online through the capability that they have.”
PRESIDENT TRUMP: “As the experts have explained, this capacity is sufficient to allow states to conduct diagnostic testing to treat patients, as well as contact tracing to contain outbreaks and monitoring to pinpoint potential hot spots during phase one.”
DR. DEBORAH BIRX: “[Adm. Giroir and CMS Deputy Administrator Smith] have prepared to have everything ready for phase two. And preparing it now for what we will need in the future.”
ASSISTANT SECRETARY ADM. GIROIR: “There’s been over 40 million ‘[tests] in the marketplace.’ But we have an end to end issue that we needed to deal with and that’s what we’ve been dealing with: the swabs, the transport media. If we don’t have people utilizing the machines the way Dr. Birx is talking about -- we have some of our main platforms that are only 10% being utilized. You could have a lot of tests in the market and those are correct numbers, but if the machines aren’t utilizing them and they’re not organized at that level, then they’re not being utilized to its fullest.”
SUPPLIES OF MEDICAL EQUIPMENT
PRESIDENT TRUMP: “We have almost 10,000 [ventilators] in our federal reserve, our stockpile as they call it and we did a great job with the ventilators. Unfortunately, the press doesn’t cover it other than the fair press.”
PRESIDENT TRUMP: “My Administration also continues to support states with our massive operation to deliver masks, gowns, gloves and other vital supplies. Admiral Polowczyk and his team at [FEMA] are really — what a job they’ve done. … They’re using detailed data about supply chains to track the deployment of one billion pieces of protective equipment through private distributors every two weeks.”
PRESIDENT TRUMP: “We’ve also conducted major military operations providing cities and states with additional medical capacity and the incredible 1,800 men and women from the Army Corps of Engineers.”
LT. GEN. SEMONITE: “We’re actually executing 32 different facilities, that’s on the order of merit of about 16,000 beds. Eight of those are all done, we’ve still got a lot more to complete, and in the next week and a half, we’re going to complete about 15 more facilities.”
TREATMENTS AND THERAPEUTICS
PRESIDENT TRUMP: “There are now 72 active trials underway across the United States, researching dozens of therapies and treatments, and another 211 are in the planning stages … This includes their therapies designed to attack the virus, as well as others that would hinder its replication, reduce the rate of infection, control the immunity response, or transfer lifesaving antibodies from the blood of recovered patients.”
NEW FUNDING PACKAGE
PRESIDENT TRUMP: “My administration continues to press Congress to replenish the enormously successful Paycheck Protection Program, which has impacted 30 million American jobs. We hope to have an agreement very soon.”
PRESIDENT TRUMP: “We’re also pushing for the deal to include an additional $75 billion -- our deal that we’re talking about. $75 billion for hospitals and other health care providers.”
SUPPORT FOR HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS
PRESIDENT TRUMP: “HHS has also distributed the first 30 billion dollars in direct payments to a million health care providers across the country.”
PRESIDENT TRUMP: “We’ve also invested 1.4 billion dollars in community health centers to ensure our most vulnerable communities, including many African-American and Hispanic American communities have access to the services and testing that they need.”
OIL PRICES
PRESIDENT TRUMP: “Based on the record low price of oil that you’ve been seeing – it’s at a level that’s very interesting to a lot of people – we’re filling up our national petroleum reserves, strategic, and all the strategic reserves. And we’re looking to put as much as 75 million barrels into the reserves themselves.”

## Let us know if you trust Ned!
### Dear Alex,
Have you heard the latest?!
Governor Lamont and Democrat leaders recently announced their latest version of tolls, which now includes tolling only trucks (his original campaign plan). Do you believe that he will only tax trucks?
Do you believe Ned?
Last week, however, the U.S. Court of Appeals For the First Circuit dealt a blow to 'trucks only' tolling. Many people believe that if the courts ultimately decide that 'truck only' tolling is a violation of the interstate commerce clause of the U.S. Constitution, Legislative Democrats will just 'flip a switch' and toll all vehicles.
What do you think - will Ned Keep his promise or flip-flop (again) on his toll plan?
Tell us!
Sincerely,
J.R. Romano

"Connecticut Republicans are taking action!
View this email in your browser
Alex --
Are you concerned about voter fraud?
Connecticut's top election official doesn't seem concerned at all!
Partisan Democrat Denise Merrill has unleashed a nightmare by sending absentee ballot applications to every ""active"" enrolled voter in the state! That means every person on Connecticut's notoriously unreliable voter rolls - whether they moved or passed away, or are even eligible to vote in the first place \- is being encouraged to vote by mail.
Merrill has opened the door to MASSIVE voter fraud, laughing off the dire consequences of truckloads of untraceable votes.
With a tsunami of absentee ballots flooding our communities, Connecticut Republicans are taking unprecedented action. With the help of generous supporters like you, we are mobilizing the resources to keep our elections clean this year!
Here's what you did already, Alex:
With The Ballot Integrity Fund
Connecticut Republicans Are Already:
* REGISTERING 4,877 New Voters
* ENSURING Registrars Clean Up Voter Rolls
* ALERTING the Public to Potential Fraud
* PROTECTING OUR FAIR ELECTIONS!
FIGHT VOTER FRAUD
We are also launching a new Ballot Integrity Alert System to let citizens report suspicious election activity, dead voters, old or inaccurate information -- all in real time!
For the first time EVER, Connecticut Republicans are equipped to fight voter fraud head on.
But Alex, this monumental task isn't free.
We need to immediately recruit 72 new donors at $50 a piece or 144 new donors at $25 to make it happen!
Denise Merrill may not care about voter fraud, but I know you do! Reports are already flooding into our office about duplicate applications, dead voters, old addresses and a slew of other irregularities. I'm afraid without immediate action, we won't be able to get to the bottom of most of these problems before it's too late.
So tell me Alex. Are YOU invested in clean elections?
With so much at stake, I hope so.

View this email in your browser
Alex,
Have you already chipped in to help Brendan Saunders qualify for matching funds through the Citizens Election Program?
Brendan is our Republican candidate in the 33rd Senate District (Chester, Clinton, Colchester, Deep River, East Haddam, East Hampton, Essex, Haddam, Lyme, Portland, Westbrook and part of Old Saybrook). This district is currently held by limousine liberal Norm Needleman, a vulnerable incumbent who I know we can beat this year!
Let's send Brendan to the State Senate to fight back against Ned Lamont's big taxing, big spending agenda!
I just heard the campaign is only $1,500 short of their target to qualify!
Please join me in chipping in $5, $20, $50 or even $100 to push Brendan over the finish line TODAY!

PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP IS BEGINNING THE NEXT PHASE IN OUR FIGHT AGAINST CORONAVIRUS: GUIDELINES FOR OPENING UP AMERICA AGAIN
“All of American society is engaged and mobilized in the war against the invisible enemy. While we must remain vigilant, it is clear that our aggressive strategy is working.”
– President Donald J. Trump
BEGINNING THE NEXT PHASE IN THE FIGHT: President Donald J. Trump is continuing the fight against the coronavirus by beginning to reopen the country in a smart and safe way.
* The Trump Administration is issuing new guidelines to enable individual States to reopen in phases using a deliberate, data-driven approach.
* Under these guidelines, States will reopen one step at a time, rather than all at once.
* The guidelines will empower Governors to tailor the phased reopening to address the situation in their State.
* Governors can begin phased openings at the Statewide or county-by-county level.
* These guidelines were developed by the top medical experts from across the Government and are based on verifiable metrics regarding the situation on the ground.
* The guidelines set clear benchmarks on new cases, testing, and hospital resources for States to meet to proceed toward a phased reopening.
* Criteria include a downward trajectory in cases presenting coronavirus-like symptoms or a downward trajectory in positive tests.
* The criteria also included hospitals having the resources to treat all patients without crisis care and a robust testing program for healthcare workers.
CONTINUING TO PROTECT AMERICANS: These new guidelines represent the next phase in President Trump’s data-based approach to protect the health and wellbeing of Americans.
* Thanks to the commitment and sacrifices of Americans across the country, we have seen critical progress in flattening the curve.
* A long-term nationwide shutdown is not sustainable and would inflict wide-ranging harm on the health and wellbeing of our citizens.
* The President’s data-based approach will protect the health and safety of Americans while laying the groundwork for economic growth.
* These guidelines will allow healthy Americans to safely return to work as conditions allow while protecting seniors and other vulnerable Americans.
LEADING A HISTORIC MOBILIZATION: President Trump has led a historic mobilization to rapidly ramp up testing and the distribution of medical supplies.
* President Trump mobilized the full resources of the Government and the private sector to increase the production and distribution of supplies like masks and ventilators.
* President Trump utilized the Defense Production Act, and the private sector responded, with numerous companies stepping up to shift production to make medical supplies.
* The Administration launched Project Airbridge to airlift supplies to the United States from around the world.
* The President surged resources and personnel to assist healthcare providers on the frontlines.
* At the President’s direction, the military and FEMA stood up emergency medical sites around the country, and two naval ships were deployed to assist hospitals.
* President Trump has led an unprecedented effort to ramp up testing across the country.
* The Administration has provided emergency use authority for dozens of new commercial tests.
* The United States has now conducted more than 3.5 million tests – far more than any other country in the world.
* The Food and Drug Administration continues to authorize new antibody tests that will be critical as we move toward the next phase.
* Because of President Trump’s decisive early action, we have been able to get needed medical supplies to our healthcare workers on the frontlines and avoid deadly shortfalls.
* No American who has needed a ventilator has gone without one.
* States like New York, California, Washington, and Oregon have even been able to send extra ventilators to other areas that need them.

"Trump Team CT Needs Your Help
View this email in your browser
Alex -- Everywhere you go across Connecticut, you can see and feel record enthusiasm on our side.
But liberals want revenge, Alex! And they are doing whatever it takes to sneak their puppet Joe Biden into the White House to authorize the most radical left wing agenda in history.
The Washington Swamp is fully mobilized, waiting for patriotic men and women like you to sit back and let them pop champagne on Election Day. You won't let that happen, will you?
I'M READY TO FIGHT BACK
Republicans can achieve victory on November 3rd, ONLY if we are INVESTED and READY to take the fight to the Democrats.
When Liberal Insiders attack President Trump,
they are really attacking YOU!
I have authorized my team to completely empty out the store to channel our record breaking momentum, Alex. I want every supporter across Connecticut to step up and show off their Trump 2020 pride as we race down the final stretch of this historic campaign!
I'M READY TO MAKE HISTORY
So I'll close this important note by asking you this: Are you proud to be a Trump supporter? Are you willing to speak up for the achievements we made together? Are you invested in the fight against socialism and corruption?
If you answered YES to any one of those questions, then please stand up and help us make history by chipping in to support Team Trump Connecticut's VICTORY operations through this link.
Your support today means we can engage and mobilize voters across Connecticut between today and November 3rd. And you can look back at this moment and say, ""I helped when it mattered most.""
THANK YOU!

Ned Lamont Ignores Connecticut Leaders & Business Owners
What seems to be a common-sense approach that has been adopted by both Democrats and Republicans across the country has been completely thrown out the window by the Lamont administration to make room for a Boston consulting firm with the price tag of 2 Million dollars.
“It is a very rare day when the Connecticut Republican Party is urging Governor Ned Lamont to be more like his fellow Democrat governor, Andrew Cuomo of New York,” said Connecticut Republican Party Chairman J.R. Romano.
Governor Cuomo set up his several regional reopen teams making sure local Government officials are valued members of these teams. They know their regions very well because they represent them in government.
What is most appalling about this move and reckless spending is the fact that the Reopen Connecticut Advisory Committee Chair Indra Nooyi worked for the same Boston consulting firm in the early 1980s. A blatant example from Lamont Administration that during this unprecedented public health crisis their priorities are to make sure old political friendships are rewarded and are taken care of before the people of this state.
“The purposeful lack of local officials has made it obvious that Ned Lamont does not trust the people of Connecticut,"" said Chairman Romano. ""That’s why Connecticut Republican Party today calls on Governor Ned Lamont to remove the Boston consulting firm and to replace it with local leaders. Our local leaders know their communities because they serve their citizens every day and they know what decisions will work to keep them safe while getting our state back open.“
We have great legislators on the Public Health Committee in Hartford as well as countless medical professionals on both sides of the aisle serving in local and state government. It is time we call upon them to join the reopening team instead of people who do not have a stake in the game of keeping Connecticut safe.

____________________________________

* President Trump is working with Congress to secure additional funding for the critical Paycheck Protection Program.
* PRESIDENT TRUMP ON 4/20/20: “My administration continues to press Congress to replenish the enormously successful Paycheck Protection Program, which has impacted 30 million American jobs. We hope to have an agreement very soon.”
* The Paycheck Protection Program has already processed nearly $350 billion in loans to 1.6 million small businesses.
* PRESIDENT TRUMP ON 4/18/20: “Through the Paycheck Protection Program, we’ve already processed nearly $350 billion to 1.6 million small businesses across the nation to keep American workers on the payroll.”
KEEPING WORKERS EMPLOYED

* PRESIDENT TRUMP ON 4/18/20: “Amy Wright, from North Carolina, as an example, said the program is a ‘game changer’ for her and her family, it’s coffee shops. And she has 120 employees, many of whom have developmental and intellectual disabilities. And now they’re all staying, and they’re getting paid.”
* PRESIDENT TRUMP ON 4/18/20: “Scott and Julie Alderink helped lead a church and own a restaurant in South Dakota, with about 15 employees. They were already starting layoffs… But now they’ve hired their employees back, and they can keep the restaurant open.”

HIGHLIGHTS | President Trump and the Coronavirus Task Force Provide an Update to Americans
________________________________
SUSPENDING IMMIGRATION TO PROTECT AMERICAN WORKERS
PRESIDENT TRUMP: “In order to protect American workers, I will be issuing a temporary suspension of immigration into the United States.”
PRESIDENT TRUMP: “By pausing immigration, we’ll help put unemployed Americans first in line for jobs as America reopens. So important. It would be wrong and unjust for Americans laid off by the virus to be replaced with new immigrant labor flown in from abroad.”
PRESIDENT TRUMP: “This pause will be in effect for 60 days, after which the need for any extension or modification will be evaluated by myself and a group of people, based on economic conditions at the time.”
PRESIDENT TRUMP: “This order will only apply to individuals seeking a permanent residency, in other words, those receiving green cards. Big factor. Will not apply to those entering on a temporary basis.”
PRESIDENT TRUMP: “This pause on new immigration will also help to conserve vital medical resources to American citizens. A short break from new immigration, depending on the time we’re talking about, will protect the solvency of our healthcare system and provide relief to jobless Americans.”
NEW CORONAVIRUS RELIEF FUNDING
PRESIDENT TRUMP: “My administration has worked aggressively with Congress to negotiate this critical $482 billion funding package. We reached a deal that includes $382 billion in crucial small business support to keep workers on the payroll, $75 billion to aid hospitals, which really need the aid, and very badly. I’m very proud of that. And $25 billion to support coronavirus testing efforts.”
PRESIDENT TRUMP: “I urged the House to pass the bill and they are going to be voting on it, I imagine, very, very soon.”
SECRETARY MNUCHIN: “This also gives us $50 billion dollars for disaster loans – EIDL loans – that will allow the SBA to make $300 billion dollars of disaster loans all for small businesses.”
SEC. MNUCHIN: “I can tell you the [Paycheck Protection Program] so far is over 30 million jobs. And, and again, that doesn’t account for other money that we’ve sent out.”
CERTIFICATION FOR PAYCHECK PROTECTION PROGRAM
PRESIDENT TRUMP: “When I saw Harvard, they have a one of the largest endowments anywhere in the country, maybe in the world, I guess. They’re going to pay back that money.”
SECRETARY MNUCHIN: “I will comment there have been some big businesses that have taken [Paycheck Protection Program] loans. I was pleased to see that Shake Shack returned the money. We will be putting out some F.A.Q.s”
SECRETARY MNUCHIN: “Certain people on the [Paycheck Protection Program] may have not been clear in understanding the certification. So, we will give people the benefit of the doubt. We’re going to put an F.A.Q. out – explain this certification. If you pay back the loan right away, you won’t have liability to the SBA and to Treasury. But, there are severe consequences for people who don’t attest properly to this certification.”
GUIDELINES ON OPENING UP AMERICA
PRESIDENT TRUMP: “Thanks to our aggressive campaign against the virus and the extraordinary talent of our medical professionals, our mortality rate remains roughly half of that of many other countries and one of the lowest of any country in the world.”
PRESIDENT TRUMP: “Since we announced our guidelines on opening up America … 20 states, representing 40% of the U.S. population, have announced they’re making plans and preparations to safely restart their economies in the very near future.”
DR. DEBORAH BIRX: “So, we really want to call people’s attention, again, to the guidelines. We are continuing to see outbreaks in nursing homes and in confined spaces, and I think as Americans we want to stop that, and we have the ability to do that by really paying attention to the guidelines that were to be in all three phases.”
VENTILATORS
PRESIDENT TRUMP: “Today, Vice President Pence visited the hard working men and women of General Electric Healthcare in Madison, Wisconsin, who are working three shifts a day to quadruple their production of ventilators.”
PRESIDENT TRUMP: “GE is also working with Ford to make 50,000 ventilators in the next 100 days, more than our entire country typically produces in a very long period of time.”
PRESIDENT TRUMP: “I said from the beginning that no American who needs a ventilator would be denied a ventilator and we have kept that promise all over the United States.”
WORKING WITH NEW YORK
PRESIDENT TRUMP: “Earlier today, I had a very productive meeting with Governor Cuomo, as you probably saw, to discuss his statewide testing strategy and how we can work together to help expand it with the goal of doubling testing in the next few weeks.”
PRESIDENT TRUMP: “New York State will be continuing to control the testing of their citizens and will also manage their state and local laboratories.”
PRESIDENT TRUMP: “The Federal government will work along with the state on the national manufacturers and distributors. Together, we’ll all work together to help them secure additional tests and we hope that this model will work with the other states as well.”
PRESIDENT TRUMP: “I’ve asked Andrew if we could bring the Comfort back to its base in Virginia so that we can have it for other locations, and he said we would be able to do that.”
UPDATE ON TESTING
PRESIDENT TRUMP: “The FDA has now authorized more than 50 diagnostic tests including, as of late last night, the first test that a patient can take home … LabCorp intends to make the home collection kits available to consumers in most states with a doctor’s order.”
PRESIDENT TRUMP: “In the coming weeks, we also have four different antibody tests already authorized. Tests will help identify individuals who can donate convalescent plasma, thus providing potentially life-saving antibodies to American patients.”
FDA COMMISSIONER HAHN: “The antibody tests are just one piece of the larger response that you’ve heard in the America returning to work plan that the President has -- with the task force – has developed.”
FDA COMMISSIONER HAHN: “We’ve authorized four applications for antibody tests and 140 test developers are pursuing applications for us as we speak.”
PHASE FOUR LEGISLATION
PRESIDENT TRUMP: “We mentioned briefly the state aid. We talked about that, Governor Cuomo and myself, and I agree with him on that, and I think most Republicans agree too, and Democrats. And that’s part of phase four.”
SECRETARY MNUCHIN: “I very much appreciate the President’s support for phase four. He put out a Tweet. As the President said, we look forward to phase four would be infrastructure … roads, bridges, broadband – especially broadband now to rural America is very important. We’ve talked about incentives for restaurants, sports, entertainment, because these businesses have been impacted. The President has talked multiple times about a payroll tax cut. And we’ve also – we are talking about in the case of states, the states we have heard from the governors and the fiscal issues of the state.”

Alex --
Do not be confused by Joe Courtney's soft demeanor. He represents a party with radical leftist, socialist ideology which is bad for the 2nd Congressional District and the entire country. His leader is Nancy Pelosi. My leader is you, The People.
I am running to represent our Connecticut voters, regardless of party affiliation.
My life in public service taught me that good ideas can come from anywhere. Our fundamental beliefs are worth fighting for, Alex.
As your Representative, I will ALWAYS:
*** FIGHT Nancy Pelosi, The Squad, and all other extremists
*** PROTECT Your 2nd Amendment Rights
*** FOCUS on locally important issues, like crumbling foundations and reviving a broken economy!
I Will Help Justin
I am asking for the good men and women of Connecticut's 2nd Congressional District to help fuel this grassroots campaign as we enter the final stretch.
Our future is so important, I resigned from my full-time job working for the military, to address the new battlefront for America's future. With your help, I will go to Washington to accomplish my next mission: Ensure the real values of Connecticut are heard and represented throughout the nation.
I Have Justin's Back!
I'm in this campaign to fight for you, Alex.
Can I count on you to Cover My Six with a contribution before midnight?
Thank you for your support!
Sincerely,
Justin Anderson
Father, Veteran, Candidate for Congress
P.S. -- Every Dime from this email is being invested in our Get Out The Vote MACHINE!
If you support my mission and want to see real results on November 3rd, then I need you to answer this call to action with an investment of $25, $50, $100 or whatever you can afford to chip in! We can achieve victory if patriotic supporters like you are willing to put your own skin in the game. . . but with limited time, we have some critical investments to make right away. Our future is in your hands!
Thanks again! -- Justin

This is not good Alex! Even though dozens of supporters stepped up to fund our digital operations, we are still $382 short before we can go live with ads in 3 more State Senate Districts TOMORROW!
Is [[EMAIL_REDACTED]] still the best email address to get in touch with you?
Here's the link to help us reach as many voters as possible over the next 72 hours: [[URL REDACTED]]
Could you spare a moment to help us out?
THANK YOU!

Dear Alex --
Between now and Election Day, all of the 2020 action that matters is happening online.
With hundreds of thousands of ballots being sent across the state as you read this email, there is no time to waste. That's why Connecticut Republicans are leaping into action with the most aggressive and targeted digital voter contact campaign EVER!
We have mobilized our digital and data team to target 8 key State Senate races, along with 29 key State House races which are all up for grabs on November 3rd.
Because of the support of investors like you, we are raising the resources to make:
300,000 Live Voter Calls
745,000 Voter Robocalls
600,000 Get Out The Vote Texts
1,250,000 Digital Ad Impressions
750,000 Absentee Ballot Reminders
That's the good news, Alex.
The BAD NEWS is that if our most dedicated supporters like you refuse to answer this call, Republicans are destined to fall short of every one of our benchmarks.
With so many races expected to come down to razor-close margins this year, I hope I don't have to explain how important it is that we meet or exceed our fundraising and digital targets, starting by midnight tonight!
So please, choose your preferred investment opportunity by clicking one of the buttons above or through this link to make sure Connecticut Republicans have the resources it will take to fight and win the most high tech election in history.
THANK YOU!
Sincerely,
J.R. Romano

Alex,
The Connecticut House of Representatives just voted to strip law enforcement officers of legal protections which help them do their tough jobs without fear of massive legal bills.
Now the anti-police bill is headed for the state senate, where Democrats will have one more opportunity to correct their public policy mess before it becomes law.
There's only ONE way to stop this bad bill from becoming law, Alex...
Democrat senators need to hear from their constituents, right away!
>> CALL THEM OUT <<
The media won't hold Democrats accountable, so Connecticut Republicans WILL!
We are immediately activating a massive response team of concerned citizens calling and texting Democrat senators, demanding to know one simple thing:
""Do Democrats Back the Blue?""
We need your help to get the word out!
If voters put enough pressure on their elected Democrat senators to do the right thing, we can STOP anti-cop legal actions from becoming law in Connecticut.
If you back the blue Alex, I need you with me in this fight.
Don't let Democrats make our streets more dangerous, with anti-cop laws that discourage good men and women from entering public service.
>> CALL THEM OUT <<
Thank you!

Dear Alex:
Recently my friend David X. Sullivan stepped forward and by unanimous vote at his convention
became the Republican Nominee for the 5th Congressional District of Connecticut.
I wasn’t surprised. I know David; he’s a distinguished former career federal prosecutor and I
can tell you he has a sterling reputation as someone who works hard.
Much to our good fortune, he’s now ready to go to work to win this election and fight for us in
Washington!
>> Help David Win! <<
Look -- we can win this race. I hear every day from frustrated residents who want to be
represented by a common sense Republican like David.
But, it won’t be easy. Make no mistake, David’s opponent and the Washington Democrats are
busy raising boatloads of money and are well organized. For his campaign to be successful he
also needs a strong grassroots organization!
He needs to get his message out. Mail, radio, television – that all requires funds.
That’s where we come in. We all have to invest in David. Because he’s investing himself in us.
I know that we are a party that is comprised of people who help one another. Let’s do our part
now to help David. Please click here to make a contribution to David X. Sullivan’s exciting
campaign today. And let’s send a Republican to Washington from Connecticut’s 5th
Congressional District!
Let’s do this!
Sue

## Unnecessary Threats
Southington– Chairman of the Connecticut Republican Party J.R. Romano announced today the party received a threatening message from Mr. Timothy Withington who also serves as the Emergency Management Director for the Town of Killingworth.
""The media and democrats have been whipping their supporters up over a volunteer recruitment email the Connecticut Republican Party sent out last week. Democrats have created a false narrative to score political points that now has their party members making threats"" said Chairman Romano.
The conversation is included in the below screen shots:
""We hope the town would reconsider such a position for Mr. Withington who has failed to demonstrate the ability to protect all members of his community"" continued Chairman Romano. ""We are calling on the Connecticut Democratic Party, Senator Christine Cohen, Candidate for State Representative Christine Goupil, and First Selectwoman Catherine Iino to condemn these threats.""

Alex --
Yesterday I sent you an important email about our new dedicated fund to send a Republican Senator to Washington (see below if you missed it).
I cannot stress enough how important it is that you answer this call to action with a contribution to the Senate Nominee Fund. Even $5 or $10 will show you are committed to helping President Trump drain the swamp.
If you usually give, please give now. If you NEVER give, please give now.
Your contribution today means that our eventual candidate has a pool of money to tap into on Day 1 of the next Senate campaign. It will be a game changer that the Democrats don't even see coming.

Contribute to our US Senate Nominee Fund
Alex,
While President Trump is hard at work on behalf of the American People, America's two worst senators are equally busy grabbing headlines for all all the wrong reasons.
This week we learned Chris Murphy probably violated the Logan Act when he snuck behind the State Department's back to conduct his own foreign policy blitz with Iran.
To end the madness, we have to Drain The DC Swamp of bad actors like Chris Murphy and Dick Blumenthal!
GREAT NEWS \-- Connecticut just launched our US Senate Nominee Fund, setting aside a special pool of money specifically for the purpose of sending a REPUBLICAN to the US Senate to replace these swamp creatures.
Will you be an early investor with a commitment of $25 or more, right away?
This special fund is dedicated to one cause: WINNING!
But we can't do it without you.
Help strengthen our GOP Senate Majority.
Help send President Trump more allies.
Help us Drain The DC Swamp!

What You Need To Know | President Trump Is Demanding Accountability From The WHO
____________________________________
“I will never hesitate to take any necessary steps to protect the lives, health, and safety of the American people. I will always put the well-being of America first.” – President Trump
ACCOUNTABILITY FOR AMERICAN TAXPAYERS: President Donald J. Trump is holding the World Health Organization (WHO) accountable by putting a hold on United States funding.
* President Trump is placing a hold on all funding to the WHO while its mismanagement of the coronavirus pandemic is investigated.
* The American taxpayers provide $400 million to $500 million in funding to the WHO each year, but the WHO has failed them.
* China, on the other hand, provides just around one-tenth of the funding that the United States provides.
* The American people deserve better from the WHO, and no more funding will be provided until its mismanagement, cover-ups, and failures can be investigated.
* President Trump will continue fighting the coronavirus outbreak and will redirect global health aid to others directly engaged in the fight.
INVESTIGATING THE WHO’S FAILED RESPONSE: The WHO’s response to the coronavirus outbreak has been filled with one misstep and cover-up after another.
* Despite the fact that China provides just a small fraction of the funding that the United States does, the WHO has shown a dangerous bias towards the Chinese government.
* The WHO repeatedly parroted the Chinese government’s claims that the coronavirus was not spreading between humans, despite warnings by doctors and health officials that it was.
* Taiwan contacted the WHO on December 31 after seeing reports of human-to-human transmission of the coronavirus, but the WHO kept it from the public.
* The WHO praised the Chinese government’s response throughout January and claimed there was no human-to-human transmission, despite the fact that doctors in Wuhan were warning there was.
* The WHO decided on January 22 that the coronavirus did not pose a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, all while praising China’s response.
* The WHO put political correctness over life-saving measures by opposing travel restrictions.
* The WHO made the disastrous decision to oppose travel restrictions from China and other countries—despite applauding travel restrictions within China itself—leading to further spread of the virus internationally.
STRUCTURAL ISSUES AND NECESSARY REFORMS: The WHO has longstanding structural issues that must be addressed before the organization can be trusted again.
* The WHO has shown it was not prepared to prevent, detect, and respond to a severe infectious disease crisis like this.
* The WHO lacks the structure to ensure accurate information and transparent data sharing from members, which makes it vulnerable to misinformation and political influence.
* The United States seeks to refocus the WHO on fulfilling its core missions of preparedness, response, and stakeholder coordination.
* The United States is also calling for reforms to promote transparency and data sharing, hold member states accountable for abiding by the International Health Regulations, increase access to medicines, and counter China’s outsized influence on the organization.

Good morning,
As a result of the Trump Administration’s efforts, the Paycheck Protection Program is effectively providing a lifeline to America’s small businesses and their employees during the COVID-19 pandemic.
* Since the launch of the Paycheck Protection Program, SBA has processed over 3.8 million loans for more than half a trillion dollars of economic support in less than one month.
* Nearly 500,000 of the PPP loans were made by lenders with less than $1 billion in assets and non-bank lenders.
* President Trump secured an additional $320 billion in funding to ensure a second round of PPP relief would be accessible for America’s small businesses. In the second round of the Paycheck Protection Program:
* 2.2 million loans have been processed, worth more than $175 billion.
* The average loan is $79,000, exhibiting that PPP is truly aiding the smallest of small businesses.
* Please click here for more information: PPP Report: Second Round
Additionally, SBA will begin accepting new Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) and EIDL Advance applications to provide relief to U.S. agricultural businesses. Eligible agricultural businesses may apply for the Loan Advance here.
Today, the President departs Washington, D.C., en route to Phoenix, AZ at 10:20am ET. The President participates in a Roundtable Discussion on Supporting Native Americans at 12:00pm MST and later participates in a tour and delivers remarks at Honeywell International Inc. at 1:15pm ET. The President departs Phoenix, AZ en route to Washington, D.C. at 2:20pm MST and arrives back to the White House at 9:30pm ET.

________________________________

Alex --
You know that America can't afford the Biden-Harris extreme left wing agenda. . .
But what you might NOT know -- yet -- is what your Connecticut Republican Party is doing to stop these extremists in their tracks.
While the radical left has been hard at work completing their takeover of the Democrat Party, we have been assembling a massive data and digital operation to shine a light on their anti-growth, anti-prosperity, anti-freedom agenda.
With radical Kamala Harris on the ticket, Joe Biden can no longer pretend he'll be a ""moderate"" president to unite the country. The radical left is using Sleepy Joe as their puppet to push through the $93 TRILLION Green New Deal, impose job crushing regulations on our businesses and keep our borders wide open to dangerous criminals and drug traffickers alike.
Alex if Joe Biden and Kamala Harris win on November 3rd, then YOU lose.
>> DON'T LET THEM WIN <<
This Sunday the president's team will ask how many invested supporters we have in Connecticut, and we know you'll want your name included in that tally!
* LIMITED TIME OFFER *
EXCLUSIVELY for email subscribers like you: Answer this call to action right away with a minimum contribution, and we will rush you a brand new Trump 2020 Bumper Sticker to show the world you oppose the far left's radical agenda.
So please, chip in $10, $25, even $45 to show our 45th President Donald J. Trump that you have his back in the urgent campaign to Make America Great Again and keep it that way!
Put your name on the line against socialism.
Put your name on the line against open borders.
Put your name on the line FOR freedom, FOR law enforcement, FOR America.
With patriots like you on our side, we can keep radical leftism out of the White House for at least another Four More Years!
So, tell us. Are YOU invested in victory?

The Trump Administration Is Supporting the People of Connecticut
Updated August 17, 2020
“We have the best doctors, the best military leaders, and the best logistics professionals anywhere in the world. And we’re orchestrating a massive Federal response unlike anything our country has ever seen.”
– President Donald J. Trump
Overview: Response and recovery efforts are locally executed, State managed, and Federally supported. Successful emergency management requires nationwide cooperation and unity of effort, combining the strength and ingenuity of our citizens and private sector with a sweeping, all-inclusive, and whole-of-government response. The below is a partial overview of Federal assistance provided to the State of Connecticut and the people of Connecticut to combat the Coronavirus. The information is bolstered by hundreds of additional actions by the Federal government to help the people of Connecticut. President Donald J. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence have appreciated the strong State-Federal partnership with Governor Ned Lamont and other State, local, and Tribal leaders in Connecticut.
 The President quickly approved Connecticut’s major disaster declaration on March 28, 2020 and National Guard funding requests on March 30, 2020 providing additional Federal resources to supplement State response efforts.
 This year, over 250 K N-95 masks, 960 K surgical & procedural masks, 200 K eye and face shields, 110 K isolation & surgical gowns, and 3.4 M medical gloves have been shipped to Connecticut through private sector, State, and Federal collaboration.
 The Federal government has directly supported 8 community based testing sites in Connecticut and will be providing over 400,000 swabs and 400,000 media to support state testing needs in the month of August.
 The Federal government coordinated the surge of supplemental personal protective equipment to all Connecticut Medicaid & Medicare certified nursing homes. And to supplement private sector supplies, the federal government is coordinating the provision of point-of-care COVID-19 testing to specified Connecticut Medicaid & Medicare certified nursing homes.
 Deployed a Battelle Critical Care Decontamination System to Connecticut that can decontaminate up to 80,000 N-95 masks daily.
 Coordinated donation of 352 cases (40 vials per case) of Remdesivir and 43 cases of commercially available Remdesivir to treat hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Connecticut.
 Medical facilities and providers in the State of Connecticut have received over $1.5 B in COVID-19 related allocations from HHS. This includes more than $1.2 B from the CARES Act Provider Relief Fund to support healthcare-related expenses or lost revenue attributable to COVID-19 and ensures uninsured Americans can get testing and treatment for COVID-19.
 The State of Connecticut and eligible local governments received over $1.3 B from the CARES Act’s Coronavirus Relief Fund (CRF) to help address unforeseen financial needs and risks created by the COVID-19 public health emergency. Tribal governments received over $119.7 M in CRF funding.
 The Small Business Administration has issued over $6.7 B in loans to over 60 K Connecticut small businesses.
 The U.S. Department of the Treasury has made 1.6 M Economic Impact Payments totaling more than $2.6 B to hardworking taxpayers of Connecticut.
 The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has made over $95.1 M in COVID-19 funding available to Connecticut grantees via CARES Act authorizations to help America’s low-income families and most vulnerable citizens.
 The U.S. Department of Education provided $141.3 M to support postsecondary education students and institutions of higher education in Connecticut, authorized $27.9 M for the State from the Governor’s Emergency Education Relief Fund, and $111.1 M to ensure learning continues for all elementary and secondary students.
 The U.S. Department of Transportation allocated more than $489.1 M to help the Connecticut public transportation systems and $30.3 M to help Connecticut airport.

Tonight, as Rosh Hashanah begins, we wish a L'Shana Tova to our friends in the Jewish Community as they celebrate the beginning of a New Year, 5781. The past year has brought challenges and triumphs that were unimaginable just a year ago: the challenge of the Corona virus pandemic and the triumph of Israel signing the Abraham Accords with two Arab countries, the UAE and Bahrain, and also establishing diplomatic relations with two other countries: Serbia and Kosovo.
We pray to the Lord for healing and good health for all who are suffering with the virus today. We ask Him to bless and sustain the People of the United States of America, Israel and all countries of our world with good health, strength and knowledge to find the cures and preventive vaccines for this scourge in order to eliminate it forever from our Earth. We beseech Him to enable our world to recover physically, spiritually and economically so that Humanity can once again thrive, prosper and improve our world for for our children, grandchildren and generations to come,
Thank you, President Trump, for your strategic vision, leadership and steadfast support for Israel which enabled the Peace agreements which we have witnessed this week to happen. We pray that in this case Peace becomes contagious and spreads throughout the world so that in the coming year, 5781, the words of Isaiah will come to fruition:
“And they shall beat their swords into plowshares, And their spears into pruning hooks; Nation shall not lift up sword against nation, Neither shall they learn war anymore.”
We wish you a Happy, Sweet and Healthy New Year that brings you and your families much joy, peace and wonderful moments together.
May you be inscribed in the book of life for a good seal.
Sincerely,
JR Romao Leora R. Levy John H. Frey

"Alex,
Did you know that Connecticut is one of only 13 states in the country that guarantees the right to an abortion by state law? Even if Roe v. Wade is overturned, that right will persist here in Connecticut.
But now that Republicans have solidified a conservative U.S. Supreme Court majority, millions of women across the country — mostly women of color — are at risk, and they’re counting on us to vote Republicans out of office next week.
The future of women’s rights, healthcare, climate change, and our democracy are at stake right now. With just days left until Election Day, can you donate to help the Connecticut Democratic Party ensure that Democrats win BIG on Tuesday?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will process immediately:
EXPRESS DONATE $10
EXPRESS DONATE $25
EXPRESS DONATE $50
EXPRESS DONATE $100
DONATE ANOTHER AMOUNT
2020 began with more than 200 Republican members of Congress calling on the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade.
Now that three Trump-appointees sit on the Court, Republicans have never been closer to making their wish come true. Next week, we must vote all of them out.
Donate $10 now to help Connecticut Democrats raise the $20,000 we need before October ends to fund our final GOTV push. It’s all hands on deck, and if we come together we will succeed.

"Hi Alex,
Connecticut is on track to soon meet the seven criteria necessary to begin the first phase of reopening our state’s businesses and workplaces.
This does not mean that everything will suddenly be back to normal, but it does mean that our collective efforts to flatten the curve are working. I hope that you and your entire family are safe, and I want to thank you for everything you’ve done to help protect your neighbors.
COVID-19 has presented our state and our country with unprecedented challenges, and I am deeply proud of the way folks in Connecticut have responded to this moment. This week is National Nurses Week, and I want to take a moment to celebrate the courage and dedication of Connecticut's nurses.
Alex, providing care to COVID-19 patients is incredibly grueling. More than 9,000 patients have been hospitalized in Connecticut to date, and more than 5,400 have been discharged. Nurses, along with doctors and other health care providers and staff, are working around the clock in extremely difficult conditions to save lives.
Fueled by deep compassion and unyielding dedication, these health care professionals are permanently impacting the lives of thousands of families across our state. As I told nurses at Saint Francis Hospital in Hartford this week, ""each and every one of you are called for this moment, each and every one of you is stepping up.""
I cannot thank our nurses and other health care workers enough, and I hope that this week you will join me in expressing gratitude to these inspiring heroes.
This week is also Teacher Appreciation Week, and I’d like to use this opportunity to express gratitude to some other Connecticut heroes today.
As every parent of school-age children can attest to, adapting to remote learning has presented families and students with a number of new challenges. Despite the logistical hurdles and incredible difficulty of managing a virtual classroom, Connecticut’s teachers are keeping our students connected and engaged with their education.
For many parents, including those who are newly working from home, this crisis has been a stark reminder of exactly how much work educators do every day for our children. Please join me in thanking Connecticut’s teachers for everything that they do.
“Essential workers” is a phrase we’ve heard a lot in the past couple of months. Nurses, doctors, and teachers are widely understood as being essential parts of any healthy modern society.
But this crisis has revealed that many of the essential work that we all depend on to live our lives does not receive the recognition it deserves. Grocery store workers, delivery workers, USPS workers, restaurant and transportation workers — all of these jobs and more have emerged as fundamental to the functioning of our economy.
This month began with International Workers' Day, and it’s important that in addition to celebrating nurses and teachers, we also honor all of the essential workers that are helping us through this crisis.
So Alex, join me in saying thank you to Connecticut’s nurses, teachers, and all essential workers for protecting our families and neighbors every day.
We must never forget the sacrifices that all of these heroes have made, and we must commit to honoring their essential work both today and once this crisis is behind us.
Thank you all, and please stay safe!

"Alex,
Last week, I announced that I will be stepping down as Chair of the Connecticut Democratic Party as of June 10th.
Today, as Connecticut Democrats prepare to elect my successor, I want to let you know what an honor it has been to serve in this role since 2019.
I am so grateful to Governor Ned Lamont for giving me this opportunity to serve. Throughout my decades of service in Connecticut politics I have met so many incredible Democrats, and I’ve been lucky to have such an amazing career. I hope to continue supporting Connecticut Democrats by stepping into Nancy DiNardo’s role on the DNC.
Alex, I’m very proud of what Connecticut Democrats have accomplished in the past 18 months.
Thanks to our hard-won Democratic trifecta, last year Governor Lamont signed the most comprehensive paid family and medical leave law in the entire country, and we raised Connecticut’s minimum wage to $15 an hour. We’ve taken major steps forward on a wide variety of issues including debt-free community college, common sense gun safety, clean energy, and police accountability.
This is an extraordinary election year, Alex, and it isn’t just about defeating Donald Trump on November 3rd.
I believe in a world founded on freedom of speech, freedom of worship, freedom from want, and freedom from fear. Today, millions of Americans are unable to live without fear — fear of when their next paycheck will arrive, if their family can afford health care or to pay their rent or mortgage, and of a justice system that targets people because of their skin color.
Connecticut Democrats are mobilizing for progress on all of these issues, and although there is a lot of work that remains ahead of us, I believe that if we continue working together we will succeed in creating a more just and equitable world for every American.
Thank you for everything, Alex, and let’s keep in touch!

If Democrats begin organizing now, we can create another Blue Wave this year that:
* Sweeps Donald Trump out of the White House
* Expands Democrats’ majority in the U.S. House
* Ends the GOP’s majority in the U.S. Senate
* Solidifies our Democratic majorities here in Connecticut
All of this is possible, but only if we have support from grassroots donors like you.

Once you get your ballot application, fill it out and send it back as soon as possible.
After submitting your application, expect your actual ballot to arrive in early October. Then you can fill it out and drop it off in your town's drop box (usually at your Town or City Hall).

"Alex, the COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically affected our ability to organize for Democrats in Connecticut. With our team unable to host in-person volunteer trainings, organizing events, and fundraisers, we might not reach our quarterly fundraising goal.
The Bad News: If we don’t reach this goal before midnight tonight, we’ll have to make cuts for our next quarterly budget.
The Good News: We still have time to get there — and right now we only need about 50 more donations to reach this critical goal.

I’m a Connecticut Democrat. As Chair of the CT Democratic Party, I believe in a world founded on freedom of speech, freedom of worship, freedom from want, and freedom from fear.
That’s what I work for every day. But as our state and our country face the COVID-19 pandemic head-on, millions of Americans are now unable to live without fear — fear of when their next paycheck will arrive, if their family can afford health care, or to pay their rent or mortgage.
This is why Democrats must mobilize. President Trump has thoroughly proven that he’s incapable of leadership, and that he’s more focused on self-promotion than protecting American lives. Yet his Republican allies continue to support him — a Connecticut GOP leader in Stamford recently claimed that the pandemic is “overblown.”
This rhetoric is irresponsible, and President Trump’s behavior is downright dangerous. CT Dems are organizing to ensure that Democrats win up and down the ballot this November because we need real leadership now more than ever — but we can’t do this important work without your support.
Can you chip in to support the CT Democratic Party before tonight’s end-of-quarter fundraising deadline? We’re still about 100 donations short of reaching our goal — and now that all of our work has gone digital, we can’t afford to miss this goal.
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will process immediately:

Democrats must mobilize to ensure that not only is Donald Trump defeated in November, but that Democrats up and down the ballot succeed too. We can do this, but not without the proper resources.
With all of our fundraising digital-only, supporting candidates, training volunteers, and holding elections now all relies upon us raising enough funds to support our quarterly budget. That is why your online support matters now more than ever.
Any amount that you can contribute would make a huge difference — and if you donate $100 or more, we’ll send you a CT Dems “This Is Why I Mobilize” shirt to show our appreciation!

Thank you for your support, Alex.

"Alex, we need a women's revolution Connecticut Democrats
When women join forces, big things happen. Today is International Women’s Day, and that’s exactly what this day is all about — women joining forces to make progress happen.
Alex, we need a women’s revolution.
I originally founded the Connecticut Democratic Party’s Women’s Caucus to serve as a place for women to get the tools and support they needed to get involved in the political process.
I want to make sure that little girls growing up in Connecticut never believe that their gender will stand in the way of them achieving their dreams.
That’s why I’m inviting you to join me on Saturday, March 28th at 10 a.m. ET at the Connecticut State Central HQ in Hartford for an organizing meeting of the Connecticut Democratic Party’s Women’s Caucus. RSVP here if you can join:
RSVP
15 years ago when I first got involved in politics, I was constantly told to talk to a man when I asked for advice. Alex, if we want to get to an equal world, enabled women need to enable other women.
I’m more than ready for that equal world — are you?
RSVP here to join the CT Democratic Party’s Women’s Caucus organizing meeting where we will get to work organizing and strategizing for the road ahead.

"Alex,
Yesterday, Donald Trump’s Postmaster General — and donor — Louis DeJoy testified before the U.S. Senate about his attempt to sabotage the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) to help Trump win re-election.
He promised that absentee ballots would be given top priority, and that there was no need for concern.
We want to see action that ensures the survival of the USPS past Election Day.
We cannot let Trump’s administration shut down the USPS. Sign our petition to demand that Congress save the USPS:
Save the USPS
The House will vote today on a $25 billion package to save one of our country’s most beloved institutions. But Mitch McConnell has indicated that he won’t bring any relief bills up for a vote in the Senate.
That is unacceptable.
Getting rid of the post office is not a new idea for Republicans. Trump and his cronies have been working to defund or privatize the USPS for years. It doesn’t matter to them that we’re living through the worst pandemic in a century — they want to end the USPS as we know it.
Connecticut's Congressional delegation is fighting to secure emergency funding to save the USPS — but they need your help. They can’t do it alone.
Add your name today to demand that Congressional and Senate Republicans vote to fund the people’s postal service:
Save the USPS

"Mobilizing Democrats has never been more difficult or more important Connecticut Democrats
Alex, every new day of this pandemic has revealed further evidence of why Donald Trump is dangerously unfit to lead our country.
Now that Joe Biden is the presumptive 2020 Democratic presidential nominee, it’s time to focus on doing the work necessary to defeat Trump.
Mobilizing Democrats means hosting volunteer training events, registering voters, and organizing volunteer actions. But COVID-19 has limited our ability to do this important work — it has also limited our ability to raise funds in order to pay for all of it.
Alex, that’s why I’m reaching out. Can you chip in to ensure that the CT Democratic Party has the resources we need to mobilize for Democratic victories this year? Any amount that you can contribute would make a huge difference.
Donald Trump has not let the pandemic get in the way of campaigning for his re-election.
He’s using his daily press briefings to spread propaganda on national television, and his administration delayed releasing stimulus checks to the American people so that his signature could appear on them.
While Trump does everything possible to sidestep blame and pretend to be a hero, Democratic leaders like Governor Ned Lamont are doing the real work to keep us safe. This is precisely why our work mobilizing Democrats to get out the vote for candidates up and down the ballot matters so much.
With all of our fundraising digital-only, your online support matters now more than ever. Your contribution will ensure that we can continue organizing for Democrats in the weeks and months ahead to defeat Donald Trump in November. Chip in now to help Democrats win:

"Alex,
We need to do everything we can to defeat Donald Trump this November — but that won’t be enough.
To root out corruption and make our country work for everyone, not just the rich and powerful, we need to defeat Trump’s Republican enablers up and down the ballot. We need to elect Democrats who will fight for working people at every level of government.
And the Connecticut Democratic Party is on the front lines of that fight. With just weeks left until November 3 and voters casting their ballots every day, it’s never been more vital to do everything we can to make sure Democrats win BIG.
CT Dems need to raise $50,000 before October to make sure that Democrats across the state can reach voters before absentee voting begins. If you can, please donate $10 or whatever you can right now to help Democrats win in Connecticut.

Right now, Republican leaders in Connecticut are cheering on Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell as they get ready to steal another Supreme Court seat.
It’s a desperate attempt by Donald Trump and Republicans to impose their will on the American people — a will that doesn’t represent who we are or the country we want to be.
So we need to fight back.
We need to get organized and elect Democrats up and down the ballot, from the Connecticut legislature to the White House. It’s the only way to stop the GOP’s blatant corruption.
This is the most important election we have ever faced. If you’re able to, please chip in $10 to make sure the Connecticut Democratic Party has the resources they need to win. Together, we can protect our democracy.
Thanks for being a part of this,
Elizabeth

Tonight, we’ll see the startling contrast between two visions for our country when Kamala Harris and Mike Pence take the debate stage. We know Pence will go to the mat for Trump and defend their administration’s worst policies.
But here’s the thing: Kamala will remind us of what we can have again — competent, compassionate leadership in Washington.

Alex —
It's been seven years since Connecticut lost twenty-six lives to a senseless act of gun violence in Sandy Hook.
We lost six adults and twenty children that day. Today, those children would be in 8th grade, and those educators would be preparing to enjoy the holiday season with their families.

James Blake was born in New York, but he grew up here in Connecticut. He started playing tennis at five, and was inspired to pursue a professional career after hearing a speech by Arthur Ashe.
In 2015, James was thrown to the ground, handcuffed, and arrested by a plainclothes New York City cop who said he believed James was a suspect of interest.
He has used that experience to take an active stand on police brutality against minorities. James' experience is particularly meaningful today, as we all look for a path forward.

Hi Alex —
The United States Postal Service (USPS) has always served an invaluable function in our country. Every day, millions of Americans rely on the people’s postal service for their life-saving medications and other critical packages.
Sadly, the Trump administration has rejected stimulus money aimed at keeping the post office open. Now, officials believe that the USPS could shut down as early as June.
Let’s not forget, the USPS is even more critical now that we’re in the middle of a pandemic — especially as many states move to enact vote-by-mail programs to ensure that your right to vote in this year’s elections is not limited by this health crisis.

These are essential workers who are risking their lives to ensure that Americans receive groceries, prescriptions, census forms, and now in many states, ballots.
We need to do our part to protect this invaluable American service. Add your name now to demand that the USPS is fully protected.
Getting rid of the post office is not a new idea for Republicans. Trump and his cronies have been working to defund or privatize the USPS for years. They are counting on your apathy.
Members of the Connecticut Congressional delegation like Jim Himes and Rosa DeLauro understand the USPS’s importance and are working to protect these essential workers.
But they need your help — can you step up and demand that Trump and congressional Republicans fund the people’s postal service?
Save the USPS
Thank you for protecting the people’s postal service,

"We need to be prepared with the resources necessary to defeat the GOP Connecticut Democrats
Hi Alex — did you hear this? A Republican running for Congress in Connecticut’s 5th district was visited by the FBI due to his involvement in the Trump Ukraine scandal. Regardless, he’s still trying to unseat Jahana Hayes this November.
Let’s be clear: President Trump has inspired countless Republicans who are not fit for public office to launch campaigns across the country, even here in Connecticut.
We need to be prepared NOW with the resources to beat them.
Donate now to help us reach our February fundraising goal. Every cent that you donate will contribute to Democratic victories up and down the ballot this November.

Alex, a number of Republicans are trying to unseat Jahana Hayes this year.
One of them, Robert Hyde, was denounced by the Connecticut GOP due to his alleged involvement in the Ukraine saga that led to President Trump’s impeachment.
This story received national attention, and it’s a perfect example of why we need to mobilize in support of Democratic victories NOW, not later. Donate to Connecticut Democrats to ensure that we have the resources necessary to win throughout 2020.
Right now, we’re still short of where we need to be to reach our monthly goal — but you can change that.
As the Democratic presidential primary heats up, many Democrats aren’t paying attention to local, state, and Congressional races. But although electing a Democratic president is incredibly important, ensuring that Connecticut Democrats like Jahana Hayes win is just as important.
Will you chip in now to help us make that happen? We need to raise $10,000 more before February ends — any amount that you donate makes a difference.

"Will you join us in thanking Governor Lamont for his leadership during the COVID-19 pandemic? Connecticut Democrats
Hi Alex —
During times of crisis in the United States, the American people have historically been able to count on our president to step up and lead us to safety.
Sadly, the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed President Trump’s inability to lead.
While other countries responded swiftly to address the spread of coronavirus, Donald Trump’s purposeful negligence and refusal to listen to health experts set us down a deadly path.
Now that the United States has the most confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the entire world, Americans have looked to their state’s governors for leadership.
Democratic governors across the country have made national headlines for their work to control the spread of this virus — and here in Connecticut, we’re incredibly proud of the work that Governor Ned Lamont has done to take on this crisis and keep us safe.
Will you join us in thanking Governor Lamont for his leadership during the COVID-19 pandemic? Sign your name here:
Thank Ned
Just as there is no doubt that Donald Trump's negligence has made this crisis worse, it is now clear that Governor Lamont’s ability to make tough calls has saved lives in Connecticut.
His daily news briefings have kept us all informed about the latest developments. His work to acquire more personal protective equipment (PPE) is saving lives. And his work to protect small businesses and workers is helping us all navigate through the economic side of this crisis.
Governor Lamont’s steady, compassionate, and unwavering leadership has played a major role in flattening the curve in Connecticut. While our state now has over 9,700 confirmed COVID-19 cases, the peak is projected to arrive soon, and we have seen several positive signs that indicate our collective efforts are working.
Join us in thanking Governor Lamont for stepping up and providing the leadership we’re lacking from the White House during this pandemic.
Thank Ned

Hi Alex —
Thank you so much to everyone who wished me a happy birthday last week! Every birthday wish was greatly appreciated, and I hope that I’ll get to thank you all in person someday soon.
Serving as the first woman ever elected CT Democratic Party Chair was the honor of a lifetime, and I’m so proud of everything that CT Dems have accomplished since then.
$15 minimum wage, the most comprehensive paid family and medical leave law in the country — this progress didn’t happen by accident. It’s all been the result of countless hours of hard work from Democratic volunteers, activists, candidates, and elected officials.
Today, I want to ask if you can help the Connecticut Democratic Party continue pushing our state forward on the path toward progress by making a monthly contribution.
Will you activate a monthly $15 donation today to help CT Dems continue mobilizing for Democratic victories up and down the ballot throughout the rest of this year?
Donate $15 Monthly
We are all looking forward to the day when we can get back to our normal routines. But until then, my friends at the CT Democratic Party are relying on online support to make everything they do happen.
Training events, volunteer organizing, registering voters, door-to-door canvassing — all of this work is now online-only, which means CT Dems must invest in digital organizing now.
Make no mistake, Alex: this November we CAN defeat Donald Trump and elect Democrats all the way down the ballot — but only if we all pitch in.
Help Connecticut Democrats fund the essential online organizing work necessary to mobilize for Democratic victories this year by activating a $15 monthly contribution now.

Alex,
Last night, I was honored to be unanimously elected to serve again as Chair of the Connecticut Democratic Party.
It’s a critical year and I’m ready to work. Together, we will:
* Build up our ground game to defeat Donald Trump;
* Protect Democratic seats in the U.S. House of Representatives;
* Activate our grassroots field operations to expand majorities in the state legislature;
It goes without saying, a lot of good work has already happened this year. Thanks to my predecessor, Nancy Wyman, for everything she has done for the state party.

Thank Nancy Wyman
Nancy was unanimously approved to take over my previous role on the Democratic National Committee last night, where I know that she will continue to defend our shared Democratic values on behalf of working families.
The progress that we made under Nancy’s leadership is undeniable. Connecticut passed the most robust paid family and medical leave law in the country and raised Connecticut’s minimum wage to $15 an hour.
So Alex, join me in thanking Nancy Wyman for everything she has done for the Connecticut Democratic Party by signing this card.
Thank Nancy Wyman
I’m looking forward to working with all of you to find new and creative ways to mobilize Democratic voters in the weeks and months ahead. Together, we will defeat Donald Trump and elect Democrats all the way down the ballot.

"Today, I'm reflecting on what mothers in Connecticut really want Connecticut Democrats
Happy Mother’s Day, Alex!
To all of the mothers in Connecticut, I hope that you are enjoying a relaxing and joyful Sunday.
Social distancing has made this year’s celebration of motherhood a bit different than usual. But even if you’ve had to replace Mother’s Day brunch with a phone call or video chat, I hope that you and your family are making the most of this day.
Yesterday morning, Connecticut Democrats successfully hosted our first-ever virtual Democratic State Convention where we nominated state party leaders. Today, I’m reflecting on what this year’s elections truly mean for Connecticut’s mothers and grandmothers.
As a mother and a grandmother myself, I don’t want my children or grandchildren to have to live in a country where a misogynist like Donald Trump is president. That’s why I’m so focused on mobilizing voters to ensure that we elect a Democratic president in November.
But this year isn’t just about defeating Donald Trump — we’re mobilizing for progress on the issues that affect the lives of Connecticut mothers every day.
What mothers in Connecticut actually want isn’t just one day of flowers and breakfast in bed.
We want guaranteed paid family and medical leave, universal affordable child care, an end to the gender pay gap, and certainty that our reproductive rights and health care decisions will never be threatened by anyone.
We also want our daughters and granddaughters to grow up knowing that their gender will never stand in the way of them achieving their dreams.
I’m proud of what Connecticut has already accomplished on these issues — our state now has the most robust paid family and medical leave law in the entire country, and we are one of only thirteen states in the nation that guarantees the right to an abortion by state law.
But we still have a lot of work ahead of us. So this Mother’s Day, let’s commit to pushing forward every day this year on the issues that truly matter to Connecticut mothers and grandmothers.
Thank you Alex, and Happy Mother’s Day!

Thanks to our hard-won Democratic trifecta, Governor Lamont signed the most comprehensive paid family and medical leave law in the entire country this year.

Alex —
Did you know that Connecticut passed the most comprehensive paid family and medical leave law in the entire country this year?
It’s true — and now we need Congress to pass legislation guaranteeing paid leave for every family in the country. That’s why we’re rallying support for Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro’s paid family and medical leave bill — the FAMILY Act — before 2020.
Will you add your name in support of national paid family and medical leave legislation? We need 1,000 signatures by midnight tomorrow to help prove that paid leave MUST be a priority for Democrats in 2020.
Add Your Name
Connecticut’s new law guarantees up to 12 weeks of paid leave for new families, families experiencing serious illnesses, and folks with other qualifying reasons.
Our state is showing the whole country what a Democratic majority can do — and now we need your help to ensure that passing national paid family and medical leave legislation is a priority for Democrats in Congress next year.
Sign our petition in support of Rosa DeLauro’s bill, the FAMILY Act→
Together, we can ensure that our Democratic agenda here in Connecticut shapes what Democrats across the country are capable of.

"Alex,
Connecticut Democrats have a long history of standing up for the rights and dignity of marginalized communities, regardless of race, religion or sexual orientation.
Today, we stand with our brothers and sisters across the country in calling for justice for George Floyd and for every man and woman who has lived under threat of a system that targets people because of their skin color.
We are living in a period of extraordinary pain and stress, and it’s time to stand together and build a path to justice and equality. We can do that by voting on November 3rd, and we can do that today by rising together in peaceful mass protest.
Here is a list of upcoming protests against racial injustice that are taking place in Connecticut today and in the days ahead. If you are able to, please make plans to safely attend one of these important protests.
Join A Protest
Please stay safe by wearing a mask, maintaining social distancing by staying a minimum of 6 feet from others in accordance with Connecticut’s latest guidelines, and looking out for each other.
Together, we can achieve justice for all. In this historic moment in American history, please join Connecticut Democrats in standing against systemic racism by taking whatever action you can to demand justice.

Alex,
As Connecticut officially enters phase 2 of reopening our state, Donald Trump is ramping up his re-election campaign — and Connecticut Democrats are fighting back.
This Saturday, Trump’s campaign will host a massive rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma to close out their first week of in-person campaigning since the COVID-19 pandemic began. That’s right, Alex: the Trump campaign has already resumed knocking on doors and hosting in-person campaign events despite the pandemic.
The Connecticut Democratic Party is still focused on virtual outreach, which means we need your help to invest further in reaching voters online. Can you contribute $10 now to help us combat Trump’s field operations by mobilizing Democrats online?

Trump’s campaign and the Republican National Committee just celebrated their biggest fundraising day ever this past weekend. Now, they’re using that record-breaking fundraising haul to ramp up their field operations and train volunteers.
With Republican staff and volunteers already back to knocking on doors across the country, Democrats can’t afford to lose any ground — we need to fight back now.
Thanks to supporters like you, we’ve been able to continue mobilizing Democrats online throughout this pandemic. But now, we need to double our efforts in order to compete against Trump and the RNC’s well-funded field operations.
Please chip in what you can now. Any amount that you can contribute to the Connecticut Democratic Party will help ensure that Democrats win up and down the ballot this November.

"Hi Alex,
As the Connecticut Democratic Party’s Executive Director, these last several months have been anything but ordinary. But we’ve adapted, and with absentee voting about to begin in Connecticut, we’re running an unprecedented virtual voter outreach program.
Everything we do here at CT Dems HQ is thanks to support from Democrats like you, Alex — and today I need to ask for your support once again.
As you may know, I celebrated my 48th birthday yesterday. Birthdays during a pandemic are strange, especially when they fall just over a month before an historic, generation-defining election — but I adapted!
Now, with less than 48 hours to go until our final quarterly fundraising deadline before Election Day, I’m asking if you’ll give $48 — or whatever you can afford — to CT Dems in honor of my 48th birthday to help us elect Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and Democrats all the way down the ticket in November.

We have a lot of work ahead of us in these final 35 days, and the Connecticut Democratic Party is counting on your support so we can double our voter outreach in October.
With Joe Biden and Donald Trump facing off on the debate stage tonight for the first time, it’s impossible not to think about Trump’s recent refusal to commit to a peaceful transition of power if he loses — or the fact that he’s about to replace RBG with an anti-abortion crusader who wants to dismantle the Affordable Care Care.
But this is not a time for despair — it’s time to stay focused and help Democrats win.

2020 is the year when global leaders must unite to prevent global catastrophe. Scientists have already warned that our time is running out — and if you look around the world right now, it’s clear that the time for debate has passed.
Australia's continent-wide bushfires have caused unprecedented destruction in recent weeks — reportedly killing an estimated half-billion animals — and the fires show no sign of stopping.
Continents on fire, mass extinctions — this is real, it’s happening, and we cannot afford to wait any longer to take serious, global action. Add your name if you agree.
We are rapidly approaching tipping points that, once reached, will make spiraling climate disaster beyond human control. But we’re not there yet, Alex.
We already have the tools we need to stop these trends and ensure that we leave future generations a healthy and habitable planet. Connecticut must work with leaders in neighboring states to address this existential threat — but we need to know if you’re on board for the work ahead.

2019 is coming to a close, and that means we’re a few days away from our end-of-year fundraising deadline.
2020 will be the most consequential election year of our lifetimes, and we need to prepare for the challenges ahead.
The problem is, Donald Trump and national Republicans raised $125 million in the third quarter alone this year.
Regardless of their fundraising numbers, our team is determined to ensure that Democrats win in 2020 — but we need your help. We want to ensure that Democrats win all across the country, not just in Connecticut.
We need to raise $20,000 before the year ends to ensure that we don’t enter 2020 at a disadvantage. This money will go directly towards our organizing efforts for Democrats in 2020. Will you chip in to help us get there?

"Please let us explain what this goal is about Connecticut Democrats
Alex —
President Trump has spent his presidency normalizing corruption — and Republicans at the local, state, and federal levels are letting him.
Here in Connecticut, we need to be prepared with the resources to beat the GOP at the ballot box in November. But in order to do that, we need your help to fund a robust field organizing operation capable of getting out the vote for Democrats up and down the ticket.
Can you chip in now to help Connecticut Democrats win this year? We’re still $10,000 short of our monthly budget goal, and we need to pick up the pace this week to get there.
These monthly budget goals are essential. We know that Republicans have raised HUGE sums of money throughout Trump’s presidency, and we know that every cent will be directed at ending Democratic majorities across the country — not to mention keeping Trump in the White House.
Democrats fought hard in 2018 to secure majorities at the state and federal levels. This year, we’ll need to fight twice as hard to win. That’s why we can’t afford to come up short this month.

"Hi Alex, it’s Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro. I’m reaching out today on behalf of the Connecticut Democratic Party before their final quarterly fundraising deadline before Election Day.
As we approach the most consequential presidential election of our lifetime, Connecticut Democrats are doing the work necessary to mobilize votes for Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and candidates all the way down the ballot who will fight for working families and strive to heal our country, not divide it.

Every week, CT Dems staff and volunteers are making phone calls for the entire Democratic ticket in Connecticut — and that includes me!
As you may know, my Republican opponent has been attacking my record on TV with negative ads. She’s on track to spend more than $1 million before Election Day, and according to the New Haven Register, would be the 7th richest member of the House or Senate if elected.
But just like the Connecticut Democratic Party, instead of being distracted by the attacks like those my opponent is running on TV, I’m staying focused on mobilizing support for Democrats in tough races to maintain and expand Democrats’ House majority.
And of course, I am dedicated to putting Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in the White House. We are fighting for the soul of our nation right now, Alex, and we must fight together.
With President Trump and Mitch McConnell pushing through another far-right Supreme Court justice, we can’t afford to lose focus — the future of women’s rights, affordable healthcare, and so much more are at stake.
If you are with me in this fight, chip in $10 today to help Connecticut Democrats reach more voters in these final weeks before Election Day.
Thank you for your support,
Rosa

"Alex, a group of Connecticut Republicans is following Donald Trump’s lead by trying to stop CT Secretary of State Denise Merrill from expanding absentee voting for November’s general election.
Do you think that Connecticut needs to prioritize making voting safe for everyone by expanding absentee voting for November’s general election? Let us know here:
Answer Here

Original Message:
Alex,
With absentee voting underway for Connecticut’s August 11th Democratic presidential primary, we must ensure that Connecticut is also prepared to vote safely in November.
This week, the Connecticut legislature will meet for a special session to address several issues, including absentee voting in November’s general election.
Do you think that Connecticut voters should be able to vote absentee in November’s general election?
Yes!
No!
Connecticut Democrats are fighting to ensure that no voter has to choose between voting and their health during this pandemic.
But a group of Connecticut Republicans has filed a lawsuit claiming that expanding absentee voting to include November’s election is “unlawful and unconstitutional.”
Alex, here’s the truth: 220 million Americans live in 34 states plus Washington, D.C. where mail-in voting or no-excuse absentee ballots are already in use — and Connecticut is one of just 11 states that doesn’t allow early voting.
Absentee voting is safe, secure and easy — do you think that Connecticut voters should be able to vote absentee in November’s general election? Answer here to let us know what you think.

"He will do everything he can to stay in the White House: Connecticut Democrats
President Trump spreads lies and misinformation about COVID-19 on a daily basis. Now, he’s threatened to fire Dr. Anthony Fauci — one of the few sources of accurate information in his nationally televised briefings.
Alex, here in Connecticut, we have Democrats like Governor Ned Lamont leading us through this crisis. We are organizing to ensure that Democrats win up and down the ballot this November because we need real leadership now more than ever.
But we can’t do this important work without your support. Contribute to the CT Democratic Party now to help us mobilize for Democratic victories in the critical weeks and months ahead. Any amount helps now that all of our fundraising has gone digital:

Original Message:
Alex, every new day of this pandemic has revealed further evidence of why Donald Trump is dangerously unfit to lead our country.
Now that Joe Biden is the presumptive 2020 Democratic presidential nominee, it’s time to focus on doing the work necessary to defeat Trump.
Mobilizing Democrats means hosting volunteer training events, registering voters, and organizing volunteer actions. But COVID-19 has limited our ability to do this important work — it has also limited our ability to raise funds in order to pay for all of it.
Alex, that’s why I’m reaching out. Can you chip in to ensure that the CT Democratic Party has the resources we need to mobilize for Democratic victories this year? Any amount that you can contribute would make a huge difference.
Donald Trump has not let the pandemic get in the way of campaigning for his re-election.
He’s using his daily press briefings to spread propaganda on national television, and his administration delayed releasing stimulus checks to the American people so that his signature could appear on them.
While Trump does everything possible to sidestep blame and pretend to be a hero, Democratic leaders like Governor Ned Lamont are doing the real work to keep us safe. This is precisely why our work mobilizing Democrats to get out the vote for candidates up and down the ballot matters so much.
With all of our fundraising digital-only, your online support matters now more than ever. Your contribution will ensure that we can continue organizing for Democrats in the weeks and months ahead to defeat Donald Trump in November. Chip in now to help Democrats win:

"Reflecting on this somber anniversary Connecticut Democrats
Alex, it’s been two years since the unspeakable violence at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.
Connecticut deeply understands the devastation and lasting trauma that gun violence brings. Today, Parkland is in our thoughts — as are all of the other communities in the United States that have been affected by gun violence.
But as we reflect on this somber anniversary, we must affirm that thoughts and prayers are not enough. We must honor the 17 lives lost in Parkland with decisive action.
In the two years since this tragedy, Parkland’s young people have launched a national movement to prevent future gun violence — and progress has been made.
Here in Connecticut, Democrats and Republicans came together last year to build upon our assault weapons ban and background check requirements. We passed legislation to ban untraceable ghost guns and require that guns are stored safely.
Now it’s time for the federal government to recognize that guns do not obey borders. We need common sense federal gun violence prevention legislation, and it’s time for Republicans at the national level to join Democrats in taking action.
If we all work together, we can prevent future tragedies and create safer communities in every state. We owe it to our children, and we owe it to every American who has been a victim of gun violence.
Thank you,
Nancy Wyman

Hi Alex,
As I look through the responses to our team’s Presidential Approval Poll and Vice President Survey, it’s clear: Democrats are ready to remove Donald Trump from the White House.
Joe Biden is closer than ever to selecting his running mate, and with Connecticut on track to soon begin the first phase of reopening our state, CT Dems are fired up to start knocking doors in support of this year’s incredible slate of Democratic candidates.
Democrats will only succeed in November if we get mobilized, and right now that mobilization is all taking place online. CT Dems have invested heavily in expanding our online organizing efforts, but we need your support to keep going.

An unprecedented national crisis calls for an unprecedented response, and we’re doing everything we can to adapt to this moment.
That means registering voters, training volunteers, and preparing a massive get-out-the-vote effort to help elect all of the Democrats running this year — from Joe Biden on down the ballot.
All of this work is important, and it’s now all being done digitally. Every dollar that you contribute enables us to invest more in this work and expand our online operation.
If you can, please make a contribution today to support the CT Democratic Party’s online organizing efforts. We’re almost halfway through this fundraising quarter, and we need your help to stay on track.

While working people are relying on strong leadership more than ever before, President Trump is focused on hosting a massive in-person campaign rally in Tulsa during a pandemic.
There could not be more at stake in this November’s election. If Democrats successfully win the White House and U.S. Senate, we can undo the damage of the Trump administration and reshape our country into one that truly values working families and our environment.

Despite all of the challenges that social distancing has presented us with, Connecticut Democrats have continued working tirelessly to lay the groundwork for Democratic victories this November.
We can’t afford to slow down. Last month we hosted our first-ever virtual Democratic State Convention, and we’re continuing to mobilize Democrats virtually as we wait for on-the-ground organizing to become safe again.
All of this work has been funded by grassroots support from Democrats like you, Alex. Recent polls show that our work is paying off, but victory in November will only happen if we continue fighting every day.
If you are able to, please contribute before tonight’s midnight deadline to help CT Democrats reach our $25,000 end-of-quarter fundraising goal. Every dollar that you contribute goes toward organizing for Democrats up and down the ballot.

As the first African American woman to serve in Congress in Connecticut’s history, Jahana has been a champion for equitable access to quality education, affordable health care for all, gun violence prevention, women’s right to choose, and so much more over the past two years.
Will you split a $10 contribution between the Connecticut Democratic Party and Jahana Hayes’ campaign today to help us ensure that Jahana wins on November 3rd?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will process immediately and be split between Connecticut Democrats and Jahana Hayes:
EXPRESS DONATE $10
EXPRESS DONATE $25
EXPRESS DONATE $50
EXPRESS DONATE $100
DONATE ANOTHER AMOUNT
As of today, more than 415,000 ballots have already been submitted in Connecticut — we’re working hard to ensure that EVERY eligible Democratic voter makes their voice heard in this election,
All of our values are at stake. As you may have heard, during a virtual community meeting this month, a group of racists coordinated to attack Congresswoman Hayes and her campaign team with six minutes of vile, racist hate speech.
On November 3rd, we must send a strong message that Connecticut rejects the culture of hate that Donald Trump has normalized in the United States by ensuring that leaders like Jahana win BIG.
Chip in today to support Jahana’s reelection campaign and help us mobilize Democratic voters across Connecticut→
SUPPORT JAHANA HAYES & CT DEMS

"Alex,
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg spent her entire life fighting for equality. She shattered glass ceilings for women everywhere and inspired so many through her historic work on the U.S. Supreme Court.
She will be greatly missed by all of us at the Connecticut Democratic Party.
Her dying wish was to “not be replaced until a new president is installed,” — but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has already declared his intent to replace her before Election Day.
Everything is at stake, Alex. Sign up today to volunteer with Connecticut Democrats and help us elect Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and Democrats all the way down the ballot in November. It’s up to us now→
I Will Volunteer
As we mourn the loss of Justice Ginsburg, we must rally to honor her legacy. It’s time to organize like our lives depend on it.
Every Monday and Wednesday for the next 6 weeks, Connecticut Democrats will be hosting virtual phone banks focused on turning out voters for the entire Democratic ticket. With absentee voting about to begin throughout the country, we’re also making phone calls and sending texts to the swing states that will decide the presidency.
We need volunteers to text or make phone calls for local Connecticut state legislature candidates and the Biden-Harris ticket right away. Sign up now to help Democrats win.
I Will Volunteer

"Hi Alex —
On behalf of everyone at the Connecticut Democratic Party headquarters, I want to let you know that you and your family are in our thoughts. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected each and every one of us, and we hope that you are following the CDC’s guidance and staying safe.
These days, “headquarters” looks a bit different for us — our staff is now working remotely from home due to Connecticut’s coronavirus prevention measures. We all must do our part to protect our neighbors. But despite this pandemic, democracy goes on.
Our team is doing everything we can to continue with our normal work, but Alex, this new digital-only world has limited our ability to do that — and we now have to reassess our budget for this upcoming quarter.
Normally, as March winds down, we’d be preparing for our state’s upcoming Democratic presidential primary — which has now been delayed until June — by holding training events, registering voters, organizing volunteer actions, and yes, hosting in-person fundraisers to help pay for all of this important work.
But all of this has changed. Supporting candidates, training volunteers, and holding elections now all relies upon us raising enough funds to support our quarterly budget — and as of this moment, we’re short.
Alex, that’s why we have to ask: before March ends, can you chip in to support the CT Democratic Party?
With all of our fundraising digital-only, your online support matters now more than ever. Your contribution will ensure that we can continue organizing for Democrats in the weeks and months ahead to defeat Donald Trump in November.
Any amount that you can contribute would make a huge difference:

The past few weeks have shown us with absolute clarity that Donald Trump is unfit to lead this country. We need to ensure that not only is he defeated in November, but that Democrats up and down the ballot succeed too.
We can do this— but not without the proper resources. If you can, chip in to support Connecticut Democrats before March ends. We need 150 more online contributions before the end of the month if we’re going to reach our quarterly fundraising goal.
Thank you for sticking with us — we’re in this together, and we’ll get through this together.

"Hi Alex, on behalf of all of us at the Connecticut Democratic Party, thank you to everyone who has contributed recently to support our work.
The COVID-19 pandemic has transformed all of our lives and limited our ability to do business as usual — but these past several weeks have shown us why we need strong Democratic leadership at every level of government.
We must work harder than ever before to mobilize for Democratic victories. Your contributions are enabling us to adapt to our new digital-only world, and continue doing the work necessary to ensure we defeat Donald Trump in November.
Thank you for your ongoing support, Alex! We’re in this together, and we’ll get through this difficult time together.
Right now, there is something extremely important that you can do to ensure that everyone in Connecticut receives the assistance they need: fill out the 2020 Census.
If you haven’t done so already, you can fill out the 2020 Census online here — it only takes five minutes!
Take the 2020 Census
An accurate Census count is necessary for Connecticut to get all of the disaster assistance resources we need. Billions of dollars in federal aid to fund everything from our schools, to our roads, to our social safety net programs (including unemployment support) are at stake.
But right now, most people in Connecticut still have yet to fill out their information. If that includes you, please take five minutes to fill out the 2020 Census online now.
You can also call 844-330-2020 any day of the week from 7:00 a.m. to 2:00 a.m ET to fill it out over the phone. Otherwise, a paper Census will be mailed to you.
Thank you for taking this important action, and thank you again for your support of CT Dems.

2019 is coming to a close, and that means we’re a few days away from our end-of-year fundraising deadline.
2020 will be the most consequential election year of our lifetimes, and we need to prepare for the challenges ahead.
The problem is, Donald Trump and National Republicans raised $125 million in the third quarter alone this year.
Regardless of their fundraising numbers, our team is determined to ensure that Democrats win in 2020 — but we need your help. We want to ensure that Democrats win all across the country, not just in Connecticut.
We need to raise $20,000 before the year ends to ensure that we don’t enter 2020 at a disadvantage. This money will go directly towards our organizing efforts for Democrats in 2020. Will you chip in to help us get there?

Hi Alex, it’s Jacqueline with CT Dems. I need to talk to you about our 2019 fundraising goal.
Republicans across the country have been outraising Democrats all year by millions of dollars. Our $20,000 end-of-year goal might seem like a lot, but to the Republican billionaires and special interest groups, it’s a drop in the bucket.
That’s fine. Democrats organized victories across the country last year thanks to lots of small-dollar contributions from supporters like you.

Trump is unfit for office — we all know this — but the Connecticut GOP sees things differently.
That’s because like Trump, they don’t value science: Connecticut’s Republican House Minority Leader Themis Klarides recently suggested that the importance of wearing a mask is debatable.
And like Trump, they don’t value safe voting: every Republican in the Connecticut Senate voted to prevent absentee voting in the general election, and wanted to get rid of drop boxes as well.

Last night, Donald Trump gave his acceptance speech for the final night of the Republican National Convention on the South Lawn of the White House — which is a blatant violation of federal law.
He meandered through an address full of lies, half-truths, and outright disinformation, praising his administration’s disastrous pandemic response (180,000 Americans have died since March).
But one thing was clearer than ever: Donald Trump isn’t just unfit for office — he’s a threat to the future of our country. We simply cannot afford 4 more years of chaos and division.

When we elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris on November 3rd, they will fight to expand paid sick leave and unemployment benefits, lower health care and housing costs, raise the national minimum wage to $15 an hour, set forth an aggressive plan to address the climate crisis, and overhaul our nation’s criminal justice system.

With so much on the line this year, it’s more important than ever that we step up for our democracy. We can’t just vote — we have to support Democrats up and down the ballot.
There are only 70 days to go until Election Day, and we’re not wasting a single one of them. We’re developing our voter outreach plans to ensure that every voter in Connecticut has the information they need to vote.
But the most important part of this process is your input. Can you take a quick survey to let us know how you’re planning to vote in November’s election.
TAKE THE SURVEY
Thanks for helping us form a winning strategy — your input is very important!

"Hi Alex —
I’m Erick Russell, Vice Chair of the Connecticut Democratic Party. Today is Juneteenth, and all of us at CT Dems are reflecting on the significance of this day and the transformation that is currently taking place across this country.
For those who don’t know, Juneteenth is the longest running national commemoration of the end of slavery in the United States. Since 1865, every June 19th has been a celebration of Black Americans and their perseverance in the face of injustice.
As we all know, Black Americans are still fighting for their lives, families, and communities to this day. Throughout this month, sustained mass protests have erupted nationwide, in big cities and small towns alike, to demand a permanent end to the systemic oppression and murder of Black Americans at the hands of police.
The video of George Floyd’s murder in Minneapolis is just the latest example of our nation’s long history of brutalizing Black Americans. The injustices that we are now marching against have been here for centuries, and we must fight to make 2020 the year when it all began to permanently change.
Already, these protests have resulted in real change taking place throughout the country — from symbolic acts like the dismantling of racist statues, to the passage of concrete legislation to transform policing and address the systemic racism present throughout so many American institutions.
In Connecticut, Governor Lamont has signed an executive order to ban chokeholds, require police officers to step in when they witness excessive force from other police, demilitarize Connecticut’s police force, and require body cameras and dash cams for all police.
And soon, the Connecticut legislature will take on the issue of transforming policing in our state through a special legislative session.
Alex: we must demand action. Together, we can achieve justice for all, but we can’t wait any longer to act. In this historic moment in American history, please join Connecticut Democrats in standing against systemic racism by taking whatever action you can to demand justice.
Here is a list of upcoming protests against racial injustice that are taking place in Connecticut today and in the days ahead. If you are able to, please make plans to safely attend one of these important protests.
Join A Protest
Please stay safe by wearing a mask, maintaining social distancing by staying a minimum of 6 feet from others in accordance with Connecticut’s latest guidelines, and looking out for each other.
Thank you,
Erick Russell

"Alex, we need to take action now Connecticut Democrats
Alex,
As Connecticut officially enters phase 2 of reopening our state, Donald Trump is ramping up his re-election campaign — and Connecticut Democrats are fighting back.
This Saturday, Trump’s campaign will host a massive rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma to close out their first week of in-person campaigning since the COVID-19 pandemic began. That’s right, Alex: the Trump campaign has already resumed knocking on doors and hosting in-person campaign events despite the pandemic.
The Connecticut Democratic Party is still focused on virtual outreach, which means we need your help to invest further in reaching voters online. Can you contribute $10 now to help us combat Trump’s field operations by mobilizing Democrats online?

Trump’s campaign and the Republican National Committee just celebrated their biggest fundraising day ever this past weekend. Now, they’re using that record-breaking fundraising haul to ramp up their field operations and train volunteers.
With Republican staff and volunteers already back to knocking on doors across the country, Democrats can’t afford to lose any ground — we need to fight back now.
Thanks to supporters like you, we’ve been able to continue mobilizing Democrats online throughout this pandemic. But now, we need to double our efforts in order to compete against Trump and the RNC’s well-funded field operations.
Please chip in what you can now. Any amount that you can contribute to the Connecticut Democratic Party will help ensure that Democrats win up and down the ballot this November.

More than a QUARTER-MILLION people have already voted in Connecticut through absentee voting.
This is historic, and it means our work getting out the vote is paying off — but it also means that time is running out to reach voters. We need to raise $10,000 before Tuesday to fund the final two weeks of our GOTV push — can you help?

"Alex,
In case you didn’t hear the news, during last week’s Republican National Convention, President Trump and the RNC raised a whopping $76 million.
That money will now be used to attack Democrats on television every single day until votes are cast in November’s election.
Democrats must respond with a surge of grassroots donations if we’re going to have the resources necessary to fight back. Can you chip in $25 before midnight?

If you thought that defeating Donald Trump would be easy, think again.
The sad truth is that millions of Americans are ready to sign up for four more years of the Trump administration, and they’re donating in large numbers to help the GOP make it happen.
If Democrats are going to succeed in November, it’s going to take an unprecedented surge of grassroots support. Chip in $25 before August ends at midnight and we’ll send you a CT for Biden-Harris sticker as a thank you for stepping up.

"we're fired up to start knocking doors, but until then... Connecticut Democrats
Hi Alex,
As I look through the responses to our team’s Presidential Approval Poll and Vice President Survey, it’s clear: Democrats are ready to remove Donald Trump from the White House.
Joe Biden is closer than ever to selecting his running mate, and with Connecticut on track to soon begin the first phase of reopening our state, CT Dems are fired up to start knocking doors in support of this year’s incredible slate of Democratic candidates.
Democrats will only succeed in November if we get mobilized, and right now that mobilization is all taking place online. CT Dems have invested heavily in expanding our online organizing efforts, but we need your support to keep going.
Will you chip in to help CT Dems continue investing in online organizing to help Democrats win up and down the ballot this year?

That means registering voters, training volunteers, and preparing a massive get-out-the-vote effort to help elect all of the Democrats running this year — from Joe Biden on down the ballot.
All of this work is important, and it’s now all being done digitally. Every dollar that you contribute enables us to invest more in this work and expand our online operation.

Since being elected to serve again as Chair of the Connecticut Democratic Party, I’ve been focused on expanding our efforts to get out the vote for Democrats in these final four months before Election Day.
With Connecticut leading the country in containing COVID-19, we must be prepared for the day when it’s safe to resume knocking on doors across the state. That’s why Tuesday’s end-of-quarter fundraising deadline couldn’t be more important.
Connecticut Democrats need to raise $25,000 before June ends to expand our voter outreach throughout this summer. Right now, we’re about 50% short of this goal. Can you chip in now to help us get there?

"Alex,
It’s time for every American to stand together against racial injustice.
In Connecticut and across the country, protestors have taken to the streets to demand justice for George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and every man and woman who has lived in this country under threat of a system that targets people because of their skin color.
Connecticut Democrats stand with everyone who has peacefully participated in these historic demonstrations, rallies, marches, and protests. Today, we are asking our supporters to contribute to three organizations that are leading the fight for racial justice in the United States.
If you’re able to, please click here to contribute to the ACLU, Color of Change, and the Connecticut Bail Fund.
Fight Racial Injustice
We must continue rising together to build a path to justice and equality, and supporting these organizations is a critical way that you can do that.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has been fighting to protect every American citizen’s Constitutional rights since 1920.
Color of Change is the largest online racial justice organization in the country, and is focused on empowering Black communities and advancing real solutions against our systems of inequality.
The Connecticut Bail Fund has helped secure the freedom of more than 415 people in Connecticut to date through their work organizing against the destructive impact of criminalization and providing bail support.
Connecticut Democrats have a long history of standing up for the rights and dignity of marginalized communities. In this historic moment when millions of Americans are uniting to demand real, systemic changes and an end to racial injustice in the United States, we must continue elevating marginalized voices and empowering those who are leading this fight.
Please contribute to the ACLU, Color of Change, and the Connecticut Bail Fund today.

James Blake was born in New York, but he grew up here in Connecticut. He started playing tennis at five, and was inspired to pursue a professional career after hearing a speech by Arthur Ashe.
In 2015, James was thrown to the ground, handcuffed, and arrested by a plainclothes New York City cop who said he believed James was a suspect of interest.
He has used that experience to take an active stand on police brutality against minorities. James' experience is particularly meaningful today, as we all look for a path forward.
RSVP before 7:00 p.m. ET tonight for what is sure to be a great discussion!

"Hi Alex, did you see that Governor Lamont reached out to you earlier?

Original Message from Governor Ned Lamont:
Hi Alex, I hope that you and your family are well.
I’m proud to serve as Governor of Connecticut, but I didn’t get here by chance — I was elected thanks to an outpouring of grassroots support from Democrats like you.
This year, CT Dems are working hard to repeat that success and keep the momentum going by organizing for Democrats in races big and small all across our state — and that includes making Donald Trump a one-term president.
I’m reaching out on behalf of the Connecticut Democratic Party about the end-of-quarter fundraising deadline they’re facing tonight.

As you know, I’ve been working 24/7 to address every aspect of the health and economic crisis facing Connecticut. I’m incredibly proud of our shared efforts so far, and I’d like to thank you for doing your part, Alex. Keep it up!
Social distancing means that all of the important work done by Connecticut Democrats has safely gone online-only — that includes training events, volunteer organizing, and the in-person fundraisers that make all of this work possible.
As a result, online donations have become more even more critical than ever before.
If you can, donate to support the Connecticut Democratic Party before their end-of-quarter fundraising deadline at midnight tonight. Any amount that you can contribute makes a difference.
Thank you, and stay safe!

"How is the COVID-19 pandemic affecting your life? Share your story here: Connecticut Democrats
Hi Alex — how are you?
The COVID-19 pandemic has changed life as we know it here in Connecticut, and all of us are facing difficult challenges. Some of those challenges are shared by all of us, others are unique.
Our team at the Connecticut Democratic Party wants to know how you and your family are doing. Will you take a moment to tell us how the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting you and your family?
Answer Here
Thank you for sharing with us how you and your family are making it through this difficult time.
We’re all in this together, Alex, and sharing our personal stories with each other is an important part of navigating this unprecedented time.
It is also important that we help each other however we can — that is why we’re launching our senior wellness check program.
Adults aged 65 years and older are at a higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19. With more than 167 million Americans being urged to stay at home, many seniors are in need of support during this time of isolation.
Connecticut Democrats are connecting volunteers with seniors in our state to help provide regular check-ins and ensure that their essential needs are being met.
Sign up here if you’re interested in volunteering to check up on seniors in your area.

"A look at what's to come as we race toward the CT primary Connecticut Democrats
Here we go, Alex!
Super Tuesday is officially behind us, and all eyes will soon be on Connecticut as the Democratic presidential primary races along.
As our team here at CT Dems HQ prepares for the work ahead, we want to take a moment to thank you for all of your support so far this year. Thank you, Alex!
Our work is fueled by your grassroots support. Whether you’ve chipped in $5 or $500, helped register one new voter or knocked hundreds of doors, you are a valuable member of this team.
Alex, defeating Donald Trump in November is going to require a true team effort. No matter which of the remaining Democratic candidates you’re supporting right now, we must all be prepared to support the final nominee and work to elect Democrats all the way down the ballot.
If you’re ready to make Donald Trump a one-term president, will you sign your name and pledge to support the Democratic presidential nominee this year?
Take the Pledge
We’re going to work hard to ensure that every eligible Connecticut Democrat turns out to vote in our primary on April 28th.
Then, we will work hard to unite everyone behind the eventual nominee. Unity — that’s what it will take to send Donald Trump back to Mar-a-Lago.
Are you in? Add your name here to let us know: [[URL REDACTED]]

Hi Alex, as the Director of Finance for the Connecticut Democratic Party, I want to be transparent with you about where things stand as we approach the final two months before Election Day.
The Good News: Since this month’s Democratic National Convention, Democrats in Connecticut have been more fired up than ever to vote for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.
The Bad News: Despite all of this energy, donations to the CT Democratic Party slowed down this month… by a lot. To do the work necessary in September to get out the vote before absentee ballots are mailed, we need to raise $10,000 before midnight tonight.

"Alex,
There’s a utility company in Connecticut which will remain nameless in this email — but Connecticut residents know exactly which one we’re talking about.
This company has engaged in price-gouging during the pandemic, and after a recent storm left hundreds of thousands of Connecticut homes without power, their response was a complete failure.
But here’s the thing, Alex: several prominent Connecticut Republicans have close ties to this company — three GOP Senators literally work for them, and GOP Minority House Leader Themis Klarides is engaged to one of their executives.
Connecticut Republicans work for private utility companies, Connecticut Democrats are working for you. Chip in $10 now to help us vote them all out in November→

Democrats in the Connecticut legislature have introduced legislation to ensure that public utilities are held accountable to the public, and this month a special session will likely address this bill.
Customers of this company saw MASSIVE increases in their electric bills this summer due to a ridiculous rate hike, and their horrific response to a tropical storm left more than 800,000 Connecticut residents without power — in many cases for more than a week longer than customers of other CT utility companies.
Connecticut has THREE Republican Senators who work for this company. Chip in now to help us elect Democrats up and down the ballot who will work for people, not for corporations.

Alex, the American people are ready for change.
After more than three years of corruption, lies, and obstruction from President Trump and the Republican Senate, polls are now showing that voters have had enough. Democrats have a real chance to win back the White House and U.S. Senate in November — and Republicans know it.
The GOP has sounded the alarm, and they’ll be raising huge sums of money over the coming months to stop our momentum.

CNN: GOP operatives worry Trump will lose both the presidency and Senate majority
Alex, we are mobilizing Democrats to win back the White House and U.S. Senate — and Republicans are getting worried.
As CNN reported yesterday, Republican strategists are raising the alarm about “what they worry could be a wipeout for the GOP.” Recent polls have shown that our hard work is paying off, and if we keep it up, we’re on track to defeat Donald Trump and win a Democratic Senate majority.
But a lot can happen between now and November. The GOP sees what Democrats are capable of when we’re united, and they will spare no expense to stop us.
Connecticut Democrats are counting on your grassroots support to help us continue organizing for Democratic victories up and down the ballot. Will you donate before May ends tomorrow at midnight to help us reach our $10,000 end-of-month fundraising goal?
Although Connecticut and other states have begun the process of gradually reopening, social distancing continues to limit our ability to organize on the ground.
That means all of the critical work that the CT Democratic Party does to help elect Democrats is still online-only — including training events, volunteer organizing, and the in-person fundraisers that make all of this work possible. Even this month’s Democratic State Convention was virtual!
Online support from Democrats like you has enabled us to continue organizing remotely without missing a beat. Now that the GOP has raised the alarm, we have to double down.
Donate to the Connecticut Democratic Party before midnight tomorrow to help us keep doing the work necessary to defeat Donald Trump and his GOP allies down the ballot in November. Democrats are on a path toward victory, and your support will help us get there.

"SIGN ON if you agree with Michelle Obama Connecticut Democrats
“If we have any hope of ending this chaos, we have got to vote for Joe Biden like our lives depend on it.” — Michelle Obama
Michelle Obama is right, Alex.
At the Democratic National Convention last night, the former First Lady said that this November, “we have to vote for Joe Biden in numbers that cannot be ignored.” That’s exactly what it’s going to take to defeat Donald Trump.
Today is the 100th anniversary of the ratification of the 19th Amendment, which guaranteed women the right to vote in the United States. In celebration of this milestone, will you answer Michelle Obama’s call to action by committing to voting for the Democratic ticket on Election Day?
Add your name to pledge to vote for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris on November 3rd:
Pledge to Vote
Throughout this month on social media, CT Dems have been highlighting activists who joined and led the long fight for women’s right to vote — from Lucy Burns to Frances Watkins Harper.
The truth is, the 19th Amendment did not prevent every American woman from being deprived of their right to vote. Even today, millions of American women of color are routinely disenfranchised through tactics like gerrymandering. Our fight for equal rights continues.
By attacking the U.S. Postal Service, the Trump administration is openly attacking every American’s right to vote. This is why Michelle Obama’s call to action is so important, Alex — we must vote for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris like our lives depend on it.
Celebrate the centennial of women’s constitutional right to vote by pledging to vote on Election Day for the Democratic ticket.

"BREAKING: Pelosi Says House Will Begin Drafting Impeachment Charges vs. Trump
— The New York Times
It’s official, Alex: this morning, Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that the U.S. House of Representatives will draft articles of impeachment against President Trump.
Things are moving quickly — the vote to charge President Trump with high crimes and misdemeanors may happen before Christmas. Will you take our short impeachment survey to let us know what you think about this breaking news?
Answer Here
* * *
Have you been following the latest developments in the impeachment proceedings, Alex?
Yesterday, the House Intelligence Committee released their official impeachment report, and today, the House Judiciary Committee held its first impeachment hearing.
Our team here at CT Dems HQ put together a short video summarizing where things stand right now. Will you take a moment to watch the video, then answer a few questions about impeachment?
Watch the video here
We now know with certainty that President Trump withheld military aid to Ukraine in exchange for investigations into his political rival.
He betrayed his oath of office, our national security, and the integrity of our elections — and now, it’s just a matter of what Congress will do about it.
What do you think about the impeachment process right now? Answer here to let us know→
Answer Here
Republicans want you to think that Democrats are solely focused on impeachment. But Alex, while the GOP has been busy making every excuse in the book for President Trump this year, the Democratic House has passed nearly 400 bills on everything from lowering healthcare costs to preventing gun violence.
The Republican Senate has killed nearly every one of these bills in an attempt to block all Democratic progress until next year’s elections — but 2020 is almost here, and we can soon hold the entire GOP accountable for their actions by voting them out of office.
Take a moment to respond to our short survey to let us know your thoughts on the impeachment proceedings and how we can hold Republicans accountable in 2020→
Thank you for staying engaged in the political process, Alex — and a special thanks to each and every supporter who pitched in to help us reach our November fundraising goal.
2020 will be a monumental year for our country, and your support will play a major role in our county’s future.

Alex —
The new year is right around the corner, which means we are approaching our critical end-of-year fundraising deadline. Remember, this is the last deadline before 2020.
In 2018, we saw what happens when Democrats get their message out and vote:
* We elected a Democratic Governor (me!)
* We secured a Democratic majority in the State Senate
* You strengthened our Democratic majority in the State House
CT Dems are determined to replicate the success we had in 2018, but to do that, we need your help.
Right now, we are $4,163 away from our end-of-year goal. Can you chip in $15 to help us get over the top?

This year we made incredible progress for working families by passing a realistic and on-time budget, increasing the minimum wage to $15 an hour, and creating the nation’s best paid family and medical leave law.
We need your help to ensure that Democrats have the resources necessary to protect our hard-won gains, and keep putting families and Connecticut residents first.

"Republicans have been fighting for decades to restrict access to safe, legal abortions. In states like Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Mississippi — they’re succeeding.

Hi Alex — do you know the story of Gerri Santoro?
Gerri was raised in Coventry, CT. In 1964, she died in a hotel room in Norwich, CT after receiving an illegal abortion. She was only 28 years old.
After her death, a graphic photo taken of her body galvanized thousands to fight for reproductive justice, and Gerri became a symbol of the pro-choice movement.
47 years ago today, that movement culminated in the Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade decision which guaranteed every woman the right to safely terminate a pregnancy.
Alex, that right is now under attack — this month, more than 200 Republican members of Congress called on the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade, and soon the most anti-choice court in modern history will hear an abortion rights case.
TAKE ACTION: Honor the memory of Connecticut women like Gerri Santoro who died for our right to choose by signing your name in support of reproductive rights.
Add Your Name
Connecticut is one of only 13 states in the country that guarantees the right to an abortion by state law. Even if Roe v. Wade is overturned, that right will persist.
We must fight to ensure that every American woman has that same right. Celebrate the 47th anniversary of Roe v. Wade by signing your name in support of reproductive freedom.

"Trump's administration doesn't care if your local post office closes Connecticut Democrats
Hi Alex —
The United States Postal Service (USPS) has always served an invaluable function in our country. Every day, millions of Americans rely on the people’s postal service for their life-saving medications and other critical packages.
Sadly, the Trump administration has rejected stimulus money aimed at keeping the post office open. Now, officials believe that the USPS could shut down as early as June.
Let’s not forget, the USPS is even more critical now that we’re in the middle of a pandemic — especially as many states move to enact vote-by-mail programs to ensure that your right to vote in this year’s elections is not limited by this health crisis.
We can’t let this happen. Sign our petition and demand that Trump and congressional Republicans save the USPS before it’s too late→
Save the USPS
If President Trump and the GOP get their way, 700,000 postal workers could lose their jobs.
These are essential workers who are risking their lives to ensure that Americans receive groceries, prescriptions, census forms, and now in many states, ballots.
We need to do our part to protect this invaluable American service. Add your name now to demand that the USPS is fully protected.
Getting rid of the post office is not a new idea for Republicans. Trump and his cronies have been working to defund or privatize the USPS for years. They are counting on your apathy.
Members of the Connecticut Congressional delegation like Jim Himes and Rosa DeLauro understand the USPS’s importance and are working to protect these essential workers.
But they need your help — can you step up and demand that Trump and congressional Republicans fund the people’s postal service?
Save the USPS

This year, we can’t afford to have anyone sitting on the sidelines. Follow President Obama’s example by adding your name and pledging to vote in 2020.

In Connecticut, we know what happens when Democrats organize and get to the polls. Just look at what happened in 2018. Because of the efforts from individuals like you, we secured historic majorities in the state senate and house, and elected Governor Ned Lamont to office.
The present circumstances have made it abundantly clear the importance of Democratic leadership at all levels of government. Democrats are focused on leading, and Republicans are focused on spreading misinformation and dividing our country.
At the 2016 Democratic National Convention, President Obama said, “Don’t boo. Vote.” We couldn't agree more. So on his birthday, follow his lead by pledging to vote for Democrats in 2020.
Don’t Boo. Vote.

Robert Hyde is one of the Republicans trying to unseat Jahana Hayes this year. Yesterday, he was reportedly visited by the FBI due to his alleged involvement in the Ukraine saga that led to President Trump’s impeachment.

The House Intelligence Committee released texts suggesting that Hyde was involved in efforts to surveil and remove a U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine.

"Unprecedented times call for unprecedented unity Connecticut Democrats
Hi Alex —
From all of us at the Connecticut Democratic Party, we sincerely hope that you and your family are safe during this unprecedented global crisis. So much has happened just in the past week, and every American’s life has been changed.
Connecticut is no exception. The latest testing results show that over 150 Connecticut residents have tested positive for the coronavirus. As we move forward, we must all continue working together to protect our neighbors and limit the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak.
Governor Lamont and state government officials have been working around the clock to enact measures designed to stop the spread of the virus and save lives:
* Connecticut's presidential primary has been postponed until June 2nd.
* Public schools have been closed for at least the remainder of March.
* Non-essential businesses like gyms, movie theaters, casinos, performance venues, and now hair and nail salons are temporarily closed.
* Restaurants and bars are now only open for deliveries, and grocery stores have introduced modified and special hours to accommodate public needs.
According to the Connecticut Department of Economic and Community Development, half of Connecticut’s businesses currently remain open at full capacity, while 39% are running at reduced capacity, and 12% are now closed.
These measures will save lives, but the economic effects are already clear. 80% of Connecticut’s businesses are expected to see significant revenue declines. More than 56,000 Connecticut workers have filed for unemployment benefits since last week, and that number will likely continue to rise in the weeks ahead.
This is truly an unprecedented moment — but Alex, we are going to get through this together.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that everyone follow these measures throughout this crisis in order to keep yourself and your neighbors safe:
* Avoid gatherings of 10 or more people.
* Wash your hands frequently using soap and water for at least 20 seconds.
* Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
* Stay home as much as possible, and contact your doctor if you are sick yourself.
* Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces daily.
You can visit the Connecticut coronavirus information hub online here to learn everything you need to know about prevention, preparation, and how you can help others in this difficult time.
Get Informed
If you have become unemployed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, you can file for unemployment benefits by visiting the CT Department of Labor website here.
File for Unemployment Benefits
If you are a small business owner, you may be eligible for a federal disaster assistance loan from the U.S. Small Business Administration — click here to learn more and apply.
Apply for a Small Business Loan
While Governor Lamont works closely with other state governments to enact safety and prevention measures, relief for individuals, workers and businesses is also rapidly being developed at both the state and federal level.
Our team here at the Connecticut Democratic Party will continue updating you on all of the latest information — but please reach out to us if there are any specific questions or concerns that we can help you with by responding to this email.

President Trump has spent his presidency normalizing corruption — and Republicans at the local, state, and federal levels are letting him.
Here in Connecticut, we need to be prepared with the resources to beat the GOP at the ballot box in November. But in order to do that, we need your help to fund a robust field organizing operation capable of getting out the vote for Democrats up and down the ticket.
Can you chip in now to help Connecticut Democrats win this year? We’re still $10,000 short of our monthly budget goal, and we need to pick up the pace this week to get there.
These monthly budget goals are essential. We know that Republicans have raised HUGE sums of money throughout Trump’s presidency, and we know that every cent will be directed at ending Democratic majorities across the country — not to mention keeping Trump in the White House.
Democrats fought hard in 2018 to secure majorities at the state and federal levels. This year, we’ll need to fight twice as hard to win. That’s why we can’t afford to come up short this month.

Voting Trump out will not be enough to silence the culture of hate and bigotry that he has normalized in our country.
Every Connecticut Republican on the ballot supports Trump 100% — to defeat Trumpism, we must vote ALL of them out on November 3rd.
More than 400,000 ballots have already been returned in Connecticut, Alex. Chip in what you can to our GOTV Fund to help us mobilize every Democratic voter in this final stretch.

"Alex,
In just two months, we’ll find out if our work organizing support for Democrats up and down the ballot this year was enough to defeat Trump and his GOP allies.
Here at Connecticut Democrats HQ, we want to make sure we’re focusing our resources where they’re needed most in the leadup to November 3rd.
Alex, you are an important part of our team — let us know where you think we should focus our resources for these final two months before Election Day by answering our survey here:
ANSWER HERE
We can’t have a repeat of 2016. As Michelle Obama said, “If we have any hope of ending this chaos, we have got to vote for Joe Biden like our lives depend on it.”
But Democrats all the way down the ballot will need our help throughout the next two months to ensure victory on Election Night — a Biden-Harris administration will need a Democratic House and Senate on their side in order to undo the Trump administration’s damage.
That’s why we want your feedback about where we should focus our resources. Answer within the next 24 hours to ensure your response is included in our final results.

Every Connecticut Republican on the ballot this year wants Donald Trump to win a second term, and Donald Trump believes that no matter what happens on Election Day, he’s entitled to a second term.
Let’s be clear Alex: the peaceful transition of power is foundational to preserving American democracy. Trump is taking us into dangerous territory.
But we the people have the power to hold this president and every Republican who stands with him accountable. We’re going to organize, we’re going to vote, and with your help we’re going to win.
Donate $10 to the Connecticut Democratic Party now to help us mobilize support for Democrats up and down the ballot in these final 39 days before Election Day.
Tomorrow, Trump is going to announce his nominee to replace Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
The stakes of this election were already impossibly high — now, the future of women’s rights, affordable healthcare, and our very democracy is at risk. The only way to defeat Trumpism now and forever is to defeat all his enablers, in Connecticut and all around the country.
Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and every Democrat on the ballot this year are counting on us. Chip in what you can now to help us turn out more votes for Democrats before absentee voting begins in Connecticut.

Her opponent, Margaret Streicker, has been referred to as one of “New York City’s 10 Worst Landlords” by The Village Voice — she was even fined $1.2 million by the New York Attorney General because of her mistreatment and abuse of tenants.
Now, she’s using her wealth to attack Rosa every day on TV with negative ads. These ads claim that “Rosa gets nothing done” — but Connecticut knows better.
We know that Rosa has fought tirelessly throughout her entire career to protect working families, women’s rights, and our social safety net. She is leading the fight in Congress to guarantee paid family and medical leave for all, make healthcare a right for every American, and end the gender wage gap.

We’re not even three weeks into 2020, and already the Connecticut GOP has been forced to denounce a Republican running for Congress in Connecticut.
Robert Hyde is one of the Republicans trying to unseat Jahana Hayes this year. Yesterday, he was reportedly visited by the FBI due to his alleged involvement in the Ukraine saga that led to President Trump’s impeachment.
This story has received national attention, and it’s a perfect example of why we need to mobilize in support of Democratic victories this year. Donate to Connecticut Democrats now to ensure that we have the resources necessary to win throughout 2020.

The House Intelligence Committee released texts suggesting that Hyde was involved in efforts to surveil and remove a U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine.
As CT Dems Chair Nancy Wyman said, Hyde is exactly the kind of candidate that Donald Trump inspires — someone who has no respect for women, the law or, common decency.

"Alex,
Through good times and bad, essential workers have kept the United States running — from our post offices and grocery stores to our hospitals and schools. During a historic pandemic that’s claimed almost 200,000 American lives and devastated our economy, we’ve relied on them more than ever before.
That’s why compassionate — and competent — leadership is critical right now. President Trump and his GOP enablers in Congress have repeatedly failed the country since the pandemic began. From blocking relief in Congress to denying the severity of COVID-19, their ineptitude has cost us dearly.
Our teachers, nurses, bus drivers, grocery store workers, and many others have taken the brunt of this historic failure. This week, students and educators across Connecticut will face the uncertainty and danger of this moment as schools reopen for in-person learning.
This Labor Day, as we reflect on America’s working families, let’s remember how important it is that we show up and elect leaders in November who actually care about governing.
It’s on us to end this national nightmare.
Let’s make our voting plans, be they early or on Election Day, and cast our ballots for champions of American workers. Let’s vote for Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and Democrats all the way down the ballot in Connecticut.
We can do this,
CT Democrats

"Join Rosa DeLauro in taking action for Connecticut workers during this public health emergency Connecticut Democrats
Alex —
For most Americans, staying home from work means losing a paycheck — and sometimes, losing a job. During a public health crisis like the coronavirus, workers should not be forced to choose between their health and their livelihood.
Connecticut Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro just introduced a bill that would secure paid sick days for all Americans during public health emergencies. Rosa’s bill is critical, and we need to show our support.
Sign our petition if you agree that every American needs access to paid sick leave during public health emergencies.
Support Rosa's Bill
Rosa’s bill would allow workers to earn seven days of sick leave per year, and give them an immediate additional 14 days of paid sick leave in the event of a national emergency.
Alex, Connecticut is now in a state of emergency due to the coronavirus. We need to ensure that everyone is able to stay home when they are sick to help keep our families and neighbors safe.
That is why we are proud to support Rosa’s bill — will you join us?

Another four years of Trump would drastically endanger the future of our democracy itself. We must choose a different path.
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will bolster and expand Obamacare, enforce safe and fair workplace laws, ensure pay equity for women, pass paid family medical leave protections like we have here in Connecticut, and pass much-needed federal COVID-19 relief.
On Tuesday, we take the first step to restoring the soul of our nation. Donate now to help Connecticut Democrats get out the vote for Democrats in these final days.

The Billion-Dollar Disinformation Campaign to Reelect the President
— The Atlantic
* * *
Donald Trump loves to lie. Obscuring the truth comes naturally to him, and disinformation has become one of his most effective political tools.
Trump’s campaign is now planning to spend more than $1 billion to help him get reelected — and as The Atlantic reports, spreading disinformation at an unprecedented scale is at the heart of their 2020 strategy.
Will you chip in to help Connecticut Democrats combat the GOP’s disinformation campaign this year? Trump-inspired Republicans are running for office all across the country this year, even here in Connecticut, and we need your help to defeat them.
Alex, Trump’s campaign understands how effective disinformation is thanks to modern technology and social media.
That’s why the Trump campaign intends to train “swarms of surrogates” to undermine negative news coverage, a tactic that some scholars have referred to as “censorship through noise.”
We must combat this billion-dollar disinformation campaign, but we can’t do it without the proper resources. Donate whatever you can now to help us ensure that Donald Trump is a one-term president.
There are already Trump acolytes in Connecticut. Just look at one of the Trump-supporting Republicans trying to unseat Jahana Hayes who was reportedly visited by the FBI last month due to his alleged involvement in the Trump Ukraine scandal.
Alex, Trump’s war on the truth has inspired dangerous candidates to run for office. We need to be prepared with the resources to defeat them this year.
Donate to Connecticut Democrats now to help counter Trump’s billion-dollar disinformation campaign.

"Alex —
We all know what happened. Democrats in the House took a stand against President Trump. They took their responsibility to the Constitution seriously and voted to impeach him.
After Mitch McConnell’s sham trial in the Senate, Trump got off with crimes and misdemeanors — now, Trump and the GOP want to flip the House red.
The GOP and their super PACs are pouring money into Connecticut to try and unseat Democrats EVERYWHERE. That includes our five Democratic members of Congress.
All of the progress we made in 2018 could be undone unless we fight back.
That’s why we need to raise $6,000 before February ends. Your grassroots donations will help ensure that Democrats in Connecticut can fight back and keep their seats. So before the end of the month, I need you to chip in $17 now.

"We need your help to put pressure on Senate Republicans Connecticut Democrats
Alex,
Earlier this month, the U.S. House of Representatives passed new COVID-19 relief legislation.
This $3 trillion stimulus package (the Heroes Act) builds on the progress made by the other multi-trillion dollar legislation passed in the last couple of months, but also goes much further to help cities and states, workers, families, and small businesses through this crisis.
In addition to $875 billion to support struggling state and local governments, this bill includes another round of $1,200 stimulus checks, increased funding for testing, extended unemployment benefits, $10 billion more for small businesses, $25 billion to help save the United States Postal Service from disaster, and much more.
But the Republican Senate is refusing to put this bill up for a vote — that’s why we need you to add your name here to help us put pressure on the GOP and demand action from the Senate. Sign your name now to demand that Senate Republicans work with Democrats to pass this bill.
Add Your Name
As Speaker Nancy Pelosi said, “Republicans are engaging in a clear act of political retribution” in an effort to help President Trump get re-elected.
Despite the fact that nearly 39 million Americans have filed for unemployment in the last 9 weeks, Republicans are refusing to work with Democrats to pass another stimulus package.
Alex, this is unacceptable, and we need to take action. Will you sign our petition now to demand that Republicans bring the Heroes Act up for a vote?
While Senate Republicans ignore reality, the Democratic House has worked hard to meet the urgent needs of the American people with the Heroes Act.
Connecticut’s own Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro played a major role in shaping this bill to expand paid family and sick leave to include essential workers that were previously left out, reduce child poverty by expanding the Child Tax Credit, and increasing the food stamps program by 15%.
This comprehensive legislation helps laid-off workers pay for health care costs, provides much-needed housing assistance to renters and homeowners, and $200 billion in hazard pay for the essential workers who are putting their lives at risk every day.
The American people need more relief now, not whenever Mitch McConnell and his GOP allies feel like it. Add your name to our petition now to join us in demanding that Senate Republicans take immediate action on the Heroes Act.
Add Your Name

"Alex,
We need to talk about the horrifying attacks that Connecticut’s Congresswomen have been subjected to this week — please be warned, the descriptions of these attacks are disturbing.
First: During a virtual community meeting, a group of racists coordinated to attack Congresswoman Jahana Hayes and her campaign team with six minutes of vile, racist hate speech that we will not repeat here.
Then: Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro was forced to respond after someone created and distributed an extremely graphic photo that depicted a Christopher Columbus statue holding her decapitated head.
Let us be clear: there is no room in Connecticut for these attacks. On November 3rd, we must send a strong message that our state rejects the culture of hate that Donald Trump has normalized in the United States.
We’re spending the next 18 days ensuring that Jahana, Rosa, and every other Democrat on the ticket wins big. Will you sign up now to help us get out the vote?

Polls have officially closed for today’s Democratic presidential primary here in Connecticut, and our team here at CT Dems HQ is so proud of everyone who cast their vote in this election.

"Hi Alex —
The U.S. Senate has unanimously passed the third federal COVID-19 relief package. Here’s what this bill does:
* Over $375 billion in grants and loans for small businesses
* A cash payment of up to $1,200 per adult, $500 per child
* $150 billion for our health care system and another $150 billion for state and local governments
* Greatly expanded unemployment benefits that include gig-workers, contractors and the self-employed
* Restrictions on stock buybacks and CEO raises for corporations receiving bailout money
Now it’s the U.S. House’s turn to vote on the relief package, which is expected to pass today.
This bill has a lot in it, so we want to know what you think about it. Do you support this latest federal COVID-19 relief package? Let us know what you think here:

Connecticut now has more than 1,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19. While the federal government works to protect working people and small businesses during this crisis, what we do on the state level is just as important.
Over the last two weeks, around 148,000 Connecticut residents have applied for unemployment benefits. Governor Lamont and the CT Department of Economic and Community Development have launched a program to help small businesses, nonprofits, and their employees in our state during this crisis.
The Connecticut Recovery Bridge Loan Program provides 0% interest loans of up to $75,000 (or three months of operating expenses) to small businesses and nonprofits negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. You can find more information about this program and learn how to apply online here.

Hi Alex, I hope that you and your family are safe and healthy. As you know, Governor Lamont and I have been working hard to address every aspect of the health and economic crisis facing Connecticut. I’m incredibly proud of our shared efforts so far, and I want to thank you for doing your part, Alex!
The health and economic crisis facing our state right now is unprecedented, but there’s nobody I’d rather work alongside at a moment like this than Ned. His compassionate and unwavering leadership is keeping us safe — a stark contrast with Republican leaders like Donald Trump.
Today, I’m reaching out on behalf of my friends at the Connecticut Democratic Party to ask if you can help them elect more Democratic leaders like Ned this November.
Can you activate a $10 monthly contribution to the Connecticut Democratic Party to help them make that happen? Their work mobilizing Democrats is critically important, and they’re relying on your support to continue this work online.
Donate Now
Social distancing means that all of the critical work that the CT Democratic Party does has gone online-only — that includes training events, volunteer organizing, and the in-person fundraisers that make all of this work possible.
As a result, online donations have become more important than ever before. CT Dems are working to elect Democrats in races big and small across our state — and that includes making Donald Trump a one-term president — but they can’t do it without your support.
If you’re able to, please make a $10 monthly contribution today to help Connecticut Democrats invest in online organizing and help Democrats up and down the ballot win this year.

Governor Lamont has led our state to flattening the coronavirus curve. We now have the lowest transmission rate in the entire country thanks to his ability to make tough calls that save lives.
Connecticut is also taking decisive action to address the systemic racism and police brutality crisis plaguing our nation.

Alex,
Polls have officially closed for today’s Democratic presidential primary here in Connecticut, and our team here at CT Dems HQ is so proud of everyone who cast their vote in this election.
Now, it’s time to get ready for November’s election — and with Joe Biden’s big announcement today that Senator Kamala Harris will be his running mate, we couldn’t be more excited to get to work.
Every time that we polled Connecticut Democrats supporters about who you wanted Joe to choose for his VP, Kamala Harris was consistently a top contender.
This is an exciting moment, Alex, but our work is really just beginning. Election Day is just 84 days away, and Democrats nationwide must unite to help send Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to the White House.
Will you chip in now to help Connecticut Democrats support the newly announced Biden Harris ticket? We’re counting on you to help us get out the vote for the Democratic ticket throughout these final 84 days.

"After 47 years, we're still fighting for reproductive rights
Hi Alex — do you know the story of Gerri Santoro?
Gerri was raised in Coventry, CT. In 1964, she died in a hotel room in Norwich, CT after receiving an illegal abortion. She was only 28 years old.
After her death, a graphic photo taken of her body galvanized thousands to fight for reproductive justice, and Gerri became a symbol of the pro-choice movement.
47 years ago today, that movement culminated in the Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade decision which guaranteed every woman the right to safely terminate a pregnancy.
Alex, that right is now under attack — this month, more than 200 Republican members of Congress called on the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade, and soon the most anti-choice court in modern history will hear an abortion rights case.
TAKE ACTION: Honor the memory of Connecticut women like Gerri Santoro who died for our right to choose by signing your name in support of reproductive rights.
Add Your Name
Connecticut is one of only 13 states in the country that guarantees the right to an abortion by state law. Even if Roe v. Wade is overturned, that right will persist.
We must fight to ensure that every American woman has that same right. Celebrate the 47th anniversary of Roe v. Wade by signing your name in support of reproductive freedom.

What do you think about the impeachment process right now? Answer here to let us know→
Answer Here
Republicans want you to think that Democrats are solely focused on impeachment. But Alex, while the GOP has been busy making every excuse in the book for President Trump this year, the Democratic House has passed nearly 400 bills on everything from lowering healthcare costs to preventing gun violence.
The Republican Senate has killed nearly every one of these bills in an attempt to block all Democratic progress until next year’s elections — but 2020 is almost here, and we can soon hold the entire GOP accountable for their actions by voting them out of office.
Take a moment to respond to our short survey to let us know your thoughts on the impeachment proceedings and how we can hold Republicans accountable in 2020→
Thank you for staying engaged in the political process, Alex — and a special thanks to each and every supporter who pitched in to help us reach our November fundraising goal.
2020 will be a monumental year for our country, and your support will play a major role in our county’s future.

"RSVP here for Racial Justice: What the Moment Demands Connecticut Democrats
Hi Alex, it's Erick Russell, Vice Chair of the Connecticut Democratic Party.
I'm inviting you to join me on Wednesday, July 1st at 7:00 p.m. ET along with CSEA SEIU Organizing Director Eva Bermúdez Zimmerman for a special and timely conversation with retired professional tennis star, author, and Connecticut native James Blake.
This discussion will address racial injustice in society today and ways that we can unite the country through individual interactions and strong leaders in public office.

James Blake was born in New York, but he grew up here in Connecticut. He started playing tennis at five, and was inspired to pursue a professional career after hearing a speech by Arthur Ashe.
In 2015, James was thrown to the ground, handcuffed, and arrested by a plainclothes New York City cop who said he believed James was a suspect of interest.
He has used that experience to take an active stand on police brutality against minorities. James' experience is particularly meaningful today, as we all look for a path forward.
I hope that you will RSVP here for what is sure to be a great discussion!

"Jacqueline is right, Alex: the work we do here at the Connecticut Democratic Party to elect strong, compassionate leaders is now more critical than ever.
We’re working hard right now to protect our Democratic majorities in the state legislature and U.S. House, defeat Donald Trump, and win a Democratic majority in the U.S. Senate. Electing Democrats like Governor Lamont up and down the ballot is how we’re going to continue on the path to recovery.
But we need your support to keep going. Donate $10 before Tuesday’s end-of-quarter fundraising deadline to help us continue mobilizing to elect Democratic leaders.

Original Message from CT Dems Executive Director Jacqueline Kozin:
Alex,
With Connecticut now leading the nation in containing the coronavirus pandemic, we must acknowledge the role Governor Lamont’s unwavering leadership has played in bringing us to this point.
This crisis has reminded us why steady, compassionate leadership matters — and why the work we do here at the Connecticut Democratic Party to elect those leaders matters too.
On Tuesday, we’re up against the biggest end-of-quarter fundraising deadline of the year. If we reach our $25,000 goal, we’ll be able to expand our voter outreach efforts throughout this summer in the leadup to Election Day.
Can we count on you to donate $10 to Connecticut Democrats now to help us elect more leaders like Governor Lamont in November? Republicans are working hard to make up the ground they lost in 2018, and we can’t afford to give them an inch.
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will process immediately:
EXPRESS DONATE $10
EXPRESS DONATE $17

EXPRESS DONATE $100
DONATE ANOTHER AMOUNT
Every dollar that you contribute will expand our voter outreach programs in the weeks ahead so we can protect our majorities in the state legislature and make Donald Trump a one term president.
Thank you for supporting Connecticut Democrats, Alex!

"Alex,
It’s been 19 years since the deadliest terrorist attack in human history shook our country.
Today, the Connecticut Democratic Party remembers and honors the nearly 3,000 lives that were taken from us, and our thoughts are with every family who lost loved ones on that tragic and painful day.
After the September 11, 2001 attacks, the American people came together for a period of national unity and care for one another. Sadly, we have seen that unity deteriorate.
As our nation approaches 200,000 deaths from COVID-19, the American people are more divided than ever. In this new period of American tragedy we need leaders who can bring us together to heal and move forward, not divide us further.
Steady, compassionate leadership matters — and the work we do here at the Connecticut Democratic Party to elect those leaders matters too.
Republican leaders like Donald Trump fan the flames of division every day. In just 53 days, Americans have a chance to prove at the ballot box that we’re ready to come together and reject hatred, bigotry, and fear by electing leaders who represent our real American values.
Together, let’s move forward.

"Hi Alex, I hope that you and your family are staying safe and enjoying a relaxing long weekend.
Today is Memorial Day, and I want to take a moment to reflect on the immense sacrifices that so many military service members and their family members have made throughout American history.
All of us at the Connecticut Democratic Party are so grateful for the bravery and commitment of those who have served in the United States Armed Forces. As we honor their service today, we must also commit to treasuring the freedoms that these brave men and women have fought so hard to defend.
American democracy is fragile, and it is incumbent on all of us to work together each day to protect it by engaging in our communities and participating in the political process. That is how we can truly honor those who have sacrificed everything for our country.
So today, as we pay tribute to the brave Americans who devoted their lives to serving our country, please join me in committing to working every day to strengthen our democracy and fight for justice for every American.

"Tell us if you think President Trump is handling the COVID-19 crisis well Connecticut Democrats
Alex, the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed President Trump’s inability to lead.
Every step of the way the president has lied about his administration’s inaction, belittled reporters and Democratic governors, and promoted dangerous pseudoscience and conspiracy theories.
Do you approve of President Trump’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic? Let us know by answering our Presidential Approval Poll now.
Respond Here
Alex, the Trump administration was warned by both American and international health experts about COVID-19, and they had time to prepare — but they chose not to. That left us without enough test kits, personal protective equipment (PPE), and other vital medical resources.
Instead of acknowledging his administration’s failures and adapting accordingly, President Trump has focused his energy on blaming others, contradicting health experts, and trying to “terminate” the Affordable Care Act.
But what do you think? Let us know by answering our Presidential Approval Poll here.
While the Trump administration ignores the advice of experts, Connecticut is moving forward with plans informed by science.
Governor Lamont has worked closely with health experts and neighboring state leaders to guide us through this health and economic crisis. His ability to make tough calls has saved lives in our state, and we’re grateful for his compassionate and unwavering leadership.
Please answer our poll to let us know what you think about President Trump’s response throughout the COVID-19 pandemic compared to Governor Lamont’s.

We’re not leaving anything to chance. Tonight at 5:30 p.m. ET, we’re hosting a virtual phone bank to support the entire Democratic ticket, including two candidates for the CT legislature.
The pandemic means that phone banking will play a crucial role in this year's election. We’ll be hosting a virtual phone bank every Monday and Wednesday, as well as sending texts and making phone calls for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in Connecticut and in critical swing states.

Alex,
With millions of Americans practicing social distancing and self-isolation due to COVID-19, normal Democratic campaign activities like door-to-door canvassing are on hold.
But even during a pandemic, democracy goes on — and that means we need to continue getting organized in the lead up to Election Day 2020. That’s why we’re inviting you to join two virtual training sessions tomorrow morning hosted by the CT Democratic Party and the National Democratic Training Committee.
The first training (beginning at 10:00 a.m. ET) will be focused on grassroots organizing, voter persuasion, and volunteer recruitment. The second training (beginning at 11:45 a.m. ET) will be focused on grassroots fundraising and how to navigate building, organizing, and prioritizing donor lists.

"Hi Alex,
I’m a Connecticut Democrat. As Chair of the CT Democratic Party, I believe in a world founded on freedom of speech, freedom of worship, freedom from want, and freedom from fear.
That’s what I work for every day. But as our state and our country face the COVID-19 pandemic head-on, millions of Americans are now unable to live without fear — fear of when their next paycheck will arrive, if their family can afford health care, or to pay their rent or mortgage.
This is why Democrats must mobilize. President Trump has thoroughly proven that he’s incapable of leadership, and that he’s more focused on self-promotion than protecting American lives. Yet his Republican allies continue to support him — a Connecticut GOP leader in Stamford recently claimed that the pandemic is “overblown.”
This rhetoric is irresponsible, and President Trump’s behavior is downright dangerous. CT Dems are organizing to ensure that Democrats win up and down the ballot this November because we need real leadership now more than ever — but we can’t do this important work without your support.
Can you chip in to support the CT Democratic Party before tonight’s end-of-quarter fundraising deadline? We’re still about 100 donations short of reaching our goal — and now that all of our work has gone digital, we can’t afford to miss this goal.

Democrats must mobilize to ensure that not only is Donald Trump defeated in November, but that Democrats up and down the ballot succeed too. We can do this, but not without the proper resources.
With all of our fundraising digital-only, supporting candidates, training volunteers, and holding elections now all relies upon us raising enough funds to support our quarterly budget. That is why your online support matters now more than ever.
Any amount that you can contribute would make a huge difference — and if you donate $100 or more, we’ll send you a CT Dems “This Is Why I Mobilize” shirt to show our appreciation!

"Alex,
With absentee voting underway for Connecticut’s August 11th Democratic presidential primary, we must ensure that Connecticut is also prepared to vote safely in November.
This week, the Connecticut legislature will meet for a special session to address several issues, including absentee voting in November’s general election.
Do you think that Connecticut voters should be able to vote absentee in November’s general election?
Yes!
No!
Connecticut Democrats are fighting to ensure that no voter has to choose between voting and their health during this pandemic.
But a group of Connecticut Republicans has filed a lawsuit claiming that expanding absentee voting to include November’s election is “unlawful and unconstitutional.”
Alex, here’s the truth: 220 million Americans live in 34 states plus Washington, D.C. where mail-in voting or no-excuse absentee ballots are already in use — and Connecticut is one of just 11 states that doesn’t allow early voting.
Absentee voting is safe, secure and easy — do you think that Connecticut voters should be able to vote absentee in November’s general election? Answer here to let us know what you think.

Thank you for your response,

Original Message from CT Democratic Party Chair Nancy DiNardo:
Hi Alex,
Since being elected to serve again as Chair of the Connecticut Democratic Party, I’ve been focused on expanding our efforts to get out the vote for Democrats in these final four months before Election Day.
With Connecticut leading the country in containing COVID-19, we must be prepared for the day when it’s safe to resume knocking on doors across the state. That’s why Tuesday’s end-of-quarter fundraising deadline couldn’t be more important.
Connecticut Democrats need to raise $25,000 before June ends to expand our voter outreach throughout this summer. Right now, we’re about 50% short of this goal. Can you chip in now to help us get there?

Republicans are already out knocking on doors across the country in support of Donald Trump’s re-election campaign. How we respond this summer will determine everything.
The GOP is investing the huge sums of money they’ve raised throughout Trump’s presidency in a massive nationwide field operation and negative ad campaign. We’re preparing to fight back, but first we need to reach this goal.
The Connecticut Democratic Party needs your support to invest further in reaching voters this summer. Can you contribute $10 before June ends to help us expand our voter outreach program this summer?
Thank you for your support,
Nancy DiNardo

"Trump's administration doesn't care if your local post office closes Connecticut Democrats
Hi Alex —
Every day, millions of Americans rely on the United States Postal Service (USPS) for their life-saving medications and other critical packages.
Sadly, the Trump administration and Republicans have repeatedly rejected Democrats' efforts to save the post office. Now, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer says that without emergency funding, the USPS is on the verge of shutting down.
Alex, now that absentee voting has become a critical part of safe and secure elections, the USPS is more important to our democracy than ever before.
We can’t let it shut down. Sign our petition and demand that Trump and congressional Republicans save the USPS before it’s too late→
Save the USPS
USPS workers are risking their lives to ensure that Americans receive groceries, prescriptions, census forms, and now in many states, ballots.
But the Trump administration's newly appointed postmaster general — a major Trump donor — is slashing overtime pay for USPS workers and plans to delay mail deliveries.
We need to do our part to protect this invaluable American service. Add your name now to demand that the USPS is fully protected.
Getting rid of the post office is not a new idea for Republicans. Trump and his cronies have been working to defund or privatize the USPS for years. They are counting on your apathy.
Connecticut's congressional delegation has been fighting to secure emergency funding to save the USPS — but they need your help.
Sign on now to demand that Trump and congressional Republicans fund the people’s postal service.
Save the USPS
Thank you for protecting the people’s postal service,

I’m proud to serve as your governor, but I didn’t get here by chance — I was elected thanks to an outpouring of grassroots support from Democrats like you in 2018.
Since then, we’ve made a lot of progress together in our state — $15 an hour minimum wage, the most comprehensive paid family and medical leave law in the country, and for the last few months we’ve led the nation in addressing the health and economic crisis still gripping our nation.
I’m incredibly proud of our shared efforts so far, and I’d like to thank you for doing your part, Alex. But our work is far from finished. We must take action now to ensure that we elect leaders who are ready to address the unprecedented crises in front of us head-on.
CT Dems have been working tirelessly to mobilize all of the incredible Democratic volunteers and organizers we have in Connecticut to ensure that we repeat the success we had in 2018. Donate now to help them get out the vote for Democrats in races big and small all across our state.
Together, let’s move forward. Thank you, and stay safe!

Trump is unfit for office — we all know this — but the Connecticut GOP sees things differently.
That’s because like Trump, they don’t value science: Connecticut’s Republican House Minority Leader Themis Klarides recently suggested that the importance of wearing a mask is debatable.
And like Trump, they don’t value safe voting: every Republican in the Connecticut Senate voted to prevent absentee voting in the general election, and wanted to get rid of drop boxes as well.
We have to vote them out. Chip in now to help us get out the vote for Democrats in Connecticut in these final weeks before absentee voting begins→

"Alex,
Throughout the United States, millions of Americans have demanded a permanent end to the systemic oppression of Black Americans and an end to the injustices that lead to mass incarceration and deadly encounters with police.
Here in Connecticut, state legislators heard these demands and took action by passing transformative police accountability legislation last month, which Governor Lamont has now signed into law.
This should be cause for celebration — but a co-ordinated misinformation and harassment campaign has made baseless charges about this new law, all to frighten Connecticut residents into standing against justice.
We’re here to set the record straight, Alex. To combat the cowards who are spreading misinformation, we’ve compiled a list of facts about what this police accountability legislation actually does. Take a look here.
Get the Facts
Black Americans are fighting for their lives, families, and communities — we must fight to make this the year when it all began to permanently change.
Connecticut Democrats stand in solidarity with all of the Connecticut legislators who took brave action against injustice by supporting this new law.
Show that you stand with us against those who are spreading lies and think threatening state legislators with violent retribution is acceptable.

"Republicans are getting worried, Alex: Connecticut Democrats
CNN: GOP operatives worry Trump will lose both the presidency and Senate majority
Alex, we are mobilizing Democrats to win back the White House and U.S. Senate — and Republicans are getting worried.
As CNN reported yesterday, Republican strategists are raising the alarm about “what they worry could be a wipeout for the GOP.” Recent polls have shown that our hard work is paying off, and if we keep it up, we’re on track to defeat Donald Trump and win a Democratic Senate majority.
But a lot can happen between now and November. The GOP sees what Democrats are capable of when we’re united, and they will spare no expense to stop us.
Connecticut Democrats are counting on your grassroots support to help us continue organizing for Democratic victories up and down the ballot. Will you donate before May ends tomorrow at midnight to help us reach our $10,000 end-of-month fundraising goal?
Although Connecticut and other states have begun the process of gradually reopening, social distancing continues to limit our ability to organize on the ground.
That means all of the critical work that the CT Democratic Party does to help elect Democrats is still online-only — including training events, volunteer organizing, and the in-person fundraisers that make all of this work possible. Even this month’s Democratic State Convention was virtual!
Online support from Democrats like you has enabled us to continue organizing remotely without missing a beat. Now that the GOP has raised the alarm, we have to double down.
Donate to the Connecticut Democratic Party before midnight tomorrow to help us keep doing the work necessary to defeat Donald Trump and his GOP allies down the ballot in November. Democrats are on a path toward victory, and your support will help us get there.

On Tuesday, we’re up against the biggest end-of-quarter fundraising deadline of the year. If we reach our $25,000 goal, we’ll be able to expand our voter outreach efforts throughout this summer in the leadup to Election Day.

With Election Day less than 7 weeks away, the Connecticut GOP is focusing their resources on turning out votes for Republicans in competitive districts throughout our state.
The Connecticut Democratic Party is fighting back. This week we launched our new bi-weekly virtual phone bank to support the entire 2020 Democratic ticket — from State Assembly and Senate candidates to Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.
Can you donate $10 now to help us expand our virtual voter outreach program before October? We need to raise $50,000 by the end of this month to ensure that Democrats in tough races across the state have the resources they need to win.
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will process immediately:
EXPRESS DONATE $10
EXPRESS DONATE $25
EXPRESS DONATE $50
EXPRESS DONATE $100
DONATE ANOTHER AMOUNT
With the ongoing pandemic, virtual voter outreach like phone banking and texting will play an absolutely crucial role in November’s election.
This week CT Dems staff and volunteers have made phone calls in support of the entire Democratic ticket and we’ve been joined by Democrats like Congressman Joe Courtney.
No Democrat can afford to sit on the sidelines this year, Alex — chip in now to help us ramp up our support for Democrats up and down the ballot.
Onward,
Connecticut Democrats

"Hi Friend \--
Great news! There will be a Libertarian Party of Connecticut Affiliate Meeting in all eight counties this month -- for the first time ever. Not only is this a great month to jump in and meet some new Libertarian friends, we need your attendance to make these meetings overwhelmingly successful.
Please check out the full calendar of events at [[URL REDACTED]] and RSVP to the meeting in your county today! These are informal gatherings at a local restaurant to hoist a beer, chat with liberty-minded folks, learn more about the LP of CT, and help us grow our party. We have established affiliates in some counties and new leaders who've stepped up to start new county affiliates as well.
If you'd like to be a part of the growth happening in the Libertarian Party of Connecticut, then please make your attendance at your county's affiliate meeting a priority. We look forward to meeting you and advancing the cause of Liberty in our state together!
Thank you!

September 5, 2020
Friend \-- here is my letter in response to five more months of emergency powers & executive orders here in our State Of Connecticut.
Fellow Citizens of Connecticut:
The State of Connecticut was ordered to be under a State of Emergency by Governor Ned Lamont on March 9, 2020. In doing so, thousands of businesses, schools, churches and community centers were closed and millions of citizens forced into lockdown. Our state was ordered to comply with a period of “15 Days To Flatten The Curve.” We are now 173 days into Lamont’s rule by emergency power.
The intent was to protect our emergency workers and medical facilities from the coming wave of infections and deaths due to COVID-19 in our state. Many in our state suffered the tragic loss of a loved one, to whom we share our consolation. Others deserve our thanks as they worked as first responders to a medical emergency in our state. Your efforts are appreciated and to be commended.
Currently, the citizens of Connecticut have been presented no definitive date or metric by which Governor Ned Lamont will declare the end to the “state of emergency”.
On average, Connecticut has had an infection rate of under 1% for weeks. Eighteen days of August had zero deaths. None. In the last fourteen days, CT has seen 11 COVID-related fatalities, which is 0.79 deaths per day on average. Less than one.
If these scientific metrics do not justify the rescinding of the state of emergency, then which will, Governor?
This week, instead of rescinding these emergency powers, Lamont declared the renewal of the state of emergency for five months until February 9, 2021. Today, our “Gang of 10”, the special committee of CT legislators who may vote to reject Lamont’s renewed emergency declaration, voted in support, 6-4.
With six months lead time, $2,000,000 spent on consulting, and his team of experts at his side, Lamont did not include one metric by which to reopen the state completely, or any mechanism to reengage the State Legislature in real and meaningful decision-making. Their only plan: one man ruling by Executive Order solely over our entire state for up to 11 months.
Governor Lamont said he doesn’t “want to make this a political process” when having to make regulations to justify renewing the emergency powers, when Executive Order is such an easier process for him to “keep us safe.”
Well, Governor Lamont, welcome to America. We have political process. We have representative government. We have elections of Legislators whom the people consent to make law regarding the affairs of the People of Connecticut. We do not consent to be ruled by a Governor with emergency powers and executive orders.
With over 750,000 citizens unemployed, families in Connecticut are still without jobs and livelihoods. Businesses and entire industries are still widely closed, and many more local small business owners struggling to survive in this environment every day, many reportedly within days or weeks of closing.
Thousands of citizens have gone bankrupt or lost their life savings, and many are struggling to meet the basic needs of their families today. Tenants can’t afford their rent, and landlords can’t afford their mortgages. Mental health issues are on the rise as churches and social interactions have been stripped from them, just as the stress and financial ruin caused by government lockdowns invaded their lives.
Children are being forced to wear a mask in school, frontline workers are being forced to wear masks for 40 hours a week at minimum wage jobs, and legislators are being told they cannot do their jobs. The projected budget shortfall for the state government will be in the millions or billions of dollars in the upcoming fiscal years due to the projected loss of tax revenue.
The Governor's sole decisions have contributed to needless injury and deaths that will now occur because of physical abuse, substance abuse, suicides, missed cancer screenings and inevitable hospital closures. His rule has been tyrannical, where local authorities either cannot make any sense of the unlawful orders or they selectively enforce them to settle political scores.
Further, Lamont has inserted chaos into our elections and used the $6,000,000 from the CARES Act for elections to unlawfully exclude candidates from the ballot. His orders have created an environment where people locked out of court are increasingly encouraged to resolve their disputes in the streets.
Most of the complaints made against King George III in the Declaration of Independence are now true as to “King” Lamont.
Less than one death per day in a state of 3.56 million people -- and from a disease that was going to “kill millions of Americans”, less than half as many fatalities as medical errors and far less than a third of those who die from heart attacks.
The people of Connecticut join the Libertarian Party of Connecticut to demand the immediate end to the State of Emergency and the emergency powers usurped by our Governor Edward “Ned” Lamont.
Sincerely,
Jonathan Johnson
Vice-Chair, Libertarian Party of CT

Friend --
The actions from Governor Lamont over the last month have been economically devastating for the state of Connecticut. This virus has claimed many lives and each one is a tragedy. Our thoughts and prayers are extended to the loved ones of those we have lost. Thousands of others find themselves without a job and many may not have jobs to return to once this is all over. Hundreds and thousands of people in other states are rising up to say ""Let us work!""
We in the Libertarian Party of Connecticut believe in individual responsibility. It is we the people who are responsible for our own health and activities.
Now, the Libertarian Party of Connecticut calls on Governor Lamont to:
1\. Reopen all businesses and allow citizens to make personal safety and health decisions themselves. Allow people to work and provide for their families again.
2\. Restore our Freedom of Assembly, Speech, and Religion that have been infringed and suspended.
3\. Reject any social and domestic spying as part of our state's reopen, such as GPS tracking and electronic contact tracing.
To voice our dissent, we are hosting a Rolling Rally on Monday 4/20/20 at 5:00pm starting at the State Capitol. We urge any participants to remain peaceful and to voluntarily protect themselves and others in whatever manner they think is best. Those who are ill or at high risk should support us in spirit. We also urge all participants to allow emergency vehicles through and to ensure that our presence on the roads does not inhibit others from traveling to or from important work.
Rise up, Connecticut! Our Freedom & Future are at stake!

"Friend --
Of all the emails I have sent you, this is the most troubling to have to send.
Earlier yesterday, the State of Connecticut had once again taken the approach of not taking any approach as to resolving our ballot access suit currently pending in Hartford Superior Court. The State itself has issued executive orders that shut down the very possibility, indefinitely, that our ballot access suit could proceed.
We were seeking, and filed a 200+ page motion with exhibits (including many affidavits) in support of, an injunction that would forever free us of the unconstitutional burden of having to collect more than 162,000 signatures to permanently obtain ballot access for every office, in the aggregate.
The ballot access process has always been arbitrary, wasteful and an unduly unconstitutional burden.
Yesterday, the State's Assistant Attorney General once again refused to take a position as to whether or not the State of Connecticut would require our volunteers and candidates, including those who are elderly and have compromised health circumstances, to circulate petitions and thus expose themselves to COVID-19 and facilitate its spread.
This is a new low of already existing and profound lows. This comes after the State of Connecticut, in light of what it deemed COVID-19 to be, a public emergency requiring even suspension of the right to speedy trial in criminal cases - a public emergency requiring a shutdown of most of the State economy and any gathering of more than 50 people.
None of us needs to be a public health expert to know this position isn't just inconsistent on the part of the State, but that it is reckless. If the State's data, experts and conclusions say we have a public health emergency and we must maintain social distancing, then it has no right to demand that you or anyone else expose yourselves to danger as the price for having a say in your government.
Such a demand is oppressive. That demand is a profound abuse of power above and beyond the already profound abuse of power previously inherent to petitioning laws. These, and its newest iterations in light of the public health emergency it takes advantage of, render the authority resorting to such an abuse of power illegitimate and tyrannical should it persist.
Of course, this does not stop the State from bending over backwards to facilitate your ability to vote Democrat or Republican (which it has) – the two anointed and chosen parties implicitly enshrined in law. The State of Connecticut has basically said 'Grandma has a right to be healthy and safe – that is until she decides she wants a Libertarian in elected office'.
China has a similar philosophy – you may vote and participate so long as you belong to the Communist Party. Governor Ned Lamont has now made that philosophy an executive order on behalf the the Democratic and Republican Parties. We reject that philosophy, and we stand proud and free in doing so.
In essence, the very last and ultimate benchmark of so called government function, held and prioritized above all else by the State especially in this public emergency, is that it decides who gets to participate in self government, and who doesn't.
The State, in the last week by way of its actions, has exhibited brutal honesty that this is its position.
The State has shut down most businesses. It now overtly acts to shut down all meaningful political speech and association.
Our immediate, full and prompt response is required, and now.
There are three things you can do to help counter this:
1. Spread this message far and wide. Let it be known what Governor Lamont has done, and willfully desires to continue to do, and that you oppose it.
2. Email, write and call Governor Lamont, Secretary of State Denise Merrill and Attorney General William Tong, and tell them all Libertarians deserve and of right ought to be placed on the ballot, pre COVID-19 – and especially now post-COVID-19. No candidate or volunteer should have to risk their health to participate in government. Please DO tell them if you are a volunteer or activist who is elderly or who has a preexisting health condition.
3. If you already haven't. Donate at [[URL REDACTED]] The recent events have immeasurably complicated our efforts and added the likely necessity of a seperate lawsuit in federal court so that we may have our own Superior Court hear the pending case.
Stay safe and be well.
In Liberty,
Dan Reale

As you may know, LPCT v State of Connecticut is expected to allow us to freely nominate without petitions.
We currently have no candidates for Congress in the First, Third, Fourth and Fifth Congressional Districts. we also have 151 General Assembly Seats and 36 State Senate Seats to fill. Pulling a nominating petition from the Secretary of State is just as critical to our ballot access lawsuit (which will show that the process is unconstitutionally burdensome), as it is to say, at our hearing on March 9, that we ought to be able to freely nominate those who have decided to stand and be counted.
Even if you apply for a petition as a placeholder, this helps our efforts. Click here to get started.
If you can't apply for petitions, volunteer or run for office, please consider giving us your most generous donation possible. Libertarians are here to solve problems in elected office. Getting there requires a financial investment that will pay off this year more than any othe r.
Can I count you in?

It is with great sadness that we report the loss of one of the Libertarian Party of Connecticut's longest standing and sustaining members, Courtenay Hough.
Courtenay died September 6, 2020 among loved ones. He will be dearly missed.
Courtenay was the chair of the Stamford Libertarian Town Committee between 1996 and 2006, which he founded. He was a member of our Party since its founding.
His contributions to the Party have been a key to sustaining it to recent times. Those efforts have led to a Party he was happy to see continue to grow. Our work will continue in large part thanks to his.
We appreciate the cause of liberty Courtenay believed in and gave great service to.
A celebration of Courtenay's life will be held at a future date. In lieu of flowers, donations can be made in his honor to: (1) Christian Children's Fund, (2) Boys Town, or (3) Connecticut Food Bank.

As you may know, Ned Lamont invented a brand new, more impossible ballot access scheme known as Executive Order 7LL. He did it contrary to the advice of Denise Merrill, who circulated a memo actually insisting he issue an order putting ALL Libertarians on the ballot without the need for a petition.
We had to appeal the case to the United States Court for the Second Circuit of appeals. The Governor recklessly disregarded that advice and misled the Court as to what 7LL really allowed and really didn't.
In the mean time, the Independent Party has been in touch with us (also a co-Plaintiff), and is giving preference to candidates who did not successfully petition on to the ballot. They have a large number of General Assembly seats with ballot access.
If you are interested in running, please continue to inform us of that interest. We have a chance at winning ballot access in the Second Circuit, which has placed our appeal on an expedited track. If you have already inquired, please reply to this email for further instructions, as we have time sensitive deadlines that have to be met prior to a decision.
Also, and especially if you were not able to collect enough signatures to get on the ballot (and even if you have), please email Mike Telesca, Chair of the Independent Party, with your name, address, phone number and email and indicate the district (State House of Senate) you are interested in running for.
We will have updates as they are forthcomming.
If you already haven't, please donate. The fight reaches critical mass.

If we add candidates for districts 35, 29, 18, 33 and 20 and have candidates running in General Assembly Districts in half of the Second Congressional District (Eastern Connecticut), that would make a substantial difference.
The game plan is the same in Congressional Districts 1, 4 and 5, who we nominated Howard Grayson, Rod Hanscomb and Jonathan Johnson to represent, respectively, at our February 29, 2020 convention. Without the need to petition, we can do this and there is no reason we shouldn't do this.
This calls for candidates and treasurers. Candidates should express interest here, and prospective treasurers should reply to this email. Please also reply to this email if you are interested in joining a local affiliate.
We have done a lot of work on civil liberties over the years, and we have opposed all forms of oppression actively. The Libertarian Party of Connecticut took Governor Lamont to federal court for locking us out of our state court ballot access suit. I took him to court over putting us all on lockdown, and challenged all the executive orders.
Republicans and Democrats fight with themselves and each other. Their ideas are so good that they must be mandatory. We have nothing but less money and less freedom to show for it. Their answers only come in the form of more taxes, restrictions and controls - which they cheer on as spectators.
The Libertarian Party leads. It takes critical action. All your jobs, schools, careers, families and communities are essential to us. No one is non-essential. Your freedom to choose is our way. Our first order of business, day one, is to make sure we never put this State under lockdown and allow Washington to recklessly spend a few trillion dollars over the course of several weeks ever again.
It is time to put an adult in the room. This is a historic time where the next generation will ask, ""Where were you and the Libertarian Party and what did you do?"" It is also an exciting time where the liberty message has been proven and the opportunity has never been greater.
Every donation to the Libertarian Party of Connecticut keeps our critical efforts going.
Can I count you in as part of this effort at this critical time?

As you know, the Libertarian Party of Connecticut is involved in important ballot access litigation.
Should we win on our temporary injunction, we expect to win our place on the ballot, freely, for every office in this State.
The decision will also be a precedent for the entire country because we are making arguments presented in detail that has never been tested in court before.
We are currently scheduled to begin making our case March 16, 2020 in Hartford Superior Court.
There are two things you can do that will help us out.
(1) We need as many people to run, volunteer for campaigns and be treasurers as can be had. We must be ready.
(2) If you already haven't, please donate most generously. The costs of mounting a ballot access lawsuit to eliminate a generations-old injustice are not small. Those costs, however, are far less than paying for $80,000 statewide and numerous other ballot drives going forward.
It is time for us to succeed.

In case you missed it, we had an excellent turnout for our October 3, 2020 Liberty Rally, where we stood up against the lockdown for what they are: evil.
Since April, the Libertarian Party of Connecticut has led the way, and its Vice Chair, Jonathan Johnson, has been showing the key difference between Libertarians and one party pretending to be two: we don't wait for ""after the election"" to make things happen. We work early, often and actively.
The reason we continue to grow is because we continue to effectively organize, communicate the Liberty Message and build upon past successes.
We reach out. We convert. We change a Connecticut looking for a viable option to show it the way out of government controlling every aspect of your life.
This is why our affiliates continue to grow. By the end of this month, we expect to have statewide coverage of all counties by operational affiliates that you can get involved in, you can join, and you can support.
Of course, there is no such thing as a free lunch. This is why your financial support matters no, so critically, on the eve of a historic ad push.
Can you chip in? Every dollar counts. Click here to donate.
It's also important that you share this message with everyone you know, to let them know that Liberty is an option - and they can have it if they choose it and fight for it.
Thank you for supporting Liberty. Your family, friends and community appreciate all you do.

We are in unprecedented times due to an unprecedented overreach of government, which has suspended the right to a speedy trial and brought 90% of all social interaction to a screeching halt.
To what productive result of putting over six plus million people out of work, shuttering a third of small business and having committed over six trillion dollars could possibly accomplish remains to be seen.
As a consequence of having had our candidates still being forced to circulate petitions - during what the Governor has proclaimed to be a life and death public emergency - the State Central Committee has authorized a Federal Action to be filed, to completely abolish the petitioning requirements.
Fortunately, the Secretary of State published and transmitted to the Governor a letter agreeing with our position. We have what we need to succeed, and obtain injunctive relief from the Federal Court, which is still open and able to proceed.
Our Party will, by virtue of having been right and issued the appropriate warnings, be in a position of leadership.
Right now we have the following tasks, which we need all your help with to the extent possible:
Task Number One: If you have not thrown your hat in the ring to run for office, please do so. We are compiling a growing list of people stepping up to take over this November, and transition things back to better, more freer, than normal. If you already have a petition pulled, please check in and report the status of what signatures you have. No, we do not expect you to be capable of gathering any - especially since the Governor limited gatherings to no more than five.
Task Number Two: If you have not already joined or expressed interest in joining an affiliate, this is an excellent time. The State Central Committee will be taking up the issue of local and regional affiliates taking up their business remotely, given the situation.
Task Number Three: Spread the word, and if you already haven't, please donate whatever you can.
Life will return to not normal, but better than normal. The consequence of government overreactions and failures to act has finally made the case for liberty, profoundly so.
Americans are learning all about telecommuting, the true effects of public education and about the vast majority of wasteful government programs and regulations that, when a crisis happens, demonstrate their lack of real world value or purpose. Many Americans are normally one interaction with their government away from becoming a Libertarian. Democrats and Republicans have dramatically increased the number of those interactions.
We have to step up and be ready, as we will.
Americans daily see confusion, alarm and panic from both elected officials and the media. They see so many press conferences and interviews from those in charge that they reasonably wonder, ""How do you have any time left to work on the problem?""
We will be the voice of calm, reason, facts, science and evidence based practices. We've done the work. Our approach and philosophy, to the very limited extent it was allowed to operate, created the best medicine, technology and healthcare in the world. It led to the best innovation that can turn things around - when we allow it to, as we will.
As bad as a lot of the self inflicted damage has been in this crisis, we have cause to be optimistic, and step up as the new leadership not only in the recovery, but in the new time of prosperity that would follow by giving liberty a try.
I look forward to working with all of you, as we all help guide our fellow Americans out of these difficult times, and we all become more happy, prosperous and free neighbors.

As of tonight, the State Central Committee approved nominees for all Five Congressional Districts, 17 General Assembly Seats (Districts 1, 4, 5, 9, 18, 19, 22, 25, 26, 27, 30, 36) and 13 State Senate Seats (Districts 1, 9, 20, 26, 27, 29, 32, 45, 46, 67, 84, 123, 136, 141, 146 and 147).
We remain optimistic of our chances in the Second Circuit of Appeals in placing all of them (not just some of them) on the ballot in November. The case has already been briefed by the Appellants.
We are asking at this time that all our nominated candidates who have not yet transmitted to us a letter indicating their name, address and position for which they consent to be placed on the ballot do so directly to the Secretary of State (30 Trinity Street Hartford, CT 06106), and ensure that they transmit to me (via [[URL REDACTED]] [at] [[URL REDACTED]]) an electronic copy. The Secretary of State requires that signed originals such letters be received and in hand by 4PM on September 2. I will be delivering all such letters we presently have in hand at the close of business, August 28, 2020 to the Secretary of State.
For those who have not expressed an interest in running in a district for which we have not yet nominated a candidate for, the deadline in which to be considered is the end of business, Friday, August 28, 2020.
If you already haven't please donate. We need to change a government that one party pretending to be two refuses to change.

First, we have set the dates for our annual convention as February 29, and March 1, 2020. Business will include nominating candidates for office, filling the SCC, selecting delegates to the National Convention in Austin, TX and important bylaws updates.
Bylaws Revisions
The Bylaws Committee has been selected, and is scheduled to meet by teleconference January 13 and January 27 - and if need be, February 10 and 24th. Changes under consideration by the Committee, to be recommended to the Convention as a whole, include changing the frequency of the convention to biannual instead of annual and making the existing committees permanent instead of having them expire and dissolve prior to each convention. Submission of suggestions and feedback on the bylaws is strongly encouraged.
Libertarian Parties of Hartford, Norwalk and Housatanic Valley
The Party's growth continues. If you are interested in joining these new affiliates, please reach out, and we'll put you in touch.
LPCT v State of Connecticut
You can track the case here. This is the most important ballot access litigation of our time. If we win, in total, on our application for temporary injunction (to be filed on or before February 10, 2020), we will not only be listed on the voter registration forms as a party designation - we will be able to freely nominate for EVERY office in this State WITHOUT petitioning. Otherwise, it's at least another 161,124 signatures and some 600+ pages of petitioning applications before that. The National Libertarian Party has intervened as a Plaintiff. A win here will also set precedent in other States, and the result will be a real path to major party status.
If you have a desire to run for office, now is the time. If you have been discouraged from running before due to the petitioning requirements - we need to hear from you, and we need you present on March 9, 2020 in Hartford Superior Court, Courtroom 312 @ 10AM.
Your donations count toward all of these efforts, and all the new ground we continue to gain as critical mass continues to build. Can we count you in?
In Liberty,

This has been an exciting and unprecedented year for the Libertarian Party of Connecticut.
We have led the way, and the Democrats and Republicans have stood aside and done nothing, on mass demonstrations against the lockdowns. We have also stood by and agreed with peaceful demonstrations against all forms of government overreach and violations of civil liberties.
To that end, we anticipate a victory on our ballot access suit in federal court, Libertarian Party of Connecticut vs Lamont, scheduled for argument on our motion for temporary injunction June 22. Whether the federal district court or the Second Circuit grant it, we expect to be nominate freely for office without the need to petition.
It is vitally important that we run a candidate in every single State Senate race (of which there are 36), and as many General Assembly House races as we can. If you or someone you know is interested in running for office, now is the time. Please complete express interest here, and declare your intent to represent the principles of liberty in our time, in elected office.
While the Democrats are interested only in fighting with Republicans, and Republicans fighting with Democrats, we have critical work to do. We have proudly nominated Jo Jorgensen, who, with our Congressional nominees, will clean up over a hundred years of bipartisan votes to only increase spending and deficits. They will join Representative Justin Amash in Washington, DC, the first ever Libertarian Member of the United States House of Representatives.
These critical times require, more now than ever, an adult in the room. That is our party. We continue to advance liberty, which is sorely needed.
If you already haven't, please chip in to help us keep our important work going. We will follow the first time we have had a candidate on the ballot for Governor in 2018 (and Libertarians in elected office that followed) with nominees for all five Congressional Districts.

This Mon. May 4, 2020, is the 50th anniversary of the Kent State University shootings in which 4 students were killed and many more wounded by the national guard. This Mon. beginning at 12:00 noon, there will be a virtual online program consisting of videos and other media. For access, go to [[URL REDACTED]] There is a link to the May 4 program.
There is a great deal of information on this site now. I was a student at Kent State then, and was at the anti-Vietnam War demonstration that precipitated the shootings. During the year following the shootings, there were discussions regarding lessons to be learned and where to place blame. Some said that the primary problem was the refusal of the demonstrators to obey lawful authority. Others believed that non-violent civil disobedience should be the maximum extent of illegal actions, ultimately requiring submission to authorities and their penalties.
This tragedy was caused by an unfortunate sequence of events and could have been avoided by a change in any one of them. The terrible decision to deploy national guard troops, who were ill trained and ill equipped for crowd control situations was a major factor. It is more meaningful to identify the fundamental flaws in our cultural, political and legal systems, which set the stage for this violence.
The existence of military conscription, in effect since 1940, coupled with the Vietnam War were the driving forces. It is absurd to expect people to submit to a system which enslaves young men into mortal combat to intervene in foreign conflicts which pose no risk to national security. It is equally unreasonable to expect them to submit to the penalty of 2-5 years imprisonment for refusing this draft. It is, therefore, understandable that when faced with these terrible options, some will react with sabotage and other illegal acts. As authorities double down with police or military actions, radicals and other citizens respond and the violence escalates. Such a dysfunctional system gives the government far too much power, particularly given the record of miserable judgements by the politicians.
The events of the Vietnam War era are not an aberration. History is replete with similarly destructive government policies, including American involvement in other unnecessary wars such as Korea and Iraq. Another counter-productive policy is the war on drugs, beginning in 1914, creating a police state and an environment of paranoia. Home invasions, asset forfeiture, vehicle and pedestrian searches lead to violence and homicides by police and citizens.
It is the responsibility of the American citizen to prevent such destructive policies from being enacted and quickly change or repeal any such policies that begin. When the results from working within the system fall short, and the consequences of existing government policies are severe, illegal actions involving evasion and resistance may be justified. This requires the ability to think independently, free from unreasonable deference to authority. These qualities are rare among the general public.
During the Vietnam War, when the voting age was 21, a large percentage of the young men of draft age had even less political power than they would today. The older generation had the responsibility of preventing or stopping their children from being sent to their slaughter, using any means necessary. Regrettably, due to their tendency to think and act like sheep, they failed miserably. The American people allowed themselves to be manipulated by a tiny group of federal politicians with support from their political cronies, who escalated and continued the war, causing the death and injury of more than 200,000 young Americans.
The same problems exist today. The majority of people in all societies do not think and behave like intelligent humans, but rather display bovine tendencies. Their group-think and herd like behavior make them susceptible to political control. Perhaps alternative educational systems and cultural changes may improve critical thinking in people.
However, I am not very optimistic about this. It appears that most people must have specific personal experience or face a personal crisis to become aware of a problem. It seems they have difficulty achieving the same awareness through observation, research or imagination. The young people of draft age during the Vietnam War quickly opposed the war and the draft, because their heads were on the chopping block.
The older generation, conditioned by the preexisting cold war ""Domino Theory"" mentality, were duped by the equally ignorant politicians in power.
Similar principles apply even when the consequences are less catastrophic. People seem to be concerned only with policies that affect them and ignore the broader, underlying issues, which eventually affect everyone. Problems of hyper-regulation are generally opposed by individuals in a particularly affected business. The intrusive ""stop and frisk"" tactics used by police primarily in low income urban areas are naturally opposed by the people subjected to them, but are not of much concern to suburban dwellers.
I am sending this out to my friends in the Libertarian movement and to friends in other groups I am associated with. Everyone should be concerned with fundamental human rights.
Check out the [[URL REDACTED]] website. The Kent State massacre should serve as an educational experience and a warning to everyone. This tragedy underscores many of the flaws in our society and of societies in general. Unless we become a more intelligent society, people will continue to suffer unnecessarily. This does not necessarily require years of higher education, but rather the development of independent critical thinking throughout the population.
Yours,
Carl Luppinacci

You may have seen (likely against all better judgment), the rigged debate between Joe Biden and Donald Trump. It is a sad fact that, even if you only heard about it, you now know you are worse off the longer it passes for ""debate"".
It was a cafeteria food fight. Everyone was the loser of that 'debate'.
The Libertarian Party nominated Jo Jorgensen, the Adult in the Room.
Of course, Adult in the Room's website crashed the night of the cafetaria food fight, from a surge of disgusted, disillusioned voter traffic.
It is no secret that Trump will not win Connecticut. The only communicated argument for that vote, to date, is that he is not Democrat, and not Biden.
It is also no secret that the only argument Biden voters make for him is, surprise, he's not Trump, or a Republican.
That sort of hatred has divided our State more than ever. With the lockdowns, it has made everything a political issue, contention or statement.
This isn't just a matter of lesser of two evils - it is decidedly more evil. That evil has accumulated for over 100 years of government not actually shrinking in any net sense.
Trump renewed the Patriot Act Biden supported, and they both supported spending trillions of dollars, and of course did nothing to end the lockdowns.
Jorgensen proudly earns her votes. She doesn't need to bring up Trump or Biden to make her case.
Jorgensen's platform also fits within your budget.
It's not only about ending all the foriegn wars this time - it's about peace in America itself, which is so desperately needed.

The State Central Committee met via teleconference April 6, 2020. The following actions were taken:
Remote Affiliate Operations
The SCC suspended, until further notice, in-person requirements for local and regional affiliates to meet. These meetings shall take place regularly (according to the frequency provided for in the bylaws, as amended), but remotely.
Affiliates should, as soon as possible, select their representatives to the State Central Committee, and notify the Secretary, Stephen Dincher, who they have selected to represent them on the SCC.
Those looking to form an affiliate may, can, should and are also encouraged to do so, remotely. If you are looking to form an affiliate, please notify the Secretary of: (1) your intention to do so; (2) the names of the founding members; (3) the content of your established bylaws; (4) of your representatives on the SCC that you choose to act as such, upon approval and recognition by the SCC; and (5) when your meetings have taken place.
We expect to accept new members on the SCC from previously recognized affiliates at the May 4, 2020 meeting, and to recognize new affiliates that have formed in the interim.
These affiliates will be important to candidate nominations moving forward, which we expect to freely be able to make without requiring petitions.
National Convention Updates
The Libertarian National Committee (LNC) has not made a decision as to how or if the May 21, 2020 convention will proceed. Due to the economic impact of COVID-19, several delegates previously nominated have indicated that they may not be able to financially make it to an in person convention. The May 21 convention may also have a combination of remote and in-person functionality.
In anticipation of events as they evolve, the State Central Committee has requested that those among the Membership interested in being an alternate delegate self nominate by replying to this email or reaching out to the Secretary, and alternates will be chosen by lottery at the May 4, 2020 telecon meeting. If you are interested, please include your name, address, email and phone number.
LPCT v Lamont, 3:20-cv-00467 (Federal Action)
As you know, the State is still requiring in-person physical petition signatures in order to be nominated for the November 2020 ballot. The Governor, Ned Lamont, also ordered the courts closed, so that our existing ballot access suit could not even be heard, remotely.
To Quote the Complaint, ""The power, scope and expansive nature of the Orders issued by Defendant Lamont have been heretofore unknown to any prior national crisis or emergency, including polio, HIV, smallpox, 9/11, the Cuban Missile Crisis and both World Wars. Defendant Lamont has, unilaterally, wielded the power to indefinitely place this State and its courts under house arrest, with no ability to challenge or question the actions placing the health and safety of the Plaintiffs at risk of infection and threat of arrest and indefinite detention in such places likely to result in infection as the very price for participating in their own government.""
We are seeking a temporary restraining order that no petition signatures be required. That application is pending.
For now, please know that we need candidates to step forward, and hope to have challengers in every General Assembly race, given the gravity and scope of how government overreach has functioned.
As always, be well, stay safe and keep up the good fight.

We are finally making some sense of the disorder presented by COVID-19's Secretary of State (who wants to place us on the ballot without petition) and Governor (who does not), and the Second Circuit of Appeals has received our brief.
For the time being, we have nominated and finalized candidates for the First and Second Congressional Districts.
We have also nominated and finalized candidates for the Fourth and Fifth State Senate and 26th, 32nd and 141st General Assembly Seats.
We have candidates who have stepped forward and we are expecting to complete the nomination process for State Senate Districts 1, 9, 10, 18, 19, 22, 25, 26, 27 and 36 as well as General Assembly Districts 1, 9, 27, 29, 45, 46, 84, 123, 136, 146 and 147. To those of you who have stepped forward:
(1) THANK YOU.
(2) Please IMMEDIATELY transmit a letter for each office you have indicated interest in running for to the Chair, Daniel Reale via snail mail to 20 Dougherty Ave Plainfield, CT 06374 addressed to the Secretary of State indicating: (1) your name, (2) your address, (3) the office for which you give the Secretary of State permission to place your name under the designation ""Libertarian"" for, and transmit a copy of the same to [[URL REDACTED]] Letters must be signed. Letters must be received at the soonest. We will submit all such letters and our Party nominating letter September 1, 2020.
(3) If you have been nominated and have not transmitted such a letter, please do so immediately, so the Party may submit it with its letter listing all its candidates for the November 2020 ballot.
For those who have not yet thrown their hat in the ring, this is a very important time for Liberty, and the lockdowns have dramatically improved your ability to make a real difference. Reply to this email to express interest in the offices not yet covered if you live in districts not listed here (or if you would like to be considered for any of the districts listed here).
The State Central Committee's next meeting is scheduled for August 24, 2020 at 8PM by teleconference. This is the last time it meets prior to having to submit its endorsement letter, meaning that time is of the essence.
If you already haven't, please donate. We have never accomplished so much, and our failure, especially during these times, is not an option.
We decided to make Liberty happen in our time. This is that time.

The bipartisan government response to COVID-19 has taken an unprecedented toll on the economy, and in particular, Connecticut.
The travel and gathering bans in Austin prevented the Libertarian Party from holding its convention in person last month, requiring us to conduct the business of nominating a presidential candidate in time to meet ballot access deadlines online. We did. The convention chose Jo Jorgensen, a candidate we can all proudly stand with.
This left the remainder of the Convention's business to its second sitting at Orlando, starting July 8th. As the government's response to COVID-19 has remained severe, costly and protracted, the ability of many of our delegates and alternates to attend became a financial issue.
A Zoom meeting of the State Chairs occured last week, and will occur again tomorrow in order to help iron out important details.
LPCT presently needs additional alternate delegates who can attend the Orlando sitting. Please use this form to indicate your interest. If you are unable to serve as an alternate, please consider chipping in what you can so that we can complete the important work of the Party.
That work is more important than ever, including the selection of a new Libertarian National Committee and a new Judiciary Committee.
Thank you for your support and all you do.

Given the time sensitive nature of our unusually large task, we are again reaching out to make sure we fill as many offices as possible.
As indicated, Libertarian Party of Connecticut v Lamont, No. 20-2179, is pending in the Second Circuit, where they will resolve the conflict between the Secretary of State's desire to place everyone on the ballot without petitions and the Governor's orders not to.
As indicated, we have nominated and finalized candidates for the Fourth and Fifth State Senate and 26th, 32nd and 141st General Assembly Seats.
As of August 19th, we have candidates who have stepped forward and we are expecting to complete the nomination process for State Senate Districts 1, 9, 10, 18, 19, 22, 25, 26, 27 and 36 as well as General Assembly Districts 1, 9, 27, 29, 45, 46, 84, 123, 136, 146 and 147\. To those of you who have stepped forward:
(1) THANK YOU.
(2) Please IMMEDIATELY (if you already haven't) transmit a letter for each office you have indicated interest in running for to the Chair, Daniel Reale via snail mail to 20 Dougherty Ave Plainfield, CT 06374 addressed to the Secretary of State indicating: (1) your name, (2) your address, (3) the office for which you give the Secretary of State permission to place your name under the designation ""Libertarian"" for, and transmit a copy of the same to [[URL REDACTED]] Letters must be signed.

If you have already stepped forward (and sent in materials and answers to any nominating questions from the SCC or local affiliate (as the case may be), whether or not your district is listed, further instructions will follow if necessary.
We are looking forward to serving in Hartford and Washington, DC, and implementing our Legislative Goals.

The State of Connecticut was ordered to be under a State of Emergency by Governor Ned Lamont on March 10, 2020. In doing so, thousands of businesses, schools, churches and community centers were closed, and millions of citizens forced into lockdown. Our state was ordered to comply with a period of “15 Days to Flatten The Curve.” We are now 220 days into Lamont’s rule by emergency power.
The intent was to protect our emergency workers and medical facilities from the coming wave of infections and deaths due to COVID-19 in our state.
Many in our state suffered the tragic loss of a loved one, to whom we share our consolation. Others deserve our thanks as they worked as first responders to a medical emergency in our state. Your efforts are appreciated and to be commended.
Currently, the citizens of Connecticut have been presented no definitive date or metric by which Governor Ned Lamont will declare the end to the “state of emergency”.
On average, Connecticut has had an infection rate of under 1% for weeks. Eighteen days of August had zero deaths. None. In the last fourteen days, CT has seen 11 COVID-related fatalities, which is 0.79 deaths per day on average. Less than one.
If these scientific metrics do not justify the rescinding of the state of emergency, then which will, Governor?
This week, instead of rescinding these emergency powers, Lamont declared the renewal of the state of emergency for five months until February 9, 2021. Today, our “Gang of 10”, the special committee of CT legislators who may vote to reject Lamont’s renewed emergency declaration, voted in support, 6-4.
With six months lead time, $2,000,000 spent on consulting, and his team of experts at his side, Lamont did not include one metric by which to reopen the state completely, or any mechanism to reengage the State Legislature in real and meaningful decision-making. Their only plan: one man ruling by Executive Order solely over our entire state for up to 11 months.
Governor Lamont said he does not “want to make this a political process” when having to make regulations as a justification for renewing these emergency powers, as Executive Order is such an easier process for him to “keep us safe.”
Well, Governor Lamont, welcome to America. We have political process. We have representative government. We have elections of Legislators whom the people consent to make law regarding the affairs of the People of Connecticut. We do not consent to be ruled by a Governor with emergency powers and executive orders.
With almost 200,000 citizens unemployed, families in Connecticut are still without jobs and livelihoods. Some businesses and entire industries are still widely closed, many local small business owners are struggling to survive in this environment every day, and many are reportedly within weeks of closing.
Thousands of citizens have gone bankrupt or lost their life savings, and many are struggling to meet the basic needs of their families today. Tenants cannot afford their rent, and landlords cannot afford their mortgages. Mental health issues are on the rise as churches and social interactions have been stripped from them, just as the stress and financial ruin caused by government lockdowns invaded their lives.
Children are being forced to wear a mask in school, frontline workers are being forced to wear masks for 40 hours a week at minimum wage jobs, and legislators are being told they cannot do their jobs. The projected budget shortfall for the state government will be in the millions or billions of dollars in the upcoming fiscal years due to the projected loss of tax revenue.
The Governor's sole decisions have contributed to needless injury and deaths that will now occur because of physical abuse, substance abuse, suicides, and missed cancer screenings. His rule has been tyrannical, where local authorities either cannot make any sense of the unlawful orders or they selectively enforce them to settle political scores.
Further, Lamont has inserted chaos into our elections and used the $6,000,000 from the CARES Act for elections to unlawfully exclude candidates from the ballot. His orders have created an environment where people locked out of court are increasingly encouraged to resolve their disputes in the streets.
Most of the complaints made against King George III in the Declaration of Independence are now true as to “King” Lamont.
Less than one death per day in a state of 3.56 million people \-- and from a virus that was going to “kill millions of Americans”, less than half as many fatalities as medical errors and far less than a third of those who die from heart attacks.
The people of Connecticut join the Libertarian Party of Connecticut to demand the immediate end to the State of Emergency and the emergency powers usurped by our Governor Edward “Ned” Lamont.
Sincerely,
Jonathan Johnson
Vice Chair, Libertarian Party of Connecticut

As you may know, 2018 was the first election year we ran online, radio and television ads.
This year we plan to go bigger still.
It's very important that we have as big of a warchest as possible to finalize all remaining media buys on October 12, 2020.
A stronger presence for the Liberty Message means higher vote totals, faster growing affiliates and successful campaigns.
We are not in this to merely spread the word. The mission for Liberty that must succeed - especially with all the damage the Governor's lockdowns have caused.
The Libertarian Party of Connecticut has already stood out as regularly organizing large rallies and events - and those that far exceed the size of even Republican gatherings.
We're not begging to be included in the discussion. We are reauthoring it to where Liberty is an option.
Can we count on you to help? Every donation critically counts at this time.
There is a lot on the line in 2020. That includes the ability to even fund hospitals.
The better we do, the more we can grow and the sooner policy will change.
And we will change it.
Thank you for all you do.

Friend --
The Libertarian Party of Connecticut's 2020 convention will be held February 29, 2020 at the Knights of Columbus in Cromwell, Connecticut, doors open at 8AM.
The agenda shall include nomination of candidates for all Congressional Districts and other offices, appointing thirteen (13) delegates to the National Convention in May 2020 (in Austin, TX) and to take up other business pursuant to the Libertarian Party of Connecticut's bylaws.
The Bylaws Committee (which only has two scheduled meetings remaining, 7PM by teleconference on Monday February 3, 2020 and Monday February 10, 2020), has reported out the following proposed changes:
1\. Modifying Article III, §3 that one must be a Regular member in order to be a delegate to the National Convention.
2\. Modifying the Entire Bylaws, replacing the word ""Annual"" with ""Biannual"", to make Conventions occur every two years.
3\. Creating a new section of the bylaws (Article V, new §7), creating an Executive Committee consisting of the four officers and one at-large member.
4\. Article IV, §2, new ¶5, authorizing the SCC to compensate is Treasurer and Secretary so long as the Party's other financial obligations and commitments are met, per State Law.
5\. Revising Article VII, re electronic voting by the SCC, to close votes within 48 hours instead of ten days, but allowing the Chair to extend such votes in 24 increments if further deliberation is required.
6\. Article IV, §4, being modified to make the current committees (Strategy & Goals, Legislative Research, IT, Finance and Fundraising) Standing Committees that do not dissolve by virtue of a convention, and making them permanent.
The following proposed changes are to be finalized and proposed for the next Bylaws Committee meetings for February 3 and 10th, respectively (if reported out of Committee):
A. [Feb 3] Creation of a mechanism to have LPCT affiliates be able to appoint their own at-large members to the SCC and the voting mechanism and terms required.
B. [Feb 10] Simplification of Article I, §1 ""Basic Aims"", which, if reported out of Bylaws Committee, would require unanimous consent of the Convention to change per Article XII.
Given the nature of bylaws amendments and their fundamental importance in addition to the need to complete all other convention business, members qualified to vote at convention may vote ""Yea"", ""Nay"" or ""Refer to Special Party Meeting"". A 2/3 majority is required to approve a bylaw revision, and a simple majority will be required to refer a proposed revision to a Special Party Meeting. If one or more proposals are refered to Special Party Meeting, that meeting will be set on the day of the convention, to occur at least thirty (30) days in the future.
We will also have an important update concerning Misbach v Merrill, the Party's milestone ballot access litigation that we expect will remove the requirement to petition once and for all.
We look forward to seeing you there.
If you already haven't, every donation counts. Please give today to keep our efforts going.

While the Demopublicans have moved backward on the quality and the vision they offer, Libertarians have only moved forward.
Jo Jorgensen, the next President of the United States and Dan Reale, running for the Second Congressional District, have a vision and the leadership to end the partisan fighting, and get the federal government out of your life so that you can live yours.
Jo Jorgensen's America is a much happier one, without the fighting. Dan Reale, like all of the Libertarian candidates, admantly opposes the Governor's unlawful, unconstitional lockdowns.
Harold Harris is running for school choice and much (much, much) smaller government, in Connecticut's Fourth State Senate District.
Stephen Dincher is running for the 22nd State Senate District. Johnathan Johnson is running for State Representative in the 26th General Assembly District.
There aren't just good reasons to vote Libertarian. There are risks in not voting Libertarian, especially this time around, that affect everyone.
Please do everything you can to spread the word about these and other Libertarian candidates.
Please also donate to the Libertarian Party of Connecticut. Air time, online ads and television are critical.
Everything you can do to donate, volunteer and spread the word is also critical.
You, your family and your friends need Liberty in our Time now more than ever.
That's why we thank you for all you do.
