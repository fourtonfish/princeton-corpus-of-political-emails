VOLUME XVII, June 25, 2020
There is much news to report since our last meeting in February. Still, I’d like to open this newsletter by wishing everyone well and letting you know how much I’ve missed the RSCC meetings, the leadership lunches, the RPEC and LFRW meetings, the fundraisers, and most of all the friendship and camaraderie with our members. Surprisingly, the last three months have been the busiest of my chairmanship, but after reading this newsletter, perhaps you’ll understand why. So let’s get started:
Despite three months of lock-down and quarantine, July will shortly arrive to find the American people still beset by a pandemic, economic dislocation, nationwide protests and riots, and rising international threats. Moreover, the opening salvoes are being fired in what promises to be the most contentious and divisive presidential campaign in recent American history, significantly adding to our existing national malaise.
While the past ninety days have certainly challenged us in unique ways, even the most cursory examination of American history reveals that our nation has seen worse, in fact, far worse. Still, as a people, we have always overcome these difficulties and prevailed in the end. Now that is not to say that we will always and inevitably conquer every adversity; our successes have never been automatic. But I do believe that the innate self-confidence, hard work ethic, and love of country which the majority of our citizens still possess, will see us through the present crises.
But politics at the national level is a battle involving tens of millions of people working together to achieve a common goal. Our ultimate victory in this fight depends on the success of the one American political party with a noble and untarnished history, grounded in the ideals of liberty and justice, and possessing the organizational strength necessary to defeat Marxism and anarchism. That party is, of course, the Republican Party, founded in 1854 with the specific goal of ending slavery in America. Never forget that fact, and be proud of who we are.
So the responsibility for leading the country out of the present political, moral, and economic chaos must necessarily fall on us as Republicans- there is no other organization with the means or even the political will to do so. That other major national political party is so mired in self-doubt and moral contradictions of its own making as to be not only incapable of healing the country but mostly responsible for dividing it in the first place!
Our victory in 2020 is not about a few hundred judgeships or even a trillion dollars in the national budget going here instead of there, but rather the survival of the core foundational beliefs upon which our country was founded and upon which our national strength and economic prosperity are based. The issues before us are genuinely momentous, the political battle lines are drawn, and it is our duty as activists to carry our banner proudly and lead the charge!
Louis Gurvich, Chairman
Republican Party of Louisiana
Upcoming July 11th Presidential Preference Primary
Louisiana will hold its Presidential Preference Primary on July 11. Extended early voting has already started and will continue through July 4, Sundays excluded. Don't forget that there are other races on the ballot, including our RPEC races.
This is a winner-take-all primary, binding the entire RNC delegation to vote for the winner. Now there isn't much doubt about who is going to win the Republican presidential primary in Louisiana. Still, it's important that all voters registered as Republicans before November 30, 2020, get out and vote to show maximum support for our President.
Not since the late '60s has the country been as politically divided as it is now. America needs leadership that believes in our country's fundamental greatness. President Trump has what it takes to defeat the radical left, rebuild our economy, and confront rising foreign foes. We need him back for a second term, and he needs your support on July 11!
Next RSCC Meeting Scheduled for August 8th
The next RSCC meeting has been scheduled for 10 a.m. on Saturday, August 8th in Baton Rouge at the Louisiana State Capitol inside the House chamber. Please arrange to be there or send a proxy. Elections for the RNC offices of National Committeeman and National Committeewoman will be held at this meeting.
NOTE: All other party leadership elections will be held in early 2021.
Louisiana's Delegates to the 2020 Republican National Convention are Selected & Ready for Jacksonville
On June 13th, the LAGOP hosted its State Party Convention via Zoom. At the convention delegates and alternate were voted on and approved to make up our delegation to the Republican National Convention in Jacksonville. Public Service Commissioner Eric Skrmetta was elected as our delegation chairman and Agricultural Commissioner Mike Strain was elected as our Vice Chairman. Congratulations to Eric, Mike, and our delegates and alternates! If you would like to see our delegation list, please click the button below:
2020 Louisiana RNC Delegation
LAGOP Announces a New Interim Executive Director
During a regular meeting of the Republican Party of Louisiana's Executive Committee, Chairman Louis Gurvich announced that Lauren Griffin, the party's current Operations Director, had been named as the Interim Executive Director of the LAGOP.
Though young, Lauren has already become a familiar face in Louisiana politics. Starting as a page in the Louisiana House of Representatives, then working with the Rural Caucus in the legislature before joining Ralph Abraham's gubernatorial campaign as Deputy Political Director, she joined the LAGOP as our Operations Director this past November. Lauren has established herself as a gifted, dynamic leader capable of working with diverse groups and interests.
""I'm honored to be taking on this important role at such a crucial time,"" said Lauren, ""and I'm proud to follow in the footsteps of Andrew Bautsch, who was a great Executive Director and mentor. I look forward to building on his success and helping to re-elect our President, Vice President, and our Republican Congressional delegation. Chairman Louis Gurvich expressed similar enthusiasm, ""In the short time Lauren has been with us, she has shown a remarkable ability to lead and inspire others. I'm looking forward to working with her.""
Legislative Update
Early this year, Republican legislators announced that their primary legislative goal would be the passage of several tort reform bills. Our delegation duly passed these bills over the bad-faith objections of Gov. Edwards and his dark money groups.
Republicans prioritized tort reform because they understand it would save Louisiana's citizens potentially thousands of dollars a year and revitalize Louisiana's stagnating economy. Unfortunately, Gov. Edwards opposed Republican efforts at this crucial reform, despite promising voters in 2019 that he would work closely with the legislature to reform our state.
The Governor and his dark money groups created and financed an attempt to force-feed the legislature and public a false narrative. Their narrative was claimed that tort reform would not lower our insurance rates, but this is demonstrably false. Louisiana is one of the only states with laws that promote frivolous lawsuits still on the books. Repealing those laws would lower car and truck insurance rates just as it has done in every other state that has passed similar reforms. Of course, rather than admitting he was wrong, John Bel used his veto power to kill badly needed change that would have benefited almost all Louisiana citizens.
To the outside observer, it would appear Gov. Edwards doesn't care that our state's outdated litigation laws hamper Louisiana's economic recovery. It would seem Gov. Edwards doesn't care that Louisiana families are struggling due to policies his party put in place decades ago. He ran on a platform of ""Putting Louisiana First,"" but since the earliest days of his administration, he has chosen to put the interests of dark money groups first, before Louisiana.
Right now, across this state, hundreds of thousands of families are stressed over whether they'll even be able to make ends meet in the face of an economic crash and global pandemic. They're worried about how they'll pay their mortgages, send their kids to school or college this fall, or afford their sky-high insurance rates.
That's why Republicans passed tort reform; that's why Republicans designed programs and policies to rebuild our economy and bring more jobs to our state. We Republicans can't stop thinking about ways to make life a little easier and a lot more prosperous for every Louisianan. Still, John Bel keeps trying to block our attempts to make life better for all our citizens because he has no interest in Louisiana succeeding. Instead, he would rather create more government dependency and less autonomy for the people of Louisiana.
Republicans are offering Louisiana a path to prosperity, and we won't stop working for the people of this state until Louisiana finally reaches its full potential.

August 19, 2020 VOLUME XIX
I would like to begin the August 2020 edition of The Party Line with hearty congratulations to our new RNC National Committeeman, Roger Villere, and our re-elected National Committeewoman, Lenar Whitney. Good luck going forward!
I must say that I was very impressed by the large turnout for the meeting- four and a half years into this state central committee’s “extended life,” we can still muster about sixty more members than necessary to make quorum! That’s quite an achievement amid a pandemic, and I thank you for your dedication to the party.
Several of you have asked me why we held the RNC elections when we did, i. e., out of sync with the other party elections, which will be held early next year. The answer is that the Republican National Committee required that new RNC officers be elected before the conclusion of the Charlotte Convention. The continuing pandemic delays forced our hand, or we would not have made that deadline.
In that case the RNC would have taken over the matter, and we either would have had no election or the Louisiana RNC delegation would have had to be convened to elect these two officers. Understandably, the Executive Committee felt that the traditional RSCC election was the fairest method and proceeded accordingly.
Please, please don’t forget that qualifying for the RSCC begins TODAY, August 19th, and continues at your local clerk of court’s office through the close of business on August 21st. Because of our successful court hearing and the legislation subsequently passed by the Louisiana House and Senate, we will qualify in our familiar Senate sub-districts. Unless you’ve since moved out of your old district, whatever district you ran in last time will be the same district that you will run in again.
Call or email the LAGOP staff if you have any questions about qualifying. The cost is the same $112.50 as it has been for years; check with your local clerk of court for acceptable methods of payment. Unlike the Democrat state central committee districts, our districts are fairly apportioned and contain approximately equal numbers of our party members. We fought very hard to keep those districts, and now we need you to keep them filled!
Thank you for your service, and I hope to see you back in that number for another four years!
Louis Gurvich, Chairman
Republican Party of Louisiana
GET YOUR YARD SIGNS FROM THE LAGOP!
GET YOUR YARD SIGNS FROM THE LAGOP!
Let’s get our grassroots organization growing, again!
The core of our State Party is the State Central Committee. Over the years we have not acted like that. I want to help you change that. We are all busy with families, businesses, jobs, friends, churches, and hobbies but as you know, the REPUBLIC IS IN TROUBLE!
We exasperate and ask, WHAT CAN I DO TO HELP? Believe it or not, there is something that I have been doing that I know helps. I have been organizing the precincts in my State Central Committee District for Trump. I go door-to-door… I wear a mask…. And I back away if someone answers the door and I remove my mask and talk to them about President Trump.
Republicans are so glad to have someone… anyone… encourage them and let them know that we are all in this together… that President Trump is doing well… and that we will defeat the Democrats in November and save the Republic. If the person at the door is excited I ask them to consider joining our Republican team. Many times the husband or wife will join their spouse at the door. The excitement and enthusiasm are contagious and a great motivator for me as well.
Yes, some people are scared. Some will not even open the door. But, I CAN STILL ENCOURAGE THEM THROUGH THE DOOR TO VOTE FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP. And, it’s on to the next house.
If you want to participate I will be happy to get you a PDF walk list of your District Voters that you can print out or the actual data if that works better. You can walk with reasonable certainty that you are visiting GOP houses where you are likely to find supporters and even volunteers.
Each State Central District has between 3.500 and 4,000 Republicans in it. That translates into a couple thousand homes. This effort is not difficult. You can easily see the 500 (25%) SUPER CHRONIC voting households in 10-15 days of work… 5-7 weekends this fall.
I promise you….IT WILL BE A REWARDING EXPERIENCE and I’m certain it will help change this STATE!
Please e-mail me with your cell phone number in the subject line and I will get right back to you.
Thanks for your continuing support and service to the Republican Party of Louisiana,
Lenar Whitney, National Committeewoman
Republican Party of Louisiana
Democrats Pick California Leftist Kamala Harris to be Joe's VP
This week the Democratic Party formally nominated California Senator Kamala Harris to be Vice-President Joe Biden’s running mate.
Sen. Harris is the left-wing political operative who sought the Democratic nomination for President last year by aligning her politics with the radical left and attacking the very same candidate on whose ticket she is now running! During her campaign, she publicly supported:
* Abolishing all private healthcare and requiring Medicare-for-All.
* Stripping American’s of their second amendment rights through the use of executive orders.
* Passing the anti-job Green New Deal while raising taxes on the middle class.
* Decriminalizing illegal immigration and offering illegal immigrants free healthcare and other services.
She has not since renounced any of these positions; if anything, she has been emboldened since the COVID pandemic began.
The choice in November is now clearer than ever: a vote for Trump-Pence is a vote for peace and prosperity; a vote for Biden-Harris is a vote for violence, anarchy, and socialized medicine. The danger of a Biden-Harris administration is grave, and the price our country would have to pay is far too high.
Only a vote for President Trump will ensure that America’s economy will be rebuilt, our country strengthened, and our people empowered. Let’s Keep America Great!
RSCC QUALIFYING STARTS TODAY
On August 19th, qualifying begins for Republican State Central Committee (RSCC), member candidates. Becoming an RSCC member is one of the best ways to get involved with the future of our Party, so if you haven’t considered running, you should!
Representing all registered Republicans in Louisiana, the Republican State Central Committee is the governing body of the Louisiana Republican Party. The RSCC is dedicated to the purposes of electing persons affiliated with the Party to public offices at the federal, state, and local levels, and supporting issues that reflect the principles of the Party.
Qualifying starts on August 19th and ends on August 21st! The election day is December 5th. You must qualify as a candidate at your local clerk of court offices.
Get involved with the future of our Party, qualify as a candidate, and run to be on the RSCC--YOUR PARTY NEEDS YOU!
RSCC Member Information Update
At our RSCC meeting earlier this month, multiple members notified us that their contact information is currently out of date. To solve this issue we’ve created an online form for members to fill out. This form will let members update their contact information, let us know which method of contact they prefer, and how often they want to be contacted by the party. RSCC Members can fill the form out here.
Party Registration Drive Continues!
We are closing in on our 1,000,000th member of the Republican Party of Louisiana very soon! Registering and changing your registration to Republican is absolutely crucial because the Democrats fund their candidates based on how many registered voters are in each party. The more united we are as Republicans, the better our chances are of keeping dirty Democrat money out of Louisiana! You can re-register by CLICKING HERE.

OFFICIAL: The LAGOP Endorses Representatives Scalise, Graves, Higgins, and Johnson for Re-election
Baton Rouge, LA – The Republican Party of Louisiana is excited to announce its official endorsements of Representatives Steve Scalise, Garret Graves, Clay Higgins, and Mike Johnson, in their respective re-election bids. These endorsements were approved by a unanimous vote of the LAGOP Executive Committee.
During their time in office, all four Congressmen have distinguished themselves as reliably conservative voices for a strong America. Rep. Graves has made tremendous progress in rebuilding Louisiana's coastline, funding flood mitigation projects, and cutting taxes for small businesses and middle-class Americans. Rep. Higgins has protected oil and gas jobs, secured our border, and obtained more than $420 million for dredging and flood mitigation projects in LA-03.
Rep. Johnson has used his two terms in office to cut taxes, and burdensome regulations defended our active-duty military and brought tens of millions of federal dollars back into his district. He now chairs the influential Republican Study Committee. Finally, Rep. Scalise has been a staunch defender of our pro-life values, an ally of President Trump, a senior Congressional leader as Republican Whip, and the RESTORE Act's lead sponsor; the single most substantial investment in rebuilding our state's coast.
""The Republican Party of Louisiana is proud to have these accomplished public servants representing our state at the federal level,"" stated LAGOP Chairman Louis Gurvich. ""Our Republican representatives have fought hard for conservative values since their election to the House. We must re-elect them so they can continue advocating for Louisiana and support President Trump. Let's KEEP AMERICA GREAT!""

Uncollected trash, unrecoverable dead bodies, out of control spending, rampant corruption, deteriorating infrastructure, and a declining population: This is the real state of Louisiana in 2020. Thanks to Governor John Bel Edwards, Louisiana is stuck in a financial death spiral, with an even worse decline in our future if nothing happens to turn Louisiana around.
This unfortunate state of affairs is something Louisianans have grown accustomed to during the Democrats' hundred plus year control of state politics. Louisiana has failed to capitalize on our abundant natural resources, our rivers and ports, and our hard-working people. We underperformed in most economic booms and suffered longer and more harshly than others in every economic downturn.
Given this record of failure, how could Louisiana have re-elected a governor who so thoroughly fits the mold of previous failed administrations? For answers, look towards Louisiana's avowedly liberal media establishment, our cabals of liberal special interests, and the money spent by wealthy out-of-state progressives to fund a corrupt political machine. Overseeing it all is our complacent Governor who believes that a 40,000 vote nail-biter re-election is a mandate to govern. To paraphrase former Governor Roemer, these are the “dragons of decline” which we must slay if Louisiana is to move forward.
Responding to incompetent governance, Louisianans in late 2019 decided that they've had enough and voted for Republicans in record numbers to take control of both chambers of Louisiana's legislature. These Republicans are committed to a reform platform, promising voters to confront Louisiana's dragons of decline.
First on the agenda is reigning in Louisiana's spend-thrift government. Legislators have already started fulfilling this promise by vigorously holding bloated state agencies to account, calling out John Bel's hypocritical staff pay-raises, and calling for responsible fiscal policies. Second, a groundswell of public outcry has made TORT Reform a tangible possibility. Republicans are working together to lower car insurance rates, bring Louisiana in line with other states, and loosen the grip of trial lawyers on our politics.
Finally, Republicans are combatting liberal interest groups that despise Louisiana's values and culture. From bills protecting women's sports, the right to life, and more, legislators are defending values that the vast majority of Louisianans hold dear. When these bills reach Governor Edwards' desk, he will have to choose between Louisiana's people or the radicals within the Democratic Party.
Louisiana faces a powerful establishment unwilling to change, and so, we as a state must now choose whether to sink or swim if we are to thrive. Thankfully, the new legislature offers Louisiana a pathway to confronting its beastly establishment. Yet to achieve victory, Republicans must remain united and must act boldly to resist Governor John Bel's progressive liberal instincts.
Republican legislators arrived at the Capitol this session in record numbers, armed with strong leadership and an independent agenda. Let us pray that they will be successful in turning Louisiana around.

As we all know, we are only days away from the most consequential election in decades. I know it, you know it, and Democrats know it which is why we have done everything in our power and we must continue to as Republicans make certain that we win. Under our dynamic new Executive Director, Brittney Reed, the LAGOP staff has been incredibly busy in the month of October, even while dodging hurricanes in the midst of a pandemic in which several of them fell ill! I am so very proud of their achievements; I'd like to here list at least some of them:
While servicing the usual needs of our members and organizations, they've been cranking more news and press releases, emails, and social media than I ever remember seeing before in my years with the LAGOP. The quality of their material has been very good, and I don't think I've seen anything better from any other state party.
They've managed to recruit and train over two hundred volunteers across the state to serve as phone bankers, poll watchers, sign wavers, etc. for Election Day. Their efforts will be of great benefit to President Trump, Senator Cassidy, our Congressmen and local candidates. And they'll be working throughout this weekend and long into Wednesday morning!
They conducted eight in-person voter registration drives in five different parishes across the state (Ouachita, Vermilion, St. Tammany, Jefferson, & East Baton Rouge) to cap off our months long voter registration awareness campaign. The LAGOP also produced three videos on school choice, the Louisiana economy and security to support our registration efforts. The result? We reached the long awaited one million member mark with thousands of new members to spare, while over the last ninety days the Secretary of State reports that ten new Republicans were registered for every new Democrat.
Our staff spoke at events held by the Acadiana Republican Women's Club, the Jefferson Parish Republican Women's Club, the Saint Martin Republican Parish Executive Committee, the Pelican State Pachyderm Club, and the Ouachita Republican Women's Club, while giving radio interviews and hosting Students for Trump (LSU) and numerous legislators during the special session. Two new College Republican chapters were also founded under LAGOP guidance at Louisiana Tech and University of Louisiana Monroe.
They purchased and distributed thousands of Trump and Cassidy signs, placards, and campaign memorabilia, while assisting our candidates with data, several new apps, and general consulting. I've spoken to the grateful candidates and campaign staffers and I've read the emails and texts thanking our staff for the great job they've been doing.
Louis Gurvich, Chairman
Republican Party of Louisiana
Introducing LAGOP Staff
Brittney Reed- Executive Director
Brittney has taken her new role head on and has shown through her leadership how to efficiently run the LAGOP. A Vermilion Parish native, Brittney brings a diverse perspective to Louisiana politics. She has been the leader & backbone behind the efforts of the LAGOP & its staff in making the LAGOP the strongest resource it can be for Louisiana.
In her short time here so far, Brittney has attended & spoken at various Republican organization’s meetings across the state, has met with several Republican Legislators and leaders to discuss how the LAGOP can build stronger relationships with constituents and how the LAGOP can play a larger role in the Legislature, grassroots efforts, education, recruitment and much more, all while leading & overseeing all efforts & activity leading up to and through Election Day.
Brittney's vision for the LAGOP centers around efficiency and unity ensuring all constituents have the resources and opportunities they need as well as pursuing victory down the ballot. We are very excited to see what else is in store as she continues as our Executive Director.
Grant Scheeringa- Communications Director and Legislative Liaison
Grant is an essential part of the LAGOP. Previously serving as the Grassroots Director for over a year crafting the on-the-ground volunteer framework, Grant has now stepped up to the integral role of Communications Director, composing and amplifying our Republican message. He is responsible for social media, press releases, newsletters, etc. as well as advising on party development and strategy. He is also the President of the LSU College Republicans.
Lena Wilson- Operations Director
As Operations Director, Lena oversees and manages daily business operations of the LAGOP. She plans and organizes various events and meetings, supervises interns, and works with the Executive Director on party development. She is an LSU graduate with a B.A. in Political Science and a minor in Information Technology Management. Originally from California, Lena wanted to bring her conservative ideas and work ethic to Louisiana where she has made an impactful difference.
Olivia Osborne- Grassroots Director
Olivia interned with the LAGOP for several months before a promotion to Grassroots Director. Olivia is the engine behind our grassroots efforts and recently organized over 200 Election Day poll watcher and phone banking volunteers. In her role, she also serves as the liaison between campaigns and Republican organizations to the LAGOP. She recently attended the Jefferson Parish Republican Women's Chapter monthly meeting where she built and strengthened relationships with members and other Republican leaders.
Lucas Kelly- Data Director
Lucas is a key component to our team who has come a long way in his time at the LAGOP. He took an interest in data analysis and quickly excelled filling a critical role in the lead up to the election. He has assisted countless campaigns with his expertise and skills curating voter contact programs. As the LAGOP's point person for data, he has extensively communicated with the RNC and national campaigns to coordinate on areas of focus across Louisiana.
Elizabeth Crochet- Deputy Communications Director
Elizabeth, a New Orleans native, interned with the LAGOP for nearly a year with a strong focus in the communications department. It was an easy decision to ask that she step in to the very important role of being the LAGOP's Deputy Communications Director. Elizabeth is the liaison to our Digital Ambassadors and assists Grant with all communication material, bringing a unique style to LAGOP communications. Elizabeth is the President of Students for Trump at LSU and is involved in several campus and conservative organizations.
Zachary Chenier- Deputy Grassroots Director
Zach is the newest addition to the LAGOP staff and there is no question as to why he was brought on board. After interning for almost a year, developing a well rounded skill set by assisting in various departments of the LAGOP, Zach was able to find his niche and is now the LAGOP's Deputy Grassroots Director. He has a B.A. in Political Science from LSU and has been putting his knowledge to good use. Zach excels at constituent communication so expect to hear him when you call the LAGOP.
Pierce Griffith- Information, Technology & Database Manager
In Pierce's role, he has been instrumental in upgrading the LAGOP's technological edge and coding programs to streamline communication and access to legislative bills, volunteer framework, and more. Pierce is an LSU graduate with a B.S. in Computer Science.
Legislative Update
We are beyond proud of our Louisiana State Representatives successful efforts in supporting a petition that puts an end to Governor Edwards' power hungry coronavirus restrictions.
The people of Louisiana want to see our state open back up and witness our economy prosper under President Trump again.
For far too long, Governor Edwards has spent his time working against Republicans in the legislature instead of doing his job and working WITH them. ""The Republican Party of Louisiana is proud of the tireless efforts that our legislators have made to reopen Louisiana,"" says LAGOP Chairman Louis Gurvich.
Aside from this, Republicans in the House approved a resolution to suspend the Fire Marshal's ability to enforce the Governor's lockdown restrictions.
Having these fighters in the Capitol every day, helps assure the people of Louisiana that our conservative principles will ALWAYS be fought for!
Deputy Chairman and State Senator Elbert Guillory gives his thoughts on the final Presidential Debate
""Former Vice President Biden, once again, duck, dodged and hid from the real issues. Biden blamed Trump, not God, for Covid but guaranteed that he, Biden, can end Covid. Then, what's new, Biden told a bald-faced lie that he never accepted money from foreign countries despite clear and convincing records of his and his son’s dealings with Ukraine and China. The former Vice President spent 47 years in Washington but did nothing to solve or to address the problems we face today. Biden plans to open America’s borders to all immigrants from all over the world. That would destroy our education system, our welfare system, our job system, and our criminal justice system! This debate proved that Donald Trump is the ONLY candidate qualified for the White House.""

VOLUME XV
Well, here we are on this April 29, 2020, also known as Day 38 of the John Bel Edwards’ statewide lockdown order. This past Monday the Governor extended Louisiana’s lockdown through May 15th, or should we say Day 54. However, many of our neighboring states are going down a different path and preparing to lift their lockdown orders. Georgia has already gone back to work.
As the Governor commented during his Monday press conference, he consulted with several medical specialists before he made his decision to extend the lockdown. They advised him that some regions within the state were still spiking with new Coronavirus cases. While he admitted during the press conference that most regions of the state were improving, he failed to consult legislators, industry leaders, or plain ordinary working folks before making his decision to extend the lockdown. His reasoning was that business and political leaders just did not have the latest medical facts, so apparently, he did not feel it was worth the effort to talk to them before he made his decision.
Now, try as one might to keep politics out of the pandemic crisis, one quickly finds this to be an impossibility. As I recently wrote in another article, “This is unfortunate but is to be expected in a republic riven by a deep and growing partisan divide, wherein every issue has become politicized.” True enough, and the Governor’s press conference starkly illustrated one of the main reasons why Democrats seem to be so insensible to conservatives’ concerns about the extended lockdown’s effect on our economy.
Basically, so few Democrat elected officials now have any business management experience (or serious business experience of any kind), that they simply cannot comprehend the level of carnage that the extended lockdown has wrought on Louisiana’s economy. Trial lawyers have no such business experience, nor do community activists and pastors, and certainly not careerist liberal-progressive politicians. Without substantial input from working folks and the business community, John Bel Edwards should never have made his decision to lock down our economy for fifty-four straight days.
To adequately portray the true gravity of the situation, consider that Louisiana started this crisis with the worst economy of any state in the nation. Add in one of the highest unemployment rates and one of the highest poverty rates in the country, and it quickly becomes evident that our citizenry had fewer savings and other resources on which to rely than most Americans.
Then add in the fact that two of our basic industries, petrochemicals, and tourism, are among the worst hit, and another, shipping and trade, is also in serious trouble. Finally, factor in the hundreds of thousands of just received unemployment claims, and you can only then begin to understand the urgency of getting Louisianians back to work as quickly as possible.
Yes, we are experiencing a pandemic crisis, but we are also experiencing an unemployment crisis and a business crisis, which could soon reach the point wherein so many businesses begin to fail at the local and national levels that we will be unable to provide even basic necessities for our people. These are the high stakes involved in Gov. Edwards’ decision last Monday.
Now before Democrats begin to fall back on their usual defensive tropes, i.e., that everyone who disagrees with their progressive ideology is a loutish deplorable, a mass murderer, or even a truly horrible “science denier,” consider the fact that what science doesn’t know about COVID-19 would fill a very, very big book. We are certainly not implying that COVID-19 is anything other than a serious disease that specializes in killing the more vulnerable among us, but we are suggesting that it is time to take a more nuanced view of this pandemic than our Governor has managed to achieve.
The obvious facts are that Louisiana‘s diverse geography contains parishes with six-figure populations, parishes where alligators substantially outnumber people, and everything in between. John Bel Edwards’ standardized statewide response to the crisis was never the best answer for Louisiana, and this becomes more evident with every passing day.
Epidemiologists, the doctors who specialize in epidemics and pandemics, have advised Gov. Edwards that the longer we maintain the economic lockdown, the more lives will be saved. True or not, other healthcare providers daily remind us that death rates are surging, and this is by no means entirely due to COVID-19 or natural causes.
Experts tell us that the social costs of unemployment, wealth destruction, business failures, delayed medical treatments, and pervasive societal fear are actually quite high. Increased rates of depression, suicide, homicides, and crime generally, drug overdoses, and other pathological behaviors, as well as the daily stresses of obtaining basic necessities, all take their toll. These factors must be weighed against the human costs of COVID-19, considerable as they may be.
Waiting for a vaccine and an effective drug treatment before restarting our economy is simply not a realistic option. While it is entirely likely that such medicines will become available much sooner than heretofore thought possible, a year for effective treatment and two years for a safe vaccine is extremely optimistic projections by past standards. We cannot wait anywhere near that long; hence we are forced to make a choice between the possibility that restarting our economy may cause an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases, versus the certainty that our economy will soon be shattered beyond near-term repair if we remain on lockdown.
There can be but one answer to this dilemma. Louisiana’s economy must be re-opened, and soon. The process need not be all or nothing. It should be phased in, but over as brief a time as the circumstances permit, and by region or parish, depending on the prevailing situation in each location. Precautionary measures should continue to be observed as long as necessary and reinstituted if, God forbid, a recurrence of the virus is detected.
But the fact remains that the longer the Governor orders that the entire state be kept on lockdown, the longer it will take to return to normal, whatever that may be going forward. If our Governor will not reconsider his decision and begin the process of reopening our state by May 1st, we urge the legislature to take immediate action to overrule his decree.

Republican Elected Officials Work Hard to Help Louisiana Recover
Despite the turmoil caused by the Coronavirus Pandemic, Louisiana’s Republican officials in DC are working hard to ensure Louisiana has the resources we need to beat the virus and rebuild our state afterward.
In the Senate, Sen. Cassidy has been able to secure funding for many Louisiana schools and infrastructure projects. Thanks to Sen. Cassidy’s work, $1 million has been secured for Louisiana’s smaller universities and $36 million has been secured for the Belle Chasse Naval Station project. Additionally, Sen. Kennedy has successfully gotten nearly $287 million of CARES Act funding for K-12 education in Louisiana. Combined with a research grant worth $200,000 for ULL’s Coronavirus research project, Louisiana’s education system looks like it will leave this crisis stronger than ever before--thanks to the work of our Senators.
In the House, Republican representatives have been hard at work, ensuring our state receives the funding necessary to weather these difficult times. Just yesterday, Rep. Johnson announced $1.6 million dollars were granted to public housing authorities in LA’s 4th district. Johnson also helped secure a $6.5 million dollar FEMA grant for the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals. Rep. Abraham partnered with the Treasury and SBA to ensure that parish owned hospitals are now able to benefit from forgivable payroll loans.
Rep. Higgins has taken actions to protect our state’s key industry- oil and gas. Higgins wrote a second letter to Governor Edwards on April 21st, asking for a cutback in the severance tax, and to President Trump requesting relief from royalties on offshore production of energy in Mexico’s gulf. This past week, Rep. Graves announced that he has secured an additional $12 million dollars in grants for Baton Rouge and New Orleans airports. Finally, Representative Steve Scalise has been hard at work while serving on President Trump’s reopening of the economy task force.
Thanks to our Republican delegation in DC, Louisiana will not simply survive this crisis, we will thrive in its aftermath.
Louisiana's Republican Congressional delegation is working hard to keep Louisiana safe and healthy. Being a public servant is all about leadership when an unexpected crisis appears, and our Republican officials are meeting this challenge.
Thank Louisiana's Republican Congressional Delegation for their leadership in these tough times by signing the card below.

A Brief Message to Take With You to the Polls
#
(BATON ROUGE,LA)\- Today is the day! Please get out and vote, and make sure to remind your friends and relatives to do likewise.
I can’t think of a better way to cap off all the newsletters, press releases, articles, and postings that the staff and I have written about this presidential campaign over the last year, than with this article written by eminent historian Victor Davis Hanson. He makes short work of the Democrats’ case against Donald Trump, exposing the fallacies of their main arguments against our President in this short but brilliantly written essay.

As always, forward this post to your friends and relatives!
Lastly, I’d like to express our deepest appreciation to President Trump, Senator Cassidy, our Congressmen and other candidates, for the sacrifices they have made throughout this election campaign. May their efforts be rewarded with victory and may our cause prevail.
God bless America!

October 1st, 2020 VOLUME XX
WE DID IT!
LOUISIANA SECRETARY OF STATE CONFIRMS: THE LAGOP NOW HAS OVER ONE MILLION MEMBERS!
It was years in the making but it’s done, and we are now on our way to becoming the largest political party in Louisiana! My thanks to President Trump, our party officials and staff, elected officials, and our activists, for a job well done.
Expanding and empowering our party, while strengthening our conservative principles, has been my chief goal since 2016, first as your secretary and now as your chairman. I can assure you that we aren’t finished growing--truth is, we’re just getting started! More news to follow as we celebrate this major milestone...
The 2020 Presidential election is now just thirty-two days away. In fact, early voting begins on Friday, October 16th, and the deadline to request a mail-in ballot is Friday, October 30th. As we have been repeatedly told by both sides, this is indeed one of the most important elections in American history, and I hope you’ll make arrangements to cast your ballot wherever you’ll happen to be on Election Day.
Now pollsters have repeatedly advised us that most Americans have already made the decision as to which candidates they will be voting for, and I hope that the overwhelming evidence long ago led you to the conclusion that President Trump and his fellow Republicans are the only choice for the country.
I do have one favor to ask of you. If you’ve heard me speak or read my articles over these last five years, you probably already know that my request has to do with voter and party registration. I very much want to get our Republican membership numbers up for this election, and there is still time to add 15,000-20,000 new members before the election.
Fact is, LAGOP membership has been growing steadily, and that growth has picked up strongly in recent months. It shouldn’t take more than a very few years before we surpass the Democrat Party in total membership. That will be a tectonic change in Louisiana politics, as Democrats once dominated the political landscape.
Let me illustrate my point: In 2016, President Trump received the highest number of votes of any candidate in Louisiana history, exactly 1,178,638. Yet even today, four years later, there are still only about one million registered Louisiana Republicans, so there were nearly 200,000 more Trump voters in 2016 then there are Republicans in Louisiana even today.
What does that tell you? It tells you that a significant number of independents, other party members, and even Democrats, are basically conservative voters. Given the state of the Democrat Party today, there shouldn’t be any conservatives giving aid and comfort to a party which trashes its country’s origins, history, and accomplishments.
But does it matter to which party you belong? Yes, it does. Remember, politics at the national level is a battle involving tens of millions of people working together to achieve a common goal. Our victory in this fight depends on the success of the one American political party with a noble and untarnished history, grounded in the ideals of liberty and justice, and possessing the organizational strength necessary to defeat Progressivism and its mentors, Marxism and Anarchism. That party is, of course, the Republican Party, founded in 1854 with the specific goal of ending slavery in America. Never forget that fact, and be proud of who we are.
So the responsibility for leading the country out of the present political, moral, and economic chaos must necessarily fall on us as Republicans. There is no other major political party with the means or even the will to do so. That other major party is so mired in national self-doubt and moral contradictions of its own making as to be not only incapable of healing the country, but largely responsible for dividing it in the first place!
Our victory in 2020 is not about a few hundred federal judgeships or even a trillion dollars in the national budget going here instead of there. No, we are fighting for the very survival of the core foundational beliefs upon which our country was founded and upon which our national strength and economic prosperity are based. The issues before us are truly momentous, the political battle lines are drawn, and it is our duty as activists to carry our banner proudly and lead the charge.
About the favor I’m asking--we have reached the one million member mark, but let’s keep working to expand our party. If our leaders and activists would each commit to making five phone calls or personal contacts with friends or acquaintances whom they know are conservative minded but who aren't yet registered Republicans, or aren’t yet registered to vote, we'll have those 15,000-20,000 new members by November 3rd.
Call them, send them the attached registration video, or just refer them to the LAGOP website or [[URL REDACTED]], and they’ll receive instructions on how to register to vote or change their party registration. We need to get this done by October 5th for new voters to be able to vote on November 3rd if they register in person the old fashioned way, but we have until October 13th if they register on the [[URL REDACTED]] website. All that most people need to do to register to vote or make a change in party affiliation is to click on [[URL REDACTED]] and then click on Register to Vote- it’s as simple as that!

VOLUME XIV
As the coronavirus continues to spread across our state and our country, as leaders, it’s our job to set a good example by keeping calm and staying positive. As President Trump has repeatedly made clear in his many press conferences, this virus is an enemy that we will overcome. Doing so will require sacrifices by all of us, but like President Trump, we are confident that when faced with a great challenge, the American people will do what is necessary.
One of the things that must be done during this challenging time is to take strict measures to protect public health. To best protect our staff, the LAGOP headquarters in Baton Rouge will be closed until further notice. Staffers are working remotely and are available to assist you as needed. To communicate with someone at the party HQ, you may contact us via email at [[URL REDACTED]]
This year is quickly shaping up to be perhaps the most eventful year in recent memory. Yet, I am filled with confidence and hope. Our President is working tirelessly to fight this virus, Americans from all walks of life are coming together in solidarity, and the sacrifice of our doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals must never be forgotten. The United States, and Louisiana, in particular, have been confronted with significant challenges many times, and just as before, we will triumph.
Let us stay healthy and committed to keeping America great!

LAGOP Congratulates State Representatives on Successful Petition Override of Governor Edwards
# FINALLY! We are immensely proud of the combined efforts of our House members for their support on the recent petition to put an end to Governor Edwards' never-ending emergency powers.
Upon receiving the petition, the Governor's must revoke his emergency orders he has used so cavalierly. This petition puts a 7 day holt on further action. We hope the Governor follows the law and finally begins cooperating with the Legislature.
The House of Representatives' petition has the endorsement and support of the Republican House Delegation. Among House leaders, Speaker Clay Schexnayder, Speaker Pro Tempore Tanner Magee, and House Republican Delegation Chairman Blake Miguez have signed on the petition.
""The Republican Party of Louisiana is proud of the tireless efforts that our legislators have made to reopen Louisiana,"" commented LAGOP Chairman Louis Gurvich. ""The Governor must abide by the law and hand over his temporary emergency powers which were never intended to remain in place for so many months without legislative input.""

"When we look back on these two sessions, we will find them to have been a momentous turning point in the fight for a better Louisiana! View this email in your browser
OFFICIAL: LAGOP Statement on the End of the Legislature's Special Session
When we look back on these two sessions, we will find them to have been a momentous turning point in the fight for a better Louisiana!
Baton Rouge, LA – Both of this year’s legislative sessions mark a turning point for our state. Louisiana faced a unique set of challenges during the three-month regular session and the one-month special session, notably the COVID pandemic and the corresponding economic crash. However, our Republican legislators turned these challenges into several significant, long-term victories.
They passed tort reform and saved several tens of millions of dollars for a rainy day. They set aside several hundred million dollars to help Louisiana’s struggling small businesses. Most of all, they asserted the Legislature’s constitutional independence from the Governor and as a result future, legislative agendas will be decided by the people’s representatives in the House and Senate chambers--not by the Governor and his bureaucrat minions on the fourth floor of the Capitol. These are historic changes that will positively alter the direction of our state.
“The Republican Party of Louisiana applauds our Republican delegation leaders and members for their boldness and determination,” commented LAGOP Chairman Louis Gurvich. “The leadership of Senate President Page Cortez, House Speaker Clay Schexnayder, GOP Delegation Leaders Sen. Sharon Hewitt and Rep. Blake Miguez, along with their respective committee chairs was the key ingredient which made this historic change possible. They are all to be highly commended- I’m confident that in the future when we look back on these two sessions, we will find them to have been a momentous achievement in the fight for a better Louisiana!”

"The U.S. Supreme Court's recent ruling on abortion threatens the value of all human life. View this email in your browser
OFFICIAL: LAGOP Statement on U.S. Supreme Court's Ruling on Louisiana Abortion Law
The U.S. Supreme Court's recent ruling on abortion threatens the value of all human life.
Baton Rouge, LA – The Republican Party of Louisiana is very disappointed by today’s U. S. Supreme Court ruling overturning Louisiana’s abortion law. As Attorney General Jeff Landry has already stated, this is a tragic decision that only advances the cause of devaluing human life.
As pro-life conservatives, we believe that every single human life is equally valuable. When any society routinely condones practices that devalue human life, this only leads to further systemic injustice. For-profit abortion is one of the worst injustices plaguing modern American society. The practice unduly targets disadvantaged and other vulnerable groups and perpetuates a myth that some lives are more valuable than others. Rather than liberating women, abortion has allowed for the development of new forms of female oppression. Far from being a humane practice, abortion is a barbaric one which has no place in a just society.
“The Louisiana abortion law which was struck down earlier today had sought to make for-profit abortion groups more responsible for the safety and welfare of their patients,” said LAGOP Chairman Louis Gurvich. “That our nation’s highest court found such legislation to be unconstitutional is a sad testament to the state of our country. We will not stop working until this injustice is no more.”

Five years ago today, Donald J. Trump descended the escalator in Trump Tower to announce his campaign for the presidency. Few believed he stood a chance, yet he spoke to the concerns of many millions of Americans. He fought hard and beat Crooked Hillary Clinton.
As Election 2020 approaches, Democrats are trying to dismantle America's gains under President Trump. Their many attempts to unseat him have failed, and now they are fighting as hard as they can to push him out of the White House. For Democrats, it's not about electing Joe Biden; it's about removing President Trump.
President Trump fights for us every day. Now it's time to fight for him.
Here at the LAGOP, we are working tirelessly to spread our conservative message across the state to help re-elect President Trump, but we can't do it alone.
If you want to help Republicans win big in November, volunteering is the best way to do it. From digital ambassadors and Republican women's groups to door-knockers and phone-callers, you can make a real impact. Find out more HERE: [[URL REDACTED]]

OFFICIAL: The LAGOP Thanks Commissioner Mike Strain for His Steadfast Support for Judge Amy Coney Barrett
(Baton Rouge, LA) – The Republican Party of Louisiana would like to sincerely thank Commissioner of the Department of Agriculture and Forestry Mike Strain for his leadership in encouraging the Senate to confirm Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the United States Supreme Court.
Our Commissioner wrote a letter signed by nine other agricultural commissioners to Senate leaders of both parties, wherein he points out the obvious- that Judge Barrett is extremely well qualified and President Trump made the right choice in nominating her. Furthermore, the President was acting well within his rights to make the nomination when he did, because he was elected to serve FOUR full years, not three and a half.
Commissioner Strain said it best: “[[URL REDACTED]] will contribute greatly to the court's jurisprudence in the years and decades to come and will help guide America back to the ideals envisioned by our founding fathers.""
We appreciate the Commissioner's support of this outstanding nominee, and we join him in urging the Senate to confirm Judge Amy Coney Barrett.

"The Choice Is Clear: Prosperity under Trump/Pence or Decline under Biden/Harris View this email in your browser
OFFICIAL: LAGOP Statement on Joe Biden's Pick for Vice-President
Baton Rouge, LA – Yesterday afternoon, Democrat nominee for President Joe Biden announced his running mate would be California Senator Kamala Harris.
Sen. Harris is the left-wing political operative who sought the Democratic nomination for President last year by aligning her politics with the radical left and attacking the very same candidate on whose ticket she is now running! During her campaign, she publicly supported:
* Abolishing all private healthcare and requiring Medicare-for-All.
* Stripping American’s of their second amendment rights through the use of executive orders.
* Passing the anti-job Green New Deal while raising taxes on the middle class.
* Decriminalizing illegal immigration and offering illegal immigrants free healthcare and other services.
She has not since renounced any of these positions; if anything, she has been emboldened since the COVID pandemic began.
The choice in November is now clearer than ever: a vote for Trump-Pence is a vote for peace and prosperity; a vote for Biden-Harris is a vote for violence, anarchy, and socialized medicine. The danger of a Biden-Harris administration is grave, and the price our country would have to pay is far too high.
Only a vote for President Trump will ensure that America’s economy will be rebuilt, our country strengthened, and our people empowered. Let’s Keep America Great!

"The Time is Now. Governor Edwards must empower local authorities to open up their parishes. View this email in your browser
OFFICIAL: LAGOP Statement On Louisiana Moving to Phase Three
Baton Rouge, LA – The LAGOP calls on Governor John Bel Edwards to allow individual parish governing authorities wherein Corona-virus infections have fallen and local hospitals possess sufficient treatment capacity, to begin moving their jurisdictions into Phase 3. This follows recently passed resolutions by the parish governments of Jefferson, St. Tammany, and St. Bernard, which expressed a similar position.
Under the current Phase 2 restrictions, bars are limited to take-out only and businesses such as shopping malls, reception halls, and restaurants, have a maximum allowed occupancy of 50%. Phase 3 would relax the aforementioned restrictions on occupancy, and nursing home visits would be permitted under certain conditions. Many business leaders have long advocated for a Phase 3 regional implementation, as this would expand economic activity and allow more people to return to work.
""Every parish is experiencing this pandemic in different ways. So a “one size fits all” strategy is both impractical and actively harmful for our state,"" said LAGOP Chairman Louis Gurvich. ""We must trust our local leaders with the flexibility to do what is best for their parishes citizens and businesses.”

OFFICIAL: The LAGOP Endorses Senator Bill Cassidy for Re-election
Baton Rouge, LA – Following a unanimous vote, the Executive Committee of the Republican Party of Louisiana is pleased to announce its endorsement of Senator Bill Cassidy for re-election to the United States Senate. As Louisiana’s senior Senator, Senator Cassidy has shown himself to be a staunch conservative and has brought a unique set of skills to the Senate.
During his first term of office, Senator Cassidy established himself as a significant voice on conservative policy issues in the United States Senate. Yet, by building relationships with Senators of every political stripe, he avoided becoming bogged down in Washington’s political swamp. As a result, Senator Cassidy secured big wins for Louisiana, from flood recovery and coastal restoration funding, to lower average healthcare costs and massive assistance during the Coronavirus pandemic. His close relationship with President Trump ensured that Louisiana’s needs took center stage early in this crisis. He has since become one of the President’s most trusted advisers on healthcare policy.
“We are proud of the work that Senator Cassidy has accomplished for the people of Louisiana,” stated LAGOP Chairman Louis Gurvich. “After spending twenty-five years working as a doctor in Louisiana’s healthcare system, Senator Cassidy is one of the most informed voices in all of Washington. His hands-on medical experience and breadth of knowledge about public healthcare policy are unsurpassed at precisely the time when his expertise is most needed. We at the LAGOP are confident that with another term, Senator Cassidy will continue advancing Louisiana’s interests and working to KEEP AMERICA GREAT!”

"The Official Newsletter of the Republican Party of Louisiana View this email in your browser
VOLUME XVIII, July 9, 2020
You may have noticed that this month’s edition of the Partyline newsletter is coming out a little earlier than usual. That’s because I wanted to take this last opportunity to strongly urge everyone to vote in this Saturday’s Louisiana Presidential Preference Primary. Voting will take place at polling locations across the state from 7:00 AM - 8:00 PM. Be sure to check out [[URL REDACTED]] to verify your polling location.
This is a winner-take-all primary which will bind the entire RNC delegation to vote for President Trump at the Republican National Convention in Jacksonville this August. Yes, we all know who is going to win the Republican presidential primary in Louisiana, but it’s important that all voters registered as Republicans get out and vote to show our support for our President. The press takes notice of such things, and a poor turnout will make the news! Liberal-Progressive newspapers spin low turnout as a lack of enthusiasm for a candidate, when in fact there’s never been more enthusiasm for our President!
The country is more politically divided now than it has been since the late 1960s. That’s why America needs a President that believes in our country's future as well as its great past. Only President Trump has what it takes to defeat the radical left’s Socialists, Marxists, and Anarchists who are trying to destroy our country as we know it. We need him back for a second term, and we need your support on July 11th.
Lastly, please don’t forget that there are other races on the ballot, including our RPEC races, municipal races, and a special election for a representative for House District 54 in Jefferson and Lafourche Parishes. Please get out and vote this Saturday!
I very much look forward to seeing everyone in person at the August 8th meeting!
Louis Gurvich, Chairman
Republican Party of Louisiana
Next RSCC Meeting Scheduled for August 8th
The next RSCC meeting has been scheduled for 10:00 AM on Saturday, August 8th in Baton Rouge at the “new” state capitol in the House chamber. The LAGOP staff encourages RSCC members to make arrangments to attend or send a proxy. This is a very important election for a four-year term for the RNC offices of National Committeeman and National Committeewoman. If you are interested in running for either of these positions, please contact us at [[URL REDACTED]] We also have much else to discuss, and the call to meeting will be sent out in the next several days, along with more information and discounted hotel rates for RSCC members.
Surgical masks, gloves, and disinfectants will be available at the door. Social distancing will be encouraged and required for the safety of all RSCC Members and LAGOP staff. Call the LAGOP for additional information, (225) 395-9527.
NOTE: All other party leadership elections will be held in early 2021.
Upcoming RSCC Elections Officially Scheduled For December 5th
The election of RSCC members has been officially scheduled for December 5th. If you are interested in running for an RSCC seat, the official qualifying dates will be from August 19th through August 21st. Contact us at [[URL REDACTED]] for more information.
NOTE: The Secretary of State's website now reflects this announcement: [[URL REDACTED]]
RSCC To Keep Present Member Districts
You may have already heard the good news that our RSCC redistricting bills sailed through the legislature and replaced an archaic and wildly disproportional Democrat devised plan from the 1980s. The districting plan on the statute books (Louisiana Revised Statute 18:443.1) required the use of House districts for political parties with more than thirty percent of registered voters.
The now redrafted state statute imposed unconstitutional regulations on the LAGOP’s ability to govern itself and define its own RSCC member districts. This long-standing issue has now been resolved, and we are deeply grateful to Sen. Cathey, Rep. Amedee, the members of the House & Governmental Affairs Committee and the Senate & Governmental Affairs Committee, Senate President Page Cortez, House Speaker Clay Schexnayder, and Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin, for their help in getting these bills passed. Our RSCC elections can now proceed in our familiar districts.
LAGOP Just Keeps Getting Bigger and Bigger
The LAGOP currently counts about thirty-two percent of the registered voters in Louisiana among its approximately 949,000 members, a new record! We want to keep increasing our party registration at a fast pace, so make it a point to make a few calls every month to conservative-minded Democrats and Independents, and we’ll soon have our millionth member!

"As November 3rd approaches, the LAGOP is releasing new ads encouraging people to register as Republicans View this email in your browser
Dear Friends,
As we enter the final stretch of this election, it’s imperative that we spread our party’s message for a better tomorrow, and warn the electorate of the awful consequences of a Democrat victory. It’s also important that we build up our party with growing numbers of new members, for this as well as future political battles.
I’m excited to announce that here at the LAGOP, we’ve found a way to achieve all three goals with the first of several new ad pieces:
""Not Safe""
“Not Safe” showcases the stark danger the Democrats pose to the safety of our country. As we have constantly been reminded since May, Democratic governors, mayors, and city officials have aided, abetted, and repeatedly justified violent and destructive acts by anarchists and looters. These Democrat “leaders” repeatedly tried to brand these anarchists and looters as “peaceful protesters”, but the videos and casualty statistics exposed the lies.
Only Republicans can keep our cities and communities safe from the radical mob. The fact is, only Republicans will even try.
Please share our videos with as many people as you can- besides voting, this is the most important thing you can do to re-elect President Trump!
Sincerely,
Louis Gurvich, Chairman

"President Trump will speak tonight at the RNC Convention View this email in your browser
Dear Friends,
Tonight, President Trump will speak at the GOP Convention. During this speech, he will offer us his vision of America's future, in stark contrast to a Joe Biden presidency, which would only hold our nation back.
His speech will kick-off a barnstorming National Weekend of Action, an opportunity to remind voters that the President is a man of action who fights for the American people.
As part of this National Weekend of Action, President Trump will visit Louisiana to survey the damage caused by Hurricane Laura and comfort the victims.
We're looking forward to welcoming the President to Louisiana during this challenging time, and we're confident he will provide us with the aid and support our state needs. As he has declared many times, the best is yet to come. Under his leadership, we will together make Louisiana greater than it has ever been.
Sincerely,
Louis Gurvich, Chairman

LAGOP Stands with Secretary Ardoin in Opposing Ballot Harvesting
(Baton Rouge, LA) – New Orleans has been added to the growing list of Democrat lead cities across America which are attempting to influence the 2020 Presidential election through legal action.
Instead of dealing with the city’s dire issues, many of which have been aggravated by its poor leadership, the New Orleans City Council is now attempting to dictate election policy for the entire state of Louisiana by suing Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin. If the Council is successful in forcing the Secretary of State to give preferential treatment to voters in Orleans Parish in the 2020 Presidential election, New Orleans will open the door to massive ballot harvesting throughout our state.
And it’s a truly insidious scheme to bring ballot harvesting into Louisiana: Under the Council’s plan, absentee ballots would be dropped off at remote locations. The law now requires that the ballots be dropped off at the Registrar’s office in City Hall.
The New Orleans City Council should focus on the multitude of problems facing the city and leave the voting process alone. In fact, the courts have already ruled on the validity of the voting process. The LAGOP stands with Secretary Ardoin in opposing ballot harvesting. When we lose faith in our democratic process, we will soon lose our democracy!

VOLUME XVI
With the regular legislative session ending today, Republican legislators have made the responsible decision to call themselves back into session at 6 pm this evening, in order to pass a budget and reforms that will put more money into the pockets of Louisianans. By tradition, the legislature would wait on the Governor to call a special session, thus enabling the Governor to set the agenda. However, considering the severity of Louisiana’s fiscal position, Louisiana cannot afford to lose any more time nor can we allow John Bel to set the agenda.
The Republican Party of Louisiana fully supports this decision by the Republican legislative delegation. We applaud Speaker Schexnayder and President Cortez for their decisive leadership. Republican legislators are reasserting the constitutional power of the legislative branch and getting to work for the people of Louisiana.
We are confident that this special session--convened by legislators themselves--will deliver a fiscally responsible budget and a series of badly needed reforms. Republican legislators are taking the first steps in rebuilding our economy and getting Louisianans back to work.
Let’s make it clear to Governor Edwards: Republicans are unified; we are the party of the people; and we will not stop working until Louisiana is prosperous, strong, and free again.
Louis Gurvich, Chairman
Republican Party of Louisiana

Party Caucuses and State Convention Update:
After much discussion, the Executive Committee of the LAGOP decided to host our state party convention by teleconference and cancel our party caucuses. This decision was taken for several reasons, among which were lack of venue availability and the health and safety of the LAGOP staff and our members, volunteers, and candidates. Additionally, Congressional district delegates and alternate candidates were all basically running in uncontested races and hence there was no real need for caucuses. The State Convention will take place telephonically on June 13th.
President Trump-Restoring the Promise of America in the Midst of a Pandemic:
In 2016, President Trump promised to restore American greatness. Almost four years on, there is no doubt he has fulfilled that promise.
The month of May has proven to be no exception. On May 22, President Trump declared houses of worship essential, forcing governors to allow churches to finally reopen and thereby protecting our first amendment rights. President Trump fought back against Nancy Pelosi’s radical attempt to jeopardize our sacred right to securely vote by blocking mail-in voting. Additionally, President Trump ensured that no senior will ever have to choose between insulin and putting food on the table by lowering drug prices. Just this week, President Trump signed a domestic production deal with an American pharmaceutical company, a first step in moving drug manufacturing back to the United States.
As May ends, President Trump continues to fight for all Americans. With his robust response to the Coronavirus pandemic, American states are reopening. Combined with a revolutionary economic plan, under President Trump America will soon achieve its greatest comeback in history.
Louisiana Republicans are Moving Louisiana Forward:
Republican legislators returned to the session earlier this month and hit the ground running. Short on time due to the Coronavirus, our legislators wasted none by quickly considering many bills that will help to transform Louisiana. From TORT Reform to Budget Reform, our legislators have taken decisive action. Uppermost in their concerns is the effect that the Coronavirus and a crash in the petrochemical markets are having on Louisiana’s economy and budget. As a result, Republican legislators are acting with foresight, passing legislation that will reshape our state into one that is business-friendly. Their actions are comparable to similar actions taken by Texas in the early ‘90s—actions that led to the Texas economic boom.
Louisiana is fortunate to have such a driven Republican-dominated legislature. Thanks to them, Louisiana’s future looks brighter than ever before.

"Our President and Republican candidates are counting on us.
To our LAGOP friends,
I hope you and your family are healthy and holding up well during this unprecedented time. I just wanted to take a moment to share a quick update with you.
As the leader of the Republican Party here in Louisiana, I have an obligation to be honest and transparent with you. The truth is, the outbreak of the Chinese virus (COVID-19) has interrupted some of our election activities and has critically slowed our fundraising. Without those crucial funds, we may have to make some tough decisions to halt parts of our operation.
However, elections are still happening, and we still have an extremely important job to do.
In unprecedented times like these, strong, conservative leadership is more important than ever before. I believe President Trump is the only candidate capable of delivering this nation from such a profound crisis. If it’s not enough that his first term delivered the most powerful economy in American history, President Trump has been the present, assertive, and competent leader we need to help the nation overcome the coronavirus.
But if we expect to keep our state red, we must continue to ramp up our Get-Out-The-Vote campaign message. That won’t happen without grassroots donations like yours. Our President and our Republican candidates are counting on us.
So please, if you are able to, join our efforts to KEEP AMERICA GREAT by signing up for one of our monthly giving programs.
Louisiana Republican Trust >>
Official Trump 45 Club >>
The Pelican Club >>
Now more than ever before, we need Louisiana Republicans to step up. We all know how important this upcoming election is, and we are working tirelessly to ensure President Trump’s re-election victory. Every dollar- and every day- is critical to our success!
It is an honor to serve you and I look forward to working together to Keep America Great!
Sincerely,
Louis Gurvich
Chairman, Republican Party of Louisiana
P.S.- Every $45 donation gets our conservative message in front of 1,000 more voters. Your donation, today, can make a HUGE difference. Please help our efforts in anyway you can!

"Just when I thought the Democrats would put aside their differences for the good of the American People, they proved me wrong yet again.
Friend,
Just when I thought the Democrats would put aside their differences for the good of the American People, they proved me wrong yet again. Democrats have made it clear that they would rather HURT our Nation than work with Republicans and do what’s right.
While tens of millions of working families are anxiously waiting on Congress to pass an economic stimulus package that helps American workers, healthcare providers, and small businesses, the Do-Nothing Democrats would rather further their own corrupt political agenda than do what’s right for the American People.
THIS is just a taste of what Pelosi and House Democrats put into the COVID-19 economic stimulus bill:
* Mandated $15 minimum wage
* Funding for sanctuary cities
* Same-day voting
* Automatic voter registration
* USPS debt forgiveness
* Unionization of federal workers
* Newspaper funding
* Mandated corporate carbon offset
* Expanding tax-credits for solar and wind energy
Enough is enough. We can’t let them play games with the livelihood of our Nation and its citizens any longer. We need all Louisiana Republicans to join us and stand up against the Do-Nothing Democrats TODAY!
Let us stay strong and committed, to keep America great!
Stay safe,

"The official way to become a member of the Trump-Republican team in Louisiana.
Fellow Deplorable,
This November, the future of our great country will be in our hands.
From the moment President Trump placed his hand on the Bible and took the oath of office to serve as America’s 45th President, he has worked nonstop to deliver on his promise to Make America Great Again.
Having already accomplished so much, President Trump is determined now more than ever to continue his efforts to KEEP AMERICA GREAT!
Yet, the mainstream media, obstructionist Democrats, and Left- leaning special interest groups continue to pursue their strategy of deception and misinformation to defeat our President and all our Republican House and Senate candidates in the 2020 election.
You know just as well as I do that the Democrats’ socialist-progressive agenda poses an existential threat to our nation. Since President Trump’s election, America has been on the road to success. With Democrats at the wheel we’d swerve sharp left straight into a [[URL REDACTED]] would bankrupt our government, disarm our military, and turn away our allies. America would be left tired, poor, and alone in a sea of sharks.
That’s why were asking ALL Louisiana Republicans to show President Trump you have his back by join the 45 Club TODAY. This special club is the best way to help President Trump, America, and the Republican Party in this election year. All it takes to join is a one-time donation of $45 or a monthly donation of $5.
Unlike your taxes under Democratic rule, your donation will not be misused. Your investment enables us to help the Trump Campaign in key ways like:
* Get Out the Vote operations (GOTV)
* Voter Outreach
* Mailers
* Phone Banking
Keeping the Democrats out of the White House is going to take every single one of us working together for the next seven months. I humbly ask that you help us stay on track to deliver another victory to President Trump and all of our Republican Congressmen and Senators who are up for election this November, by becoming a member of The 45 Club TODAY!
Thank you for believing in our country and helping us Keep America Great.
Sincerely,
Louis Gurvich, Chairman

Republican Friends & Colleagues,
We are now less than two weeks out from the most important Presidential election in recent history. It’s crunch time- we need all Republicans on board to make that final push for victory in what will likely be a close and bitterly fought campaign.
As you probably know, Louisiana is not considered a battleground state. This means we won’t be receiving any outside resources to assist us, but we must deliver the largest vote in the history of our state to the President and to our other Republican candidates. We must secure this victory ourselves, and we must do it in the midst of a pandemic with changed election dynamics.
So the LAGOP is going to need YOUR help to create the best ground team in Louisiana history. We need volunteers, and lots of them! Here are some of the ways you can help:
(1) PHONE BANK VOLUNTEERS: Phone bank volunteers are essential. There are many voters who haven’t yet made up their minds, and with a little persuasion you can bring them on board. Phone banking can now be done from your own home, and it’s a perfect way for our older volunteers and caregivers to contribute to the cause.
(2) POLL WATCHERS: Poll watchers are important in every major election. They work a long day, but their presence ensures that the laws are followed at the polling places, and they report vital information through the day to the LAGOP/Trump campaign. (Don’t worry, we’ll provide the special instructions needed for this job.)
(3) OFF SITE VOLUNTEERS: Remote site volunteers are needed to help with signs, neighborhood door walking, strike teams, etc.
To participate, you can submit your information to the LAGOP directly at [[URL REDACTED]] by October 24th. Please don’t hesitate to send this email to anyone you think might be interested in helping us!
We thank you for your support and look forward to making history together!

Louis Gurvich

## LAGOP Announces Postponement of the March 28th, 2020 Congressional Caucuses
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
March 16th, 2020
(Baton Rouge, LA) Following the postponement of Louisiana’s Presidential Primary and amid the ongoing spread of the coronavirus COVID-19, the LAGOP has decided to postpone the March 28th Delegate and Alternate Congressional Caucuses.
Out of an abundance of caution, the LAGOP Executive Committee voted unanimously to postpone the Delegate and Alternate Congressional Caucuses until mid-April 2020.
This decision was not taken lightly, but instead with caution and the health of Louisiana Republicans in mind. “With this novel coronavirus continuing to spread rapidly, we felt it was in the best interest of the voters and our party staffers to postpone the Caucuses. We understand the concern and uncertainty everyone is experiencing around the evolving situation, and we're committed to being responsive and flexible,” said LAGOP Chairman Louis Gurvich.

"HB419, a proposal for Vote-by-Mail threatens the integrity of our elections and put at risk the democratic society we have worked so hard to build.
For the second week in a row, a radical Democrat is trying force unregulated vote-by-mail. Mail-in Mandie Landry and other Democratic operative groups are pushing legislation like HB 419, which allows for unregulated mail-in-ballot. This legislation is a clear attempt to rig our elections and pose a huge threat to our democracy.
At the core of the vote-by-mail campaign is a willingness to overturn all electoral accountability. Vote-by-mail would run into multiple issues:
* Voter rolls are not always up to date meaning some people could get the wrong ballot, or never receive one.
* There are no promises mail-in-ballots will be counted or delivered to election officials.
* There is no way to verify the identity of voters.
* It weakens our democracy.
* It destroys voter confidence and integrity.
* It opens our elections to more fraud, abuse, and corruption.
We hope you can understand the severity of this attempt to implement vote-by-mail in Louisiana. The Republican Party of Louisiana is taking this seriously, and that’s why we need you all to submit written testimony--opposing HB419--to the Committee on House and Governmental Affairs before the bill’s hearing on Tuesday, May 19th at 1:00 PM.
Please submit your testimony opposing HB 419 to House and Governmental Affairs attorney [[URL REDACTED]] at least three hours before the meeting, which begins at 9 am. If you don’t, Louisiana’s elections could be rigged forever.
Our founding fathers called on us to defend our rights, and now is the time for us to defend our sacred right to vote and for every single vote to be counted equally. Thank you for opposing this legislation and support Louisana’s election integrity.
Share the post below and let everyone know you stand for Louisiana’s election integrity and oppose HB 419:

"Dear Republican Friends & Colleagues,
We are now less than three weeks out from the most important Presidential election in recent history. It’s crunch time- we need all Republicans on board to make that final push for victory in what will likely be a close and bitterly fought campaign.
As you probably know, Louisiana is not considered a battleground state. This means we won’t be receiving any outside resources to assist us, but we must deliver the largest vote in the history of our state to the President and to our other Republican candidates. We must secure this victory ourselves, and we must do it in the midst of a pandemic with changed election dynamics.
So the LAGOP is going to need YOUR help to create the best ground team in Louisiana history. We need volunteers, and lots of them! Here are some of the ways you can help:
(1) PHONE BANK VOLUNTEERS: Phone bank volunteers are essential. There are many voters who haven’t yet made up their minds, and with a little persuasion you can bring them on board. They may also need additional information on early voting and absentee voting. Phone banking can now be done from your own home, and it’s a perfect way for our older volunteers and caregivers to contribute to the cause.
(2) POLL WATCHERS: Poll watchers are important in every major election. They work a long day, but their presence ensures that the laws are followed at the polling places, and they report vital information through the day to the LAGOP/Trump campaign. (Don’t worry, we’ll provide the special instructions needed for this job.)
(3) OFF SITE VOLUNTEERS: Remote site volunteers are needed to help with signs, neighborhood door walking, strike teams, etc.
To participate, you can submit your information to the LAGOP directly at [[URL REDACTED]] by October 20th. We thank you for your support and look forward to making history together!
Sincerely,
Louis Gurvich

## LAGOP Calls on Gov. Edwards to Not Stand in the Way of Moving Louisiana Forward
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
March 9th, 2019
(Baton Rouge, LA) As legislators gather in Baton Rouge for the start of the 2020 Legislative Session, the Republican Party of Louisiana (LAGOP) calls upon Governor Edwards to work with Republican legislators to pass real reforms that will move Louisiana forward.
Since winning re-election on his campaign promise to be a bi-partisan leader, Governor Edwards has proposed an agenda that runs counter to the reforms Republicans and voters desperately want. As a result, Governor Edwards is failing to be the bi-partisan leader he promised to be during his campaign.
The LAGOP believes this kind of blatant manipulation of voters is undignified for the office Governor Edwards holds. ""We hope that Governor Edwards' will fulfill the wishes of Louisiana's voters by supporting positive reforms proposed by conservative legislators,"" commented LAGOP Chairman Louis Gurvich, ""Governor Edwards must support true reforms that will move Louisiana forward.""

"Dear Republican Friends & Colleagues,
I would like to begin by first wishing all those who suffered through Hurricanes Laura and Delta a quick recovery from the storms’ effects. We must be thankful for the very low number of casualties reported so far in Delta, even as we sort through the debris. I know that the strength and fortitude of our people will once again see us through this disaster, but having lived through Katrina, I know what you are going through now. Should you need supplies, my old security company can be of assistance- just leave your name and number with the LAGOP staff.
We are now only three weeks out from the most important Presidential election in recent history. It’s crunch time- we need all Republicans on board to make that final push for victory in what will likely be a close and bitterly fought campaign.

## LAGOP Announces Rescheduling of the 2020 Congressional Caucuses and State Party Convention
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
March 27th, 2020
(Baton Rouge, LA) Amid the ongoing pandemic of the coronavirus COVID-19, the LAGOP has updated its previous decision to postpone the March 28th Congressional District Caucuses and the April 18th State Party Convention.
Out of an abundance of caution, the LAGOP Executive Committee voted unanimously to reschedule the Congressional District Caucuses for June 6th and the Louisiana Republican State Party Convention for June 13th. This decision was taken to protect LAGOP staff, volunteers, and party members, and to support efforts to reduce the spread of COVID-19.
“Our country’s doctors, nurses, and hospitals are relying on the public’s cooperation to reduce the spread of the Coronavirus. So we felt that it was in everyone’s best interest to reschedule the caucuses and the state convention. We understand the uncertainty caused by the delays, but hopefully, the situation will be much improved by June. If the situation isn’t much improved by then, we could still arrange to conduct the meetings via teleconference if necessary. We very much want to play our part in helping Louisiana return to normalcy as quickly as possible,” commented LAGOP Chairman Louis Gurvich.

Friend --
Louisiana's Presidential Preference Primary is coming up. Here's what you need to know.
The Presidential Preference Primary is scheduled for Saturday, April 4, 2020.
If you are registered Green (or Independent, Libertarian, No Party, or Other) you won't be able to vote in this primary. It's just about the only time where being Green keeps you from being able to vote. Most of our primaries are open ""jungle"" primaries, but not this one. It is a closed, private affair, for members only.
Greens like to maximize their participation in democracy. It's especially frustrating because the Green Party does have a nominating process which is underway now. (More about that below.) Because we have fewer that 40,000 registered party members in Louisiana, the state doesn't run a primary for us. Only the Democrats and Republicans get that treatment — though all of us taxpayers fund it.
A number of Greens have asked about switching party registration in order to participate in the Presidential Prefernce Primary. While we can't endorse such a strategy, we do feel obliged to inform our members that it's easy and relatively painless. You can do it online before March 14th. You'll need your driver's license. Just remember to change your registration back to Green after the primary!
(Please note that on April 4 there will also be local races on the ballot in 24 parishes. All registered voters can participate.)
More information on voting is at [[URL REDACTED]] Here's a shortcut link directly to the page for Online Voter Registration.
> Editorial comment: We predict the Democratic nomination will go to Joe Biden. We think Bernie would have had a better shot with the Green Party. Over the past four years, many ""progressive-minded"" folk have devoted their efforts to reforming the Democratic Party, with varying levels of success. We applaud their motivations, but we remain skeptical of the feasibility of this project. We continue to believe (and most Americans agree) that we need to develop options beyond the Big Two. At the same time, know from experience that organizing against the duopoly ain't easy.
Hey, wait a second, didn't you say the Green Party has a nomination process underway?
Yes, here's some more information about that.
Green Party Presidential Nominating 2020
The Green Party will hold its annual national convention in Detroit, Michigan, at Wayne State University on July 9-12.
Eight individuals are running for the GPUS Presidential nomination. They are:
Sedinam Moyowasifza-Curry, Howie Hawkins, Dario Hunter, Dennis Lambert, David Rolde, Susan Buchser-Lochocki, Kent Mesplay and Chad Wilson.
More information and links to questionnaires filled out by these people can be found on the GPUS page Presidential 2020.

Hi GPL'er!
We want to share two short videos about how to make a medical mask. We don't need to explain why you will need them, so let's get to work!
The first video is about making a mask using a sewing machine to make a cloth mask. This mask can be used by medical professionals, as it is sewn and therefore is more durable.
When you make this type of mask, you can wash it and re-use it. You probably will want to use a little bleach in the wash water, or use hot water.
[[URL REDACTED]]
The second video shows a mask which can be made very quickly and doesn't require a sewing machine. It is more suitable for use at home or on the rare occasions when you have to go out in public to shop or do other necessary errands.
[[URL REDACTED]]
Whichever you choose, please stay well and stay at home!

The Green Party is planning a Convention for this June. COME JOIN US!
In order to participate in the Convention, you will be required to be registered as a Green in Louisiana.
If you changed your party affiliation to vote in the Democratic primary, you will need to re-register as a Green in order to vote in the virtual Convention, which is tentatively scheduled for June 22.
If you need to re-register, we advise that you do so no less than one week before the Convention.
We are planning to hold the Convention online at Zoom.
""Please stay tuned for further details.""
