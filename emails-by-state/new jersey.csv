"Tonight is the first fundraising deadline of this year... View this email in your browser
,
Our fundraising deadline is less than 24 hours away and we are $4,425 short of our goal.
I'm asking, right now, can you pitch in to help us hit our goal?
The Democrats have targeted New Jersey because they know our Republican candidates are strong and our chances are good. We're going to win in November, but we can't do that with out the critical resources to support our New Jersey Republicans.
We need just 295 individuals to donate $15 in the next 24 hours so that we can hit our goal. Can you donate today so that we can hit our goal?
Donate $15
Donate $20.20
Donate $35
This fundraising deadline is critical. We must show that New Jersey Republicans are strong and ready to win in November. Can you help us hit our goal with a contribution of $15, $35, or even $55 today?

Friend,
Have you activated or renewed your 2020 Membership yet?
The eyes of the nation are truly on New Jersey this fall. It is of the utmost importance that we protect our existing seats, add new ones, rebuild the Republican House Majority and hold Governor Murphy accountable.
When you activate or renew your 2020 Membership, you give our New Jersey Republican team the support they need to make sure every single seat, up and down the ballot, has a Republican candidate fighting for YOU.
Click to activate or renew your 2020 Membership!
Thanks to the support of individuals such as yourself, we had historic elections in New Jersey last year - flipping two Assembly seats and a Senate seat. And, just a month into this year Congressman Jeff Van Drew joined the GOP team, like so many other Democrats around the state and country.
Our work is just getting started and your immediate membership contribution of $5, $15, $35 or even $50 right now will jump start our path to victory in November. Activate or renew your 2020 Membership today!
I am looking forward to another victorious election year for our Republican team!

We're building a massive infrastructure for 2020.
Why?
Because New Jersey is poised to have the
most Congressional pick-ups in the nation.
(Seriously, the Democrats are vulnerable.)
Let's win big in 2020.
Our plan is to have staff on the ground early, in every targeted congressional district, so we can get a head start on activating and training our grassroots army to support our candidates post-Primary.
You may not know this, but the NJGOP provided all the data and technology for free to our winning campaigns in 2019. We also provided hundreds of hours of training needed to effectively utilize the voter turn-out applications.
Between data, staff, and technology - we need more resources than ever to ensure we're winning statewide next November.
Make an investment in our infrastructure!
Right now, a group of major donors has pledged $250,000 to fund our operating plan for 2020. That's a great start, but we have to raise another $50,000 by January to stay on track.
Will you invest in the future of New Jersey by sending a contribution to the Party that will get us there?
I know this is a big lift, but we have the capacity to get it done. Our success is central to Republican efforts to take back the House and restore sanity to Washington. Together, we will win.

Friends, Phil Murphy delivered the SOTS yesterday, were you tuned in?
His reading of the state of our State reflected the delusions of an out-of-touch executive who can’t (or won’t) accept the harsh economic realities of America’s highest taxed families.
The US economy is booming, and the common-sense policies employed by President Trump mask just how weaker and poorer New Jersey is under this Governor. Murphy’s agenda ignores the economic challenges of youth, the tough, fiscal realities of parenthood, the difficult retirement decisions facing seniors, and the crippling business climate his policies create.
The beautiful thing about our State and Country is that every November we have a choice. Every election is a chance to choose a better path, one that lowers taxes, relaxes regulations, recognizes hard work, and respects the United States Constitution.
New Jersey Republicans offer common sense and affordable solutions to the 30 years of economic peril wrought by legislative Democrats. I know we asked a lot last cycle, but 2019 wins do not mean we can sit back in 2020.
Katie helped me set up a secure fundraising link for you and I hope you'll help us one more time. We'd really appreciate seeing your name when we pull the report of contributors later.

Friend,
On Saturday morning, Chairman Doug Steinhardt praised the life of Ruth Bader Ginsburg. As a pioneer for women in the law, she led an incredible life. The Chairman went on to make clear ""Americans deserve a full court to carry forward. I see no reason for us to wait, we have time, the Senate should take up the nomination and we should move forward with a full contingent.""
In this critical time in our nation's history, it's up to you , Do you think President Trump should fill the Supreme Court vacancy?
New Jerseyans deserve strong leadership in Washington and our Republican Party is prepared to deliver.
With only 43 days until Election Day, it is CRITICAL that we know where you stand. Do you think President Trump should fill the Supreme Court vacancy?
YES
NO
With your support, Republicans will WIN in November!
Sincerely,

"Phil Murphy is the wrong pianist playing the wrong notes. View this email in your browser
Hi Friends,
I wanted to make sure you saw NJGOP Chairman Steinhardt's important op-ed on Governor Murphy's recent budget address. Please give it a read below!
# GOP: Murphy’s 2021 budget is built on yet another income tax he’ll use to pay for his radical, liberal agenda
By Doug Steinhardt
When I was in law school, I played piano at local piano bars to help support myself. I’ve always been a jazz music fan, and one of my favorite quotes is from jazz pianist Thelonious Monk, who said, “The piano ain’t got no wrong notes.”
I always thought that wisdom liberating. It reminds me there is no script for creating or problem solving. It’s also a great measure of self-accountability. If Monk’s quote taught me anything it’s that in life, I’m my only obstacle. I never blame the piano if the song doesn’t sound right.
When I hear Gov. Phil Murphy talk about New Jersey and our affordability crisis, it sounds a lot like he‘s blaming the piano. He describes New Jersey as a place where families and businesses should just accept high taxes. He admitted as much when he said, ”If you’re a one-issue voter and tax rate is your [[URL REDACTED]]’re probably not your state.”
After the governor’s 2020 budget address, it is clear that he has settled comfortably into accepting that New Jersey will always be unaffordable, and we will always be the nation’s No. 1 exporter of jobs, businesses and family members. Phil Murphy is oddly at peace with the fact that our children can’t afford to start their lives here and our parents and grandparents can’t afford to retire here.
I’m proud to be the chairman of the NJGOP because I reject that mentality and know that New Jersey can be more affordable. Family is worth fighting for, and that fight starts with admitting that the governor is no Thelonious Monk. Phil Murphy is the wrong pianist playing the wrong notes.
For decades Democrats have been singing the same, tired song. But the honest answer is, we can’t tax and spend our way to solvency.
For the two years I’ve been chairman, we’ve advocated a single, simple message: New Jersey government has a spending problem, not a revenue problem. While the governor is willing to mortgage and tax your family’s future for the cost of his sanctuary state, so-called “free” college and a host of special interest giveaways, the honest answer is, we can’t afford it, and neither can you.
Governor Murphy’s 2020 budget is built around yet another income tax. At $40 billion, it is the largest in New Jersey history and grew faster than the state’s gross domestic product. His communications team has been working overtime to try and sell New Jersey residents on the idea that if we only tax people who can “afford” it, he’ll have enough taxes to fund his radical, liberal agenda.
Except, New Jersey voters are smarter than that. We know that any new income tax will eventually find its way to the middle class. The governor’s own caucus has been reluctant to embrace his plan, since it perpetuates the state’s problems, without really solving them.
But they are solvable. At NJGOP, we’ve been advocating four, simple steps: reduce state taxes (tackle pensions and health care), relax state regulations (end COAH and the inequities in the state’s school funding formula), reward hard work (give tax credits for college tuition and tax breaks to seniors and small business), and respect the United States Constitution (by embracing the Bill of Rights, not trampling it). And, that’s just the start.
There’s nothing inherently unaffordable about our home state. Don’t blame the piano. Instead, change the pianist. Every election is a chance to elect a better band. Under this band leader, though, every sharp and flat is another tax and fee, and instead of playing Bon Jovi’s “Who Says You Can’t Go Home,” Phil Murphy keeps playing the Beatle’s “Tax Man.”
If you drive a car, I'll tax the street
If you try to sit, I'll tax your seat
If you get too cold, I'll tax the heat
If you take a walk, I'll tax your feet
'Cause I’m the taxman.

"Friend,
I just left a meeting with Chairman Steinhardt and let him know that we are still a few thousand dollars away from our goal.
If last night taught us anything, it's that we must support our Republicans from the top of the ticket to our local offices. This November's election is too important.
Will you contribute just $5, $10, $15 or more today? We are sending a free Trump Pence bumper sticker to each person who contributes toward our goal!
President Trump wiped the floor with Sleepy Joe Biden last night and I know Republicans around New Jersey are fired up to carry that momentum to victory on Election Day. Your support today will help us score wins for the GOP team from the White House to the Court House. Please, chip in immediately before our midnight deadline!

Friend,
We're in the final stretch. Election day is less than 40 days away and our team has ONE FINAL DEADLINE. This one is important.
Midnight on September 30th is our final End-of-Quarter deadline
I am challenging us to raise another $10,000 before midnight on September 30th. Can you help us reach our goal?
Our team has been working hard to ensure Republican victories up and down the ballot in November.
Just last month, the Democrats and Governor Murphy passed another unconstitutional law MANDATING that we vote-by-mail in November's election.
Our team immediately filed a lawsuit in Federal Court alongside President Trump's team and the Republican National Committee.
We know the Democrats are trying to silence our voices and steal this election. They must be stopped.
We are counting on your support. Will you consider contributing $5, $10, or $15 today?
Sincerely,
Doug Steinhardt
Chairman
NJGOP
PS. I know you are getting a lot of requests, that's why we are giving every donor a FREE Trump Pence Bumper Sticker when they contribute $5, $10, $15 or more to our End-Of-Quarter Deadline!

Fellow Republican,
Last December, I WALKED AWAY from the Democrat Party after Nancy Pelosi and Democrat leaders ordered me to vote to impeach President Trump. I am beyond grateful to President Trump and the Republican Party for accepting me with open arms. Like I said at the Republican National Convention last week, I have always been a Conservative and aligned more with the Republican party anyways, and I am glad that I made it official.
Did you have the chance to see my speech last Thursday? If not, then you can watch it HERE!
RNC Speech
, the Democrat Party has been hijacked by the Radical Left. The radical ideas that they are proposing - Medicare for All, the Green New Deal, and DEFUNDING the Police are WRONG for America. They go against our founding philosophies of small government and personal freedom. That is why this November, we cannot afford to lose to the Radical Left.
My opponent, Amy Kennedy, is a Radical Democrat who supports the socialist wishlist of AOC and the Squad, she’s even said there is merit to Defunding the Police!
After my speech, Democrats are even more FURIOUS at me for walking away and exposing their Radical agenda. Right now, Amy Kennedy is raising millions of dollars and courting Pelosi to drop millions of special interest funds into this district. , our election is in less than 65 days and I am ready to defeat the Radical Left… are you?
I won’t let Amy Kennedy or Nancy Pelosi walk over South Jersey or over the brave men and women who serve in Blue. I took a stand against the Left in December, and once again at the RNC; now I’m asking YOU to take a stand too.
Chip in any amount you can afford below and help my team and the New Jersey Republican Party DEFEAT Amy Kennedy and the Radical Left this November in South Jersey!
Contribute $150 NOW to defeat the Radical Left this November!
Contribute $75 NOW to defeat the Radical Left this November!
Contribute $45 NOW to defeat the Radical Left this November!
Contribute $15 NOW to defeat the Radical Left this November!
Contribute Any Amount NOW to defeat the Radical Left this November!

Rep. Kevin McCarthy: A Marshall Plan for Main Street
For three years, small-business optimism has been at record highs. Lower taxes and fewer regulations unleashed the best economy in half a century and gave small businesses the means to hire more employees, pay higher wages, and reinvest capital. These conditions still exist but are being seriously challenged by the coronavirus pandemic, a true ""black swan"" catastrophe. While our nation continues to fight against this pandemic, we have a responsibility in Congress to help small businesses survive this storm.
As one of America’s main employers, Main Street is the engine of our economy. According to the Small Business Administration, there are more than 30 million small businesses in America and nearly 60 million small-business employees. That is over 47% of the entire workforce. They deserve a government that responds to their needs, especially during moments of crisis.
Before entering politics, I opened a small deli in my hometown of Bakersfield, California. Two lessons always stuck with me: 1.) You’re the first to work, last to leave, and last to get paid, and 2.) your employees are your greatest resource. I know from personal experience that small businesses create meaningful opportunities for entrepreneurs, satisfying work for employees, and personalized service for local communities. But I also know how difficult it is to run a small business, even in the best of times.

Hi Friends,
We hope everyone is staying safe and healthy.
Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been at least 4,151 coronavirus related deaths in New Jersey’s long-term care facilities including many at the state’s only veterans’ nursing home. That represents more than half of all COVID-19 related deaths in New Jersey to date.
It is well documented that since the start of April, Governor Murphy and the New Jersey Department of Health have been ordering nursing homes to accept admissions even if the person was confirmed with a case of COVID19.
Despite pleas and warnings from facility managers, the Murphy Administration has continued to send infectious patients to unprepared facilities.
New Jersey Republican State Committee Chairman Doug Steinhardt is calling for a legislative investigation into this ongoing crisis.
“Our senior population is the most vulnerable demographic to this pandemic and it appears that Governor Murphy has cost thousands their lives and jeopardized the lives of an untold number more,” said Steinhardt. “The NJGOP calls upon the Senate President and Assembly Speaker to convene swift and thorough hearings into the Administration’s handling of New Jersey’s long term care facilities, what the State knew, when, and why New Jersey’s senior population was exposed to these risks.”

# Steinhardt says Murphy holding back small business aid to plug budget holes
Republican State Chairman Doug Steinhardt is accusing Gov. Phil Murphy withholding almost $2 billion in CARES Act dollars from the Coronavirus Relief Fund that could be used to help struggling New Jersey residents and businesses.
“Governor Murphy is sitting on a nearly $2 billion mountain of money that could save New Jersey small businesses, and he’s lying to all of us about it,” Steinhardt alleged. “Murphy is hoarding it hoping he can use it to balance his bloated budget.”

Assemblyman Scharfenberger: Follow ‘common sense’ protocols to reopen New Jersey
Assemblyman Gerry Scharfenberger (R-Monmouth) has composed a set of what he is calling common sense protocols small businesses could implement to start down the road to safe economic recovery as the 2020 coronavirus pandemic continues to grip the state.
In a May 7 press release, he said, “Without a doubt, the impact which COVID-19 has had on New Jersey’s health and economic well-being has been overwhelming.
“However, by Trenton failing to offer residents a detailed reopening plan and delays continuing with unemployment claims, it only grows their heavy concerns; they deserve to have clarity in a strategy for the future.
“That is why today I, along with several of my colleagues in the Assembly, have authored a set of common sense recommendations for virtually every business in New Jersey that will allow them to begin operating safely, while protecting those most vulnerable among us,” Scharfenberger said.
“People are in danger of losing their homes, their livelihood and their way of life. This has to end, we need to show them there is light at the end of the tunnel,” he said.
Scharfenberger, who said he was cognizant of the hardships already facing New Jersey’s small businesses and residents, said the economic burdens would continue to increase with each day officials delay.
“New Jersyans have endured unprecedented job losses, business closings and mandatory lockdowns, and have nobly sacrificed freedoms in the name of public health.
“We owe it to them to offer a plan that seeks to reopen the economy and allow them to get back to work for their own financial health.
“When owners and employees are dependent upon a business for their livelihood and to put food on the table for their families, there is no such thing as a ‘non-essential’ business.
“As such, it is imperative that we begin the steady process of reopening New Jersey’s economy,” Scharfenberger said.
Thank You Assemblywoman Nancy Muñoz!

Hello!
Let me start with a big THANK YOU to everyone who generously contributed to our annual Toys for Tots collection at the NJGOP's Holiday Party this past Tuesday! We collected hundreds of toys that are on their way to make a child's Christmas a little brighter.
It's not only the holiday season, it's that time of the year where elections have just ended and Democrat politicians in Trenton cram through the most offensive laws because they anticipate the least consequences from their constituents. This is always a dangerous time for taxpayers.
This year, one particular issue we want to highlight for you is the Democrats' effort to force through drivers licenses for illegal immigrants.
NJGOP Chairman Doug Steinhardt testified at a Senate hearing on the bill and let Trenton Democrats know that New Jersey Republicans will not be shouted into a corner as they stand up for honest answers to our state's real problems.

NJGOP IN THE NEWS
WHO’S UP AND WHO’S DOWN
Who's up
Doug Steinhardt
Even though he didn’t actually say “nihilism,” we applaud him for appreciating the concept. In any event, the Chairman of the State GOP’s unsparing, razor-sharp elbowed but lawlerly take-down of the Democrats’ Trenton agenda was one of the best pieces of oration in recent memory.
Phil Valenziano
Steinhardt this week announced his choice of Valenziano as the new Executive Director of the GOP State Committee. The former Jay Webber for Congress campaign manager will replace Theresa Winegar who is moving on to serve as Tom Kean’s campaign manager for Congress in New Jersey’s 7th Congressional district.
# Kean taps Winegar as campaign manager
While at the state party, Winegar helped the GOP flip two State Senate seats: Christopher Brown (R-Ventnor) in the 2nd district in 2017 and Michael Testa, Jr. (R-Vineland) in the 1st district in 2019.
“I am honored to join this campaign because I believe in Senator Tom Kean. When I think of strong leadership, I think of Tom Kean. I have seen firsthand the leader he has been for the Republican Party and the state of New Jersey,” Winegar said. “He is the best possible candidate to take on Tom Malinowski. I am excited to deliver a victory for Senator Kean, and my home district of NJ-7.”
The RNC's Charlotte Host Committee, (CLT Host 2020, Inc.) is working to identify the 8,000 volunteers that will be necessary to support next year's convention. And they're taking applications NOW.

🔦 Legislation Spotlight Of The Week 🔦
Senator Michael Testa (R-1) votes NO on
S-3229 which would grant driver's licences
to Illegal Immigrants.
“Like so many of our families, my grandparents on my mother’s side and my great grandparents on my father’s side immigrated to the United States the right and legal way,” said Testa (R-1). “We should not reward those who have no respect for our country’s laws with the privilege of a driver’s license. Democrats pushing this legislation are laying out the welcome mat for illegal immigrants rather than prioritizing the needs of their actual constituents.”
Testa criticized the bill, S-3229, which would create a second tier of driver’s licenses for those who are unable to prove lawful presence in the United States.
“While this is only my second week at the State House, I’m witnessing firsthand how out of touch Trenton democrats are with the top concern of many New Jerseyans – affordability. We must quit wasting State time and money on Governor Murphy’s partisan agenda and start taking action to lower taxes and make the Garden State a more affordable place to live, raise a family, and retire.”

Friend,
We're less than one month away from Election Day and New Jersey's Liberal Congressional Quartet have made it clear who they're supporting: Nancy Pelosi.
We've been watching as they vote with Pelosi over 96% of the time, ignoring the interests of New Jersey families and businesses. We can't afford another two years of weak leadership from Mikie Sherill, Tom Malinowski, Andy Kim and Josh Gottheimer!
Donate $5, $15, or $25 today to remove the Liberal Quartet and send Nancy Pelosi back to the minority!
It's time we replace New Jersey's Liberal Quartet with New Jersey Conservative leaders who will stand up for our freedoms in Washington.
New Jersey deserves better. We're pouring all the time, money, and staff we've got into defeating these liberals, but we need your help! Donate TODAY to send the right leadership to Washington on November 3rd.
Donate $5
Donate $15
Donate $25
Sincerley,
Phil Valenziano
Executive Director

PS. I know you're getting a lot of requests these days, but with just 26 days until Election Day the time to act is now! Donate just $5, $10 or $15 to make a difference in November's Election.

Murphy’s Last In the Nation In Business Tax Climate
Trenton- A new report shows that New Jersey ranks dead last in the nation for our overall Business Tax Climate. Delaware is 13th, Pennsylvania is 27th, and New York is 48th. New Jersey also ranks 46th in property taxes, 48th in corporate taxes, and 50th in individual taxes.
In 2018 Governor Murphy raised the Corporate Business Tax (CBT) to the nation’s highest level. This year the Governor and legislative Democrats hiked the state income tax. Trenton Democrats also cancelled the scheduled sunsetting of part of the CBT and instituted a new tax on healthcare companies. There’s even a new “Rain Tax” under Governor Murphy, who said if taxes are an important issue to you, “we’re probably not your state.”
Chairman Doug Steinhardt issued the following statement:
“Since taking office, Governor Murphy has waged a relentless assault on the State’s job creators. We saw this clearly over the last several months, as his approach to the fiscal challenges posed by the pandemic boiled down to “private sector pain, and public sector gain”. Now, we have further confirmation that New Jersey Democrats are failing New Jersey citizens. In fact, New Jersey is ranked dead last in overall tax climate by the independent tax policy research Tax Foundation. We could be a vibrant hub of innovation, leading the country in job growth, GDP, and opportunity for all, but Governor Murphy’s policies are like cement shoes holding us down, keeping Garden Staters from prosperity, and making it harder to live, work, and raise a family here. We deserve better than another Murphy induced last place ranking, and New Jerseyans deserve a Governor who will deliver real growth and opportunity for all the citizens of our State.”

# Steinhardt wants timeline on Murphy’s virus exposure
The New Jersey Republican State Committee wants to know how Gov. Phil Murphy was exposed to COVID-19, demanding on Wednesday a timeline to the events preceding the governor’s virus exposure.
Murphy left midway through an early afternoon outdoor event at Camden County College in Blackwood after announcing he had been come into contact with someone who tested positive for the virus on Saturday.

# Bucco Pans Murphy’s Veto of Restaurant Relief Funds
“Based on Governor Murphy’s personal guidance, restaurants invested a significant amount of money, often on personal credit cards, to restock in anticipation of resuming indoor dining on July 2nd,” said Bucco (R-25). “When the governor reversed course at the last moment, those restaurants suffered steep losses that they could ill afford. It’s unbelievable that Governor Murphy would veto targeted relief funds to cover losses that restaurants incurred to comply with his changing executive orders. It’s a slap in the face to an industry that’s struggling to survive.”
After initially announcing that restaurants could resume indoor dining on July 2nd, Governor Murphy signed Executive Order No. 158 to rescind his prior order and continue a complete prohibition on indoor dining.
Bucco introduced S-2704 after talking with local restaurant owners who warned that they might not survive the major expenses they incurred in anticipation of the governor’s false reopening.
The legislation sought to appropriate $30 million of the $2.4 billion of CARES Act relief funds that New Jersey received from the federal government to fund financial support for food establishments that incurred financial losses as a direct result of the E.O. 158.
While the legislation received unanimous approval in both houses of the Legislature, Governor Murphy sought to downplay his veto of S-2704 by saying that other CARES Act funds had recently been announced to support restaurants.
“I don’t think Governor Murphy truly understands the dire situation that’s facing New Jersey’s restaurant industry,” added Bucco. “We could lose nearly half of our restaurants if we don’t take action to help. They need every penny the governor has promised and more. It’s a shame he hasn’t put the billions we received through the CARES Act to better use.”
A report issued in early October by the State Auditor found that Governor Murphy had spent barely 10% of the $2.4 billion of CARES Act funds received by New Jersey through the end of September.
# Amy Kennedy isn’t fighting for us.
She called for DEFUNDING the Police from the comfort of her lavish waterfront mansion, collected millions from drug companies through her tax-exempt non-profit instead of helping addicts recover, and even profits off of investments in COMMUNIST China. We need a leader who will fight for South Jersey, not against it. We can’t trust Radical Amy Kennedy.

FIVE STORIES PRESIDENT TRUMP DOESN'T WANT YOU TO MISS
Trump: Sudan to Join UAE, Bahrain in Recognizing Israel
-The Associated Press
“President Donald Trump announced Friday that Sudan will start to normalize ties with Israel, making it the third Arab state to do so as part of U.S.-brokered deals,” Deb Riechmann and Matthew Lee report. “Sudan had demonstrated its commitment in battling terrorism. ‘This is one of the great days in the history of Sudan,’” President Trump said.
Tech Censorship Is on a Dangerous Path
-The Daily Signal
“The titans of social media, [Jack] Dorsey at Twitter and Mark Zuckerberg at Facebook, lead their companies the way China does. These men want to control what the public sees, which enables them to better monitor and, ultimately, influence every aspect of society and life,” Armstrong Williams writes. “It is hard to imagine a more insidious effort to subvert freedom of speech, expression, and the free flow of ideas.”
How Team Trump Is Fighting China’s Ploys to Control the UN
-New York Post
“I’ve seen firsthand the Chinese Communist Party’s increasingly aggressive efforts to manipulate UN agencies to whitewash its bad behavior, silence criticism and advance authoritarian government,” U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Kelly Craft writes. “Unlike our predecessors, the Trump administration is clear-eyed about this threat.”
Why Operation Warp Speed Is a Made-in-America Story
-Fox Business
“We have already seen tremendous unprecedented progress toward a vaccine. Four of our six vaccine candidates are in the final stage of human trials, and we may even see data emerge from one of more of these in October. In the meantime, a unique made-in-America story is being written,” Health & Human Services Secretary Alex Azar writes.
Confronting Ohio’s Rural Opioid Crisis
[[URL REDACTED]]
“Throughout Ohio and across the country, as we emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic, another health crisis remains: drug addiction . . . President Trump [has] expanded the use of telemedicine, unraveling burdensome regulations to ensure those receiving counseling for substance use disorder are able to receive continuous care,” writes Jim Carroll, director of the White House’s Office of National Drug Control Policy.

Hi Friends,
This week, the New Jersey Republican State Committee launched a campaign to expose Phil Murphy’s incompetence during the COVID-19 crisis. [[URL REDACTED]] is a website for people who are tired of being told to move to another State and want facts about their Governor’s failures.
“New Jersey deserves better. Our families and businesses deserve answers. We deserve a leader who is guided by facts, treats us as equals, and doesn’t ignore his own executive orders,” said NJGOP Chairman Doug Steinhardt. “We have a duty to ensure that New Jerseyans everywhere know just how badly Governor Murphy has failed our State’s families.
[[URL REDACTED]] has answers. His weak leadership is killing our economy and his poor judgement is killing our loved ones. He had no plan to navigate us through this crisis, and he has no plan to guide us out of it.
“New Jersey needs strong Republican leadership, not another empty political suit. Phil Murphy is an empty political suit. More leading, less hiding.”

Senator Bucco and Assemblywoman Dunn stand up to Governor Murphy on behalf of small businesses
Gov. Phil Murphy is a hypocrite for supporting, and participating in Black Lives Matter protests while cracking down on others caught violating his COVID-19 orders against large gatherings, say two state lawmakers representing Roxbury.
State Sen. Anthony Bucco (R-25) and state Assemblywoman Aura Dunn (R-25) pointed to summonses issued last week to business owner Jennifer Rogers for hosting a rally in May where fellow small-business owners protested the closure orders.

After seeing governor at protest, Assemblyman Webber proposes Murphy’s Law
A day after calling for Gov. Phil Murphy to pardon New Jersey residents cited for violating pandemic executive orders, a North Jersey lawmaker has proposed what he calls ""Murphy's Law.""
Assemblyman Jay Webber, R-Morris, introduced a bill Thursday that would nullify a executive order as soon as the governor who issued it was found to have ""broken the rule,"" as Webber explained it on Facebook.
Webber drafted the measure after Murphy attended two Black Lives Matter marches in Union County on Sunday. At that time, the limit on outdoor gatherings remained at a maximum of 25 people.

Hi Friends,
Last week, the NJGOP highlighted New Jersey’s outlier status in COVID-19 related longterm care facility deaths and called for a legislative investigation into the Murphy Administration’s policies, including forcing facilities to accept COVID-19 positive admissions.
Wednesday, the New Jersey legislature announced such an investigation, but backed off an hour later and postponed the investigation until after consultants hired by the Murphy administration deliver their recommendations for future policies and protocols.
Tragically, the Murphy administration had notice and time to prepare for health outbreaks in New Jersey’s longterm care facilities. In 2018, 11 children died after an adenovirus outbreak at a long-term care facility in northern New Jersey.
The legislature drafted a law requiring facilities to have strict outbreak plans, but Governor Murphy’s Health Department objected to the bill’s original language. They objected to a requirement that all of the plans be reviewed and approved by the State government, because they were concerned that the Department lacked the recourses to give overnight and wouldn’t provide the extra funding to keep people safe.
A Message From NJGOP Chairman Doug Steinhardt
Senior homes are building makeshift morgues because of Governor Murphy’s poor judgment and weak leadership. This administration turned longterm care facilities into death traps and locked in our parents, grandparents, veterans and other loved ones, and left them to die.
Since the Democrat State legislature refuses to do its duty and protect the interests of the State’s residents, we are appealing to the federal government to intervene, be objective, and conduct an immediate and impartial investigation. Someone must answer to New Jersey’s families.
Here's what you need to know today
1\. President Trump visited workers at Owens & Minor, Inc. distribution center and announced new actions to modernize and replenish our Nation’s stockpile of PPE. President Trump also issued an Executive Order to bolster our independence in healthcare, manufacturing, and technology to protect Americans during this time.
2\. The U.S. Department of the Treasury and U.S. Small Business Administration released new information regarding the Paycheck Protection Program:
* Interim Final Rule on Eligibility of Certain Electric Cooperatives
* SBA launched a new search functionality within the E-Tran Servicing section of the Capital Access Financial System (CAFS). This tool will help PPP lenders review loans in their portfolios. Lenders should review all fields in these files for accuracy and completeness.

# N.J. failed to fix unemployment system for 19 years, records show. Now Murphy pleads patience.
By Sophie Nieto-Munoz | NJ Advance Media for [[URL REDACTED]] and Matthew Stanmyre | NJ Advance Media for [[URL REDACTED]]
The warnings were clear, the language was ominous: A critical state website relied upon by tens of thousands of New Jersey residents was teetering on the verge of collapse.
In a 43-page report, the state Department of Labor outlined the dire need to modernize the state’s archaic unemployment website. A failure to do so, the report cautioned, could lead to catastrophic problems in the event of a spike in unemployment.

"President Trump Acquitted!  View this email in your browser
Hi Friends,
This was a big week for President Trump and Republicans around the country. President Trump was acquitted of his impeachment charges by the United States Senate and delivered one of the best State of the Union speeches in our nation's history.
Here is what NJGOP Chairman Steinhardt had to say:
""America and President Trump are all moving forward. Our nation's economy is growing, problems are being solved and our country is secure.
""Now, New Jersey needs their liberal Congressional quartet of Josh Gottheimer, Andy Kim, Tom Malinowski, and Mikie Sherrill to get on board or prepare to get voted out.
""They have been an impediment to progress in Washington. They have spent their entire term pursuing impeachment and playing politics, not solving problems and representing their districts and our state.
""New Jersey deserves honest answers to our state's real problems, and our current delegation of Democrats is not delivering.""

# Murphy cuts ties with close ally suspended by national Dems over toxic workplace allegation
The head of New Jersey’s Republican Party on Tuesday said it was filing public-records requests into Alonso’s time as Murphy’s chief of staff in 2018.
“Phil Murphy has a terrible history of hiring toxic individuals who mistreat women,” state GOP Chairman Doug Steinhardt said in a statement. “The public needs to know if Governor Murphy passed the trash on Adam Alonso. If Phil Murphy recommended Alonso for positions knowing Alonso’s history of work place harassment, the Governor must answer to Alonso’s victims.”

Assemblyman Brian Bergen (R-25)
Bergen bill grants small businesses credits for sales tax collection
Assemblyman Brian Bergen introduced legislation this week to give small businesses credit for collecting and remitting sales tax to the state.
“The state expects our small businesses to collect, manage, file and remit sales taxes all at their own expense. It’s time that costs associated with doing the states revenue collection work is paid for by the state and not forced on the small business,” said Bergen (R-Morris). “Small businesses are responsible for half the jobs in New Jersey. We have to do what we can to keep jobs in the state and help these employers.”
According to the Small Business Administration, New Jersey small businesses employ 1.8 million people. More than 90 percent of small firms were responsible for generating about 40 percent of New Jersey’s $27.4 billion in total exports in 2016. The state has more than 884,000 small businesses with about 19 percent of those businesses employing less than 20 workers.
Under Bergen’s bill, businesses with less than 20 full-time employees would be able to get a credit of 10 percent of their monthly remittance of sales tax or $100 per month, whichever is less, when they file their sales and use tax return.

Hi Friends,
During these challenging times we want everyone to be smart and safe. For guidance on how to protect yourself and your community from Coronavirus, see the CDC website here: [[URL REDACTED]]
Like many offices around New Jersey we have moved temporarily to a remote work environment, however NJGOP remains fully operational and focused on protecting the progress we’ve made and the integrity of our democratic processes. Many state and county election offices are considering changes to deadlines, dates, and requirements, and we will provide periodic updates at [[URL REDACTED]] and on Facebook and Twitter, as those decisions are made. You can also email us questions or concerns as they arise and we will work to provide answers as they come available.
We are continuing to work with our partners and grassroots team around the state on various projects, and will continue to do so during this period of disruption. We believe that protecting our fellow citizen's health and preparing to win elections this fall are not mutually exclusive, and we will continue to advance both of those objectives during this challenging time.

Friend,
Today, Joe Biden made a choice.
While President Trump is fighting for all Americans, Sleepy Joe Biden is still stuck in his basement, making gaffe after gaffe, along with false claims and bad choices.
And now he's chosen ultra liberal Kamala Harris as his Vice President!
Donate $5
Donate $10
Donate $15
We all knew that Sleepy Joe is just a puppet for Nancy Pelosi and the Democratic Party. He's a placeholder to push through the extreme liberal agenda that will hurt everyday Americans. His choice of Phony Kamala Harris as VP confirms it!
New Jersey can't afford Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, and neither can our country! That's why our team is on the ground, working every day to elect Republicans up and down the ballot in November.
We need your help TODAY to build the resources necessary to win in November. Will you consider contributing $25 today?
Sincerely,
Team NJGOP
PS. We know you're getting a lot of emails these days, but ever little bit counts. Please, consider rushing us $10, $15 or $25 today!

Hello!
Earlier this week, NJ Globe reported that Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin was potentially reintroducing, in lame duck, the Democrat proposal to game New Jersey’s election system by rigging the redistricting process.
The NJGOP struck back hard and fast, vowing to fight back, just like we did in 2018.
Last night, Senate President Sweeney backed off the threat to reintroduce the legislation and declared the proposal dead, for now.
NJGOP In The News
Steinhardt urges preemptive defense
against possible redistricting push
“Bringing their intraparty street fight for political power full circle, Democratic politicians in Trenton are spitting in the faces of New Jersey’s 9 million residents by reintroducing and reconsidering the same rancid redistricting amendment they pursued last year to rig the legislative reapportionment process and secure for themselves a permanent majority in the legislature,” GOP State Chairman Doug Steinhardt said.
Join us for the NJGOP's Toys for Tots Holiday Party, Tuesday, December 10th with special guests Senator-Elect Mike Testa, Assemblyman-Elect Erik Kurt Simonsen and Assemblyman-Elect Antwan McClellan in New Brunswick!

🔦 Legislation Spotlight Of The Week 🔦
Senator Michael Testa Sworn In!
Michael L. Testa, Jr. took the oath of office today to become the new Senator for New Jersey’s 1st Legislative District.
“The residents of the 1st Legislative District sent a message when they elected a real conservative to represent them in Trenton,” said Testa. “I’ll fight for the property tax relief and school funding that our overlooked towns in South Jersey deserve, and against the extreme spending, tax, and sanctuary state policies that our hard-working families can’t afford.”
Testa will serve on the Senate Budget & Appropriations Committee and the Senate Labor Committee.
“I’m excited to have the opportunity to be a member of the Budget Committee where I’ll have a voice on the most important fiscal matters that impact New Jersey families,” said Testa. “Serving on the Labor Committee will allow me to counter the expensive and unreasonable mandates being pushed by Democrats that are driving employers out of business and jobs out of New Jersey.”
The senator, his wife Julie, and their son and two daughters live in Vineland.
“My wife and I want our children to have the same opportunities that we had growing up in New Jersey,” added Testa. “The sad truth is that too many families are looking at growing tax bills, jobs heading south, and they don’t see a future in the Garden State for their kids. I’m going to spend every day as a senator working to restore common-sense to Trenton and fighting to stop the parade of moving vans from New Jersey.”

Hi Friends,
Yesterday, Chairman Steinhardt, Leader Bramnick, and Senator Oroho announced that the Republican Party in New Jersey is unified against Governor Murphy's borrowing scheme and plan to file suit against it.
Chairman Steinhardt said ""In the highest tax state in America, New Jersey democrats found a way to pile on more. You can't be for big borrowing and big government and still be for the little guy. You have to pick a side. Today NJ Democrats picked their side. They chose big government and big borrowing, the NJGOP and Senate and Assembly Republicans chose the little guy. Middle class, hard working families across New Jersey, small business, small business owners, and 1.2 million unemployed New Jerseyans.""
Watch the full press conference below!

# Great American comeback: 2.5 million jobs in May!
Together, President Trump and American workers built the greatest economy on Earth. Now, as we safely reopen from Coronavirus, we are rebuilding stronger than ever!
“Experts” predicted that America would lose 7.5 million jobs last month. Instead, our country added 2.5 million—10 million more than expected.
🇺🇸 President Trump: We’re starting an incredible period of growth!
May’s 2.5 million jobs are the most new jobs ever recorded in a single month.
Across our country, America is coming back. Nearly three-quarters of U.S. small businesses are now open, up from the pandemic low of just 52 percent in April.
American workers helped slow the spread of Coronavirus by social distancing and following the guidelines of their local health officials. Many paid a price by losing their jobs to keep the rest of us safe. As we reopen America, they deserve this incredible news.
All told, last month our economy added:
* 1.2 MILLION leisure & hospitality jobs
* 464,000 construction jobs
* 424,000 education & healthcare jobs
* 368,000 retail jobs
* 225,000 manufacturing jobs
“We had the greatest economy in the history of the world. And that strength let us get through this horrible pandemic,” President Trump said.
“We’re going to be back there. I think we’re going to actually be back higher next year than ever before. And the only thing that can stop us is bad policy.”
WATCH: A record-breaking job surge across American industries!

Hi Friends,
We hope everyone had a great holiday!
We did a fun 12 Days of Phil Murphy's Christmas on social media that we wanted to make sure you saw:
On the First day of Christmas, Phil Murphy gave to NJ: $4 Billion in new, government spending.
The NJGOP solution: Admitting that NJ has a spending problem, not a revenue problem, and implementing policies like a 2% state government spending cap.
On the Second day of Christmas, Phil Murphy gave to me: The highest property taxes in America.
The NJGOP solution: Change public employee healthcare plans from platinum to gold, institute honest pension reforms, and end jackpot sick time payouts.
On the Third day of Christmas, Phil Murphy gave to me: The highest income tax rates in America.
The NJGOP Solution: Remove the state SALT cap. Let NJ taxpayers deduct their entire property tax from their state income taxes, and permanently freeze senior property taxes.
On the Fourth day of Christmas, Phil Murphy gave to us: A $100 million Obamacare tax.
The NJGOP Solution: Block the federal mandate forcing government-approved health insurance in New Jersey.
On the Fifth day of Christmas, Phil Murphy gave to us: A $200 million tax increase for so-called “free” community college.
The NJGOP Solution: Income tax deductions for college savings and tax credits for businesses that pay student loans.""
On the Sixth day of Christmas, Phil Murphy gave to us: A $1.7 billion corporate business tax.
The NJGOP Solution: Adopt the recommendations of the Red Tape Review Commission and protect New Jersey’s job creators.
On the Seventh day of Christmas, Phil Murphy gave to us: The highest outmigration of businesses and residents in America.
NJGOP Solution: Phil Murphy’s policies are breaking up NJ families. We need tax relief and a Governor who doesn’t believe that, “If tax rate is your issue . . . we’re probably not your state.”
On the Eighth day of Christmas, Phil Murphy gave to us: Attacks on the Second Amendment.
The NJGOP Solution: Give courts discretion when sentencing out-of-state gun owners, then enforce existing gun laws and that punish gun crimes and crime guns, and stop punishing legal gun owners.
On the Ninth day of Christmas, Phil Murphy gave to us: A Sanctuary State and drivers’ licenses and $2 million for legal aid to illegal immigrants.
The NJGOP Solution: Ban sanctuary cities and promote cooperation between state and federal law enforcement.
On the Tenth day of Christmas, Phil Murphy gave to us: A rigged, automatic voter registration system.
The NJGOP Solution: Enact automatic registration across the board, including people applying for building and construction permits and hunting and fishing licenses.
On the Eleventh day of Christmas, Phil Murphy gave to us: The region’s worst commuter system.
The NJGOP Solution: Increase revenue streams for NJ Transit and address NJ’s failing infrastructure.
On the Twelfth day of Christmas, Phil Murphy gave to us: Two more years of tax increases, progressive platitudes, and assaults on the middle class.
The NJGOP Solution: Two more years of fighting back! Merry Christmas, New Jersey, Happy Holidays, and a Happy and healthy New Year. Stick with us. We will do better.

Dunn attends annual Christmas Eve
memorial for “Baby Mary”
Assemblywoman Aura Dunn attended the annual memorial service for “Baby Mary,” a newborn girl who was abandoned and found dead near a stream in a secluded area of Mendham Township on Christmas Eve 1984.
“My commendations and sincere gratitude goes to the Mendham Township Police who have revered baby Mary’s life since 1984 when her newborn body was found abandoned by a river on Christmas Eve,” said Dunn (R-Morris). “I am pleased to be a part of this annual service. May she remain a beacon of hope and light for us all this holiday season.”
Dunn said she is closely monitoring the implementation of a new law mandating instruction about the state’s Safe Haven Infant Protection Act for all high school students in health and physical education classes. New Jersey parents can leave a newborn at a hospital, EMT headquarters, police or fire station without any legal repercussions up to 30 days after the child is born.
“My college-age daughters were not familiar with the Safe Haven program when we discussed its importance at the dinner table last night,” continued Dunn. “It was then that I knew the implementation of the recently enacted law requiring schools to inform students about the program must be closely monitored to ensure no young mother and father feels helpless, alone or ashamed.”
At least 72 unwanted babies have been saved since the Safe Haven law took effect in 2000.

Friend,
The Democrats are raising money [[URL REDACTED]] have to catch up.
We've had a strong 2nd quarter, but not strong enough. To make matters worse, New Jersey Democrats Liberal Quartet continues to put Washington interests first. They got elected saying one thing, now they're doing another, and they are certainly not standing up for New Jersey.
The Congressional Democrats are blindly supporting Joe Biden and aren’t concerned about his allegiance to China.
We have to do better. You deserve better.
This year is our chance to fight back…that’s why I’m setting an aggressive goal today. I am challenging all New Jersey Republicans to help raise $8,250 before midnight on June 30th.
Can you chip in at least $5, $10 or more to help us level the playing field?
New Jersey Republicans are fighting for you and your family. I know we can win in November, but we sincerely need your help.
Can you give $5, $15, $30 or $55 today to help us reach our goal?
Thank you for your commitment to our cause.
Thank you,

Hi Friends,
This week Governor Murphy gave his ""State of the State"" address. You can be sure the NJGOP had something to say about the rosy picture the Governor painted as he glossed over our state's affordability crisis. The Governor's progressive agenda is a wet blanket on our state's economy, and Chairman Steinhardt is absolutely right that his policies are ""tearing our families apart."" I hope you'll check out the Chairman's official response below, and continue to help us hold them accountable!

🔦 Legislature Spotlight Of The Week 🔦
S-1972 - Senator Kristin Corrado's (R-40) bill to update the Legislature's sexual harassment policy for the first time in more than a decade.
“I want to send a loud and clear message that sexual harassment will not be tolerated,” said Corrado (R-40). “News reports, and testimony we have heard in Trenton indicate sexual misconduct is more prevalent than we could have imagined. That has to end. The Legislature must lead by example with a no-nonsense policy that clearly provides protection from harassment and assault.”
Corrado’s measure (A3312/S1972) requires the Legislature to adopt a policy prohibiting sexual harassment by members, officers, and employees, and requires appropriate measures be taken to ensure the prohibited conduct does not occur.
“The current environment reminds us that we cannot assume proper behavior,” added Corrado. “All reports will be thoroughly investigated with discretion and authority.”
The bill also establishes procedures for reporting and investigation complaints, and guidelines for final determinations, remediation, discipline, and prohibited conduct.

Friends-
Friday it was announced that the New Jersey Adjutant General and Commissioner of Military and Veterans Affairs resigned, along with the heads of the Menlo Park and Paramus veterans homes. In response, the NJGOP is filing Open Public Records Requests for the work schedules of the fired employees to ascertain the extent of their interaction with Murphy Administration officials.
NJGOP Chairman Doug Steinhardt issued the following statement:
“Governor Murphy continues to prove that his greatest leadership quality is his ability to point fingers and lay blame. He failed New Jersey’s veterans and seniors when he sent COVID infected patients into long term care facilities untested. The NJGOP has demanded that Governor Murphy come clean about his Administration’s work with these facilities, but he has failed and refused to respond. While Phil Murphy protested, some 200 veterans and 6,900 seniors perished. Their families deserve answers and we deserve leadership. If the Governor can’t admit he failed, he’s the one who should resign.”

# Steinhardt: Murphy must say how he’ll address COVID spikes
Republican State Chairman Doug Steinhardt called on Gov. Phil Murphy to release his plan to deal with the growing number of COVID-19 cases in the state.
“COVID hit New Jersey hard the first time around and Governor Murphy’s policies were so bad that they are under DOJ investigation,” Steinhardt says. “Many New Jersey families have a loved one in a nursing home or long-term care facility. As COVID spikes again, we need transparency from the Murphy Administration and a plan that proves he won’t be sentencing our senior population to certain infection.”

# Bucco: Persistent Lines and Poor Customer Service Indicative of Deeper Problems at MVC
Motorists lining up outside of facilities in the pre-dawn hours, no less than six sites closed due to COVID, and countless residents frustrated by a system that has let them down, is what New Jersey residents face at DMV facilities. This has become business as usual for New Jersey’s Motor Vehicle Commission.
“Not a day goes by that I don’t hear another horror story from a constituent who has been mistreated by a broken system,” said Senator Anthony M. Bucco. “It is painfully obvious that customer service is buried low on MVC’s list of priorities, and New Jersey residents deserve better.”
Bucco was contacted this morning by a resident who was texting in the dark outside an agency more than two hours before the facility would open its doors.
“While writing this note to you I sit in the dark by the moonlight at the DMV in Randolph on a line that wraps around the building with an air temp of 49 degrees,” the constituent said. The text went on to note the irony of the government requiring residents to congregate with hundreds of other people during a public health emergency.
“I don’t understand how Governor Murphy and his administration can allow this to happen. It is a disgraceful way to treat our citizens,” Bucco said. “We should have mobile facilities set up to safely service motorists renewing paperwork, and we should have an appointment system so people can schedule times to conduct business with MVC.
“You can order a Big Mac on your phone and have it delivered to your door, yet this state agency is mandating residents to wait in lines for hours, only to be given a number so they can come back later in the day and wait in another line.”
Bucco began sounding the alarm and warning of impending problems at MVC early in the pandemic. On May 7 and again on May 19, he wrote to NJMVC’s chief administrator, B. Susan Fulton.
“I suggest that you consider alternate ways to complete some of these services remotely in the interim. Perhaps you can consider what other states are doing in this area. Procedures such as on-line title transfers and issuing temporary licenses to new drivers under a protocol you develop to help lessen the anticipated overwhelming need when the agencies reopen,” Bucco wrote. “In an effort to lessen the anxiety of my constituents, I would respectfully request an overview of your plan for reopening.”
In the letters, he advised hiring more staff and transitioning more processes online. There has been no indication Bucco’s warnings were heeded, and the horror stories began unfolding in real life on July 7 as agencies reopened for the first time since March 15.
“It has been more than three months since MVC reopened, but the problems persist,” Bucco said. “The lines this morning in Randolph and at facilities across the state are the direct result of the failure to plan, adapt, and adjust by a bureaucracy that can’t seem to get out of its own way.
“I will continue to press the Governor’s Administration to fix the MVC and provide the level of service New Jerseyans expect in return for their hard-earned tax dollars.”
State Committee Update From Chairman Steinhardt:
Hello State Committee,
I hope you're all doing well today. It was a pleasure to see most of you in person, and many of you virtually, at the Woman Of The Year event in Mountain Lakes a few weeks back.
As we enter the stretch run of the campaign I wanted to update you on two major things the NJGOP has under way.
1\. You've heard us talk this year about how our fundraising has been up leaps and bounds, in spite of the pandemic. Well, I'm happy to report that we're turning those dollars into votes. In addition to funding the lawsuits the State Party has filed on behalf of the citizens of our state, we've also launched an aggressive paid voter contact program, focused primarily hyper targeted digital advertising and texting, that we anticipate will give us nearly 1.5 million more voter contacts between now and Election Day. This effort is focused on chasing ballots, driving people to [[URL REDACTED]] to learn how to cast their vote, and making sure no stone is left unturned. We're constantly refreshing our target lists for these projects, focusing only on Republicans with unreturned ballots, making sure not a penny goes to waste.
2\. The State Party and Victory program has surpassed ONE MILLION voter contacts so far this year as of last weekend. This is an incredible achievement and a testament to the hard work of all of you, grassroots Republican activists, our dedicated staff, and strong county and municipal committees. We've set an ambitious goal of one million additional volunteer voter contacts from now through Election Day, which is very aggressive, but with everyone pulling together, I know we can get there. Thank you for all your help on this, and for all you will do to help our candidates finish strong.
These projects are, of course, in addition to all the work we're doing to assist our great county parties, municipal committees, candidates for office, and others.
Finally, I'm pleased to announce that the NJGOP has completed the RNC's GROW program. Our completion of this program certifies that the NJGOP has done everything that the RNC believes a strong state party should be doing. We're one of the only state parties in the country that has completed this program, and we're now eligible for additional support from RNC.
I know you're all busy, so I will leave it there. Let's get out there and knock one more door, make one more call, write one more check, host one more event, and leave it out on the field as we press forward toward Election Day.
Thanks.
Sincerely,
Chairman Doug Steinhardt

FIVE STORIES PRESIDENT TRUMP DOESN'T WANT YOU TO MISS
Twitter’s Partisan Censors
-The Wall Street Journal
“The political actions taken Wednesday by Twitter—and to a lesser extent Facebook—went far beyond normal content moderation,” The Wall Street Journal editorial board writes. “Silicon Valley's partisan interference flies in the face of American instincts about democracy, fair play, and the spirit of the First Amendment.”
First Lady Melania Trump: ‘My Personal Experience with COVID-19’
[[URL REDACTED]]
“It was two weeks ago when I received the diagnosis that so many Americans across our country and the world had already received—I tested positive for COVID-19. To make matters worse, my husband, and our nation’s Commander-in-Chief, received the same news,” First Lady Melania Trump writes.
MORE: “Give focus to our next generation,” the First Lady says
The Senate Should Confirm Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court, and Quickly
-The Hill
“The unfortunate vacancy left by the passing of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg must be filled in a timely manner to continue the important role of the judiciary. The Constitution is clear—the president has a solemn duty to make a nomination for the Senate’s consideration. President Trump fulfilled his duty by putting forward Barrett, and now the Senate must do its job,” Chase Martin writes.

Trump Administration Announces Deal With CVS and Walgreens to Administer Coronavirus Vaccine to Seniors in Long-Term Care
-CNBC

-The Daily Caller
“Since the start of the [Justice Department’s Operation Legend] in July there have been over 5,000 arrests including federal offenses, drug charges, and murder charges,” Kimberly Eade reports. Violent crime spiked across major U.S. cities following riots this summer. “Kansas City has a 40 percent increase of homicides compared to last year. President Donald Trump promised to protect cities that have high rates of violent crimes.”

Wirths says Murphy, Democrats should consider flat 2021 state budget after COVID-19
Assemblyman Hal Wirths is calling on Democrats to consider freezing spending for next fiscal year. He says that necessary spending increases on obligations need to be maintained, and hard decisions need to be made on discretionary spending.
“New Jersey is already in a poor fiscal condition, and we are not sure how revenues will play out in the coming months,” said Wirths (R-Sussex), the Assembly GOP budget officer. “Obviously we need to pay our bills first and foremost. Tough decisions need to be made to make sure the budget is truly balanced a year from now.”
Over the weekend, treasury officials discussed with lawmakers plans to freeze discretionary spending for the current fiscal year, but did not indicate for how long. Murphy proposed increasing spending by $2.2 billion for fiscal year 2021. The fiscal year 2020 budget was $38.7 billion.

Hi Friends,
We hope everyone is staying safe, healthy.
Earlier this week on Tucker Carlson, while discussing the various public gatherings the Governor has banned, Governor Phil Murphy stated that, “I wasn’t thinking of the Bill of Rights when we did this.” When asked again, “By what authority did you nullify the Bill of Rights in issuing this [congregation] order,” Murphy responded, “That’s above my pay grade, Tucker.”
“In New Jersey, there is no elected state office above Governor. The buck stops there,” New Jersey Republican State Committee Chairman Doug Steinhardt said. The NJGOP is calling on the New Jersey legislature to convene and exercise the checks and balances needed to measure Governor Murphy’s executive power.
“The Bill of Rights is not a science experiment; on that there is no compromise,” Steinhardt continued. “Those rights have endured over 200 years and they will endure this pandemic. Contrary to the Governor’s thinking, protecting New Jerseyans’ constitutional rights is not above the his pay grade.”
Steinhardt concluded, “We are in uncharted territory as a country, and it is testing the limits of elected leaders everywhere. The fundamental fabric that constitutes the Bill of Rights is constructed of individual fibers each as important as the other. No right is elevated above another and forsaking one right is forsaking all of them. The NJGOP calls on the Senate and Assembly to convene and exercise the checks and balances needed to measure the Governor’s powers.”

# Steinhardt: Lift China’s legal immunity
State Republican Chairman Doug Steinhardt called on the state’s congressional delegation to move to remove China’s sovereign immunity so entities in New Jersey could sue the nation over its role in the COVID-19 crisis.
“Our local economies are being devastated, our healthcare system is being pushed to its limits and people are dying,” Steinhardt said. “The Communist Party of China must be held accountable for its negligence and New Jersey should steer the solution to pressure China to help pay for this crisis. New Jersey families need their Congressional delegation to be leaders and take the steps that would allow us to formally file a lawsuit against Beijing. We are taking on trillions of dollars in debt, and I don’t want my children, or yours, to ever pay for the bad actions of the CPC.”
# Smith’s bill would allow Americans to sue China for COVID-19 related losses | Gallagher
Legislation introduced by Congressmen Chris Smith (R-NJ) and Ron Wright (R-TX) on Friday would strip China and other countries of their sovereign immunity if they intentionally made misrepresentations regarding the coronavirus, thereby allowing U.S. citizens, businesses and local government to sue those governments for the deaths, pain and suffering, and economic losses caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

# Senator Michael Testa: NJ Must Stop Investing in Chinese Pharmaceutical Companies
State Senator Michael Testa Jr. says it is time for New Jersey to stop investing in Chinese pharmaceutical companies.
“One of the lessons we have learned from the coronavirus crisis is we cannot depend on China,” said Testa (R-1). “Their government demonstrated blatant disregard for human life when they obscured information about the severity and spread of the virus in Wuhan, and last month they threatened to withhold shipments of coronavirus medicine to the United States. New Jersey has no business investing in pharmaceutical companies that can’t be trusted.”
Chinese companies supply active ingredients in antibiotics, vitamin C, ibuprofen and hydrocortisone. Reports indicate China may control critical elements in as much as 90 percent of the prescription drugs in the United States.
“For too long, we have allowed China to silently grab control of our economy, and they have broken our laws and the laws of common decency all along the way,” said Testa. “New Jersey should stop supporting a regime that has consistently stolen our trade secrets and used sweatshop labor to dominate our consumer markets.”
New Jersey pension funds are invested in at least one China-based pharmaceutical company, Hutchison China MediTech Limited.
“Our state is home to 20 pharmaceutical and medical technology firms including 17 of the world’s Top 20 companies,” Testa noted. “There is no need to invest in China when we have opportunities like these right in our backyards. New Jersey should not be complicit in China’s ownership of our medicine cabinets.”

"Pelosi and the Liberal Quartet from New Jersey aren't taking this seriously... View this email in your browser
Friend,
12 days ago the critical Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) that President Trump championed to keep small businesses afloat ran out of funds due to its overwhelming popularity. Immediately, Republican leadership called for replenishing the funds to provide the support that our businesses so desperately need.
Nancy Pelosi, Tom Malinowski, Andy Kim, Mikie Sherrill, and Josh Gottheimer all said NO.
Nancy Pelosi and her Liberal Quartet from New Jersey are refusing to support New Jersey businesses and families. We've had enough.
Can you help us fight back against Nancy Pelosi and New Jersey's Liberal Quartet? Your contribution will help us defeat them at the ballot box this fall!

Pelosi even had the gall to do a late night comedy show, showing off her ice cream stash in her $24,000 freezers. All this while Americans are struggling through a pandemic and economic collapse.
We need strong leadership in Washington that will look out for our New Jersey friends, families and businesses. Can you help us defeat Nancy Pelosi and support New Jerseyans?

Hi Friends,
Since Governor Murphy’s indefinite order to close New Jersey’s economy without any plan for re-opening it, the State has seen a record surge in unemployment claims. More than a million workers have applied for unemployment benefits in New Jersey, but hundreds of thousands of residents are still waiting, some as long as six weeks, for their checks. We’re past crisis point.
New Jersey families of all backgrounds are suffering. They need leaders who are kind hearted, not mean spirited, but Governor Murphy has been callous to criticisms of his Administration’s handling of unemployment claims. When he was questioned about his Labor Department’s abject failures, he told New Jersey’s unemployed that if they were unhappy, they could “go to another state”. Ouch.
Governor Murphy needs to show he has the temperament and real solutions to the unemployment crisis, not dismiss the more than one million New Jerseyans wanting answers. Even members of his own party are now publicly urging him to address New
Jersey’s unemployment pandemic.
A Message From NJGOP Chairman Doug Steinhardt
Governor Murphy won’t let you work, but he won’t give you support either, from an unemployment benefit system you’ve been overpaying into since the moment you set foot in New Jersey. The Governor’s mix of callousness and incompetence is unnerving. The NJGOP asks the legislature step in, investigate, and find a quick solution to put money in the hands of hungry families. We hope that Senate President Sweeney and Speaker Coughlin will act swiftly to support New Jersey where Governor Murphy and his Administration are failing.
Here's what you need to know today
1\. Retail stores that Governor Murphy has deemed ""non-essential"" can now open for curbside pickup.
2\. President Trump is working to ensure underserved communities across America have the resources necessary to fight the virus. To provide health and economic support, President Trump has delivered:
* $2 billion for community health centers to provide care and testing for their 28 million patients
* $60 billion in loans under the Paycheck Protection Program targeted to support minority and disadvantaged communities
* $1 billion to Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Hispanic serving institutions, and other minority serving institutions impacted by the coronavirus
3\. Throughout the coronavirus pandemic, President Trump has supported the farmers, ranchers, fisherman, and producers who put food on America’s kitchen tables.
* On Friday, USDA approved $1.2 billion in contracts to support both American producers and communities in need through the USDA Farmers to Families Food Box Program.
* President Trump signed an Executive Order and announced $300 million to assure America’s competitiveness in the seafood industry and to support fishermen and related businesses hurt by the coronavirus.

* The Administration has provided small agricultural businesses access to capital through the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) and Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) program.
# Connors, Rumpf & Gove: Time Is Right for State Reopening Process to Be Expedited
“New Jersey needs to expedite the process of reopening the state.
“The responsibility to prevent the spread of COVID-19 is in all of our hands. Americans understand the threat posed by this disease after having COVID-19 dominate their lives for nearly two months. They can be and must be trusted to conduct themselves accordingly.
“The present course is economically unsustainable. Businesses that could be reopened are coming close to going under completely. Individuals on unemployment, if they have had their claims processed, won’t have jobs to go back to if the present course holds. Government entitlement programs, such as unemployment insurance, can only last so long before the system collapses under its own weight.
“At the outset, our delegation supported an extremely cautious response to the coronavirus, and for good reason. A large segment of our constituency is comprised of senior citizens, thought to be among the most vulnerable if infected by the disease. Throughout the state of emergency, we’ve provided e-mail updates to constituents so that they could be better informed about COVID-19 and the government response. This information, we believe, has better prepared our constituents for the state reopening process.
“Reopening New Jersey will require adherence to social distancing directives as well as strict cleaning policies which are absolutely necessary to protect our most vulnerable citizens. If infection rates increase, it is possible that restrictions on business operations and social gatherings would need to be reinstituted.
“Businesses should be afforded the opportunity to decide for themselves whether they can reopen safely. They have no choice but to adapt. Consumers will ultimately decide if a business can safely operate by virtue of their shopping habits. Businesses should be given a fighting chance to survive now that we all have a better understanding of this disease and responsible behavior and practices in this new environment..
“There is simply too much at stake for the reopening process not to be expedited. Many businesses that have been ordered to close can maintain social distancing just as easily as liquor stores, which have remained open during the duration of the crisis. Unquestionably, there is a tremendous need to allow for elective surgeries to resume immediately. Locking just about everything down and hoping for the best is not a viable plan to restart the economy.
“Churches and funeral homes should also be given more latitude under the Governor’s executive orders. These respected entities have a firm understanding of the severity of the current situation based on the services they provide and, therefore, should be trusted to take necessary precautions to prevent any spread of the virus. Individuals could take solace in praying with others, even if in small groups, and should have the ability to pay their final respects to loved ones when they pass. With social distancing guidelines strictly observed, church services and funeral processions could help individuals to cope with the mounting hardships we all have been forced to endure.
“As Americans, we should all be thinking more broadly about the very serious national security concerns at hand. America is made vulnerable by a weakened economy that cannot afford a strong military. This would only embolden our enemies and endanger our allies.
“Reopening the state must be re-approached and advanced as a priority, not viewed as a distant eventuality. Again, too much is at stake. Our delegation stands ready to work with businesses and fellow elected officials to achieve the progress in getting New Jerseyans back to living that is so desperately needed.”

Hi Friends,
We have an exciting update regarding the 2020 NJGOP Statewide Leadership Summit.
We are thrilled to announce special guest keynote speakers Matt and Mercedes Schlapp! Click here and purchase your ticket today!
#METOO CHAMPION MIKIE SHERRILL SILENT ON BLOOMBERG MISOGYNY
AND
MIKE BLOOMBERG PROVES HE’S LIBERAL ENOUGH FOR JOSH GOTTHEIMER
NJGOP is calling on Congresswoman Mikie Sherrill to break her silence and address the claims of misogyny against her endorsed Presidential candidate.
Many outlets have reported a number of allegations against Bloomberg, including this one from CNN:
They include claims from the 1990s that prior to a male colleague’s wedding, Bloomberg told a group of female employees to “line up to give him a blow job as a wedding present”; that he would regularly direct comments like “look at that nice piece of ass” at women in the office; and that upon learning that a female employee was expecting a baby, he responded: “Kill it!”
Congresswoman Sherrill claims that President Trump’s so-called “attacks on women” were her motivation to run, but she has been silent on allegations against Bloomberg and touted his “integrity” in her endorsement.
Morris County Republican Chairwoman Laura Ali released the following statement:
“Congresswoman Sherrill has had opportunity after opportunity to be a leader in her own Party, but each time she has passed. Whether it has been any of the host of toxic workplace scandals under Phil Murphy or her endorsement of potential misogynist Mike Bloomberg, I think the women of New Jersey know they can’t count on Mikie Sherrill to stand up for them. Good thing voters in NJ-11 have an opportunity to vote her out in November.”
AND
NJ-5 Congressman Josh Gottheimer dropped a glowing endorsement of Mike Bloomberg for President.
Despite a widely criticized debate performance, Congressman Gottheimer decided that he saw a candidate liberal enough for him to get behind.
Here are some of the positions Mike Bloomberg took minutes before Gottheimer’s endorsement:
* Mike Bloomberg totally flip-flopped and now supports the disastrous Obamacare policy and even wants to expand it.
* Mike Bloomberg was proud to have raised taxes as Mayor of New York and plans to raise more taxes as President.
* Mike Bloomberg would kill thousands of American jobs for a quick, liberal headline on climate change.
* Mike Bloomberg did not have any answers for accusations of misogyny and might still be hiding scandals.
New Jersey Republican State Committee Executive Director Phil Valenziano released the following statement:
“I can’t imagine what Josh Gottheimer saw in Mike Bloomberg last night that made him jump off his couch and fire off an endorsement press release, but North Jersey voters won’t be fooled by his bi-partisan facade. It took a hard tack to the left for Gottheimer to get behind Bloomberg and that is right in line with his record in Washington. Gottheimer spends his time dithering over impeaching Donald Trump and waiting for his orders from Nancy Pelosi, who he votes with 94% of the time. Maybe Josh will have a job waiting for him at Bloomberg’s office after North Jersey voters toss him in November.”

🔦Legislative Spotlight🔦
S-957 sponsored by Senator Chris Connors, Assemblywoman DiAnne Gove, and Assemblyman Brian Rumpf
Legislation sponsored by Senator Christopher J. Connors, Assemblyman Brian E. Rumpf and Assemblywoman DiAnne C. Gove that would permit a portion of municipal development trust funds to be spent on housing affordability assistance to veterans was released by the Senate Community and Urban Affairs Committee.
“Simply, the intent of our bipartisan legislation is to help first-time home-buying veterans realize the dream of owning their own homes, which as we all know can be financially challenging in this state.
“Current law permits a municipality authorized to collect affordable housing fees to set aside amounts from the fees to provide certain affordability assistance programs. We are proposing that up to 30 percent of these affordability assistance funds could be dedicated to assist first-time home-buying veterans, specifically as a down-payment assistance grant of up to $15,000 per individual recipient.
“Veterans receiving the proposed assistance grants would be shielded from taxation of the grant funds, and from potentially losing their eligibility to other State programs. Additionally, our bill is permissive in that municipalities would have the option of establishing a program, meaning that no State mandates would be imposed.”
The 9th District Delegation’s veterans’ proposal passed the Senate in the previous 2018-2019 Legislative Session but was stalled in the Assembly.

Hi Friends,
Happy new year!
This will be my final update before Phil Valenziano takes over as Executive Director of the New Jersey Republican State Committee. It's been a great two and a half years working with you all to rebuild, rebrand, and re-engage New Jersey Republicans under Chairman Steinhardt's Leadership. I am proud of the work we have done together and look forward to seeing all of you later this Spring at the Statewide Leadership Summit!
President Trump’s decisive action in the airstrike against the terrorist Qasem Soleimani sent a strong message to the evil around the world and dealt a major blow to the Iranian regime at the same time. With President Trump as Commander-in-Chief, America is both firmly a safer and stronger nation.

Senator Anthony Bucco (R-25) tells Governor Murphy
to ""Pound Away"" on cutting NJ's Taxes and
make the State more affordable
Senator Anthony M. Bucco responded to comments by Governor Murphy Thursday on his plans to “continue to pound away” for an income tax increase in the coming year.
“When New Jersey leads the nation in the outmigration of residents to more affordable states, Governor Murphy’s pursuit of higher income taxes is insanity,” said Bucco (R-25). “His plans would cement New Jersey’s place as the highest taxed state in the nation. Instead, the Governor should ‘pound away’ on lowering the sky-high property, income, and business taxes that are driving New Jerseyans to leave the Garden State.”
At a press conference today, the Governor also said that raising income taxes on high earners would prepare New Jersey for a “rainy day.”
“Every penny in higher taxes that’s collected through Murphy’s proposed income tax increase would disappear into the black hole of the state budget,” added Bucco. “Even worse, that higher level of spending would be dependent on people who have the greatest ability to leave, which many are already doing. That income is highly variable and prone to steep declines when the economy turns, as New Jersey painfully learned during and after the Great Recession of 2008. Instead of preparing us for a ‘rainy day,” Governor Murphy would be repeating the failed fiscal policies of the McGreevey and Corzine administrations that led to more than 100 tax and fee increases on middle-class New Jerseyans when they could least afford them.”

Hi Friends,
NJGOP Chairman Doug Steinhardt published a MUST READ op-ed this weekend:
They say, ‘Before borrowing money from a friend decide which you need most,’ the money or the friend. Well, governor chose. In the middle of a pandemic, where every New Jersey household and small business has sacrificed, made tough choices, and scaled back spending, Gov. Phil Murphy’s appetite to spend your money grew. New Jersey’s tax problems will continue as long as Democrats control Trenton, but we can change that. The road to a safer, more affordable New Jersey isn’t paved with liberal handouts and borrowed money. It’s paved with smart choices.

# Bucco Bill Saving Jobs and Taxpayer Money Signed Into Law
Legislation sponsored by Senator Bucco providing protections for school employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement was signed into law this week.
Sponsored by Senator Anthony Bucco (R-25) and Senator Troy Singleton (D-7), the new law (S-2303) prevents employers from entering subcontracting agreements which could affect the employment of those workers in a bargaining unit during the term of their contract.
“This will provide stability in our schools and help save money on the cost of healthcare for teachers,” said Bucco. “At the same time, it protects the jobs of important school employees during these challenging times. The jobs of cafeteria workers, janitors and other valuable members of our school communities would be safe from outsourcing to vendors while they are protected by contract.”
An employer, under the law, is defined as any local or regional school district, board or commission under the authority of the Commissioner of Education or the State Board of Education.
“Educational support professionals enhance the scholastic experience our students receive at school. They help separate New Jersey’s public schools from the rest, and are part of the reason why we have had the best schools in the country for the past two years,” said Singleton. “With this new law, we are showing our support professionals that they are core to our children’s education.”

FIVE STORIES PRESIDENT TRUMP DOESN'T WANT YOU TO MISS
'A No-Fail Mission': Army Special Operator Recounts ISIS-Hostage Rescue for Which He Will Receive Medal of Honor
-Stars And Stripes
President Trump will present the Medal of Honor today to Sergeant Major Thomas Payne, who braved machine gun fire on October 22, 2015, to save ISIS-held prisoners from a burning jail in northern Iraq. “Payne will receive the Medal of Honor on the 19th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the primary event that convinced him to join the military, as thousands of other Americans did,” Corey Dickstein reports.
Remembering Flight 93 and Heroes of 9/11
-Pittsburgh Post-Gazette
This morning, President Trump and the First Lady visited the Flight 93 Memorial near Shanksville, Pa., where 40 brave passengers and crew sacrificed their lives to protect fellow Americans. “This Patriot Day, I encourage all Americans to honor the memories of the nearly 3,000 precious lives we lost on Sept. 11, 2001, as well as every hero who has given his or her life since that day,” Interior Secretary David Bernhardt writes.
Threats Have Evolved Since Sept. 11, but DHS Stands Ready to Protect the Nation
-Washington Examiner
“The American creed is precious and precarious, only as secure as the state of our homeland. The terrorists of Sept. 11 targeted America, believing our freedom made us vulnerable. They were wrong. The commitment of our people to liberty and self-governance was not shaken in the face of terrorism, it was redoubled,” Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf writes.
Trump Says US ‘Will Always Fight Back’ During 9/11 Ceremony in Shanksville, Pa.
-New York Post
“The heroes of Flight 93 are an everlasting reminder that no matter the danger, no matter the threat, no matter the odds, America will always rise up, stand tall and fight back,” President Trump said today. En route to Pennsylvania, the President led a moment of silence aboard Air Force One at 8:46 a.m. ET—the moment when American Airlines Flight 11 crashed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center, Steven Nelson reports.
Recovered COVID-19 Patient Thrilled To Give Back By Donating Plasma
-Tulsa KOTV-DT
“Employees at the Red Cross said [donating plasma] is a simple way for people who recover from COVID-19 to turn around and help someone else. The plasma donations could save someone's life whose body is struggling to fight COVID-19 . . . The machine works while the patient sits back and relaxes,” Sawyer Buccy reports.

🔦 Legislature Spotlight Of The Week 🔦
S-1298 Sponsored by Senator Anthony Bucco
Legislation sponsored by Senator Anthony M. Bucco providing towns an opportunity to highlight their efforts to control property taxes through shared service agreements has been signed into law.
“New Jersey residents struggle to pay the nation’s highest property tax bills, and they want to know what’s being done to ease that burden,” said Bucco (R-25). “This new law provides towns with the opportunity to show directly on property tax bills how they are using shared service agreements to produce savings for taxpayers.”
The new law, S-1298, permits a municipality to include on the tax bill a statement listing the number and type of shared services entered into by the municipality, the dollar value of the savings to the municipality from each of those shared services, and a total amount of municipal savings resulting from those shared services.
The State has allowed shared services since the 1970s, resulting in hundreds of successful arrangements.
According to the Department of Community Affairs, reported agreements have resulted in cumulative savings totaling more than $28 million since 2011.
“With nearly 600 school districts and 565 municipalities in New Jersey, the savings achieved to date through shared services represent the tip of the iceberg of what’s possible,” added Bucco. “It’s my hope that this legislation will encourage local officials to do more to lower the cost of government and give property taxpayers a better handle on what’s being done on their behalf.”

Friend,
Democrats tried to hold us back and stop us from voting in Tuesday's Primary Election by sabotaging the election and forcing voters to vote-by-mail, but they can’t stop us.
Republicans are FIRED UP.
The momentum behind our team is palpable, Republicans are united and stronger than ever.
Just last night, Fox News highlighted the importance of New Jersey in the 2020 General Election. The road to the House Majority runs right through our state. President Trump is counting on New Jersey voters. We can’t stop now.
We’re launching our state-wide field program, with a presence in all 21 counties committed to winning in November. The field team is getting trained, positioned, and ready to turn out voters.
Our Republican candidates are counting on us to help get them across the finish line in November and stop the Democrats.
Join the NJ Victory Team!
We’ve made it this far thanks to your support, but we need to keep going. Contribute today to help us build our war chest and defeat Nancy Pelosi in November!

Click here to EXPOSE MURPHY!
Friend,
Last week our team launched a huge campaign to expose Phil Murphy's failures throughout the four-month COVID crisis.
You may have seen our coverage of whistleblowers from within his Administration raising concerns about his leadership and what it means for the future of our state.
Things just keep getting worse for Murphy.
From lawsuits against councils and school districts to Murphy seemingly authorizing preferential testing and treatment for his own Administration, Murphy continues to be exposed for his over-reach and outright abuses of power.
We can't sit back and let Murphy get away with this any longer and we need your help. Donate today to fund our fight to expose Murphy and stop his reckless leadership from continuing to put New Jersey families and businesses at risk.
>> Donate $10 <<
>> Donate $15 <<
>> Donate $25 <<
Our Republican team has the momentum to expose Phil Murphy for his failures and defeat him in 2021, but we need your help. Will you help us expose Murphy today?
Sincerely,
Team NJGOP

Did you see Madi's email? Our fundraising deadline is tonight at 11:59PM. Will you help us hit our goal?
We are still $2,370 short of our goal. Democrats are watching us, if we don't hit our goal they will know that they have a chance to win in New Jersey in November.
We need only 158 supporters to contribute $15. I'm asking, right now, can you help us out?
This fundraising deadline is critical. We must show that New Jersey Republicans are strong and ready to win in November. Can you help us hit our goal with a contribution of $15, $35, or even $55 today?

Hi Friends,
Governor Murphy’s administration has announced that unemployment rose by nearly 12% from March to April to 15.3%, and that revenue is down $2.8 billion this fiscal year and an anticipated $7.4 billion for fiscal year 2021. Now Murphy is pushing a multi-billion dollar borrowing scheme as a solution.
Sensible Democrats are understandably distressed over the Governor’s massive spending plan, but despite having handed New Jersey Republicans their biggest legislative gain since 1991, Assembly Speaker Coughlin jumped on board the Murphy plan.
“Some politicians in Trenton will always be owned by the public sector labor unions,” said Chairman Steinhardt. “Governor Murphy and Speaker Coughlin would rather mortgage the State’s future with a multi-billion dollar borrowing scheme than make needed budget cuts that reduce spending and spare taxpayers the added crunch.”

# NASA: We’re Going Back to the Moon, and Beyond
“Our nation is on the verge of launching NASA astronauts to the International Space Station on a commercial American rocket and spacecraft—a historic mission,” NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine writes in USA Today.
“NASA has a bold plan to quickly and sustainably explore more of the moon than ever before under the Artemis program. Even as we shift focus to the moon, NASA remains committed to supporting a space economy in low-Earth orbit for research, crew training and more.”

“Of course the Trump administration is playing tough with the media—because the media has played tough with him before he was even elected. Nearly every question asked in the briefing room is usually in the loaded construction of, ‘As you know, things are terrible, and it’s your fault, care to comment?’ McEnany has decided to hit back,” the New York Post editorial board writes.
“Democrats and virtually every journalist in the Washington media are fond of saying things like Nobody wants the shutdown to last forever and Everybody wants the economy to go back to what it was. But just as when they insist that Everyone believes in securing the Southern border, there's no real indication that they're being honest,” Eddie Scarry writes in the Washington Examiner.
“Most Medicare recipients will have access to prescription plans next year that limit their copays for insulin to no more than $35 a month, potentially saving hundreds of dollars, the Trump administration announced Tuesday,” The Associated Press reports.

# Why I decided to sue Governor Murphy | Steinhardt
By NJGOP Chairman Doug Steinhardt
Accountability is an important lesson. It’s one I learned as a child, from parents who taught me the value of hard work. I taught it to my children, who are 17 and 22 today. And I learned, as the Mayor of my hometown, that you don’t spurn your constituents; they trusted you to lead. Accountability matters.
Unfortunately, too many of the politicians in Trenton don’t understand accountability. They spend money we don’t have, adopt policies we can’t afford, and saddle small businesses with regulations we don’t need. Governor Murphy is one of those politicians.

A Note From NJGOP Chairman Doug Steinhardt
To Our NJGOP Family,
First, I want to thank our great Republican candidates, staff and volunteers for doing more than just talking. They acted. They ran strong campaigns forged in Republican principles. Everything’s over now but the counting.
From the bottom of my heart, I want to thank all of you for your ongoing support of the New Jersey Republican Party. We’ve come a long way, with a long way yet to go. Still, the product of three years of focused effort and execution has allowed us to strengthen our Republican family and actually grow it. Since January 2018 we’ve registered over 200,000 new Republicans, erasing decades of registered losses by nearly double. That renewed energy and enthusiasm, combined with a strong message and stronger candidates, means victories across New Jersey tonight and in the coming days.
By any calculus, this was a difficult year. The COVID crisis presented new challenges, but we have a lot to be proud of. Below is just a sample of what we have done this year, together:
* Hosted a Rally in Wildwood with over 15,000 attendees
* Recruited and trained over 3,000 volunteers statewide
* Gathered over 10,000 petition signatures to get President Trump and his delegates on the ballot
* Contacted over 2,000,000 voters via door to door, text message and phone banking
* Attended over 150 events in all 21 counties
* Earned over 200 media mentions in national, state and local media outlets
* Reached over 8,000,000 voters on social media
* Exposed Governor Murphy's weak leadership and poor judgement during the COVID crisis, resulted in a Federal Investigation into his policies
* Invested in an aggressive, targeted, digital advertising program that showed our message over 2 million times
* Sent 1,300,000 GOTV texts to voters around the State
* Sent 3,800,000 pieces of mail to voters
* Our total funds raised is up over 26%
* Half our donors are new, which is a sign of a growing and healthy fundraising program
* Nearly doubled our small dollar fundraising
* Grew our email list by nearly 50%
* Hosted the largest Statewide Leadership Summit ever, and
* Added over 200,000 new Republicans to the rolls in our state, and in the last two months have exceeded the Democrats in growth rate.
* Flipped the first legislative district
It is an honor to serve as your Chairman and I am humbled by your support and confidence. I want our kids to have the opportunities that my sister and I did; to start their lives here, and I want their grandparents to be able to afford to retire here. New Jersey Republicans and the NJGOP are fighting to keep our families together. Governor Murphy and the Democrats are tearing them apart. I can't think of a more worthy cause, and we are making a difference, one election at a time.
Thank you,
Doug Steinhardt

Hi Friends,
Please see below for a NJGOP update on COVID-19.
A Message From NJGOP Chairman Doug Steinhardt
Good afternoon everyone,
I hope everyone is staying healthy and safe during these difficult times.
Earlier this week on Tucker Carlson, while discussing the various public gatherings the Governor has banned, Governor Phil Murphy stated that, “I wasn’t thinking of the Bill of Rights when we did this.” When asked again, “By what authority did you nullify the Bill of Rights in issuing this [congregation] order,” Murphy responded, “That’s above my pay grade, Tucker.”
In New Jersey, there is no elected state office above Governor. The buck stops there. The NJGOP is calling on the New Jersey legislature to convene and exercise the checks and balances needed to measure Governor Murphy’s executive power.
The Bill of Rights is not a science experiment; on that there is no compromise. Those rights have endured over 200 years and they will endure this pandemic. Contrary to the Governor’s thinking, protecting New Jerseyans’ constitutional rights is not above the his pay grade.
We are in uncharted territory as a country, and it is testing the limits of elected leaders everywhere. The fundamental fabric that constitutes the Bill of Rights is constructed of individual fibers each as important as the other. No right is elevated above another and forsaking one right is forsaking all of them. The NJGOP calls on the Senate and Assembly to convene and exercise the checks and balances needed to measure the Governor’s powers.
Here's what you need to know today
President Trump has unveiled Guidelines for Opening Up America Again, a three-phased approach based on the advice of public health experts. These steps will help state and local officials when reopening their economies, getting people back to work, and continuing to protect American lives. Read more here...
Yesterday President Trump convened Members of Congress to serve on the Opening Up America Again Congressional Group.
Democrats like Andy Kim, Mikie Sherrill, Josh Gottheimer and Tom Malinowski are STILL refusing to drop the political games and fund the Paycheck Protection Program after it ran out of money yesterday. The program will substantially help New Jersey's small businesses and economy. Read more here...

Friends,
It’s clear now that Phil Murphy never had a plan to navigate New Jersey through this crisis, and he has no plan to guide us out of it. Today’s announcement was more of the same Murphy two step we’ve seen over the last 2 ½ years, and more often over the last 2 ½ months.
Watch This Video From NJGOP Chairman Steinhardt!
Governor Murphy Violating His Own Executive Order
Over the weekend, Governor Murphy broke his own Executive Order and attended Black Lives Matter protests in Westfield and Hillside.
NJGOP Chairman Doug Steinhardt offered this comment on the Governor’s hypocrisy:
“New Jersey needs a leader who shows up more frequently than when his political interests line up with people’s needs. The DOH whistleblowers from Governor Murphy’s own administration described him best when they called him a political opportunist. He has canceled church services, in person voting and shuttered countless small businesses in the name of social distancing, but when he saw the opportunity for a photo op this weekend he stood shoulder to shoulder, literally, with thousands of protestors.”
“None can dispute the call for justice for George Floyd. None can dispute the push to answer that call. Yet, Governor Murphy blurs lines between protests worthy of participation and those deserving prosecution, by picking constitutional winners and losers in the same way he picked economic ones. He has created different classes of protestors, business owners, and even Covid patients, by sending some 6,000 New Jerseyans to die in our nursing homes. We deserve better and that is something we will all come together on in November and in November 2021.”

# State GOP asks Murphy admin to preserve COVID-19 response documents
By NJ Globe
The Republican State Committee demanded state officials preserve documents related to New Jersey’s coronavirus response in a letter sent last week.
The letter Deputy Attorney General Christopher Weber, which was penned by State Sen. Michael Testa (R-Vineland), calls on the administration to hold documents related to business reopenings and closures made early into the COVID-19 crisis.
The Republicans also want communications sent to Murphy or State Police Superintendent Col. Pat Callahan by Health Department officials since Feb. 1 preserved.
“As it becomes clearer that Gov Murphy’s words and promises on crisis management and the state’s economy were hollow, we felt it important to ensure that the same transparency virus that has prompted leaks and claims of scapegoating and coverups doesn’t befall the State’s emails and other electronic communications,” Republican State Chairman Doug Steinhardt said.
Former Assistant Commissioner of Health Chris Neuwirth, who was in charge of, public health infrastructure, laboratories and emergency preparedness for the department and oversaw emergency medical services and the state office of Disaster Resilience, was fired late last month.
Neuwirth has claimed he was scapegoated. The governor and his administration have repeatedly declined to comment on his firing, citing a policy that bars comment on personnel issues.
The Republicans are also asking the attorney general’s office to preserve memos and other forms of correspondence detailing the efficacy of various executive orders Murphy has enacted during the crisis.
In the wake of the June 4 letter, the state committee is pushing to have the case removed to the appellate division, where the case would be expedited.

# Best News Yet of 2020: Signs America’s Bouncing Back Fast
America got some welcome news on Friday: “surprising, unprecedented job growth along with clear signs that the national pandemic has ebbed far from its peak,” the New York Post editorial board writes.
Two and a half million jobs were added last month—the biggest jump in U.S. history.
“More grounds for hope: All indications are that the virus is losing.” In New York City, there were zero reported Coronavirus deaths one day this week, marking the first day without any deaths in nearly 3 months.

“A majority of the Minneapolis City Council has pledged to ‘dismantle’ the city’s police department as their solution to police violence after George Floyd’s death.” The city council said they will defund the police and put the money toward a “community-based public safety model.” Read more from Henry Rodgers in The Daily Caller.
Now is a terrible moment for The New York Times—and for freedom of expression everywhere. “On Sunday afternoon, the Times announced that James Bennet, its editorial page editor, would resign, and Jim Dao, his deputy, would be reassigned. Their crime: publishing an opinion piece from a United States senator Times staffers and readers did not like,” former Times reporter Alex Berenson writes for Fox News.
“Today, behind the cloak of a pandemic the Chinese Communist Party itself created, we are witnessing similar kinds of strategic behavior as China seeks to advance its own agenda and Chinese propagandists seek to advance a pro-authoritarian government narrative,” White House Trade & Manufacturing Policy Director Peter Navarro writes for Fox News.

Steinhardt attacks Murphy over plan to continue making pension payments
Republican State Chairman Doug Steinhardt attacked Gov. Phil Murphy over his intent to make a full pension payment this quarter on Tuesday.
“If a reasonable person made a list of 100 things the state of New Jersey should invest in, you would probably see important agenda items like aid to small businesses, veterans, our children’s education or help for more than 1.3 million unemployed New Jerseyans,” Steinhardt said.

President Trump wants you to have the facts!
* America is open for business. This is the second huge jobs report after our record jobs gains were artificially halted by a global pandemic.
* President Trump built the strongest economy in history and is doing so again.
* In June, a massive 4.8 million jobs were added – double what was added in May and blowing past expectations by 2 million.
* There was a gain in both the manufacturing and construction industries:
* Manufacturing: 356,000 gain
* Construction: 158,000 gain
* The unemployment rate dropped over 2 points to 11% as states across the country reopened.
* The labor force participation rate increased .7% to 61.5%.
* Wages increased by 5% year over year in June.
* There is no denying our Great American Comeback is under way and President Trump is the jobs President.
* If Joe Biden had his way, we would revert to higher taxes and more regulations that would stifle this economic growth.
* President Trump built the greatest economy in the history of the world, and he’s going to do it again.

Governor Leaves $750 Million of Savings on the Table, Threatens to Slash Popular Property Tax Relief Programs
Senator Anthony M. Bucco said Governor Phil Murphy missed an opportunity to implement State employee furloughs back in May that could have provided more than enough savings to fund property tax relief programs that provide critical assistance to families and seniors:
“The Legislature sent Governor Murphy bipartisan furlough legislation back in May that could have saved the State an estimated $750 million, more than enough to fund the Homestead Rebate and Senior Freeze programs. Instead, he returned to the Legislature a watered down furlough bill that is unlikely to produce any substantial savings. This is unacceptable.
“Because the governor failed to enact the original legislation, the State budget is in a deeper hole. In fact, the administration says it may cancel Homestead Benefit credits on upcoming property tax bills and Senior Freeze reimbursements that otherwise would have been paid this month. It didn’t have to be this way.
“We’ll keep fighting to get New Jerseyans the property tax relief they deserve.”
Governor Murphy already eliminated Homestead Benefit credits from property tax bills due in May, leading to higher bills for many homeowners.
Concerned taxpayers can sign an online petition that urges Governor Murphy not to follow through on his threat to cut the Homestead Benefit and Senior Freeze property tax relief programs.

Why you are a Republican: Beyond the traditional reasons (pro-life, pro-gun, tax cuts, et cetera), I'm a Republican because conservative Republicans of today are defending common-sense positions that are under siege by the left - positions like the belief that immigration policy should both be controlled by the government and shouldn't depress American wages.

Friends,
Yesterday, a group of courageous whistleblowers came forward and exposed the Murphy Administration’s disastrous response to the COVID-19 pandemic inside nursing homes and longterm care facilities. In a letter to Senate President Sweeney and Leader Kean, a group of health department employees who identify themselves as Democrat-leaning voters called the Governor’s efforts “an unmitigated failure” that led to “preventable deaths”. NJGOP Chairman Doug Steinhardt praised the whistleblowers and charged Governor Murphy with addressing what was brought to light:
“The letter that came to light last night, written by courageous whistleblowers within the Murphy administration, confirms our worst suspicions about the administration’s handling of the COVID crisis. We’ve long suspected the Governor was more concerned with public perception than PPE, more focused on media coverage than medical expertise, and is now more worried about covering up his failures than correcting them.
“Governor Murphy must begin his press conference today with a clear statement restoring faith in his actions. He must condemn these insider deals, admit that his ‘plan’ was never backed up by data, and stand accountable for his and his staff’s failures. We long suspected the governor’s actions were causing unnecessary deaths. Despite apparent fear of intimidation and retaliation, his own staff now confirms it.”
The NJGOP has submitted a formal request to Attorney General Barr and US Attorney Carpenito to investigate the Murphy Administration’s policies that led to the deaths of 6,000+ longterm care facility residents and staff.

We can meet New Jersey’s budget obligations after coronavirus with a tax cut, says Assembly GOP Conference Leader. Here’s how.
Rather than increasing taxes or borrowing after state revenue has dropped by billions, Assemblyman John DiMaio believes he has found a way for New Jersey to cut taxes for the middle-class while keeping state and local governments afloat.
Similar to the reciprocal tax agreement with Pennsylvania, certain residents would not have to file a federal income tax return and New Jersey would raise rates to the federal level for only this tax year. The state would have to create a new tax form that would be filed earning under a certain income, to be negotiated with Congress, to limit the amount of revenue to New Jersey’s needs.
Essentially, residents who file this form would get a tax cut by not paying state income tax rates in addition to federal rates, and applying the federal rates at the state level would boost revenue by billions.
It also avoids constitutional problems because the state would not have to use a bond or loan to cover revenue.
The state Supreme Court ruled in a 2004 case, Lance v. McGreevey, that under the state Constitution’s Article 8, section 2, paragraph 2, does not qualify bond proceeds as revenue to balance the budget. In that same section, paragraph 3 allows debt to be issued for emergency costs, but the subsection only pertains to the restrictions in that paragraph.
DiMaio says that the plan addresses New Jersey’s three biggest fiscal problems: residents struggling to make ends meet will receive tax relief, state revenue receives a much-needed boost to help state and local budgets, and there is no conflict over constitutional interpretation to slow down New Jersey’s urgent need to recover.
“The state shouldn’t be asking for a federal bailout because of years of poor fiscal management,” said DiMaio. “But our political system needs a market correction. New Jersey annually gives far more tax dollars to the federal government than we get back. This plan doesn’t ask for taxpayers across the nation to fix our problems, it asks to let us fix our own problems.”
Federal receipts from New Jersey were $33.9 billion more than federal expenditures to the state combined between fiscal years 2017 and 2018 alone, according to the Rockefeller Institute of Government’s “Giving or Getting” reports. New Jersey sent $112 billion to the federal government in FY18. Gov. Phil Murphy told President Donald J. Trump in a press conference that the state needs up to $30 billion.
The plan is amenable to Congress setting fiscal conditions on how the money is spent and requiring reforms that achieve savings to optimize help for people and state and local governments. Income tax revenue is constitutionally dedicated to property tax relief, which covers education spending, county and local government aid, and pensions and health benefits.
“New Jersey and other states should not receive the benefit of the doubt because there is ample reason to doubt the money will be spent responsibly,” said DiMaio, who has repeatedly been critical of the state’s penchant for adding new programs and budgetary increases while not ensuring that current programs are financially solvent. “Congress would be wrong to give carte blanche, because if that is the case there is a good chance states will go back hat in hand. The states that need money the most are by many metrics the worst managed: currently and historically.”
The state Treasury Department is releasing a revenue report today. DiMaio has sent letters to Sens. Mitch McConnell and Chuck Schumer, Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, as well as all of New Jersey’s members of Congress. He sent a separate letter to President Donald J. Trump, asking for his consideration of the plan.

# GOP senators want Sweeney to tell DoH to preserve documents
NJ Globe
Five Republican senators urged Senate President Steve Sweeney to send preservation letters to the Department of Health and other administration officials.
State Sens. Tom Kean (R-Westfield), Kristin Corrado (R-Totowa), Steve Oroho (R-Franklin), Joe Pennacchio (R-Montville) and Declan O’Scanlon (R-Little Silver) raised specific concerns over the recent firing of a senior health department official.
“Among other assertions, published reports have pointed to the possible misuse of federal funds and suggested that Assistant Commissioner Christopher Neuwirth was terminated in an attempt to hide misconduct within the Administration,” the lawmakers said in the letter.
The New Jersey Globe first reported Neuwirth’s ouster last week.
Murphy has repeatedly declined to say why Neuwirth was fired, citing a policy barring comment on personnel issues.
Sources have told the New Jersey Globe that Neuwirth’s firing was related to a side-job he held with Margolis Healy & Associates, a national emergency management consulting firm that is affiliated with the Cozen O’Connor law firm and was not noted on Neuwirth’s financial disclosure.
Others have told the New Jersey Globe that Neuwirth was one of several administration officials suspected of leaking embarrassing information about the inner workings of the administration during pandemic to reporters.
Neuwirth’s inclusion on that list was first reported by the (Bergen) Record.
The Republicans want to make sure he gets a preservation letter.
“These should include a general preservation letter covering the Department of Health at large, in addition to individual preservation letters directed to any and all persons implicated in the reports referenced above, including, but not limited to, Mr. Neuwirth,” they said.

Friend,
I am pleased to announce that our NJGOP team has joined forces with Donald J. Trump for President Inc. and the Republican National Committee to stand up for the rights of all New Jersey voters by filing a lawsuit again Governor Murphy's unconstitutional vote by mail scheme.
Last Friday, Governor Phil Murphy issued yet another unconstitutional executive order, this time establishing an all vote by mail election scheme that violates the basic rights of New Jersey citizens.
Throughout the COVID-19 crisis and July's primary election, one thing became very clear: Governor Murphy is failing New Jersey families and businesses.
DONATE NOW!
Governor Phil Murphy continues to ravage our constitutional rights, upend our economy and sacrifice the health of our veterans and senior citizens.
The NJGOP will not allow Governor Murphy to hijack November's election, we will not allow him to silence our voices and deny us the basic right to vote.
I know that in November we can change the course of this State. We cannot wait until then to take action. I hope you will join our team, support our fight and stand with us today by making a donation of $5, $10 or $15.

Friends,
Recent reports reflect that additional whistle blowers within Governor Murphy’s Administration plan to come forward with concerns about the Governor’s mishandling of the COVID19 crisis. While Republicans have long questioned the Governor’s poor leadership, his own Party now seems to be turning against him. Democrat controlled councils in places like Asbury Park vocally opposed the Governor’s mismanagement, and it was reported that Democrat Congressional members have growing concerns with his erratic decision making.

Comment from NJGOP Chairman Doug Steinhardt:
“Governor Murphy has lost control and can no longer cover up the mess he has created. Last week, the NJGOP launched our campaign to expose Governor Murphy’s failed responses to one of the biggest crises in our state’s history. From over 6,300 dead longterm care facility occupants to over 1.2 million unemployed, it’s important that we expose the truth about the Murphy Administration’s failure. Governor Murphy lacked the strong leadership to get us through this crisis and he lacks the strength to bring us back from it.”

"Friend,
The NJGOP has sued the Governor on behalf of the citizens of New Jersey not once, not twice, but THREE TIMES this year for repeatedly violating the Constitution. We are happy to keep going after him and we are humbled by your support. But, lawsuits are expensive. Our most recent lawsuit is no exception and we need your continued investment.
On Wednesday, Chairman Steinhardt announced that we'll be taking King Murphy to federal court. We're working every day to preserve your basic 14th Amendment right, the right to vote.
Chairman Steinhardt wants to know that you are on our team. He's asked for a list of everyone who has contributed to our lawsuit fund and I want to make sure your name is on the list. Please, make sure your name is on the list by contributing just $15 to our lawsuit fund today.
Sincerely,
Phil Valenziano

Friend,
I am pleased to announce that our NJGOP team has joined forces with Donald J. Trump for President Inc. and the Republican National Committee to stand up for the rights of all New Jersey voters by filing a lawsuit again Governor Murphy's unconstitutional vote by mail scheme.
Last Friday, Governor Phil Murphy issued yet another unconstitutional executive order, this time establishing an all vote by mail election scheme that violates the basic rights of New Jersey citizens.
Throughout the COVID-19 crisis and July's primary election, one thing became very clear: Governor Murphy is failing New Jersey families and businesses.
DONATE NOW!
Governor Phil Murphy continues to ravage our constitutional rights, upend our economy and sacrifice the health of our veterans and senior citizens.
The NJGOP will not allow Governor Murphy to hijack November's election, we will not allow him to silence our voices and deny us the basic right to vote.
I know that in November we can change the course of this State. We cannot wait until then to take action. I hope you will join our team, support our fight and stand with us today by making a donation of $5, $10 or $15.
Sincerely,
Doug Steinhardt
Chairman

Hi Friends,
Happy Labor Day weekend.
Experts and studies continue to raise red flags over Governor Murphy’s spending and borrowing habits.
Today, business relocation expert John Boyd said that Governor Murphy’s proposed budget effectively takes New Jersey “off the table” for businesses looking at relocating here. Watch the interview here.
Yesterday, a survey of 892 New Jersey CPAs found that the vast majority of them opposed Governor Murphy’s $9 billion borrowing scheme. Read more here.
And earlier in the week, data from United Van Lines provided to Bloomberg News showed that 7 in 10 New Jersey citizens moving were actually moving out of the state. Read more here.
“Governor Murphy has failed to inspire confidence in New Jersey businesses and families,"" said NJGOP Chairman Doug Steinhardt. At one time New Jersey led the nation in the export of pharmaceuticals, goods and other services. Today, we lead the nation in the export of jobs and people. Our parents and grandparents can’t afford to retire here and our children and grandchildren can’t afford to start their lives here. Under Murphy’s reckless and irresponsible spending, New Jersey’s economy will continue to shrink and we’ll continue to devolve into FaceTime families. Next November, it’s Phil Murphy who needs to pack his bags.”
# NJGOP In The News
# Trump’s RNC takes aim at ‘radical left’ Joe Biden
# Overall, Doug Steinhardt gave it high marks.
“I think the president really dug down, was measured, was deliberative, made it clear that we need to be tough on China, we need to eradicate COVID, talked about creating jobs, lowering healthcare costs, standing up for and alongside our police departments, and draining the Washington swamp,” Steinhardt said.
And something never seen before, a convention held at the White House. It’s illegal for taxpayer property to be used for a political campaign, and hundreds gathered close with no masks. None of it stopped the president.
🎬MUST WATCH OF THE WEEK🎬
The GOP House leadership’s Congressional Leadership Fund (CLF) is up with a new ad in NJ-07. The spot – “Screwed” – is running online as well as on broadcast and cable television.
“Democrats ran on promises of bipartisanship but their records reveal the truth about how they have embraced the worst of Washington,” said CLF President Dan Conston. “Democrats will have to face the music as voters back home realize their records are too liberal and too phony to deserve second terms.”
# Bucco: Gov. Murphy Must Quickly Sign Bills to Help Drivers Avoid Long Lines at MVC
After Administration Fails to Plan MVC Reopening, Legislature Sends Solutions to Governor
Senator Anthony M. Bucco called on Governor Phil Murphy to quickly sign a pair of bills into law that would help more drivers to avoid the long lines that have persisted at New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission (MVC) agencies since their July reopening.
A constituent shared these pictures with Sen. Tony Bucco of long lines at the Randolph MVC agency before 8 a.m on Friday, September 4, 2020. ([[URL REDACTED]])
“The Murphy Administration failed to come up with an effective reopening plan for the MVC, which has led to ridiculously long lines at agencies and justified frustration for drivers,” said Bucco. “With little help coming from the governor, the Legislature has stepped in with fixes that could help many drivers to skip the trip to the MVC. We put legislative solutions to some of the MVC’s problems on Governor Murphy’s desk, now he needs to sign the bills into law without delay.”
Bucco asked the MVC for the opportunity to review its strategic reopening plan in early May, warning that chaos would ensue once agencies opened their doors after months of being closed. No plan was produced despite repeated requests.
“Even before COVID-19, a visit to the MVC was a dreaded experience for most people,” said Bucco. “You didn’t need to be a rocket scientist to realize that MVC agencies would be overwhelmed by people who had waited months to get a driver’s license, register a car, or transfer a title. We urged the Murphy Administration to prepare and offered suggestions to help, but they just didn’t listen. Hopefully the governor listens this time and signs our bipartisan solutions into law.”
In response to the long lines at reopened MVC agencies, legislators from both sides of the aisle in the Senate and General Assembly worked together to quickly adopt a pair of bills that could offer substantial relief.
Bucco sponsored S-2747, which authorizes the MVC to extend the time that a stored driver’s license or identification card photo can be used from 8 years to 12 years. The legislation also allows stored photos to be used indefinitely for those over the age of 65, and allows for agencies to reserve certain times to provide appointments to senior citizens or those with certain medical conditions during the pandemic.
“I’ve heard from a lot of drivers who were blocked from renewing their licenses on the MVC website because their picture was too old,” said Bucco. “Instead of quickly renewing online, they were forced get up before dawn to wait on line for hours at the MVC to get a new picture taken. That’s an incredible and unnecessary waste of time. Allowing the pictures the MVC already has stored to be used for another 4-year renewal as we have proposed is an incredibly easy way to save people time and cut lines at agencies. The bill would also save seniors and those with special needs from waiting for hours at the MVC. Governor Murphy needs to sign this immediately.”
The second bill, A-4520, allows people who move to New Jersey from other states during the pandemic up to 120 days to obtain a New Jersey driver’s license and to register their vehicle. In regular times, new residents are required to obtain a New Jersey license and registration within 60 days.
Bucco also sponsors a package of MVC bills that would offer drivers additional relief. He also offered a series of proposed solutions to the governor in early July that could have been enacted.
The senator warned that many people whose license expirations were extended to the end of September need immediate help.
“When reopened agencies were overwhelmed in early July, the governor asked drivers not to rush to the MVC saying they had plenty of time,” said Bucco. “Months later, the lines are still there and people are facing the imminent threat of their licenses expiring on September 30th. Parents who have school starting and jobs to juggle don’t have the time to waste at the MVC. What are they supposed to do? Governor Murphy needs to do something to help. He can start by signing the bills we sent him into law.”

FIVE STORIES PRESIDENT TRUMP DOESN'T WANT YOU TO MISS
Payrolls Increase by Nearly 1.4 Million as the Unemployment Rate Tumbles
-CNBC
“Nonfarm payrolls increased by 1.37 million in August and the unemployment rate tumbled to 8.4% as the U.S. economy continued to climb its way out of the pandemic downturn,” Jeff Cox reports. “‘These jobs numbers reflect a big win for American workers . . . Unemployment breaking the 10% barrier so decisively is a big psychological lift as well,’ said Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union.”
America's Fight: Civilization Versus Anarchy
-Newsweek
“The level of violence we are seeing around America cannot be understood and analyzed as a normal event within a free society,” former House Speaker Newt Gingrich writes. “The new anti-American rebellion is better organized, better connected, more widespread and has a lot more strategic thinking than its precursor did in the 1960s.”
Restore Our Lives Using Medical Science, Data and Common Sense
-The Hill
“Americans are anxious to get back to work and to send their children to school. The science backs them up . . . Unlike his critics, who have focused on the wrong goal and engaged in unfounded fear-mongering, President Trump has been implementing a three-pronged, data-driven strategy that is saving lives while safely reopening the economy and society,” writes Dr. Scott Atlas of the White House Coronavirus Task Force.
Trump to Award Medal of Honor on 9/11 to Soldier Who Rescued 75 Hostages
-Fox News
“On the 19th anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks, President Trump plans to award the Medal of Honor to U.S. Army Sgt. Major Thomas Payne for conspicuous gallantry for his role in leading a dangerous nighttime raid in Iraq that freed 75 hostages.” The President will also visit the Flight 93 National Memorial in Pennsylvania, Andrew O’Reilly reports.
GM, Ford Produce 80,000 Ventilators, Conclude Historic 'Arsenal of Health' Effort
-The Detroit News
“Capping off a historic effort by Detroit's automakers to build ventilators for the national stockpile, General Motors Co. and Ford Motor Co. say they have fulfilled their commitments to manufacture tens of thousands of the breathing machines that have helped save the lives of COVID-19 patients across the country,” Breana Noble

Today's the day. Chairman Steinhardt and our Republican Leaders will be heard by the New Jersey Supreme Court.
The NJ Supreme Court wouldn't be listening if our concerns weren't valid. Governor Murphy continues to overreach, issuing unconstitutional executive orders and scheming New Jersey taxpayers into years of debt.
As our Party takes the to the court room today, will you show your support by signing our petition and giving a few dollars toward our cause?
This lawsuit isn't cheap, but we know it's necessary to save New Jersey families and businesses from the wrath of King Murphy.
Please, consider contributing just $5, $10 or $15 today to fund the fight and put an end to the reign of King Murphy.

Friend,
For years, New Jersey businesses and families have been burdened by debt racked up by the liberal stranglehold that exists in Trenton. While businesses are closing doors and families are struggling, Governor Murphy and the liberal legislature have closed their eyes and ears.
King Murphy’s decision to borrow $9.9 billion from the Federal Government and disguise it as “relief” is nothing more than a political scheme to fill his budget holes that will have long-lasting detrimental impacts on our friends and families.
This is why the NJGOP, alongside the state’s Republican legislative leadership, has filed a lawsuit to stop Murphy’s bonding scheme. Beginning Wednesday, the New Jersey Supreme Court will be hearing our arguments. Our team is ready to stand up for New Jerseyans and put a stop to Murphy’s failed leadership.
Fund The Fight
We know that King Murphy’s recent borrowing boondoggle is unconstitutional, which is why Republicans have joined forces to put a stop to his executive orders and legislative overreach.
Can you chip in $5, $10 or $15 today to help fund our fight and stand up for New Jerseyans?
As a life-long New Jerseyan, I know what this state can be for our families and children. I want New Jersey to be a place that our children can live, unburdened by the debt and mistakes of the liberal leadership in Trenton.
I know this is a big ask, but anything you can give would be appreciated. Will you contribute today to give our team the resources we need to see this lawsuit through and put a stop to Murphy’s failed leadership?
Sincerely,
Doug Steinhardt

Hi Friends,
We hope everyone is preparing for a safe and healthy Memorial Day Weekend.
In case you missed it yesterday, on behalf of shuttered employers and some 1.1 million unemployed workers from around New Jersey, Chairman Doug Steinhardt and the NJGOP have joined forces with a group of small business owners and filed a lawsuit against Governor Phil Murphy and his Administration. Plaintiffs’ claims challenge the Governor for creating arbitrary and capricious classes of employers and employees and enacting and enforcing unconstitutional executive orders that deny millions of New Jerseyans equal protection under the law.
NJGOP Chairman Doug Steinhardt said:
“Governor Murphy has irreparably harmed New Jersey small businesses by arbitrarily declaring some essential and others non-essential. While mom and pop barbers, bars, brew pubs and retail shops are shuttered and struggling, big box stores, with big cash cushions, survive. Governor Murphy has callously covered his ears, closed his eyes, and ignored New Jersey’s cries for honest answers to real problems. The Covid crisis has created challenges for governments everywhere, but forty-nine other states are making progress, while New Jersey flounders. Governor Murphy could be guided by science, but instead hides behind it.""

Stories President Trump Wants You To See
In Michigan Visit, Trump Calls for Americans to Get Back to Work, Expects 'Epic' Comeback
-Detroit Free Press
“Making his first visit to Michigan since the coronavirus pandemic began in the U.S., President Donald Trump on Thursday praised the ingenuity and pluck of Ford Motor Co. and its employees for turning its Ypsilanti components plant into a ventilator factory,” Todd Spangler reports. Ford and GE are jointly producing 50,000 ventilators.
Susan Rice’s Mysterious Email
-The Wall Street Journal
“The larger truth here is now undeniable: The Obama Administration spied on the political competition, it continued that spying even after Mr. Trump was elected, and then it tried to cover up what it had done,” The Wall Street Journal editorial board writes.
Trump is Right to Hold WHO Accountable
-Washington Examiner
“President Trump's effort to hold the World Health Organization accountable for its bungled handling of the coronavirus is well justified. It is outrageous to expect taxpayers to continue supporting an international body that acts as a lap dog for Beijing,” the Washington Examiner editorial board writes.
It’s Okay to Acknowledge Good COVID-19 News
-National Review
“The coronavirus has taken a heartbreaking toll on Americans, but the course of the virus is not the same as it was a few months ago. We are on the other side of the curve. There are encouraging signs all over the country, and no early indications of a reopening debacle,” Rich Lowry writes. “The question now is whether the media and political system can absorb good news on the virus, which is often ignored or buried under misleading storylines.”
Public-Private Partnerships Will Lead Recovery
-The Detroit News
“It took nearly a decade for Michigan’s small businesses to fully recover from the Great Recession of 2008-09. I’m optimistic these vital businesses will bounce back much quicker this time, thanks in large part to the indisputable success of the Paycheck Protection Program,” Small Business Administrator Jovita Carranza writes.

Hi Friends,
We hope everyone is staying safe and healthy.
Nancy Pelosi and the liberal quartet of Andy Kim, Tom Malinowski, Mikie Sherrill and Josh Gottheimer passed a $3 trillion socialist wish list under the guise of sending aid during a pandemic.
The truth is, this messaging bill had very little to do with coronavirus or helping small businesses, the healthcare system or needy New Jersey families.
Not only is this legislation a waste of time as it is dead on arrival in the U.S. Senate, but it contains the following non-related provisions:
* Gives illegal immigrants $1,200 taxpayer-funded checks
* Incentivizes workers not to return to work
* Releases dangerous criminals from prison
* Prevents the deportation of criminal illegal immigrants
New Jersey Republican State Committee Chairman Doug Steinhardt offered the following comment:
“The liberal quartet of Andy Kim, Tom Malinowski, Mikie Sherrill and Josh Gottheimer hits another bad note. Even during New Jersey’s most desperate hours, they put politics over families, small businesses and frontline heroes. These politicians have failed their constituents and NJGOP will certainly remind voters of that this fall.”

# Steinhardt slams Murphy on all-VBM primary plan
Republican State Chairman Doug Steinhardt says that elections conducted exclusively through vote-by-mail ballots has failed and that Gov. Phil Murphy’s decision to hold a predominately all-VBM primary could lead to more incidents of ballot tampering.
“It is critical our citizens have faith in the security and validity of our elections – voter fraud anywhere is a threat to our election’s legitimacy everywhere,” said Steinhardt. “There are concerns around the nation about states choosing to mail ballots to all registered voters, and we’ve seen why right here in New Jersey, just in our handful of municipal elections this week.

Nancy Pelosi’s $3 Trillion Coronavirus ‘Relief’ Bill is Purely a Political Stunt
-New York Post
“House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is happy to play rank politics with the federal coronavirus response,” the New York Post editorial board writes. Exhibit A is the absurd $3 trillion package she unveiled, which is the first major emergency bill written by one party with zero input from the other. “The bill is packed with junk that has nothing to do with the pandemic.”

# Corrado: As State “Revenues Fall Off a Cliff,” Murphy Admin Pays $1.35 Million in Settlements
Senator Kristin Corrado issued the following statement following reports that New Jersey taxpayers will be on the hook for $1.35 million of settlement payments resulting from allegations of wrongdoing by the Murphy Administration.
“At the same time Governor Murphy is warning that State revenues are ‘falling off a cliff’ and begging for a multi-billion dollar federal bailout, he’s making big payments to settle claims of wrongdoing by his administration,” said Corrado (R-40). “His mismanagement of Katie Brennan’s allegations and patronage at the SDA come at a real cost to taxpayers when they can least afford it.”
On May 6, it was reported that the Schools Development Authority agreed to pay $550,000 to a woman who claims she was forced out of her job at the agency after raising alarms about political patronage.
Today, it was announced that a $1 million would be paid to Katie Brennan to settle a lawsuit regarding rape allegations and the administration’s botched response. According to published reports, the State will pay $800,000, with the remainder to be paid by Governor Murphy’s campaign.
Corrado served as vice-chair of the Legislative Select Oversight Committee, which investigated how taxpayer money was being misused by the Administration to make inappropriate and, at times, illegal patronage hires.

MUST READ OF THE DAY
# Republican chairwoman: Donald Trump is working around the clock to keep Americans safe
## The commander in chief has engaged every sector of society in the fight against our shared enemy:
Ronna McDaniel
Opinion contributor
As all Americans are adjusting to the new reality the coronavirus has imposed on our lives, one thing hasn’t changed, and that’s the strong and decisive leadership we have come to know and expect from our commander in chief.
From the outset, President Donald Trump pledged to put the full weight of the federal government behind combating this crisis and protecting the health and safety of our fellow citizens.
And that’s exactly what he has delivered by marshaling a “whole-of-America” approach to meet the challenges this unprecedented moment demands.
It started with President Trump’s decision to restrict travel from China early on. Even as he was implementing these restrictions — a decision that experts like Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, have credited with saving countless lives — Democratic front-runner Joe Biden was accusing him of being xenophobic.
Yet at every step of the way, from partnering with the private sector to working with Congress on a bipartisan relief package, President Trump has engaged every sector of society in the fight against our shared enemy.

Hi Friends,
Please see below for a NJGOP update on COVID-19.
A Message From NJGOP Chairman Doug Steinhardt
We hope everyone is staying healthy during these challenging times, and has a Happy Passover and Holy Week.
This is the Chinese Chernobyl
""The United States is waking up to the national security risk that is American dependence on Chinese pharmaceuticals. New Jersey, meanwhile, is uniquely situated to be a national problem solver. At one time, our pharmaceutical footing was without rival. Today, foreign powers have usurped our role. When we finally turn the corner from this viral pandemic, and we will, our Governor and legislature can make a real difference in our economic security and the security of every American family.""
Read the rest of the op-ed here...
Here's what you need to know today
1\. Governor Murphy Moves Primary Election Date to July 7th. Read more here.
2\. The Trump Administration has launched the Paycheck Protection Program, which will provide nearly $350 billion in loans to small businesses.
* Since its launch last Friday, the Paycheck Protection Program has already authorized tens of billions of dollars in critical loans for small businesses.
* PRESIDENT TRUMP DURING A ROUNDTABLE TODAY: “On Friday, we launched the Paycheck Protection Program to help small businesses keep workers on the payroll. As of today, SBA has processed over $70 billion in guaranteed loans, which is far greater than we would have ever thought at this time…That will provide much-needed relief for the more than a quarter million businesses that have applied for these loans and these numbers will continue to rise quickly.”
3\. Do I have to pay rent during coronavirus crisis? Can I be evicted? Here’s the latest for N.J. renters.
4\. FROM THE WHITE HOUSE: By the Numbers: A Massive Nationwide Response
. Governor Murphy has closed all state and county parks. This move has been met with much opposition.

"Like I told President Trump in the Oval Office... View this email in your browser
Friend,
Like I told President Trump in the Oval Office, I became a Republican because the Democratic Party has become a party led by extreme socialists who are fixated on trying to remove the President from office. Unfortunately, things didn’t change once the coronavirus pandemic hit and we saw yet again just how partisan and petty my former party could be -- even in the face of one of the greatest challenges our nation has ever faced.
That’s why I’m running for re-election as a Republican. I want to keep America great and guarantee A Strong America for future generations, but Nancy Pelosi has put a target on my back and is determined to take back my seat for the Democrats. Will you chip in $10, $25 or even $50 to help me fight back and keep this seat for the NJGOP?
Donate!
A Strong America means strong borders to make sure that our country is safe. It means a strong military so we always have the protection and strength we need.
A Strong America means having a strong supply chain so that we produce and manufacture our own goods - so that we produce and manufacture drugs and prescriptions right here in the United States of America.
Independence is what keeps us strong. Self-reliance is what keeps us going. We cannot rely on other countries, like Communist China, to help us - we must always put America first!
I need your help to get that message of A STRONG AMERICA out - chip in today so we can get our message far and wide:
Chip in $100
Chip in $50
Chip in $20
Chip in $10
There are those that would try to silence us – those who think America is not the greatest country on earth. Donate today so we can continue to fight for A Strong America. I can’t do it alone so please be as generous as you can.

NJGOP: More Regulations And No Support From Murphy
Governor Murphy announced that as of November 5, New Jersey workplaces and small businesses must abide by a glut of new regulations.
“Phil Murphy just might be the least jobs friendly Governor in America,” said NJGOP Chairman Doug Steinhardt. “He’s standing bone dry on a dock watching New Jersey businesses drown. Instead of keeping them afloat with any of the billions in CARES Act cash he’s hoarding, he shoved them under, under the weight of onerous, new regulations. That’s the Phil Murphy we know. More for him, less for you.”

# Republicans laud federal probe into state’s veterans homes
Republicans celebrated a new probe into the state’s handling of COVID-19 in its veteran memorial homes launched by Department of Justice Tuesday.
“It is unfortunate that it has come down to this, that the federal government is looking into the state’s troubling incompetency. At least somebody is listening,” State Sen. Joe Pennacchio (R-Montville). “Along with colleagues in the Senate Republican Caucus, I have been saying all along that the Administration’s lack of transparency was troubling and unacceptable. We now know that they were not forthcoming with federal investigators.

SHOCKING UPDATE
This week, Governor Murphy rolled out the red carpet for prisoners he’s releasing early and gave them a private trip to the MVC to register to vote and get new IDs. It's been four months of hell for anyone trying to use Phil Murphy's MVC, with miles long lines, traffic jams, and people sleeping outside. Today's action is an insult to every single resident of this state, and we'll be sure to return the favor next November.

FIVE STORIES PRESIDENT TRUMP DOESN'T WANT YOU TO MISS
The Economy’s Post-Lockdown Comeback
-The Wall Street Journal
“The U.S. economy grew at a record 33.1% in the third quarter, even after most government transfer payments expired. When politicians lift their lockdowns, and Americans can get on with their prudently cautious lives even in a pandemic, people work, business invests and the economy grows,” The Wall Street Journal editorial board writes.
Why Trump's Health Care Price Transparency Rules Will Reignite America's Economy
-Fox Business
“In a historic win for all Americans on Thursday, President Trump issued a final rule requiring health insurers to post the prices they have negotiated with hospitals, medical facilities, and doctors. Under this rule, health care consumers, including employers sponsoring workplace coverage, can finally know prices before they receive care,” economist and former Reagan adviser Art Laffer writes.
I'm the FDA Point Person on COVID-19 Vaccines. We'll Make Sure They're Safe and Effective.
-USA Today
“With high uptake, COVID-19 vaccines have the potential to save many lives in the United States,” Dr. Peter Marks of the FDA writes. “Therefore, it is critical to be open and transparent about the process that the [FDA] will follow to help make safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines available . . . We pledge to do our duty to the best of our ability, independently and without conflicts of interest.”
Secretary of State Pompeo: America First Foreign Policy Is Succeeding
-Fox News
“An America First foreign policy puts our national interests first, which starts with seeing the world as it is, not as we wish it were,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo writes. “Seeing the world with clear eyes also means recognizing without hesitation who our friends are. America has no greater friend than Israel.”
Trump Is the Greatest President in the Modern Era When It Comes to Shaping the Judiciary
-The Washington Post
“With the Senate’s confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court, President Trump has cemented his legacy as the most important president in the modern era when it comes to shaping the judiciary,” Marc Thiessen of the American Enterprise Institute writes. “Trump has made better judicial choices than any modern Republican president.”

Friend,
For years, New Jersey businesses and families have been burdened by debt racked up by the liberal stranglehold that exists in Trenton. While businesses are closing doors and families are struggling, Governor Murphy and the liberal legislature have closed their eyes and ears.
King Murphy’s decision to borrow $9.9 billion from the Federal Government and disguise it as “relief” is nothing more than a political scheme to fill his budget holes that will have long-lasting detrimental impacts on our friends and families.
This is why the NJGOP, alongside the state’s Republican legislative leadership, has filed a lawsuit to stop Murphy’s bonding scheme. Beginning Wednesday, the New Jersey Supreme Court will be hearing our arguments. Our team is ready to stand up for New Jerseyans and put a stop to Murphy’s failed leadership.
Fund The Fight
We know that King Murphy’s recent borrowing boondoggle is unconstitutional, which is why Republicans have joined forces to put a stop to his executive orders and legislative overreach.
Can you chip in $5, $10 or $15 today to help fund our fight and stand up for New Jerseyans?
As a life-long New Jerseyan, I know what this state can be for our families and children. I want New Jersey to be a place that our children can live, unburdened by the debt and mistakes of the liberal leadership in Trenton.
I know this is a big ask, but anything you can give would be appreciated. Will you contribute today to give our team the resources we need to see this lawsuit through and put a stop to Murphy’s failed leadership?
Sincerely,
Doug Steinhardt
Chairman
NJGOP
PS. I know you’re getting a lot of requests and times are tough. Anything you can give to support our cause will make a big difference. Please consider rushing $3, $5 or $10 today!

Hi Friends,
Earlier this week, Governor Murphy described the NJGOP call for federal election monitoring “ridiculous”, but moments later, Democrat Senator Nia Gill called for an audit due to “the failure of the Governor to properly implement vote-by-mail & to ensure the integrity of our elections.”
NJGOP Chairman Steinhardt:
“Phil Murphy’s failures keep mounting and they are impossible to ignore, even by members of his own party. He forced New Jersey into an ill-advised VBM scheme, and his actions to erode the fundamental precepts of democratic governance go beyond party lines. While the Governor has proven adept at passing out political patronage, parrying press calls, and plain old pandering, he’s proven equally inept at actually governing.”

# NJGOP State Committee Meeting Highlights!
This week, the NJGOP held our quarterly State Committee meeting via Zoom. Here are some highlights:
1\. 📢 We have exceeded yearly targets for growing social media and email list size in under half a year. Tens of thousands of new followers and email subscribers.
2\. 👨‍💻 In spite of the COVID crisis, we've continued to engage with our local GOP clubs and campaigns, conducting four trainings or meetings a week, virtually.
3\. 📱 Our three Digital Days of Action have been hugely successful. Our primary focus was registering new Republicans, and we contacted hundreds of thousands of New Jerseyans through phone calls, text, and social media.
4\. ✍️ We successfully delivered over 10,000 petition signatures for President Trump. We promised the President we'd deliver 10,000 signatures before the Crisis, and even with door to door eliminated, were still able to get it done.
5\. 🔍 We launched Murphy : Exposed, a 14 piece messaging campaign against the Governor's failings, and generated so much attention that our web traffic was at a five year high.
6\. 🏦 Despite the Covid crisis, our fundraising has been incredibly strong. Over half of our donors this year are new supporters of the NJGOP, and we are well ahead of last year overall. We have 66% more donations than this point last year, and have raised 20% more so far this year than at this point last year.
Congratulations to Ginny Haines and Bill Palatucci on their unanimous reelection as RNC Committeewoman and RNC Committeeman! We look forward to them continuing to represent our state well at the RNC for the next four years!

The fifteen members of the Senate Republican caucus sent the following letter (click here for PDF) to Governor Phil Murphy calling for a real wage freeze for State employees to address a multi-billion dollar budget shortfall, calling the administration’s limited efforts to achieve payroll savings “too little and too late.”
The 15 members of the Senate Republican caucus urged to Gov. Murphy to implement a real wage freeze for State employees to address a multi-billion budget shortfall, calling the administration’s limited efforts to achieve payroll savings “too little and too late.”
Dear Governor Murphy,
At a time when you are seeking legislative approval to borrow as much as $14 billion to support spending through the next fiscal year, our caucus remains concerned by the extremely limited nature of the steps your administration has taken to cut costs as necessitated by the public health emergency.
For months, the Legislature and our caucus have offered solutions that could help close revenue shortfalls, protect the financial well-being of State employees while producing significant payroll savings, and support the ability of private sector employers to survive the lockdown and safely reopen to boost the New Jersey economy and the State’s tax revenues. Inexplicably, your administration has repeatedly declined the bipartisan outreach of the Legislature to work in a collaborative and transparent fashion. Instead, the unilateral actions you have taken have repeatedly been too little and too late.
For example, after you refused calls for more than a month to take action on proposed payroll savings, the Legislature approved a bill (S-2350/A-4132) in mid-May allowing the State to more easily and quickly furlough public workers, while protecting them from pension impacts. Many of those employees, forced to stay home and unable to perform their regular job duties due to COVID-19, have been paid their full salaries since the beginning of this crisis at taxpayer expense. While we hoped our legislation would have prompted you to act responsibly, the bill has sat on your desk untouched and unsigned for six weeks. Had you signed the bill into law and implemented furloughs immediately, the State could have taken greater advantage of generous federal unemployment benefits that would have paid more to most furloughed employees than they were making during that time by remaining on the State payroll while at home and not working.
Instead, a week after we sent the comprehensive furlough bill to your desk, you announced a voluntary furlough program. We have seen no evidence this program has been utilized to any extent or that it has produced any notable savings. This approach was clearly too little.
Two days ago, you announced a preliminary agreement with the Communications Workers of America (CWA), the state’s largest public employee union, that includes a limited furlough program. By not implementing broad furloughs months ago when much of New Jersey, including most government offices, were shut down, the opportunity to achieve savings has been greatly diminished. Further, the additional $600 of weekly Pandemic Unemployment Compensation appropriated through the federal CARES Act is set to expire before the end of July, leaving workers who are furloughed after that date with far less financial support than if furloughs had been implemented earlier, as urged by the Legislature. According to the CWA, the number of furlough days has been limited to 10 days to allow those days to be scheduled prior to the expiration of the additional federal benefit. For those reasons, your announcement is clearly too late.
Additionally, we are concerned that you have failed to implement a simple wage freeze for State employees given the scale of the budget shortfall cited by the administration. We note that former Governor Corzine sought a pay freeze in 2009 when the State’s financial crisis was far less severe. At the time, his proposal estimated savings of more than $200 million.
Instead, the preliminary agreement you announced with the CWA simply defers planned cost of living adjustments (COLA) for wages until later next year. This agreement is so weak that the CWA is advising its members, “By the end of the contract, you will get every raise promised. We have not given up any raises.” Despite the upcoming 2% COLA being deferred for CWA members, it does not appear the administration has made any effort to freeze the regular step increases provided to most State employees, which result in annual pay raises of approximately 4% on the anniversary date of an employee’s hiring. In a regular year, the COLA and step increase combine to provide most State workers with a 6% pay raise. As a result of the agreement you negotiated, some State workers will simply have their pay increases trimmed slightly from 6% to 4% over the next 12 months, far from a real wage freeze. In fact, those workers will now get 8% pay raises in FY 2022, including two COLAs and a step increase, under this agreement. When you have failed to take reasonable steps that even Governor Corzine would have taken, it again appears you have done too little.
Had step increases been frozen in March, you could have prevented the 4% pay increases that a quarter of State employees received over the last three months on their hire dates, which the State could ill afford. Absent an announcement that step increases will be frozen going forward, the cost will compound over the next year when those employees and others receive their next increase and another 4% raise. Given the lack of action on this front by the administration, we can’t even say you are too late.
For an administration that has made “fairness” a guiding principle, it hardly seems fair to dole out massive pay raises to public employees when the taxpayers who pay the bills continue to suffer under the lingering effects of lockdown orders on private sector employers. Those raises don’t seem fair when you have simultaneously threatened to cut funding for the Senior Freeze and Homestead Benefit property tax relief programs that many middle-class and elderly residents rely upon to afford living in their homes.
By delaying and avoiding action to achieve payroll savings, the administration continues to dig the State budget into a deeper hole. We advise you to stop digging, and we urge you to implement a real wage freeze that is justified given the situation.

Hi Friends,
Please see below for a NJGOP update on COVID-19.
A Message From NJGOP Chairman Doug Steinhardt
As we emerge from one crisis, I appeal to Governor Murphy not to plunge us deeper into another one. The telltale signs of a state economic collapse are here and we need our Democratic leaders to reject their reflex to plug budget holes with big loans and bigger tax increases.
Yesterday, Governor Murphy laid out his 'Road Back to Economic Health' which was long, winding and nothing new: reduce COVID cases, test, trace, & isolate. Economically, it boils down to this: appoint a commission to study our problems and go to the Fed and beg for money. Insider politicians suggest commissions, studies and talk. What New Jersey needs right now is leaders to lead. Revenue projections are down. There are one million unemployed New Jerseyans waiting for jobs, benefits and answers. Families are starving and businesses are shuttered. Instead of data, dates or answers from the Governor, Treasurer or Commissioner of Labor, we got a campaign speech for embattled Congressman Tom Malinowski, who left half his congressional district's local governments with no first round stimulus money.
The NJGOP message is simple and clear: no new taxes. Our children couldn't afford to start their lives here, and our parents and grandparents couldn't afford to retire here, even before this pandemic started. Decades of liberal taxing and spending came home to roost and they’re tearing New Jersey families apart.
Now we need discipline. Governor Murphy should channel New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, exercise economic restraint, and consider real economic relief in the form of:
Tax holidays that increase taxpayers’ available cash, not tax increases that reduce it.
Updating outdated school funding formulas and antiquated COAH requirements.
Helping the nearly one million unemployed New Jerseyans who need benefits, jobs and answers.
Improving our worst-in-the-nation tax climate through tax-cutting policies that make New Jersey more affordable, not less.
Streamlining approvals and cutting red tape to keep businesses open and people working.
Repurposing our profit centers and investing in ourselves and our businesses.

Here's what you need to know today
Yesterday, President Trump took historic action to meet our Nation’s testing needs by unveiling the Opening Up America Again Testing Overview and Testing Blueprint. These tools will aid states in safely reopening and provide the American people with the confidence they need to resume their daily lives.
Additionally, the U.S. Small Business Administration resumed accepting Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) applications today.
* As of 3:30 pm EDT yesterday, SBA had processed more than 100,000 PPP loans submitted by more than 4,000 lenders.
* Top-line Overview of PPP
* SBA Paycheck Protection Program Loan Report
# US Passes South Korea in Virus Testing as Trump Unveils Expanded Effort
“The United States has passed South Korea, considered the gold standard by the media, in testing for the coronavirus, and, in hot spots like New York City, has done several times more per capita than the Asian nation,” Paul Bedard reports for the Washington Examiner.
Over 5 million tests have been conducted in America to date, thanks to close partnership between the Trump Administration and the private sector. Click here to read more.
“The president’s all-of-America approach has meant federal agencies working hand in hand with state and local governments to slow the virus’ spread. The president will use that same approach to take the next step: protecting Americans while we open our country again,” Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar writes in USA Today.
The Trump Administration has “announced an unprecedented regulatory relief package to equip the American health care system with maximum flexibility to care for COVID-19 patients . . . The strategy essentially reimagines what constitutes a hospital for the duration of the emergency,” CMS Administrator Seema Verma writes for Fox Business.

# GOP: Don’t let Murphy raise your taxes and borrow billions
By NJGOP Chairman Doug Steinhardt
Almost one year ago, Moody’s Investor Service published a report that warned New Jersey is the least prepared state in America to handle a recession. They specifically cited small cash reserves and our enormous pension liability as the main reasons for our vulnerability. Then, this week, amid the economic fallout of the coronavirus, Moody’s lowered New Jersey’s outlook to “negative” and warned “significantly reduced liquidity levels"" and increased cash-flow borrowing could spur a credit downgrade. Sadly, New Jerseyans are accustomed to bleak outlooks of our state’s economic forecast. However, it is avoidable.

Here's what you need to know today
1\. Small businesses and New Jersey workers have struggled to stay afloat while Andy Kim, Tom Malinowski, Mikie Sherrill, Josh Gottheimer and Nancy Pelosi stalled critical aid for political leverage in Washington. New Jersey has had enough! Pass the Paycheck Protection Program’s replenishment!
Voters have had enough, and new data from a statewide poll released today by Monmouth University proves it.
Polling in all four of the districts occupied by the liberal quartet of Andy Kim, Tom Malinowski, Mikie Sherrill, and Josh Gottheimer shows Republicans have a 46%-45% lead.
At the same point in the five competitive districts, when Democrats were seeking to flip four House seats and re-elect Gottheimer to a second term, they had a 7-point lead, 49%-42%.
2\. “Thirty-four nurses from Colorado landed at Newark Airport on Tuesday afternoon and after a short prayer service headed off to three New Jersey hospitals hit hard by the coronavirus to lend a hand. The nurses, from Centura Health System, part of Catholic Health Initiatives, agreed to travel to New Jersey after its president, Peter Banko, received an appeal from his counterparts in the state,” Matt Fagan reports for [[URL REDACTED]]
3\. President Trump signed a proclamation yesterday temporarily suspending immigration into the United States, a response to the economic crisis caused by the Coronavirus. The President said this action ""will ensure that unemployed Americans of all backgrounds will be first in line for jobs as our economy reopens.” Read more from Barbara Sprunt in NPR.
4\. “Harvard University said it will not take the $8.6 million in aid [that] was granted as part of the U.S. government’s efforts to cushion the economic impact of the coronavirus lockdown, reversing itself and bending to U.S. President Donald Trump who said Tuesday that the university should not take the money,” John Carney reports for Breitbart.

"Our volunteers are working overtime to find and register Republicans in New Jersey... View this email in your browser
Friend,
We're on the hunt to close the gap.
Our team of volunteers across the state are working around the clock to find and register Republican voters, conduct volunteer trainings and build momentum heading into November's elections and they need your support.
Late last month, we held our first Digital Day of Action where our volunteers:
* Reached nearly 20,000 unregistered conservatives via text and phone call
* Submitted letters to the editor to outlets around the state
* Shared Republican content hundreds of times on social media
* Increased Facebook reach 936% and increased facebook engagement over 2,000%
But we can't stop now. It takes resources from our best supporters to help our volunteers as they out-organize and out-work the Democrats. Our volunteers are preparing for another Digital Day of Action and they need your support.
Can you give $5, $15, $25 or $40 to support our volunteers as we continue working to find and register Republicans?

Hi Friends,
This week Governor Murphy announced an all vote by mail general election for November.
In reaction to this news, NJGOP Chairman Doug Steinhardt released the following statement:
“The Governor’s Executive Order on vote by mail is characteristically weak and ineffective. It fails to address the glaring issues that surfaced in Paterson or July’s primary, like voters receiving multiple ballots, human error, outdated voter rolls, and fraud.
“The NJGOP will not sit idly while Phil Murphy tramples Americans’ most fundamental right: voting. If casinos can open for in person gambling and illegal immigrants can stand in line for driver licenses, New Jersey voters can vote in person. Every option is on the table and we are actively pursuing all of them.”

# Steinhardt wants 4th presidential debate — in New Jersey
GOP State Chairman Doug Steinhardt wants a fourth presidential debate to be held in New Jersey, where voters will begin casting ballots ten days before the first debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden is held.
“The truth is, Joe Biden has avoided public scrutiny and the press since becoming the nominee,” Steinhardt said. “Vote by mail voters deserve to see for themselves that he is unfit for the Presidency.”
Trump has been seeking a fourth debate.

# NJ can borrow, with limits, nearly $10 billion for coronavirus, state Supreme Court rules
Doug Steinhardt, chairman of the New Jersey Republican Party, reacted to the decision by suggesting that the justices — Democrats, Republicans and one unaffiliated voter — ""are firmly in the grasp of the Democrat Party.""
""The only way to put an end to out of control spending is to send more Republicans to Trenton. While the State’s Democratic Supreme Court today took a partisan swipe at a common-sense spending issue, the New Jersey Republican Party was compelled to file it and isn’t dissuaded by the result,"" Steinhardt said in a statement. ""It was expected. Instead, it motivates us, as it should every New Jersey Republican, to get to work digging out Democrats who supported this $10 billion borrowing boondoggle.""

FIVE STORIES PRESIDENT TRUMP DOESN'T WANT YOU TO MISS
Israel-UAE Agreement Shows Trump’s Middle East Policy Succeeding
-Fox News
“Thursday’s announcement of a ‘historic peace agreement’ between Israel and the United Arab Emirates—the first deal to normalize relations between Israel and an Arab nation brokered by the U.S. in over a quarter-century—is more evidence that President Trump is the first president in a long time to get U.S. Middle East policy more right than wrong,” writes James Jay Carafano, a foreign policy expert at the Heritage Foundation.
Governors Can’t Use Coronavirus to Indefinitely Declare a State of Emergency
-The Federalist
“In a moment of national panic, Americans permitted their state and local executives to take power—to declare states of emergency and to implement lockdowns—and now those executives won’t give that power back,” Molly McCann writes. “Our current quandary is that governors are using COVID as an excuse to extend their authority indefinitely.”
Trump Is Giving Schools Tools to Reopen, and They Must Do So for Children's Sake
-Washington Examiner
“For our children's sake, we must reopen schools for in-person learning. President Trump’s new ‘Kids First’ plan will help enable school districts to do just that,” Kevin Roberts writes. Leading voices, such as the American Academy of Pediatrics, “are coming together in agreement: These indefinite school closures are hurting our children.”
It's Time to Hire American
-RealClearPolicy
“President Trump recently suspended the entry of some guest workers into the United States. And he ordered federal officials to stop issuing green cards for the rest of the year, with limited exceptions. These are bold first steps towards halting the massive, harmful influx of foreign labor into the United States”—especially important to get more Americans back to work as we reopen from the pandemic, Marie Larson writes.
Now There's No Denying It: Obama's FBI Spied On Trump... Period
-Townhall
News broke today that former FBI lawyer Kevin Clinesmith is expected to plead guilty to falsifying documents as part of the FBI’s surveillance of the Trump campaign in 2016. “If you are conducting surveillance that is not authorized and, in fact, you lied to get the authorization . . . You are spying,” Larry O’Connor writes.

Phil Murphy is at it again. After announcing that unemployment is up 12% from March to 15.3% in April, Murphy and his administration have started pushing for a multi-billion dollar borrowing scheme.
Murphy's Administration would clearly rather mortgage our state's future than make needed budget cuts, reduce spending and spare New Jersey taxpayers. It's time to put a stop to Murphy's special interest favors.

## Governor Phil Murphy’s gross overreach of power and blatant abuse of Executive Orders has been clear since the start of the COVID Crisis, but he’s gone too far this time. While our team has joined forces with President Trump and the Republican National Committee to fight for our right to vote at the polls, this election is too important to leave to chance.
##
## If the Court does not rule in our favor, we must fight back with our voices and our votes.
##
## While Vote-By-Mail is not our first choice, we may have no other option. Today we are launching [[URL REDACTED]] which will be a central hub of information for how to cast your vote under this system.

If you didn't see, the NJGOP took our two northern-most Democrat congressmen, Gottheimer and Malinowski to task for shorting their congressional districts of federal COVID-19 relief funding. We are pleased to see that this motivated Congressman Gottheimer to get out and fight harder for the people of Warren and Sussex counties."" - Chairman Doug Steinhardt

NJGOP Calls For Nursing Home Death Transparency
Following the crushing story of a Marine veteran who passed away from COVID in a state run nursing home in New Jersey, the leaders of a state run veterans home in Massachusetts being indicted on criminal charges , and the federal investigation into the Murphy Administration, the NJGOP is calling for more transparency:
“New Jersey families need to know that they are safe from Governor Murphy’s policies,” said Chairman Steinhardt. “The state run nursing and veterans home COVID deaths are a despicable tragedy. The fastest way for us to heal and or have any confidence that our loved ones are safe, is for Governor Murphy to start being honest with his constituents. The NJGOP is calling for a full and immediate disclosure of the Murphy Administration’s communications with all state run veterans and nursing homes.”

# Bucco to Governor: It’s Time to Drop the Puck and Let Youth Hockey Games Resume
Governor Murphy’s executive orders have placed youth and amateur hockey games on ice since the pandemic began, and Senator Anthony M. Bucco said it’s time to take another look at restrictions that are having a devastating effect on the sport and the ice rinks that depend on it.
“Hockey is a popular participation sport in New Jersey, and the players have been more than patient with guidelines intended to keep everybody safe,” said Bucco. “But with the resumption of so many other sports, it is starting to feel like hockey has been stuck in the penalty box. We are in a position now where we have the knowledge and precautions that will allow the return to safe competition.”
USA Hockey, the national governing body for the sport in the United States, reasons the risk of contracting COVID while playing hockey is minimal. The organization published detailed guidance for rink owners, leagues, teams and parents, including a series of resources for safely returning to rinks and mitigating risks.
“Hockey should not be perceived as having any more COVID risk than other similarly classified sports like volleyball, lacrosse, soccer, softball and baseball, and they have all been cleared to resume games,” said Bucco. “The state should capitalize on USA Hockey’s extensive experience and broad influence to confidently allow live competition to resume with appropriate precautions in place.”
In July, Governor Murphy issued an executive order allowing the resumption of outdoor practices and games for medium-risk sports, and non-contact practices in indoor settings.
“The state’s guidelines fail to consider the unique characteristics of hockey and the controlled environments of the ice rinks,” Bucco noted. “Hockey facilities are designed to maintain appropriate ice conditions, with outstanding ventilation systems and air circulation. The conditions are not that different than being outside. In addition, players are covered from head to toe with protective equipment, and the games take place on a large playing surface.
“These are unique circumstances and they must be taken into consideration by the Governor,” said Bucco. “The administration should take another look at how the COVID rules apply to hockey. If they do, they will realize it is safe to resume competition.”
# Van Drew Offers to Match State Troopers’ Reward for Intel Re. Monument Desecration
Locked in a dogfight for his congressional seat, U.S. Rep. Jeff Van Drew (R-2) today told InsiderNJ he would match the $5,000 reward offered by the State Troopers Fraternal Association for information leading to the arrest of whoever desecrated Trooper Bertram T. Zimmerman’s memorial.
“I know the Zimmerman family and was at the dedication of this very memorial which was in part the work of a local Eagle Scout,” said Van Drew. “It’s just around the corner from where I live and serves as a constant reminder to all of us who pass by that our brave men and women in law enforcement, particularly those like Trooper Zimmerman who made the ultimate sacrifice don’t deserve to be demeaned, diminished, or defunded.
“The Defund the Police movement has no place in South Jersey and I am willing to match the $5,000 reward being offered by the State Troopers Fraternal Association, the State Troopers Non-Commissioned Officers Association, and the State Troopers Superior Officers Association for information leading the arrest and conviction of those responsible,” the congressman added.
Yesterday, the roadside memorial in honor of Trooper Bertram T. Zimmerman, III, located on State Highway 83, in Dennis Township, Cape May County, sustained a savage desecration and vandalization by “a cowardly vandal or group of vandals,” according to the New Jersey State police.
Trooper Zimmerman served with the New Jersey State Police with honor and distinction and was assigned to a special task force in 2004, in response to a string of armed robberies of convenience stores in the Dennis Township area. Trooper Zimmerman, in his brave response to a robbery call made the ultimate sacrifice after his troop car struck a utility pole on State Highway 83.
The three state police unions, the State Troopers Fraternal Association, the State Troopers Non-Commissioned Officers Association, and the State Troopers Superior Officers Association stated jointly that the disrespect or degradation of our state troopers and all men and women who serve in law enforcement will not be tolerated.
“The State Troopers Fraternal Association, the State Troopers Non-Commissioned Officers Association, and the State Troopers Superior Officers Association are offering a reward of $5000.00 for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the classless actors who perpetrated this heinous crime,” the officers said.

FIVE STORIES PRESIDENT TRUMP DOESN'T WANT YOU TO MISS
Thousands of Health Experts Sign Declaration Calling for End to Lockdown, Warn of ‘Irreparable Damage’
-The Daily Wire
“Thousands of medical and public health experts have signed on to a declaration calling for an end to lockdown policies in favor of a more targeted approach to combatting the coronavirus pandemic,” Tim Pearce writes. “As infectious disease epidemiologists and public health scientists we have grave concerns about the damaging physical and mental health impacts of the prevailing COVID-19 policies,” the declaration states.
Return Respect to Nomination Process
-Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette
“We should not allow the toxic politics of recent Supreme Court nominations to turn this nomination into a partisan circus. Judge Barrett and our country deserve a fair and respectful hearing,” Arkansas Lt. Governor Tim Griffin writes. “In a less polarized time, a nominee as eminently qualified as Judge Barrett would receive a nearly unanimous vote for confirmation.”
Schools Aren’t Super-Spreaders
-The Atlantic
Across the United States, “fear and bad press slowed down or canceled school reopenings,” Brown University economist Emily Oster writes. “It’s now October. We are starting to get an evidence-based picture of how school reopenings and remote learning are going . . . Schools do not, in fact, appear to be a major spreader of COVID-19.”
In Afghanistan, As We Enter Our 20th Year, It's Time to Come Home
-Fox News
“As someone who volunteered for service, fought in Afghanistan, and watched good friends give their lives for the mission there, it’s difficult to accept that 19 years hasn’t been enough. As President Donald Trump signaled on Twitter on Wednesday American involvement in the Afghan conflict should end, our service members should come back to their families, and our country should move forward,” Nate Anderson writes.
National Association of Scholars Calls for Revoking the 1619 Project Pulitzer Prize
-The Federalist
“An impressive array of academics associated with the National Association of Scholars signed a letter to the Pulitzer Prize Board calling for it to revoke the prize it ceremoniously awarded to Nikole Hannah-Jones this year for her lead essay in The New York Times’ deeply troubled and historically challenged 1619 Project,” Glenn Stanton writes. “Hannah-Jones and the Times secretly deleted the most fundamental claim of her lead essay for the project: that slavery was the central reason for our nation’s founding.”

"Did you see Rep. Jeff Van Drew's email?
Friend,
Did you see Congressman Van Drew's recent email? While this pandemic plagues our state and nation, we need leadership that is willing to stand up again Nancy Pelosi and her socialist Democrats in Washington to fight for our families.
Throughout this crisis, few things have become abundantly clear. One of those is that family is worth fighting for.
I'm encouraged by Congressman Jeff Van Drew's platform to fight to keep America great and guarantee A Strong America for our New Jersey family. We need the leadership of Rep. Jeff Van Drew in Washington. Can you chip in today to help the fight for A Strong America?

Hi Friend,
Like I told President Trump in the Oval Office, I became a Republican because the Democratic Party has become a party led by extreme socialists who are fixated on trying to remove the President from office. Unfortunately, things didn’t change once the coronavirus pandemic hit and we saw yet again just how partisan and petty my former party could be -- even in the face of one of the greatest challenges our nation has ever faced.
That’s why I’m running for re-election as a Republican. I want to keep America great and guarantee A Strong America for future generations, but Nancy Pelosi has put a target on my back and is determined to take back my seat for the Democrats. Will you chip in $10, $25 or even $50 to help me fight back and keep this seat for the NJGOP?
Donate!
A Strong America means strong borders to make sure that our country is safe. It means a strong military so we always have the protection and strength we need.
A Strong America means having a strong supply chain so that we produce and manufacture our own goods - so that we produce and manufacture drugs and prescriptions right here in the United States of America.
Independence is what keeps us strong. Self-reliance is what keeps us going. We cannot rely on other countries, like Communist China, to help us - we must always put America first!
I need your help to get that message of A STRONG AMERICA out - chip in today so we can get our message far and wide:
Chip in $100
Chip in $50
Chip in $20
Chip in $10
There are those that would try to silence us – those who think America is not the greatest country on earth. Donate today so we can continue to fight for A Strong America. I can’t do it alone so please be as generous as you can.

Friend,
Nancy Pelosi and New Jersey's liberal quartet, Andy Kim, Tom Malinowski, Mikie Sherrill and Josh Gottheimer, are at it again. Just last week they passed a $3 trillion bill full of wasteful spending for their liberal agenda, including:
* Giving illegal immigrants $1,200 taxpayer-funded checks
* Incentivizing workers not to return to work
* Releasing dangerous criminals from prison
* Preventing the deportation of criminal illegal immigrants
They must be stopped. Can you donate $5, $10, $35 or $50 to stop Nancy Pelosi and New Jersey's liberal quartet?
Stop Nancy Pelosi!
Once again, Kim, Malinowski, Sherrill, and Gottheimer are siding with Nancy Pelosi and putting the interests of illegal immigrants before those of hard-working New Jersey families.
Can you help us stop Nancy Pelosi and New Jersey's liberal quartet?
>> Donate $35
>> Donate $20

>> Donate $10
They must be held accountable and defeated this fall! Donate today to stop Nancy Pelosi and the liberal quartet!

Hi Friends,
After several formal requests by the NJGOP (Steinhardt asks Justice Department to probe administration’s handling of long-term care facilities, FEMA funds and Steinhardt seeks probe of long-term facility deaths), the DOJ has begun the first phase of an investigation into the actions of the Murphy Administration that led to the deaths of over 7,000 seniors and veterans in New Jersey’s long term care facilities.
“The Murphy Administration turned veteran and senior homes into death traps by sending Covid-positive patients into these facilities against CDC guidance, and the families of the more than 7,000 victims deserve justice,” said NJGOP Chairman Doug Steinhardt. “Thank you to the Department of Justice for hearing New Jersey’s cries for help.”
# NJGOP In The News
Republicans said the governor’s budget plan relied too much on tax increases and borrowing. Doug Steinhardt, chairman of the New Jersey Republican Party, also said it was inappropriate for the state to make the record $4.9 billion pension payment without asking public-sector unions to make sacrifices related to their state-funded retirement plans.
“In the middle of a pandemic, where every New Jersey household and small business has sacrificed, made tough choices, and scaled back its spending, Phil Murphy’s appetite to spend your money is growing,” said Mr. Steinhardt.
🇺🇸Congratulations President Trump!🇺🇸
NJGOP Chairman Doug Steinhardt released the following statement regarding Donald J. Trump’s acceptance of the Republican party’s nomination for President:
“The GOP convention has been a celebration of American greatness and an optimistic view of our nation’s potential. President Trump has clearly outlined his plan to fight for this country and in turn we are celebrating his leadership and commitment to the American people.
“Trump is the ultimate check and balance on the insane spending being pushed by Democrats leaders like Phil Murphy. This November, we have a clear choice: continue our Great American Comeback or go down the Joe Biden and the radical Democrats’ road of liberal policies that will bankrupt New Jersey.”

# Pennacchio & Bucco Introduce Legislation Protecting Veterans’ and Nursing Home Residents
Senator Joe Pennacchio and Senator Anthony M. Bucco have introduced legislation to ensure seniors living in veterans and nursing facilities would no longer be subject to the inhumane conditions known to exist in the homes during the pandemic. The measure sets testing and visitation requirements and employment restrictions in response to the COVID outbreak.
Senator Pennacchio and Senator Bucco have introduced legislation to ensure seniors living in veterans and nursing facilities would no longer be subject to the inhumane conditions known to exist in the homes during the pandemic. ([[URL REDACTED]])
“These are the most vulnerable members of our society, and they have the right to expect responsive, respectful and caring treatment and safe living conditions,” said Pennacchio (R-26). “The reality hasn’t met those expectations, and as a result, 7,000 souls died in the state’s care. This bill will help address issues that contributed to the loss of life. These changes are crucial to protecting residents now during the pandemic.”
The bill (S-2897) establishes requirements for procedures and visitation at long-term care facilities, including mandating all staff of the facilities to be tested for active infection at least once each week, and as soon as they present symptoms of the coronavirus.
“Nursing home residents and staff were recklessly exposed to the virus as it spread from person to person inside the facilities,” said Bucco (R-25). “Consistent monitoring will help contain infection, keep residents healthy, and save lives. It must be standard procedure. The lives of health-fragile seniors depend on it.”
Under the bill, visitors will be allowed inside facilities once per day for visits within the resident’s room or a designated visitation area if there is more than one resident in the room. Visitors must be screened for signs of COVID, and protocols must be in place to ensure visitors have as little contact as possible with staff and other residents.
“It is impossible to fathom the fear residents must have suffered in the hopeless isolation of facilities lacking the tools and the expertise to contain the virus or treat acute illness behind the walls,” said Pennacchio. “Their terror was only magnified by the ban on visitors that left them alone and forgotten. Homes can maintain safety without withholding personal contact from patients.”
The inability to visit residents also took a toll on families, said Bucco.
“This issue is personal for me. My family currently has a loved one in a long-term care facility,” Bucco noted. “I can tell you first hand that there is a significant impact on families who are unable to see and interact with their loved ones. The helplessness and isolation is unnecessary, and the legislation will eliminate it.”
In addition, any employee or contractor at a facility who tests positive for the virus will be required to self-quarantine at home until symptoms pass and a negative test is confirm.
This bill is designated as Sally’s Law, in memory of Sally Griscavage Florek, a resident who was infected by the virus at a nursing home and died before what would have been her 100th birthday on August 1. After a fall she was transported to the hospital for treatment and was released back to the nursing home, where she eventually succumbed to COVID-19.
“My mother died on April 15 and COVID was listed as cause of death,” said Phyllis Florek. “Dozens of residents died in her facility. My prayer is that a thorough investigation of the causes of this human tragedy be conducted resulting in significant changes in the delivery of care in facilities. Her death and that of others should not be in vain.”

VIDEO OF THE DAY: President Trump welcomes 5 new American Citizens!
President Trump joined Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf yesterday as five new American Citizens took the Oath of Allegiance to the United States during a naturalization ceremony at the White House.
“Today, America rejoices as we welcome five absolutely incredible new members into our great American family,” President Trump said.
“You are now fellow citizens of the greatest nation on the face of God’s Earth.”
Hailing from Bolivia, Lebanon, India, Sudan, and Ghana, these five new Americans have embraced our country’s values and laws. They’ll contribute both as citizens and as participants in the great American economy. The group includes a small business owner, a teacher, a software developer, a veterinarian, and a medical worker.
President Trump believes in an immigration system that is pro-American, pro-immigrant, and pro-worker. By restoring the rule of law, fairness, and security at our border, our leaders in Washington can protect the safety and prosperity of all Americans while helping our new citizens assimilate and flourish.
Last year, President Trump proposed moving America to a merit-based immigration system that would accomplish just that. “Our plan includes a sweeping modernization of our dysfunctional legal immigration process,” President Trump said. “The system will finally be fair, transparent, and promote equality and opportunity for all.”
Despite inaction from Congress, America’s immigration system continues to make strides under President Trump. Historic agreements with Mexico and other countries are making the border safer for legal immigrants and protecting citizens all across our country.
Thanks to President Trump and thousands of brave law enforcement officers who make the system work each day, all Americans—including millions of devoted legal immigrants—have an opportunity to achieve the American Dream for their families.
FIVE STORIES PRESIDENT TRUMP DOESN'T WANT YOU TO MISS
You Can’t Handle Rioting Radicals Like University Unrest
-New York Post
“Since the 1960s, campus leaders have perfected a script. Student activists can take over administrative offices or the library. These violations are tolerated, as long as not too much is disrupted . . . In recent months, we have seen this script applied to city streets, where the costs are higher than having to bite your lip as inflamed 19-year-olds berate you,” R.R. Reno writes.
Justice Department Asks New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania for COVID Data on Nursing Home Deaths
-Just the News
“The Justice Department on Wednesday requested COVID-19 data from four states it says required nursing homes to accept residents infected with the coronavirus, policies that may have rendered elderly Americans ‘unnecessarily put at risk’ . . . [and] ‘which may have resulted in the deaths of thousands of elderly nursing home residents,’” Daniel Payne reports.
Trump Plan Would Cure School Re-Opening Chaos
-RealClearPolitics
“From Los Angeles to New York, and many stops in between, America’s public school teachers’ unions have demanded that schools remain physically closed, that police forces be defunded, and that unrealistic COVID-testing policies be implemented . . . These unions do not seem to care that it is the most disadvantaged students in our nation who will be most negatively affected by their decisions,” Kevin Nicholson writes.
Enough Is Enough: Trump Gave Veterans Real and Permanent Choice
-The Hill
“It’s been more than a year since President Trump ushered in the greatest improvement to veteran health care since World War II, and the media still refuse to credit him with this accomplishment. Reporters are playing word games instead of reporting the facts, and are failing to tell the public what millions of veterans know: the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has never worked better,” VA Secretary Robert Wilkie writes.
White House Announces $750M Deal for Abbott Labs' COVID-19 Rapid Test
-Fox Business
“The White House has announced a $750 million deal with Abbott Laboratories Thursday to buy 150 million of its new rapid coronavirus tests,” Lucas Manfredi writes. This major development in testing will save lives by further protecting America’s most vulnerable and will allow our country to get more Americans safely back to work and school.

"Chairman Steinhardt just announced that he's joining forces with businesses across New Jersey to sue Governor Murphy.  View this email in your browser
Friend,
I hope you've seen the news. Chairman Steinhardt and the NJGOP team are joining forces with New Jersey's mom and pop barber shops, bars, restaurants and businesses across the state to file a lawsuit against Governor Murphy.
We don't have to tell you, Governor Murphy has irreparably harmed our state, our home, by arbitrarily declaring some businesses, workers, and individuals essential and others non-essential.
This has to stop. Families and businesses across New Jersey are struggling. The livelihood of our state is at risk.
We have the team in place, but we need your help to fund this legal effort. Can you chip in a few dollars to help our efforts?
Join Our Fight!
Governor Murphy is causing irreparable harm to our friends, families and neighbors. We have the team to stop him, now we just need the resources.
Can you give $5, $15 or $30 today to put a stop to Murphy's reckless leadership?
Chairman Steinhardt has said it best, we want a New Jersey that our children can afford to return to, a place for them to build a family and raise their own children. Under Murphy's leadership, that New Jersey is getting harder and harder to imagine.
You've asked and we've heard you. I hope you'll join us in standing up for New Jersey families and businesses.

Hi Friends,
This week, in a near party line vote, Democrats pushed through an unconstitutional borrowing scheme with a price tag in the tens of billions of dollars. New Jersey’s courts have consistently held that it is unconstitutional to bond for general operating expenses.
NJGOP, Senate and Assembly Republicans are united against this scheme and upon Governor Murphy’s signature will file suit in superior court to halt it.
NJGOP Chairman Steinhardt, Assembly Republican Leader Bramnick, and Senator Oroho jointly released the following statement:
“For too long, this state has been burdened with debt racked up by politicians without the courage to solve the problems with which the next generation of New Jerseyans will be saddled. Governor Murphy and his Democrat co-conspirators recklessly chose the short term sugar high of more borrowing and debt over the long term interests of New Jersey and its residents.”
“The bill passed today is unconstitutional. It’s bad policy. It is the result of giving in to special interests instead of standing up for families, businesses, and overburdened taxpayers. The responsible path forward is clear: lower taxes, fiscal restraint, government reform, and re-examination of spending priorities, but Democrat Trenton is an economic echo chamber. New Jersey has “America’s worst fiscal health” according to US News and World Report, and Governor Murphy and the Democrat legislators responsible for this scheme have piled on an added $10 billion in debt, untold billions in debt service, and an estimated half billion dollars in legal, accounting and professional fees. With the doors to the Democrat controlled state house closed, New Jersey Republicans are taking their appeal for economic common sense to the court house.”

Bucco Blasts Borrowing Bill as Premature, Excessive, Unconstitutional
Senator Anthony M. Bucco today implored the Legislature and the Governor “don’t mortgage our future in a state that is already overburdened in debt” moments before the Senate passed a bill authorizing almost $10 billion in debt with no voter approval.
The bill (S-2697/A-4175) authorizes a borrowing scheme coveted by Governor Murphy to fill holes in the budget that Republicans said will cost taxpayers tens of billions of dollars in fees and interest they will be paying back for almost four decades.
“Don’t take the easy way out,” Bucco told the Senate. “This is not a plan, it’s the easy way out. We’re not waiting to address this problem in a logical fashion, taking now-outdated projections based on difficult times and using that to justify massive borrowing to repair the budget. This will place the state in even worse condition for years to come.”
Bucco called the borrowing premature, excessive and violates the state constitution “that is not above any of our pay grades and all of us took an oath to uphold.”
“No one would argue the 2021 budget isn’t going to be a challenge,” Senator Bucco said. “The State has enacted changes that balance the budget until September 30, and the Governor’s own treasurer tells us there will be a surplus of close to a billion dollars at its close. The Governor is not scheduled to propose his revised budget until August 25.
“$9.9 billion is not what we need to make us whole. It represents the Governor’s wants so he can continue to spend at the level he proposed back in February when the economy was booming,” Bucco continued. “The Governor has not expressed the extent of the hole in the 2021 budget that needs to be filled.”
Bucco also addressed Murphy’s criticism of those opposed to the debt plan for whining about it.
“When you live in one of the most expensive states to live in, don’t mistake residents gasping for breath to survive as whining,” said Bucco.
The Senator also outlined five options proposed by Republicans that would provide significant savings and reduce the state’s dependency on borrowing but have been ignored by the Governor.
This list included bipartisan furlough legislation passed by both houses two months ago that would have saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars.
“We lost a tremendous opportunity by not having that legislation signed and we left far too much revenue on the table,” said Bucco.

“For far too long, Chinese President Xi Jinping and his communist regime have been allowed to trample the basic human dignity of the Uighur population in Xinjiang . . .

NYPD-Bashing Ideologues Just Don’t Care About Reality

“Every day makes it more obvious that facts just don’t matter to the cop-bashers and the politicians who cater to them. [New York City] Police Commissioner Dermot Shea gamely told the truth again Thursday, calling out state and city lawmakers for ‘going too far’ to ‘handcuff’ the NYPD,” the New York Post editorial board writes.

Ivanka Trump, “a co-chair of the American Workforce Policy Advisory Board, has urged the government to engage in hiring practices to ‘better recognize the talents and competencies of all Americans’ it hires. Part of that is to prioritize job skills and talents over college degrees,” Brooke Singman writes.

Friend,
I humbly ask for you to make sure you cast your vote today. I have been across the 5th Congressional District with my campaign team, spreading our message and making sure that every vote is counted and heard.
This campaign has had some unprecedented twists and turns throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, but we have overcome and we are still getting our message out and making sure that every voter knows they have a choice while filling out their ballot.
I know we agree that the failed leadership under Josh Gottheimer has been detrimental to New Jersey. I know we both see just how much control Nancy Pelosi has over him. He voted with her 96% of the time.
We deserve better from our Representatives in Washington. That’s why I’m running for Congress and I’m asking for your vote.
But there's more, after we dug into Gotthemier's financials we noticed a disturbing pattern. Turns out 70% of his donations have come from outside of New Jersey. That's right he sold out New Jersey again. He'll be voting with Nancy Pelosi and AOC, increasing their control of his vote.
I need your help, today. Will you chip in $25, $50, $75, $100, $250 or even $500 today to show Josh that New Jersey wants a true leader, not someone who will go along to get along.
I promise to always put New Jersey, our home, our values, our communities, our businesses, and our children and families FIRST!
A donation, big or small will go a long way to help get us across the finish line.
Thank you for your support!

This week Governor Murphy introduced the biggest spending plan in New Jersey history. It includes a basket of liberal spending priorities, a new income tax and doesn't even begin to address the honest answers to this state's real problems. Chairman Steinhardt & the NJGOP are pushing back, and holding the Democrats in Trenton accountable for their liberal, tax and spend policies.

Bucco: Murphy Budget is a Missed Opportunity
Sen. Anthony Bucco said Gov. Murphy’s FY 2021 budget failed to offer beleaguered taxpayers any hope for a more affordable New Jersey.
“This was a missed opportunity for a more affordable state for taxpayers. At $40.85 billion, this budget reflects an increase of more than 5 percent over the FY 2020 budget passed last year.
“Residents are fleeing the state in record numbers, as evidenced by study after study. This was the time to start giving people hope for a more affordable New Jersey and give them a reason to stay.
“This budget gives us new and higher taxes, and boosts the cost of government to historic levels. The state should be living within its means, not continuing the failed tax-and-spend policies of the past.”

Hi Friends,
Despite New Jersey’s courts consistently holding that it is unconstitutional to bond for general operating expenses, Governor Murphy approved a $10 billion borrowing and State levied property tax scheme.
Earlier this week, the New Jersey Supreme Court heard arguments from the NJGOP, Senate and Assembly Republicans seeking to stop Murphy’s illegal borrowing and taxing.
NJGOP Chairman Steinhardt released the following statement:
“Thank you to Senator Michael Testa Jr, Mark Sheridan, and all the plaintiffs in this case for helping our party make a strong, unified argument to the New Jersey Supreme Court today.
“The State struggled to prove that Phil Murphy’s $10B borrowing and property tax scheme is anything more than giving Murphy a credit card for his reckless liberal spending habits at the expense of 9 million NJ families trying to make ends meet. Ultimately, the State was unable to provide any limiting principles on what this debt would be spent on, including building a sports stadium or making debt payments on prior bonds.
“We were pleased to stand up for average New Jerseyans today, firmly believe our argument won the day, and look forward to the Court’s decision.”

It’s time for Republicans in New Jersey to put on our hard hats and get to work. New Jersey may not be a traditional “battleground” presidential state, but we are going to be in the national spotlight, and we need to be ready for our moment.
To win a majority in the House of Representatives, Republicans would need a net gain of 20 seats around the country. With four Democrat incumbents occupying swing districts right in our backyard, the NJGOP is ready to play a “make or break” role in delivering up to 20% of the gains necessary to take the gavel from Nancy Pelosi.

Today’s [[URL REDACTED]] news story on the terrible carnage at New Jersey’s Murphy-administered veteran's homes cries out for an independent investigation and federal oversight of state facilities that get millions in federal funding. As Governor Murphy’s culpability in the deaths of thousands of our most vulnerable citizens grows, why isn’t Congressman Gottheimer criticizing Governor Murphy’s handling of COVID-19 at nursing facilities and veteran's homes? Why isn’t Gottheimer joining bi-partisan calls for an investigation of the Murphy administration?
I'm urging Governor Phil Murphy to issue a statement at his next press briefing to formally declare that all NJ Health Department Employees fall under OSHA's whistleblower laws and be treated accordingly. He should also urge them to proactively reach out to Federal authorities and tell them what they know

# Assemblyman DePhillips (LD-40) to work on urgent business, employee relief package
In light of a business survey that found 45 percent of employers would close within three weeks, and over 83 percent within 11 weeks, Assemblyman Christopher DePhillips said he will work on providing state-level relief for businesses. He says the best way to start is ensuring current-year income will last beyond the pandemic.
“There is a huge surge of businesses and employees who aren’t making any money right now, and New Jersey’s high cost of living could end up being the straw that breaks their back,” said DePhillips (R-Bergen). “We can only focus on what the state can control, and the one thing the state can control is taxes. That is where relief needs to start.”
DePhillips introduced a bill cutting the corporation business tax to 2.5 percent over four years. He says that plan could be implemented right away and amended to apply retroactively. The assemblyman will also propose a $10,000 standard deduction on income taxes that is not mutually exclusive with other exemptions, deductions or credits, removing the cap on property tax deductions, and increasing property taxes as a percentage of rent to 30 percent from 18 percent.
“The state can’t afford to spend right now, and state revenues will drop as much as personal income does,” continued DePhillips. “This doesn’t have to be a lose-lose situation for government and people. Elected officials need to put constituents’ personal income first, even if that means state revenue is a sacrificial lamb. People need to come out of this pandemic physically and financially healthy. That is the priority.”
About three in five businesses have had to let workers go, and over three quarters of respondents said that they might need up to $100,000 to survive the next three months.
The EDA has announced more than $75 million, over $100 million with federal resources, in assistance for small businesses. The programs will assist between 3,000 and 5,000 small and midsized businesses, only 0.56 percent of the just under 885,000 small businesses in New Jersey.
DePhillips sent the survey by email to over 300 businesses in his district on Wednesday, March 25, and posted on Facebook.

"Im-🍑-ment Sham and Criminal 🎄 Christmas  View this email in your browser
Hi Friends,
What a week! We have had three major events to bring you up to speed on:
1\. IMPEACHMENT
10 of New Jersey's 12 Congressional members voted to impeach President Trump. Here's what NJGOP Chairman Doug Steinhardt had to say about that:
“As America’s economy roars under President Trump’s leadership, liberal elites in Washington let out a whimper today with their partisan impeachment vote. Fake New Jersey moderates Andy Kim, Josh Gottheimer, Tom Malinowski and Mikie Sherrill turned their backs on their constituents, thumbed their noses at democracy and put their partisan political interests ahead of the country’s interests, and voted to impeach the President. Meanwhile, the issues they were elected to address, like keeping our economy strong, repairing our healthcare system and fortifying our national security, have gone months without attention. The road to a Republican majority in the house runs through New Jersey and, right now, I like our odds.”
If you want to fight back and help us retake the House, CLICK HERE!
2\. Congressman Jeff Van Drew Flips To Republican
The NJGOP released the following in response to the news of NJ-2 Congressman Jeff Van Drew’s change of party affiliation from Democrat to Republican.
“Voters in CD-2 have been looking, for the past several years, to Republicans for honest answers to South Jersey’s real problems,” said Chairman Steinhardt. “They are looking for solutions on job creation and affordability. When Democrat leaders like Phil Murphy and Nancy Pelosi focus 100% of their time on a liberal agenda that includes a partisan impeachment probe and millions of dollars supporting illegal immigrants, they are bound to lose support. Now, they’re losing a Congressman.”
Since 2016, Republicans have made significant gains in South Jersey. Republicans flipped a State Senate seat in LD-2 in 2017 and Senate and Assembly seats in LD-1 (Van Drew’s former legislative district) in 2019. This is the first time LD-1 has been entirely Republican in nearly two decades. Republicans also held the Assembly seats in LD-8, thanks in large part to the margin in the NJ-2 part of the district.
Republicans gained control of Salem County government and now have the opportunity, in 2020, to win control of Cumberland County government. This year, Republicans also won control, and have a 5-0 majority, in Van Drew’s hometown of Dennis Township and a 3-0 majority for the first time ever in neighboring Middle Township.
Chairman Steinhardt continued, “When we set out to grow the NJGOP, we always knew that meant re-engaging Republicans, winning unaffiliated voters and attracting Democrats unhappy with their party’s new, extreme positions.”
After losing almost 108,000 Republican registrants (approximately 18,000 every midterm election dating back to the Whitman Administration in 1993), Republicans have increased the Party’s registrations by 7.5%, adding almost 98,000 Republicans in the 2 1/2 years since Steinhardt became Chairman. Democrats still maintain an advantage statewide, but Republicans are fighting back with strong, sharp-elbowed messaging.
“We have had positive and continuing dialogue with party leadership in South Jersey and Washington and welcome Congressman Jeff Van Drew to the NJGOP. This is a quickly evolving situation, but we look forward to continuing to work to ensure that South Jerseyans have a Republican Congressman for years to come.”
3\. Criminal Christmas In Trenton
This week the Democrat controlled New Jersey legislature will held votes on six bills to support criminals and criminal behavior.
S3229 – Drivers licenses for illegal immigrants
S4154 – Revises expungement eligibility and procedures, including new “clean slate” automated process to render convictions and related records inaccessible
S4260 – Gives voting rights for people convicted of indictable offense who are on parole or probation.
SCR183 – Legalizes marijuana
A3979 – Makes is easier for prisoners to see their children
S761 – Requires DOC to develop inmate reentry plan
NJGOP Chairman Steinhardt offered the following comment:
“It’s criminal Christmas today in Trenton. As Democrat politicians shower rule breakers with privileges and sympathy, the millions of hardworking New Jersey families who do it by the book are once again left asking, who is looking out for them? Our state is limping behind the rest of the country and we’re bleeding jobs, opportunities and family members. Phil Murphy’s backwards approach to governing goes beyond kicking the can down the road. He’s loaded the can into a cannon and shot it into the meadowlands swamps. This state needs honest answers to its real problems, and the clock is ticking.”

🔦 Legislature Spotlight Of The Week 🔦
Assemblywoman Serena DiMaso (R-13) and Assemblyman Chris DePhillips (R-40)
Create a Tax Cut Caucus in Trenton
In order to force Trenton to consider the real concerns of residents, Assemblyman Christopher DePhillips and Assemblywoman Serena DiMaso announced the creation of a tax cut caucus that would fight for state taxpayers who are overburdened by the Democrats’ tax-and-spend policies.
“It’s time we talk affordability and it’s time we consider legislation that would reduce taxes for citizens and businesses – these are the concerns of the citizens of this state and they are being completely ignored by the Democratic majority,” said DePhillips (R-Bergen). “I invite any legislator in the Assembly who wants to fight to keep families in this state to join our tax cut caucus. We will methodically review all pending taxes in New Jersey and make recommendations to cut them, or eliminate them, at every voting session in the coming two-year term.”
In the last voting sessions, the Democrats posted and passed bills to create a parking tax in six municipalities, exceed the property tax cap in municipalities with underfunded school districts, and create driver’s licenses for illegal immigrants.
“I think the Democrats are underestimating the power of the people to fight back, but that is exactly what we intend to do,” said DiMaso (R-Monmouth). “The Democrats are spending money the state doesn’t have and then forcing taxpayers to pay for their bad legislation. This caucus will ensure we start hearing about real solutions to real issues.”
A Monmouth University poll found that most respondents name property taxes as the most important issue facing New Jersey, along with income taxes, taxes and the cost of living in general. An NJBIA-Rutgers poll had similar results, with approximately 80 percent of respondents saying they pay more in taxes than they get in return, and listing property taxes as the main problem. A poll by Farleigh Dickinson and the Garden State Initiative found that 44 percent of New Jerseyans plan to leave New Jersey because of property taxes and the high cost of living, while 28 percent plan to leave in the next five years.
“I want to thank Chris DePhillips and Serena DiMaso for helping us bring the issue of affordability to the forefront of the discussion in Trenton,” said Assembly Republican Leader Bramnick (R-Union). “Republicans have continually advocated for reducing taxes and improving New Jersey’s business environment with bills ready for discussion and ready for votes.”
Since Gov. Phil Murphy has taken office, the Democrat-controlled Legislature has passed more than two dozen bills increasing taxes and fees. Murphy has signed more than half of them, costing taxpayers at least $2.5 billion. Despite increasing spending, pensions and education are still underfunded by a combined $2.6 billion and property taxes remain the highest in the nation.

"You need to hear what President Trump told me View this email in your browser
Hi Friends,
Thank you to everyone who joined us at the rally in Wildwood on Tuesday. It was an excellent event, and an honor to have President Trump in South Jersey.
I had a few moments to speak with President Trump privately, and his message to me was clear: New Jersey is a MAJOR key to winning back a majority in the House.
TAKE BACK THE HOUSE!
During his remarks, President Trump said, “While we are creating jobs and killing terrorists, congressional Democrats are obsessed with demented hoaxes, crazy with hunts and deranged partisan crusades.”
We need your help to take back the house and defeat the liberal Congressional quartet of Josh Gottheimer, Andy Kim, Tom Malinowski, and Mikie Sherrill, who have led the impeachment witch hunt in Washington.

Hi Friends,
The New Jersey Republican State Committee is hitting the ground running in the 2020 general election. With three Democrat incumbents occupying Trump districts and another in a <1% Clinton district, the NJGOP is ready to play a “make or break” role in delivering a Republican majority.
Early last year, it was reported that the GOP was working to plot a “blue-state invasion in November“, and the NJGOP looks forward to partnering with the RNC to deploy a sophisticated and well funded field effort.
In April, a Monmouth University Poll found that Democrats are facing a tough road in the five most competitive seats that helped contribute to 2018’s “blue wave”. According to Monmouth, voters give Republican candidates (46%) a slight edge over Democrat candidates (45%) in the five most competitive districts (i.e., CDs 2, 3, 5, 7, 11). This time two years ago, Democrats held an aggregate 7- point edge in these districts (49% to 42%).
“The NJGOP is ready to carry our momentum from the most successful legislative elections in 28 years into this year’s House races,” said NJGOP Chairman Steinhardt. “The New Jersey Democrat delegation has taken a dangerous turn to the left, pursuing a socialist agenda and an erroneous impeachment crusade. Polling indicates they’re turning off voters and Congressman Van Drew’s flip to the Republican party proves that common sense people are hungry for new leadership.”

Bucco & Bramnick Offer Solutions to Long MVC Lines that Murphy Can Implement Immediately
Senator Anthony M. Bucco and Assembly Republican Leader Jon Bramnick offered a series of concrete solutions that Governor Phil Murphy could implement immediately to help remedy the chaos that has followed the Motor Vehicle Commission’s disastrous reopening.
“More than two months ago, I asked for the MVC’s plan to reopen smoothly and they never responded,” said Bucco (R-25). “It’s clear they never developed an effective reopening plan, which has forced New Jersey drivers to wait in extremely long lines all day, overnight, and in sweltering heat in the hopes of getting the service they deserve. Despite what the governor has suggested, this isn’t the fault of New Jerseyans who have waited patiently for four months to obtain services that the MVC does not offer online. It’s clear more needs to be done, which is why Leader Bramnick and I are proposing concrete solutions that would offer immediate relief for drivers and reduce the urgent need to visit MVC agencies that have been overwhelmed.”
“Making people stand outside in the heat for seven hours or more in the middle of a pandemic is absolutely a disgrace,” said Bramnick (R-Union). “People are rightly outraged at the MVC reopening and Governor Murphy should take immediate action with the solutions we have proposed.”
Bucco and Bramnick urged the Governor to take the following steps immediately to reduce the volume at MVC agencies to manageable levels:
* issue a 90-day moratorium on all motor vehicle regulation enforcement;
* open agencies seven days a week for 12 hours each day;
* serve people based on the first letter of their last name or some other distinction on different days;
* allow for permits to be issued online for those who have completed driver education courses;
* allow for those who are seeking a probationary license to continue driving temporarily with their permit;
* allow for those seeking to convert a probationary license to a basic driver’s license to do so online; and
* establish proper social distancing measures outside MVC agencies.
FIVE STORIES PRESIDENT TRUMP DOESN'T WANT YOU TO MISS
Education Secretary Betsy DeVos Wants Schools Open Full-Time This Fall
—Chicago Tribune
“Ultimately, it’s not a matter of if schools need to open, it’s a matter of how. School must reopen, they must be fully operational. And how that happens is best left to education and community leaders,” Education Secretary Betsy DeVos told governors this week. On Tuesday, President Trump held a White House summit on reopening schools this fall.
China Never Reported Existence of Coronavirus to World Health Organization
—The Washington Free Beacon
“Contrary to claims from both Chinese officials and the World Health Organization, China did not report the existence of the coronavirus in late 2019, according to a WHO timeline tracking the spread of the virus. Rather, international health officials discovered the virus through information posted to a U.S. website,” Adam Kredo reports.
Last Week's Jobs Report Was Good. Here's Why the July Report Will Be Even Better in Spite of Pandemic Fears.
—Yahoo Finance
“The June employment report from the [Bureau of Labor Statistics] showed an increase of 4.8 million jobs,” Yahoo Finance reports. Now, “daily job listing data, especially in the retail and hospitality sectors,” indicate that July could be an even stronger month for job growth.
Trump Committed to Helping Hispanics Create Prosperity Through Business, Education
—Miami Herald
“As the daughter of first-generation Mexican Americans born in a working-class community in Chicago, I know firsthand how important opportunity is in promoting upward mobility and achieving the American Dream,” writes U.S. Small Business Administrator Jovita Carranza. And creating such opportunity is the “central goal” behind an executive order on Hispanic prosperity that President Trump signed Thursday.
The Media’s War on Words
—National Review
“Every time some new correct-speak emerges, CNN and all the media will participate in browbeating us into subservience. Progressive pundits will laugh off concerns about the Orwellian slippery slope. And all of them will immediately sign on to the next round of rhetorical groupthink and further degrade clear language and clear thinking,” David Harsanyi writes.

"Yesterday we launched a campaign to expose Phil Murphy, but we need your help...
Friend,
I hope you saw the news. Yesterday, we launched a massive messaging campaign to expose Phil Murphy's failures, and tens of thousands of New Jerseyans have shared this important information. Murphy continues to fail us time and time again. He's putting our families and businesses at risk and we deserve better.
Chairman Steinhardt called me this morning and he wanted to know who is supporting our campaign. I want to make sure your name is on the list. Can you give today to help us expose Phil Murphy for his failures and lackluster leadership?
Donate today to help us expose Murphy!

Subject: ""An Unmitigated Failure""
View this email in your browser
Pierce,
Since the beginning, it's been clear that Phil Murphy is faking his way through the COVID Crisis. At a time when the livelihood of New Jersey families and businesses are at risk, we deserve better.
Whistleblowers from inside the Murphy Administration continue to raise concerns, calling Murphy's leadership "" an unmitigated failure"" that has led to ""preventable deaths"".
Meanwhile, Murphy is avoiding questions after he violated his own Executive Order.
It's time we expose Murphy for what he is. NJGOP has launched a new website to hold him accountable.
While Murphy is more worried about public perception than PPE and media coverage than medical expertise, we must stand up for New Jersey families that have been put at risk due to Murphy's lack of leadership.
>> Donate $10, $25 or $30 toward our campaign to expose Phil Murphy today!
For months, Phil Murphy has been winging his way through the COVID Crisis, basing the future of New Jersey on what his gut tells him to do on any given day. We must put an end to it.
Sincerely,
Team NJGOP
Donate to Expose Phil Murphy!

Hi Friends,
Please see below for a NJGOP update on COVID-19.
A Message From NJGOP Chairman Doug Steinhardt
Good morning everyone,
I hope everyone is staying healthy and safe during these difficult times.
As the curve is flattening, and conversations begin about re-opening our state and plans for economic recovery, please know that the NJGOP will be here to offer solutions to our state government. We will be advocating for tax holidays and fighting tax hikes.
I want to spotlight the leadership of LD-13 Assemblyman Gerry Scharfenberger who has pledged to forgo his legislative salary until his constituents’ unemployment claims are fulfilled. He wrote:
“My staff and I have been working seven days a week yielding countless phone calls and emails from residents who have lost either all or part of their income due to this public health crisis,” said Dr. Scharfenberger. “They have sought state unemployment insurance, calling on a daily basis only to be told to be patient and they may have to wait another 4 to 6 weeks. This is unacceptable and as leaders in this State, we cannot allow families to struggle to meet the basic necessities of life. We must show that we stand with them, especially in these hard times.”
Here's what you need to know today
1\. President Trump and Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue announced the creation of the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program (CFAP). This $19 billion immediate relief program will provide critical support to farmers and ranchers, maintain the integrity of our food supply chain, and ensure every American continues to receive and have access to the food they need.
2\. Senator Michael Doherty has launched an online petition to allow religious services to resume in New Jersey with reasonable precautions.
3\. Assemblyman Brian Bergen wants Gov. Phil Murphy to talk about the economy during daily COVID-19 briefings and add economic expert. Read more here...
4\. As The Wall Street Journal notes, “The longer Democrats refuse to provide financing for small businesses after government cut off their revenue, the more Americans will have every right to conclude that Mrs. Pelosi and Mr. Schumer are responsible for the worsening economic destruction.”
This should not be a partisan issue. Even Obama’s SBA chief says Democrats should fund the Paycheck Protection Program.
Needless to say Nancy, hope you’re enjoying your San Francisco estate, your fancy fridge and your premium ice cream while 22 million Americans are unemployed.
Bottom Line: To the 22 million Americans who lost their jobs because of the coronavirus, Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, Andy Kim, Mikie Sherrill, Josh Gottheimer and Tom Malinowski and the rest of the job killing Democrats are sitting on their hands. The Democrat Party is no longer a party for working Americans.
MUST READ OF THE DAY!
# Trump Rewrites the Book on Emergencies
##
For the first time in U.S. history, an administration is responding to a crisis with deregulation and decentralization.
By Christopher DeMuth
Washington’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic is upending one of the most durable patterns of American politics. Throughout history, national emergencies have led to a more powerful and centralized federal government and to the transfer of federal power from Congress to the executive branch. This time, the federal response rests largely on state and local government and private enterprise, with a wave of deregulation clearing the way. The Trump administration has seized no new powers, and Congress has stayed energetically in the game.

Hi Friends,
Last week the NJGOP launched a campaign to expose Governor Murphy’s weak, ineffective, non-transparent, dictatorial and hypocritical management of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of Governor Murphy’s failures, 9 million New Jerseyans have endured crushing unemployment and the senseless deaths of 6,300 vulnerable nursing home patients and counting.
Since the NJGOP launched “Murphy Exposed,” there’s been plenty of over reaches and outright abuses. We’ve highlighted everything from whistleblower complaints against the Governor’s Administration to letters ordering nursing homes to accept previously COVID positive patients without testing them.
Today, we are updating our “Murphy Exposed” website with even more failures, from lawsuits against councils and school districts, to double standards in the Attorney General’s office, to Governor Murphy seemingly authorizing preferential testing and treatment for his senior staff, while restricting or denying it all together to millions of other scared and unprotected New Jerseyans.
A growing group of whistleblowers in the Murphy Administration plan to come forward and expose a state review of Murphy’s nursing home response as a white wash.
Fact Check: (“Coronavirus NJ: Secret recording, report ‘flaws’ bring nursing home review into question”)
Members of Governor Murphy’s own party are frustrated with his weak leadership and bad judgment.
(Fact Check: “Tension builds between Murphy, Dems in Congress over governor’s coronavirus responses”)
Governor Murphy seems to authorize preferential treatment for his senior staff while restricting or denying it all together to millions of other scared and unprotected New Jerseyans.
(Fact Check: “I was fired after denying Murphy’s top aide coronavirus tests for his family, health department official claims”)
Governor Murphy is rewriting social distancing laws after he personally and publicly breaks them to avoid citation.
(Fact Check: New Jersey Attorney General directed municipal prosecutors to drop executive order violation charges against protest organizers as part of new COVID-19 enforcement guidance.)
NJGOP Chairman Doug Steinhardt released the following statement on this update:
“Phil Murphy continues to spurn millions of New Jersey citizens and small business owners, imposing his will, ignoring his critics, and telling 9 million New Jerseyans that if they don’t like his orders, they can move. When a governor stops respecting the governed, it’s easy to imagine the kind of culture that festers in his office. Consequently, few would be surprised if, at the height of this pandemic, Phil Murphy had one set of rules for his staff and himself, and another set for us. He proved that in Hillside and Westfield, when he violated his own executive orders, but had his Attorney General excuse those and issue prosecution guidelines yesterday for everyone else. The hypocrisy is thick and allegations serious. Governor Murphy must find it within himself to be a real leader and own up to his failures. Accountability matters.”

# Congressman Chris Smith co-sponsors police reform and transparency legislation
Rep. Chris Smith (R-Hamilton) has taken the lead in the U.S. House of Representatives to pass the JUSTICE Act, legislation that 20-term incumbent says will enhance transparency and accountability in policing.
“I watched the video of Derek Chauvin kneeling on the neck of Mr. Floyd who pleaded ‘I can’t breathe’ with horror and disbelief,” Smith said. “Chauvin not only betrayed his solemn duty to serve and protect but he betrayed, as well, police officers throughout the nation who serve with great honor and valor and make enormous sacrifices to protect the innocent and enforce the law.”
The proposal would provide incentives for local law enforcement agencies to ban choke-holds, make lynching a federal hate crime and creates a commission to study policing conditions for black men of all ages, among other things.

Hi Friends,
We hope everyone is staying safe and healthy.
NJGOP Chairman Doug Steinhardt released the following statement in response to Governor Murphy’s April 27th press briefing on his plan for economic recovery:
“As we emerge from one crisis, I appeal to Governor Murphy not to plunge us deeper into another one. The telltale signs of a state economic collapse are here and we need our Democratic leaders to reject their reflex to plug budget holes with big loans and bigger tax increases.
“Today, Governor Murphy laid out his ‘Road Back to Economic Health’ which was long, winding and nothing new: reduce COVID cases, test, trace, & isolate. Economically, it boils down to this: appoint a commission to study our problems and go to the Fed and beg for money. Insider politicians suggest commissions, studies and talk. What New Jersey needs right now is leaders to lead. Revenue projections are down. There are one million unemployed New Jerseyans waiting for jobs, benefits and answers. Families are starving and businesses are shuttered. Instead of data, dates or answers from the Governor, Treasurer or Commissioner of Labor, we got a campaign speech for embattled Congressman Tom Malinowski, who left half his congressional district’s local governments with no first round stimulus money.
“The NJGOP message is simple and clear: no new taxes. Our children couldn’t afford to start their lives here, and our parents and grandparents couldn’t afford to retire here, even before this pandemic started. Decades of liberal taxing and spending came home to roost and they’re tearing New Jersey families apart.
“Now we need discipline. Governor Murphy should channel New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, exercise economic restraint, and consider real economic relief in the form of:
“Tax holidays that increase taxpayers’ available cash, not tax increases that reduce it.
“Updating outdated school funding formulas and antiquated COAH requirements.
“Helping the nearly one million unemployed New Jerseyans who need benefits, jobs and answers.
“Improving our worst-in-the-nation tax climate through tax-cutting policies that make New Jersey more affordable, not less.
“Streamlining approvals and cutting red tape to keep businesses open and people working.
“Repurposing our profit centers and investing in ourselves and our businesses.”

# Senate Republicans: Reopening Parks a Reasonable Step, Many Businesses Ready to Reopen Too
The Senate Republican leadership team said Governor Phil Murphy’s announcement that State and county parks and golf courses will be allowed to reopen is a reasonable step and that many businesses are also ready to resume operations once restrictions are lifted:
The Senate Republican leadership team said Gov. Phil Murphy’s announcement that State and county parks and golf courses will be allowed to reopen is a reasonable step and that many businesses are also ready to resume operations once restrictions are lifted.
“Over the last few weeks, we have witnessed with awe and pride an amazing transformation in the attitudes and practices of individual New Jerseyans as they adopted necessary social distancing and personal protective measures that just months ago would have been unthinkable.
“Similarly, we have watched as retailers, educators, and healthcare professionals have responded with ingenuity, dedication, and professionalism to ensure their ability to continue serving their communities.
“Given the increased understanding of reasonable personal behavior during this time, we believe the reopening of open spaces across New Jersey, including State and county parks and golf courses, is long overdue. Still, we are glad Governor Murphy has finally acknowledged what most New Jerseyans have been asking for since the parks were closed.
“Additionally, we believe it’s time for the governor to begin to trust the tens of thousands of small businesses that have plans in place and are ready to reopen safely. They’ve made detailed plans and taken steps to ensure their ability to reopen while protecting their workers and customers. There’s no reason a shop on Main Street has to remain shut when the convenience store next door is open. If they can put in place the same precautions, Governor Murphy should lift the restrictions he placed on them and let them get back to work.”
According to the New Jersey Business & Industry Association Business Recovery Survey, 70% of businesses said they could operate safely under social distancing guidelines recommended by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Hi Friends,
We hope everyone is staying safe, healthy and enjoying their holiday weekend.
As the coronavirus pandemic continues to eat away at New Jersey’s economy, with a third straight week of record unemployment claims, our Democrat representatives in Washington continue to obstruct aid at the behest of their liberal leadership. Most recently, Nancy Pelosi has vowed to block $250 billion in aid to struggling small businesses.
“When Nancy Pelosi tells the liberal quartet of Andy Kim, Josh Gottheimer, Tom Malinowski and Mikie Sherrill to jump, they jump out of their shoes, even if it means cheating small businesses during a pandemic,” said NJGOP Chairman Doug Steinhardt. “They all stood by sheepishly as Pelosi held up phase 3 relief to try and sneak through a liberal wish list that included $35 million in funding for a DC opera house! The people of New Jersey, particularly business owners, are suffering, residents are dying, and these four representatives won’t exhibit the courage to stand up for their constituents. Let’s all keep that in mind in November.”
Andy Kim has 13,202 small businesses in his district.
Josh Gottheimer has 19,634 small businesses in his district.
Tom Malinowski has 19,439 small businesses in his district.
Mikie Sherrill has 21,120 small businesses in her district.
And, it’s worth pointing out that while New Jersey businesses struggle, Andy Kim made time to join Governor Murphy during the Governor’s daily COVID-19 briefing and politicized it instead of going to work to protect New Jersey families.

This is the Chinese Chernobyl | Steinhardt
The United States is waking up to the national security risk that is American dependence on Chinese pharmaceuticals. New Jersey, meanwhile, is uniquely situated to be a national problem solver. At one time, our pharmaceutical footing was without rival. Today, foreign powers have usurped our role. When we finally turn the corner from this viral pandemic, and we will, our Governor and legislature can make a real difference in our economic security and the security of every American family.

# Senator Declan O’Scanlon: Failure to Utilize Extremely Valuable Human Resources Needs to Be Immediately Rectified. Failure to Do So Could Cost Lives. Governor Needs to Act Now.
“As the Governor knows and has said, we need all hands on deck,” said O’Scanlon (R-13). “This should be a no brainer. This is something that should have happened weeks ago and yet we keep getting told it’s just around the corner.”
Recently, through Executive Order 112, Governor Murphy permitted the state to allow out-of-state and retired nurses and doctors to work in New Jersey.
Nursing schools in the state are expediting the graduation of students in their final semester to help in the fight. However, those nursing students that graduated prior to the pandemic and who were waiting to take their nurse licensing exams were not permitted to be hired during the COVID-19 crisis.
“I understand the administration has been trying to get the old nurse permitting system back online to help with this situation, but we don’t want to take so long as to have it miss the surge. Let’s get it done,” said O’Scanlon.
“We are also missing a huge opportunity to permit EMS personnel who have recently let their certifications expire or who have been inactive to join the cause,” O’Scanlon continued. “This has the potential to get hundreds of extra EMTs and Paramedics who are ready, willing, and able to aid in this crisis. Adequate staffing is as big a concern as personal protective equipment and childcare. Heads should roll if we didn’t get this done in time.”
Doctors, nurses, and virtually every other profession in the State, are governed by the Division of Consumer Affairs in the Attorney General’s Office. However, the New Jersey Department of Health is the regulatory body for EMS. To be permitted to be reactivated, EMTs would have to take 24 hours of class and a test, and paramedics would have to take a minimum of 48 hours, and as high as hundreds of hours of retraining, however, all classes and testing centers are currently closed.
“The Department of Health is extremely busy these days. However, they have emergency powers to get this done. The Governor needs to act, or the Legislature will,” O’Scanlon concluded.

Hi Friends,
The United States is coming together to take on the coronavirus, and we are all thankful for the bold and decisive leadership of President Trump. A new ABC News/Ipsos poll released Friday reports that 55 percent of respondents approve of Trump’s management of the public health crisis.
Many state and county election offices are considering changes to deadlines, dates, and requirements, and we will provide periodic updates at [[URL REDACTED]]
Chairman Steinhardt: New Jersey Needs Senator Anthony M. Bucco
25th District Democrats have nominated their candidate to challenge Senator Anthony Bucco in November. NJGOP Chairman Steinhardt reacted with the following comment:
“The last thing New Jersey needs is another rubber stamp in the state Senate supporting Phil Murphy’s insatiable appetite for our tax dollars. New Jersey’s state government needs diversity of thought, they need common-sense thinkers and they need a fiscally minded representative like Senator Bucco. Our state’s affordability crisis has the potential to get a lot worse in the coming months and voters need to know that the NJGOP agenda is the right first step to making sure our kids can afford to start their lives here and our parents and grandparents can afford to retire here. Tony Bucco fights for the people of north Jersey and that’s why he will be re-elected resoundingly this November.”

Friends,
We all saw Nancy Pelosi tear President Trump's speech in half last night. It was an action that is perfectly emblematic of her soon-to-be short tenure in the majority. House Democrats have torn this country in half with their partisan impeachment mission. They have put the well-being of our economy, our national security and our healthcare completely on the back-burner. As of this afternoon, the President has been acquitted on both Articles Of Impeachment!
CLICK TO GET RID OF PELOSI!
Now it's our turn to hold them accountable for this partisan witch hunt. This November, New Jersey has a real opportunity to put people over politics, kick the liberal congressional quartet of Kim, Malinowski, Sherrill, and Gottheimer out of office, and help send Nancy Pelosi back to the minority.
Help us fund our efforts to support the President! Any donation you make today will go directly towards our effort to fight Congressional Democrats that supported impeachment.
Support President Trump, vote out the liberal Congressional quartet of Josh Gottheimer, Andy Kim, Tom Malinowski, and Mikie Sherrill and put Nancy Pelosi back in the minority!
Thank you,

A note from Chairman Steinhardt:
Friends-
Over the last week, the nation was shocked to hear the news of positive COVID test results for President Trump, the First Lady, Governor Christie, and New Jersey natives Kellyanne Conway and Bill Stepien. Each of these strong leaders is resilient, receiving the best of care, and I know they will beat this deadly virus. I, and the entire NJGOP family are wishing President Trump, the First Lady, and Governor Christie a speedy recovery. Everyone impacted by COVID-19 in New Jersey and around the world is in our prayers.
NJGOP Chairman Doug Steinhardt On Governor Murphy’s Budget Signing
“With this budget, Governor Murphy might as well be signing a letter addressed to every New Jersey taxpayer that reads ‘move to FL or PA. I don’t care.’ This $32.7 billion budget is the most callous and crippling in New Jersey history. In the middle of an economic crunch made worse by his decisions, Phil Murphy’s lack of understanding for struggling New Jersey businesses and families was never more evident.”
NJGOP In The News!
Crime guns and reoffending criminals are killing New Jersey. Murphy won’t stop them, but we can. | Steinhardt
A trio of statewide crises face New Jersey. We have the Corona virus, and the ever-changing, politically tainted executive orders that have come with it. There is unrestrained borrowing of billions, with no plan to repay it. And now, we have a surge of violent gun crime by repeat offenders across our State. While Governor Murphy basks in the artificial glow of his hollow, progressive policies, crime-guns and reoffending criminals are killing New Jersey citizens, and our Demcoratic leaders are too weak to stop it.

# Kean and Bucco Speak at ‘Voices for Seniors’ Rally
Showing their support for the families of the more than 7,100 lives lost in long-term care facilities due to the tragic mistakes made under Governor Phil Murphy’s leadership, Senate Republican Leader Tom Kean and Senator Anthony M. Bucco both spoke at the ‘Voices for Seniors’ New Jersey Rally at St. Joseph’s Senior Assisted Living and Nursing Center in Woodbridge on September 30, 2020.
“So many families have been impacted by the pandemic, but those who have lost loved ones in nursing homes, veterans homes, and long-term care facilities are still seeking answers about this preventable tragedy,” said Kean (R-21). “For the past five months, Senate Republicans have called for a thorough, bipartisan, and transparent investigation into the more than 7,100 deaths in long-term care facilities. The families and loved ones of victims deserve to hear the truth and be given the peace of mind to know that those responsible are being held accountable.”
More than 7,000 residents of New Jersey’s nursing homes, veterans’ homes, and long-term care facilities have died from COVID-19. A full 50% of the state’s coronavirus deaths have occurred among these vulnerable populations.
Whistleblowers from within the New Jersey Department of Health have hinted that dangerous policy directives, misrepresented data, and arbitrary decision-making by the administration in Trenton contributed to preventable outbreaks and the unnecessary loss of life in our long-term care facilities.
Senate Republicans have launched an online petition to enlist the public’s support to convince legislative leaders to allow a special bipartisan committee with subpoena power to investigate the massive loss of life in New Jersey’s nursing homes, veterans’ homes, and long-term care (LTC) facilities due to COVID-19.
The online petition can be signed at [[URL REDACTED]]
“The efforts of ‘Voices for Seniors’ honor the many thousands of lost loved ones in our nursing homes and the countless others who still can be saved,” said Bucco (R-25). “Each one of those 7,000 people who perished were loved, are sorely missed, and they deserve our efforts to find out what went wrong and to fight to prevent any additional, unnecessary loss of life. I urge all residents to sign the petition. Together, we can be the strong, unified voices that our seniors deserve.”
FIVE STORIES PRESIDENT TRUMP DOESN'T WANT YOU TO MISS
September Jobs Numbers Best Since Reagan-Era, Don't Panic America
-Fox Business
America added 661,000 jobs last month, according to today’s jobs report, while the unemployment rate fell to 7.9 percent. “You may read elsewhere about an economic slowdown but September’s very positive jobs numbers actually confirm that we are still experiencing the most dynamic economic recovery in American history,” Andy Puzder writes.
BY THE NUMBERS: September Jobs Report Shows American Grit
Cuts in Policing Have 'Led to 710 Murders and More Than 2,800 Gunshot Victims' Across the US
-Daily Mail Online
“Major cities across the United States are seeing a 'dramatic and widespread spikes in homicides' after police funding cuts,” Lauren Fruen reports. University of Utah Law Professor Paul Cassell dubbed this rise in crime the “Minneapolis effect,” explaining that “as a result of de-policing during June and July 2020, approximately 710 additional victims were murdered and more than 2,800 victims were shot.”
Liberals Should Love Amy Coney Barrett
-The Washington Times
“Liberals should love Amy Coney Barrett. As an independent woman who has held prestigious positions in legal academia, private practice and the judiciary, she embodies the ideal of professional excellence for feminists . . . If tenacious women like Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg prepared the way for women to practice law, formidable women like Judge Amy Coney Barrett have paved it,” attorney Kelly Tshibaka writes
NBC News Misrepresents Internal DHS Memo About Their Response to the Kyle Rittenhouse Case
-Townhall
“NBC News misrepresented an internal memo given to Department of Homeland Security officials that was meant to brief them on the Kyle Rittenhouse situation the week it occurred in August. NBC News reported ‘officials were directed to make public comments sympathetic’ about Rittenhouse and it included quotes from the document.” In reality, these “‘sympathetic’ talking points were not talking points at all,” Julio Rosas reports.
Trump Nominated a Third Time for Nobel Peace Prize
The Hill
“President Trump has received a third nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize,” Aris Folley reports. “Four Australian law professors recently nominated the president for the high honor, with one of them, David Flint, citing his recent role in helping broker relations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).”

Hi Friends,
This week, New Jersey Democrats passed the most callous and crippling budget is state history.
Governor Murphy cried wolf and duped the New Jersey Supreme Court into letting him borrow nearly $10 billion in the name of the COVID-19 crisis. His pitch to the people of New Jersey was that it was absolutely necessary to saddle future generations with additional debt in order to plug critical budget holes today.
Here is a list of just a few of those critical spending items that Governor Murphy has prioritized in his 2020 budget:
* $4 million in funding for Essex County’s First Tee golf program.
* $1 million for the Hinchliffe Stadium project in Paterson.
* $150,000 to the Thomas Alva Edison Memorial Tower and Museum in Edison.
At the same time, this budget rigs the numbers so many seniors, people with disabilities and low- and middle-income homeowners won’t receive the Homestead property-tax relief benefit.
And even though New Jersey’s private sector has shouldered 100% of the economic impacts of the COVID-19 crisis, with this budget Governor Murphy is telling more than one million students, seniors, commuters, unemployed workers and struggling small businesses owners that it’s not enough. He wants more. As a result, he’s pushing these new tax hikes for this year:
* An income tax on job creators
* An employee payroll tax increase
* An almost 10 cent per gallon tax increase on gas
* A toll increase of approximately 30%, and
* An increased tax on health care plans
In response, NJGOP Chairman Doug Steinhardt offered the following comment:
“Phil Murphy doesn’t get it and doesn’t care. This is the most shocking and callous budget in New Jersey history. Businesses are closing and the unemployment line is growing. Yet, he piles on debt and taxes to feed his liberal wish lists while you try to feed your family.
“New Jersey leads the nation in the outmigration of jobs and people. We have the worst business climate in the region. Republicans have proposed common sense reforms like tax fairness agreements and caps on spending, but they are ignored by Democrats who would rather buy votes with pet projects like sports stadiums and golf programs. We can’t change Trenton’s selfish tax and spend mentality in Court. We’ve tried that. If we’re going to end single party rule in this State, stop self serving politicians, and end Phil Murphy’s dictatorial reign, it has to be on Election Day. Voters need to send in their ballot this year and send Phil Murphy the message that change is coming.”

# Steinhardt smacks Malinowski for taking money originating from corporate PACs
Republicans are disputing Rep. Tom Malinowski’s assertion that his refusal to take corporate PAC money allows him to be independent, saying that he takes lobbyist and leadership PAC contributions that are funded by corporate PACs.
“Congressman Malinowski is peddling a lie to his constituents about his independence and refusal to take corporate PAC money,” said Republican State Chairman Doug Steinhardt. “The truth is, Malinowski takes money from lobbyists and Leadership PACs that are funded by corporate PACs. He has a nearly identical voting record with Nancy Pelosi. He is a career Washington insider who always puts himself first. He is the furthest thing from independent.”
Steinhardt cites a report from the independent Political Money Line that says Malinowski has accepted $138,000 from leadership PACs headed by other Democrats, many of whom accept corporate PAC money.

# Bucco on Budget: ‘That’s Not the New Jersey I Want’
Senator Anthony M. Bucco delivered the following statement on the Senate floor prior to today’s vote on the Fiscal Year 2021 state budget:
Like most people running for elected office, Governor Murphy ran on a platform promising to raise your taxes…and boy has he delivered.
It seems every budget season we hear it’s just one or two or three more tax increases…that’s all we need to fix the problems of our State. So far during Governor Murphy’s tenure we have seen tax and fee increases on:
* personal income
* business income
* employer payroll
* employee payroll
* utilities
* gas
* Uber and ride sharing
* lodging
* health care plans
* hospitals
* nursing homes
* certain business transactions
* sportsmen
Now we are seeing more tax increases supporting this budget either directly or indirectly:
* Directly we have:
* Taxes on businesses
* Taxes on health care
* Taxes on income
Other tax increases that support this budget more indirectly include
* A 500% payroll tax increase that started January 1
* A 30% toll increase in September
* And a 25% gas tax increase on October 1
And while it is not discussed here, there is a projected $900 million increase in employer payroll taxes to rebuild our UI Fund.
And on top of all these new taxes, we have $4.5 billion of additional debt to pay for operating costs and $5 billion of federal funding to address COVID 19. The rich irony is that there is $350 million in spending in this budget to pay down these bonds. For the life of me, I don’t know why we borrowed an extra $350 million so we could give it back.
You would think with all this new money, there wouldn’t be a need for foolish spending cuts?
Yet, there are about one hundred school districts whose aid is being cut. In one district, 240 people were just laid off. But I thought school aid was flat this year? Apparently not for some unfortunate districts.
Astoundingly, even with all this money, the budget today reduces the Governor’s proposed pension payment by more than $100 million.
With all the rhetoric, you would think one thing that everyone is getting is a $500 tax rebate. But the truth is there is NO money at all in this budget for the rebate. All we have is a promise that the check will be coming next year just before reelection. To make matters worse, if you read the fine print, most seniors without children, the poorest of the poor who receive a refundable earned income tax credit, and those who have lost their jobs or businesses and their income this year, won’t even be eligible for the rebate. That’s sad.
And what about all that talk about how hard it was going to be to balance this budget? It couldn’t have been that hard…you found Christmas tree money to make municipal renovations at one town facility;
There’s millions for a golf course subsidy for one favored golf course;
There’s millions for one favored local park;
There’s $15 million for some demolition in Camden to the exclusion of every other community in New Jersey that has their own demolition needs; and
Finally, we have what is being called a record surplus, when truth be told, it’s just part of the 4.5 billion dollars of borrowed money that we will be paying back with interest for at least the next 10 years.
But where are the long-term fixes to things like health care costs that are out of control?
Where are reforms to some of the pension abuses that exist for the well-connected?
Why are we increasing one-shots that destabilize our budget?
Where are the efforts to stop New York from overtaxing New Jersey residents and keeping money that belongs to us?
Just like years gone by, you took the easy way out!!!
No hard choices — just more taxes, debt, and spending, making NJ one of the most expensive states in the country to live. This budget does nothing to stop families from being broken apart as grandparents are forced to leave, and children don’t return after college.
That’s not the New Jersey I want. I want a better and more affordable future for our families and seniors and this budget just doesn’t get us there.

Hi Friends,
Please see below for a NJGOP update on COVID-19.
A Message From NJGOP Chairman Doug Steinhardt
As a lifelong New Jersey resident and now Chairman of the NJGOP, it’s good to see my President and Governor come together in the thick of this COVID19 crisis. NJ is the among the hardest hit State’s in the Country and we urge you to use your meeting today to do more than just shill for a bailout. Come home with a plan.
Nine million New Jerseyans need answers. Instead, you gave a vague road back, but to where? We need a detailed road forward. One that reflects dates and benchmarks. It is hard for us in NJ to ignore the more detailed plans coming out of the federal government, New York and Pennsylvania. Where is ours?
When you meet with President Trump today, make it substantive, not symbolic. Come home with a plan for saving the State’s failing economy.
What does that plan look like? We need a plan that corrects the overspending that’s plagued Trenton for decades. Work with the President to devise a plan that will provide meaningful economic changes today, not postpone paying for them until tomorrow. Come back with a plan to trim the state’s budget, not increase it. Come back with a plan to shrink state government, not grow it. While you’re at it, come back with a plan to reduce our tax burden, not add to it, fix pensions, not borrow billions to appease public sector labor unions, and improve our worst in the nation’s tax climate by helping small businesses, propping up the middle class, and putting people back to work.
Don’t come back with a road backward. What we did yesterday got us here. Come back with a road forward that has light at the end of the tunnel.
Here's what you need to know today
1\. New Jersey state and county parks will open this Saturday! A special thank you to Senator Steven Oroho, Assemblyman Hal Wirths, Assemblyman Parker Space, Senator Kip Bateman and Assembly Leader Bramnick and Assemblyman Jay. Webber for fighting to get this done.
2\. President Trump signed an Executive Order to preserve the safety of our Nation’s food supply chain during the COVID-19 outbreak. This order directs the Department of Agriculture to ensure America’s meat and poultry processors continue both safe and uninterrupted operations to the maximum extent possible. This action is part of continued efforts by President Trump to support our farmers and make sure Americans have food to put on their tables.
* In March, the President held a teleconference with grocery store executives to ensure essential products and food would remain available and accessible during the outbreak.
* In April, the President announced $16 billion in aid to farmers, ranchers, and food producers who experience economic losses during this pandemic.
* Through the Department of Agriculture, the Administration is purchasing $3 billion in fresh produce, dairy, and meat products of excess supply to assist Americans in need and producers with lost markets.
* Please click here for more information: Fact Sheet
3\. The U.S. Department of the Treasury and the U.S. Small Business Administration released additional guidance regarding the Paycheck Protection Program:
* Joint Statement by Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin and Administrator Jovita Carranza on the Review Procedure for Paycheck Protection Program Loans
* Interim Final Rule on Disbursements
* Frequently Asked Questions (Question 37)
# Thank You Assemblyman Brian Bergen!
Asm. Bergen to introduce legislation restricting emergency executive orders
Assemblyman Brian Bergen is introducing legislation to put a layer of checks and balances on the governor’s ability to enact emergency executive orders.
""The governor's ability to unilaterally impose restrictions on the freedoms of our citizens cannot go unchecked,” said Bergen (R-Morris). “One person with near absolute power is dangerous. Governor Murphy doesn’t even have a problem admitting that he doesn’t consider the Bill of Rights. My legislation will ensure that the governor has the ability to take emergency action, but that action must be reviewed and approved by the legislature within 14 days or it will expire.""
The governor’s emergency powers are defined in the Disaster Control Act to assist with a war effort, and was expanded to provide for civil defense and natural and unnatural disasters.
The state Supreme Court warned in Worthington v. Fauver, 1982, that “These emergency powers represent an extraordinary delegation of authority by the Legislature to the Executive. Because of the extraordinary nature of that authority, the executive orders must not only bear a rational relationship to the goal of protecting the public, but their scope must not exceed the extent of the emergency.”
According to Bergen, the steps Gov. Phil Murphy has taken have crossed that line.
“Right now, the governor is picking winners and losers in the business community,” said Bergen. “He is allowing box stores to remain open while shuttering main street businesses. You can buy a bike from Target but not your local bike shop; you can pave a road but not a driveway; you can buy a sandwich but not ice cream. Governor Murphy is making these decisions in a bubble with no checks and balances. That needs to end now and should never be allowed to happen again.""
Bergen’s legislation would require legislative review after 14 days of any executive order and would not allow an executive order to extend beyond that point without the affirmation of the legislature.
""The legislature is the lawmaking body of the state, and no governor should be able to trump all state, county and municipal law with the stroke of a pen without those actions being reviewed and approved by the legislature,"" concluded Bergen.

Hi Friends,
Please see below for a NJGOP update on COVID-19.
A Message From NJGOP Chairman Doug Steinhardt
Good afternoon everyone,
I hope everyone is staying healthy and safe during these difficult times.
Today, I want to highlight two Republicans from our New Jersey Senate caucus that have taken up the important cause of reclaiming pharmaceutical leadership and divesting from Chinese pharmaceuticals. New Jersey has the infrastructure and brainpower to immediately take on greater pharmaceutical manufacturing. We have a patriotic duty to make that happen and protect ourselves from China.
The NJGOP called on our leaders to act, and now they have.
Please read Senator Mike Testa's initiative here: NJ Must Stop Investing in Chinese Pharmaceutical Companies
and please read Senator Declan O'Scanlon's press release here: Time for New Jersey to Reclaim Manufacturing/Pharmaceutical Industry Leadership Role
Here's what you need to know today
The Trump Administration is working around the clock to deliver CARES Act funding with unprecedented speed and accuracy to local governments, small businesses, and working Americans impacted by the coronavirus epidemic. The Department of the Treasury launched a web portal to facilitate the disbursement of CARES Act funding to State, Local, and Tribal governments.
Additionally, the Treasury Department released an updated Paycheck Protection Program FAQ Sheet. President Trump continues to call on Congress to replenish the Paycheck Protection Program that is supporting hundreds of thousands of small businesses and millions of Americans.
Finally, this week alone over 80 million eligible Americans are set to receive direct payments– providing immediate economic relief for families during the coronavirus outbreak.
GET THE FACTS!
Small businesses in New Jersey have received 17,187 loans totaling nearly $6 billion to help keep their companies afloat during the coronavirus pandemic, thanks to the Paycheck Protection Program signed into law by President Trump.
Small businesses are the backbone of the American economy, and during these trying times it is crucial that employers are able to stay in business as we slow the spread of the virus.
Under the Paycheck Protection Program, the Trump Administration made nearly $350 billion available to small businesses across America. President Trump is working tirelessly to ensure employers and employees remain secure by providing much needed financial assistance.
Bottom Line: President Trump has shown swift and decisive leadership and is committed to providing relief to small businesses.

Friend,
We're in the final stretch. Election day is less than 40 days away and our team has ONE FINAL DEADLINE. This one is important.
Midnight on September 30th is our final End-of-Quarter deadline
I am challenging us to raise another $10,000 before midnight on September 30th. Can you help us reach our goal?

Just last month, the Democrats and Governor Murphy passed another unconstitutional law MANDATING that we vote-by-mail in November's election.
Our team immediately filed a lawsuit in Federal Court alongside President Trump's team and the Republican National Committee.
We know the Democrats are trying to silence our voices and steal this election. They must be stopped.
We are counting on your support. Will you consider contributing $5, $10, or $15 today?
Sincerely,
Doug Steinhardt
Chairman

"SAVE THE DATE - STATEWIDE LEADERSHIP SUMMIT IN AC View this email in your browser
Hi Friends,
For those of you who I have not had the chance to meet, I am Phil Valenziano, the new Executive Director of the New Jersey Republican State Committee.
By way of background, I served as Campaign Manager for Assemblyman Jay Webber’s 2018 campaign for Congress, worked for Governor Chris Christie, Governor Kim Reynolds, Governor & Ambassador Terry Branstad, and Senator Mitt Romney.
I grew up in New Jersey and I am excited to come home and help Chairman Steinhardt fight for honest answers to our state’s real problems.
Evidence that Governor Murphy’s policies are choking the life out of New Jersey continues to mount. Earlier this week, a United Van Lines study found that, for the second consecutive year, more residents moved out of New Jersey than any other state in America. And just today, an analysis of Internal Revenue Service data by the NJBIA confirmed that outmigration cost New Jersey billions of tax dollars in 2017-2018.
“No one in New Jersey needs a study to know that their family members, friends and neighbors are leaving the state,” said NJGOP Chairman Steinhardt, “the countless ‘for sale’ signs, ‘for rent’ signs and Facebook relationships prove that. All this data just confirms what is a painful truth; Phil Murphy’s New Jersey is weaker and poorer. It’s astounding that our Governor can look at these facts and still refuse to acknowledge there is a problem with his liberal agenda.”

🔦 Legislature Spotlight Of The Week 🔦
Contentious N.J. independent contractors bill won’t get vote before session ends next week S4204
S4204 which Democrat leaders were trying to pass quickly during a lame duck session of the legislature, will not get a vote when the session ends. If passed, this independent contractor law would've delivered a death blow to workers and employers in the gig economy. This means that Uber drivers, truck drivers, freelance writers, home health workers, house cleaners, photographers and an endless list of other workers who provide supplemental and sometimes full income to their families will be shut out. They’re out of business. According to the Westfield Leader, it was forced to end its freelance program after the New Jersey Department of Labor fined the paper’s publisher going back to 2015 for not treating freelance reporters and photographers as employees.
Chairman Steinhardt and Republican legislative leaders have been vocal opponents of efforts by Democrats in the Legislature to codify through S-4204 the Murphy Administration’s treatment of independent contractors as employees under State [[URL REDACTED]] the Governor’s direction, the State has fined a variety of businesses and services, including Uber, that have allowed freelancers and independent contractors the freedom to work when they want and the opportunity to earn extra income at their own pace.
NJGOP Chairman Doug Steinhardt offered the following comment regarding the Democrat push to pass S4204.
“Governor Phil Murphy might as well be called Fix-It-Phil, because the fix is in, again. Fix-it-Phil has made it crystal clear to New Jersey businesses and families that his political agenda trumps their well-being. No matter how strong the American economy is, Fix-it-Phil won’t let the State’s residents reap the benefits. Instead of finding creative ways to put people to work, Fix-it-Phil will shut down an entire section of the State’s economy; one that benefits hundreds of thousands of businesses and families each year.
“Fighting back against S4204 and Phil Murphy isn’t about party politics, it’s about protecting our businesses and families from a backwards approach to government that is strangling the economy and killing economic opportunity. We’re launching this petition to send Fix-It-Phil a message. Tell him to stop passing laws that break up our families and bankrupt our businesses. That’s not stronger and fairer, it’s weaker and poorer, and we can do better.”

Hi Friends,
We hope everyone is staying safe, healthy.
NJGOP Chairman Doug Steinhardt released the following statement in response to Governor Murphy pointing fingers at the federal government for New Jersey’s poor economic outlook:
“The NJGOP joins Governor Phil Murphy in seeking the dollars New Jersey needs to recover from the COVID19 crisis. New Jersey businesses and families are struggling in one of the hardest hit states in the country, and we are facing some hard truths as a result.
“There is no truth, however, in the Governor’s attempts to lay blame for the consequences of the State’s economic crisis at the feet of the federal government. If it happens that New Jersey is forced to lay-off teachers, cops, firefighters and paramedics, the very people who are on the front lines fighting this pandemic, those consequences were facilitated over decades by a Democrat controlled legislature and for the last two and half years by a Governor whose spending was unrestrained.
“New Jerseyans have been paying more than their fair share of taxes for a long time, and it’s right that those dollars come back home. But, they need to be used responsibly, to prop up failing businesses and hungry families, not to justify or prop up a bloated spending system that was broken long before the COVID19 crisis came along and exposed it.”

# GOP: Don’t let Murphy raise your taxes and borrow billions
By NJGOP Chairman Doug Steinhardt
Almost one year ago, Moody’s Investor Service published a report that warned New Jersey is the least prepared state in America to handle a recession. They specifically cited small cash reserves and our enormous pension liability as the main reasons for our vulnerability. Then, this week, amid the economic fallout of the coronavirus, Moody’s lowered New Jersey’s outlook to “negative” and warned “significantly reduced liquidity levels"" and increased cash-flow borrowing could spur a credit downgrade. Sadly, New Jerseyans are accustomed to bleak outlooks of our state’s economic forecast. However, it is avoidable.

📈📊📉Polling Update!
Monmouth University released a poll this week that showed continued momentum for the NJGOP. Coming off our largest legislative gains in 28 years, we are well positioned to be competitive in our swing Congressional districts and help deliver a House majority for President Trump.
The cumulative generic ballot margin in the state’s five competitive House districts is 46 percent Republican to 45 percent Democrat. At this point two years ago, Democrats in those five combined districts had a seven-point lead.

# Senator Michael Testa: Calls for Investigation of NJDOC’s Mishandling of COVID-19 Response
Senator Michael Testa (LD-1) renewed his call for the New Jersey Department of Corrections to implement extensive COVID-19 management plans. The Senator is seeking an immediate investigation of the NJDOC’s overall handling of virus infections within the system.
Sen. Testa said the New Jersey Department of Correction must take immediate steps to protect inmates and correction officers from the coronavirus with a comprehensive COVID-19 management plan. (Flickr)
“The Department of Corrections has failed to protect its inmates, correction officers and the communities where the officers live with their families,” said Senator Testa. “It is indefensible. Due to close confines and the extremely viral nature of COVID-19, the health of all who work or are incarcerated in NJDOC’s facilities must be the highest priority. This is a potentially fatal illness that must be contained effectively.”
On March 31, Senator Testa demanded that the NJDOC do a better job protecting corrections officers and their families amid the COVID-19 pandemic. He has called on the department to enact a variety of measures to help slow the spread in state prisons.
“My urging for a comprehensive coronavirus plan has been ignored,” Senator Testa said. “It is time to investigate the department’s laissez faire approach now, before we have a full-blown crisis in our prisons.”
According to reports, at least 14 State prisoners have died from coronavirus.
Senator Testa noted that New Jersey’s COVID-19 dashboard now includes a section on Long Term Care facilities and calls for the prison system data to be included in the dashboard.
Recently, allegations surfaced that a South Jersey Corrections officer was denied a test for coronavirus.
“As the world continues to learn how to deal with this pandemic, our Freeholder Board is increasingly concerned with the health and safety of our corrections officers. We consider them to be first responders who are entitled to be tested at our drive-through testing facility located at Rowan College of South Jersey – Cumberland Campus in Vineland,” stated Cumberland Freeholder Director Joseph Derella.
To receive testing, individuals must be symptomatic and request an appointment to be screened by completing the form at [[URL REDACTED]] or calling (856) 451-4700.
Senator Testa is sponsoring legislation, S-2359, which would require the New Jersey Department of Health to conduct coronavirus disease 2019 testing for first responders, including Correction Officers.
“Our nurses and doctors, first responders, and law enforcement should never be denied testing, especially when they believe they are symptomatic,” Testa added. “They are on the front lines each and every day. They 100 percent deserve our protection from coronavirus.”

"It's time we expose Phil Murphy for what he is.  View this email in your browser
Friend,
Since the beginning, it's been clear that Phil Murphy is faking his way through the COVID Crisis. At a time when the livelihood of New Jersey families and businesses are at risk, we deserve better.
Whistleblowers from inside the Murphy Administration continue to raise concerns, calling Murphy's leadership "" an unmitigated failure"" that has led to ""preventable deaths"".
Meanwhile, Murphy is avoiding questions after he violated his own Executive Order.
It's time we expose Murphy for what he is. NJGOP has launched a new website to hold him accountable.
While Murphy is more worried about public perception than PPE and media coverage than medical expertise, we must stand up for New Jersey families that have been put at risk due to Murphy's lack of leadership.
>> Donate $10, $25 or $30 toward our campaign to expose Phil Murphy today!
For months, Phil Murphy has been winging his way through the COVID Crisis, basing the future of New Jersey on what his gut tells him to do on any given day. We must put an end to it.
Sincerely,
Team NJGOP

Senate President Steve Sweeney and Senate Republican Leader Tom Kean issued the following joint statement today announcing revisions to the Senate’s scheduled proceedings in response to the coronavirus pandemic:
“This is a rapidly-expanding public health crisis unlike any we have experienced that presents unique challenges for public health professionals, the medical community, government leaders, local communities and the public. We must work together to protect the health and safety of the people of New Jersey, to prevent the spread of the coronavirus and to minimize the impact and the consequences of the pandemic.
“There are policy actions we can take in the Legislature but it is our responsibility to move forward on these initiatives in ways that protect the public, legislators and staff. We have work to do, but we must safeguard the workplace as we do it.
“The Senate committees’ proceedings for Monday will be revised to help protect the health of the public. The committee sessions will go on as scheduled but members of the public will not be allowed to attend the meetings themselves. The sessions will remain accessible to the public via the live audio service on the Office of Legislative Services’ website and anyone who wants to submit written testimony should do so ahead of the committee meeting so that it may be considered by the committee and included in the committee’s record.
“Testimony can be submitted to the email contact on each committee agenda. The committee meetings will be open to credentialed members of the press corps.
“This is similar to actions taken by Congress and other states, including the Maine Legislature, to protect the public and allow the governing bodies to act on legislation to respond to the crisis.”--

Friend,
All eyes are on New Jersey as we approach some of the most competitive Congressional races in America this fall. Everything is on the line in November, not only for Republicans in my Seventh District, but for our whole New Jersey Republican Team up and down the ballot.
The path to the House Majority runs right through New Jersey, and while the Democrats trip over each other to appease the Radical Left, Garden State Republicans stand united for our New Jersey values as we head into the General Election. We’re strongest when we stand together.
But we need your help to win, which is why I’m writing to you today: we’re counting on you. Will you donate today and stand with us? Every dollar you can give gets us one step closer to a NJ GOP win. And a win for New Jersey Republicans is not just a win for New Jersey: it’s a win for America, and New Jersey can lead the way to a brighter future.
CONTRIBUTE HERE
Across the board, New Jersey has an impressive group of top-notch candidates who are strong challengers against Democrats who claimed to be “Moderate Democrats,” then as soon as they arrived in Washington voted with huge Liberals like Nancy Pelosi and AOC nearly 100% of the time.
That’s not moderation: that’s extreme partisan politics, and that’s not representative of our New Jersey values.
But our NJGOP Team has a plan to win and a path to get there, but we need your support today if we’re going to make victory a reality.
We need to Get Out the Vote (GOTV). We need boots on the ground. We need our grassroots army making phone calls, sending peer-to-peer text messages, mailing literature or walking door-to-door to drop it off in person, waving signs, and the list goes on and on and on.
But we need donations to fund these efforts which support challengers like me taking on incumbent Democrats and support our Republican incumbents who need to weather the onslaught of false and negative attacks that the Desperate Democratic Party will throw at them to take their seats.
Help fund our grassroots fight right now! New Jersey Republicans need to reach more voters, so please chip in to this special fund split jointly between the NJGOP and my campaign. Chip in whatever you can and give our New Jersey Republican Team a major boost so that we can GOTV and post a larger total vote on Election Day!
DONATE NOW
Thank you for your support of our New Jersey Republican Team. Together, we will win this fall and make history!
Be safe,
Tom Kean
P.S. I know you’re getting a lot of emails right now, and I know what you may be thinking: “I can’t give very much, will it make a difference?” The answer is: yes! Whatever you can give makes a huge difference. Each dollar brings New Jersey Republicans one dollar closer to matching the Democrats, so chip in whatever you can. I appreciate all you’re doing to help our team win!

Friend,
Today, the NJGOP stands together with 1.1 million unemployed New Jersey workers and numerous small businesses owners who have been negatively impacted by Governor Murphy and his Administration.

"Important Must Read! View this email in your browser
Friends,
I hope you all had a great Memorial Day weekend, and kept the memories of all those who have paid the ultimate price to protect our country at the forefront.
Last week the NJGOP joined with small businesses to challenge the Governor's arbitrary closure of certain businesses around the state, but not others. During this challenging time, it is critical that we stand up for the average New Jerseyan, our mom and pop stores, and the main streets across our great state. It's clear the Governor has forgotten those groups, so NJGOP will make sure their voice is heard - in court. Since we filed the lawsuit, we have been overwhelmed with support from all 21 counties. I'd like to wish you all a sincere thank you for your passion, your outreach, and your well wishes as we stand up for our shared values. Below you'll see an op-ed I wrote on the heels of the lawsuit and why it’s so important. I hope you'll give it a quick read.
Today brought us a new week, and with it a new unconstitutional scheme by Governor Murphy. As you'll see below, Governor Murphy and Speaker Coughlin are aiming to further burden our children with debt. We must all join together to oppose this ill conceived, unconstitutional scheme to pad Murphy's budget.
Thank you for being part of the team, and for your continued support.
Sincerely,
Doug Steinhardt
Chairman
Must Read Op-Ed!
Why I decided to sue Governor Murphy | Steinhardt
Accountability is an important lesson. It’s one I learned as a child, from parents who taught me the value of hard work. I taught it to my children, who are 17 and 22 today. And I learned, as the Mayor of my hometown, that you don’t spurn your constituents; they trusted you to lead. Accountability matters.
Unfortunately, too many of the politicians in Trenton don’t understand accountability. They spend money we don’t have, adopt policies we can’t afford, and saddle small businesses with regulations we don’t need. Governor Murphy is one of those politicians.
Covid-19 has challenged leaders in every State, from both parties, in different ways. Forty-nine Governors have outlined economic reopening plans that balance personal and economic health, provide meaningful dates and benchmarks, and recognize the importance of small business, but not Phil Murphy.
New Jerseyans from all over the State reached out to Governor Murphy by letter, email, press conference, and otherwise. In response, he covered his ears, closed his eyes, and told them that their interventions to him don’t matter, “not one little bit.” He reminded us, more than once, that if we don’t like his dictates, we can ”move to another state.”
In times like these, New Jerseyans want accountability, but Phil Murphy avoids it. That is why the NJGOP banded together with small business owners from around the State and filed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the Governor’s executive orders and the over-reach of his executive authority.
The Governor has irreversibly damaged New Jersey small businesses by arbitrarily declaring some essential and others non-essential. While mom and pop barbers, brew pubs, retailers and more are closed and struggling, big box stores, with their big cash cushions, are open and thriving. The Murphy Administration picked economic winners and losers and, by doing so, turned the right to private property into a privilege.
Murphy says the Bill of Rights is “above [his] pay grade,” but it’s not above ours. Our interventions may not matter to him, but they matter to us. This lawsuit lets plaintiffs plead their case to New Jersey’s courts, since New Jerseyans’ pleas to their Governor are largely ignored.
The Governor’s personal wealth may insulate him from the economic side effects of his bad judgment, but our State’s small business owners and 1.1 million unemployed are far less lucky. Worse yet, all of us will pay the price for his bad judgment and fiscal mismanagement long after he’s gone, in November 2021.
We are proud to champion the rights of small business owners and unemployed workers. Let’s just hope that in a state where all three branches of government are controlled by Democrats, one of them starts listening.
Steinhardt Comment On Murphy Borrowing Scheme
Governor Murphy’s administration has announced that unemployment rose by nearly 12% from March to April to 15.3%, and that revenue is down $2.8 billion this fiscal year and an anticipated $7.4 billion for fiscal year 2021. Now Murphy is pushing a multi-billion dollar borrowing scheme as a solution.
Sensible Democrats are understandably distressed over the Governor’s massive spending plan, but despite having handed New Jersey Republicans their biggest legislative gain since 1991, Assembly Speaker Coughlin jumped on board the Murphy plan.
“Some politicians in Trenton will always be owned by the public sector labor unions,” said Chairman Steinhardt. “Governor Murphy and Speaker Coughlin would rather mortgage the State’s future with a multi-billion dollar borrowing scheme than make needed budget cuts that reduce spending and spare taxpayers the added crunch.”
Must See Quotes!
“Last I checked, the State of New Jersey had three branches of government, not one,” Doherty said in a statement Friday. “The governor’s preference to lead via executive order rather than through collaboration with elected legislators has proven to be dangerous and deadly. Our proposal to place limits on executive authority will ensure that the administration is transparent about the continued need for any executive orders that it believes should be extended.”
\- Senator Michael Doherty
# NJ GOP lawmaker: Gov. Phil Murphy is ‘eviscerating’ the Constitution
Bergen’s bill, introduced last Monday in the Assembly, would limit a governor’s emergency orders to just two weeks in duration. At that point, with a few exceptions, an order would remain in effect only after receiving approval from the Legislature.
“New Jersey is a diverse state with vastly different economies and interests depending on the region,” Bergen wrote in explaining his legislation. “The legislature represents every region of the state, and their input is necessary to ensure that a one-size-fits-all approach does not discriminate against New Jersey’s diversity. The vast differences are just too much for the executive office to consider on its own, and this is the fundamental reason for the representative government we have.”

Hi Friends,
A recent report by a federal government watchdog confirmed what the NJGOP has been screaming about for months – Governor Murphy is sitting on almost ALL of the CARES Act money that the federal government sent to New Jersey for COVID-19 relief.
Meanwhile New York has spent 42.3% of its allocation and Pennsylvania spent 28.7%.
NJGOP Chairman Doug Steinhardt released the following statement:
“New Jersey is on fire and Governor Murphy is letting it burn. It has been 127 days since the CARES Act was signed into law, yet Murphy sits on a mountain of money while businesses go under and senior citizens and veterans die in long term care facilities. We have the highest COVID death rate in America, the second highest unemployment rate, and billions of dollars in federal aid being withheld from the millions of New Jerseyans who need them. That’s Phil Murphy’s legacy and it stinks.”
# NJGOP In The News
# N.J. has not spent most of its stimulus money, federal watchdog says
New Jersey Republicans, though, said Murphy already should have distributed a lot more money to help the state recover from the pandemic.
“He’s squirreling away billions for his own purposes while acting like the crumbs he’s doling out through his benevolence are going to save New Jersey,” said state Sen. Michael Doherty, R-Warren, a frequent critic of the governor. “It was supposed to be disbursed quickly to help struggling employers and employees to survive this crisis. He still refuses to do that.”
And state Republican Chairman Doug Steinhardt complained, “Instead of putting that money to use helping struggling small businesses, Murphy is hoarding it hoping he can use it to balance his bloated budget.”

FIVE STORIES PRESIDENT TRUMP DOESN'T WANT YOU TO MISS
Texas Couple Has Saved 68 Lives and Counting With Their COVID-19 Plasma Donations
-Good Morning America
“Brian and Dina Murphy of San Antonio, Texas, have made it their mission to help others by donating plasma to 68 people after both fell ill with [Coronavirus] in March,” Angeline Bernabe writes. “I felt that really, God really saved me and to be a survivor,"" Dina said. “I felt that this is really what he wants me to do—to help others.”
There Is No Substitute for Proactive Policing
-City Journal
“As budget cuts begin to affect police personnel, departments may have to pull officers from proactive activities and place them in response cars to manage the demand for emergency calls,” criminal justice professor William Sousa writes. If 20th-century American history is any guide, “higher rates of crime and disorder will likely result.”
Restoring America's Energy Dominance
-The Marshall News Messenger
“In the very near term, President Trump championed the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) which helped bring the energy industry back from the brink of collapse in the face of plunging prices as a result of the pandemic . . . In the longer term, President Trump has rolled back stifling regulations which have constrained American energy production,” Texas state Rep. Chris Paddie writes.

Hi Friends,
Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been at least 4,151 coronavirus related deaths in New Jersey’s long-term care facilities including many at the state’s only veterans’ nursing home. That represents more than half of all COVID-19 related deaths in New Jersey to date.
It is well documented that since the start of April, Governor Murphy and the New Jersey Department of Health have been ordering nursing homes to accept admissions even if the person was confirmed with a case of COVID19.
Despite pleas and warnings from facility managers, the Murphy Administration has continued to send infectious patients to unprepared facilities.
New Jersey Republican State Committee Chairman Doug Steinhardt is calling for a legislative investigation into this ongoing crisis.
A Message From NJGOP Chairman Doug Steinhardt
Our senior population is the most vulnerable demographic to this pandemic and it appears that Governor Murphy has cost thousands their lives and jeopardized the lives of an untold number more,” said Steinhardt. “The NJGOP calls upon the Senate President and Assembly Speaker to convene swift and thorough hearings into the Administration’s handling of New Jersey’s long term care facilities, what the State knew, when, and why New Jersey’s senior population was exposed to these risks.
Here's what you need to know today
1\. The fifteen members of the Senate Republican caucus urged Governor Phil Murphy to listen to the common concerns that have been raised repeatedly by constituents during the seven weeks that New Jersey has been locked down and to act on proposed recommendations. Read more here...
2\. Assemblyman Gerald Scharfenberger (R-Middletown) has proposed his own plan for re-opening New Jersey during the coronavirus pandemic. Read more here...
3\. President Trump recognized a group of extraordinary nurses and signed a proclamation in honor of National Nurses Day. President Trump will continue to utilize the full power of the federal government to defeat the virus and support our healthcare professionals, and he has already delivered:
* $175 billion in funding for hospitals and other healthcare providers
* Over 75 million N95 respirators
* 120 million surgical masks
* 8 million face shields
* More than 19 million gowns
* Nearly 1 billion gloves
# Pennacchio: State Imposed ‘No Test Order’ for Admission to Nursing Homes
New Jersey Highest in Nation in COVID Deaths at Long-Term Care Facilities
Senator Joe Pennacchio has obtained a letter sent by the New Jersey Department of Health dated March 31 directing hospitals and nursing care facilities not to inhibit transfer of hospital patients with COVID-19 entering post-acute care settings such as long-term nursing and rehabilitations facilities.

"President Trump fighting back with us on Sanctuary State! View this email in your browser
Hi Friends,
It is great to report that President Trump is helping New Jersey fight back against Governor Murphy's Sanctuary State laws.
This week the officially DOJ has filed a federal complaint against Governor Murphy’s Sanctuary State policies.
Here is what Chairman Steinhardt had to say about this:
“Law Enforcement officials in New Jersey put their lives on the line every day to keep our families safe,” said Chairman Steinhardt. “We are proud to stand with President Trump in support of New Jersey’s Law Enforcement community. Phil Murphy may be willing to pay for his progressive platitudes with the health, safety and welfare of New Jersey citizens, but the NJGOP is not. We will continue to rally against the Governor’s reckless Sanctuary State policy.”
The NJGOP and New Jersey Republicans are leading on supporting a healthy workplace environment.
NJGOP Chairman Steinhardt has been a vocal proponent of ensuring that gag orders are barred from any New Jersey Republican political campaign that is supported by the NJGOP. This policy was adopted by Essex and Burlington County GOP Chairmen Barlas and Earlen, too.
Current Republican Gubernatorial candidate, Jack Ciattarelli, announced yesterday that he too will implement a campaign policy prohibiting discrimination, harassment, and retaliation and designated former State Senator Diane Allen as the channel to report alleged misconduct.
In March, the NJGOP will include anti-sexual harassment training at its third annual Statewide Leadership Summit at Harrah’s in Atlantic City.
“Governor Murphy, has failed repeatedly to show leadership and take meaningful steps to expose and combat sexual abuse, harassment and the toxic work environment in his own Party,” said Chairman Steinhardt. “He has offered a shallow apology and empty promises to do better next time, in hopes that we will all just move on. We are not moving on, and it is important that the GOP lead the way and set an example that will lead to a long-term culture change in Trenton and around the State.”
Many reported sources are describing what can only be described as a cover up by Governor Murphy and his Administration.
It has been reported that confidentiality agreements are keeping five women from disclosing details of a “hostile and toxic” Murphy for Governor campaign.
Other sources confirm they had personally spoken to both the Governor and the First Lady about the toxic work environment on his campaign and specific incident of sexual harassment.
Just two days ago, Murphy doubled down on his insistence to maintain gag orders on his campaigns.
The Murphy Administration has also yet to respond to NJGOP OPRA requests regarding Adam Alonso, who was recently separated from the DNC and the Murphy campaign for driving a toxic work environment.

Senator Tom Kean (R-21)
S-278 Supports Veterans Seeking Higher Education
Kean’s legislation would require New Jersey’s public colleges and universities to refund course tuition and fees to military members called to duty during a school semester.
“Going to school while serving is a difficult undertaking in itself, let alone trying to manage the traditional college semester timeline around deployment dates and other military obligations,” said Kean. “New Jersey should do everything in its power to be more accommodating to the brave men and women who are willing to put their lives on the line to protect our freedoms. Offering military members the flexibility to register late for classes and refunds for course tuition that conflicts with deployments is a small way to express our gratitude to those who have sacrificed so much to defend our country.”

Friend,
The Department of Justice announced yesterday that they have begun the first phase of a federal investigation into the actions of the Murphy Administration that lead to the deaths of over 7,000 seniors and veterans across New Jersey.
Throughout the COVID Crisis, the Murphy Administration has held back information and made decisions that harmed our most vulnerable.
The Murphy Administration's decision to send COVID-positive patients to long term care facilities against CDC guidance lead to the deaths of thousands of New Jerseyans who should have never been in danger.
This is yet another failure of the Murphy Administration. Phil Murphy is unfit to run our state and continues to harm the livelihoods of our friends, families and neighbors. New Jersey deserves better.
Sincerely,
NJGOP Watch Dog

Hi Friends,
Governor Murphy is telling a massive $1.8 billion lie. While he squirrels away nearly $2B in CARES Act funding, millions of New Jersey businesses and residents are struggling.
At one of his daily press briefings just over a week ago, Murphy claimed, “Treasury’s guidance renders much of this funding literally unusable, and without additional flexibility, will mean we will likely not be able to use it, but we’ll have to return a good chunk of it to the federal government.”
However, guidance from the Federal Treasury Department states clearly that these funds can be used to help struggling small businesses. Section 5 of this document reads as follows:
Eligible expenditures include, but are not limited to, payment for:
Expenses associated with the provision of economic support in connection with the COVID-19 public health emergency, such as:
* Expenditures related to the provision of grants to small businesses to reimburse the costs of business interruption caused by required closures.
Since receiving CARES act funding, Governor Murphy set up just one, $5 million small business grant through the New Jersey Economic Development Authority. After an hour, over 10,000 businesses applied, and over the next week, another 22,000 battered, New Jersey businesses submitted applications. According to this report, though, only 1,250 to 2,000 small businesses will actually receive any grant money. Meanwhile, Governor Murphy is holding back $1.8 billion that could be allocated to the remaining. 30,000+ applicants.
A Message From NJGOP Chairman Doug Steinhardt
Governor Murphy is sitting on a nearly $2 billion mountain of money that could save New Jersey small businesses, and he’s lying to all of us about it,” said NJGOP Chairman Steinhardt. “The CARES Act was meant to help people who are directly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic like frontline medical workers, small business owners and their employees, and people infected with COVID-19. But instead of putting that money to use helping struggling small businesses, Murphy is hoarding it hoping he can use it to balance his bloated budget. New Jerseyans should demand that the Governor send that money where it belongs, to create jobs, save businesses and help New Jersey’s nearly 1 million unemployed.
Last night, we were pleased to be joined by the RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel in our first Virtual NJGOP event. Chairwoman McDaniel updated us on the President's campaign, the historic organizing and fundraising success of the RNC and Trump campaign, and made sure we all knew how important success in New Jersey this fall is to taking back the House of Representatives. We were honored to have her join us.
Here's what you need to know today
1\. China's Coronavirus Lies Pile Up
“A Department of Homeland Security analysis has concluded that China hid the early spread of the coronavirus so it could hoard medical equipment, keeping it from other countries that would have bought it if they had known of the danger that was coming their way from Wuhan,” the Washington Examiner editorial board writes.
“Specifically, DHS found, with 95% statistical confidence, that changes to China's personal protective equipment import and export behavior were highly abnormal and not random.”

2\. As a result of the Trump Administration’s efforts, the Paycheck Protection Program is effectively providing a lifeline to America’s small businesses and their employees during the COVID-19 pandemic.
* Since the launch of the Paycheck Protection Program, SBA has processed over 3.8 million loans for more than half a trillion dollars of economic support in less than one month.
* Nearly 500,000 of the PPP loans were made by lenders with less than $1 billion in assets and non-bank lenders.
* President Trump secured an additional $320 billion in funding to ensure a second round of PPP relief would be accessible for America’s small businesses. In the second round of the Paycheck Protection Program:
* 2.2 million loans have been processed, worth more than $175 billion.
* The average loan is $79,000, exhibiting that PPP is truly aiding the smallest of small businesses.

# Senator Declan O'Scanlon: NJ's COVID-19 federal grant strategy is failing
Gov. Murphy has been raising concerns that almost $2 billion from a federal grant provided to New Jersey under the federal CARE Act will do nothing to help offset New Jersey's massive loss of state budget revenues due to COVID-19. He has not released the funds and is hoping to use them for nothing more than replacing lost state revenue.

Hi Friends,
The NJGOP is joining Donald J. Trump for President, Inc. and the Republican National Committee and filed suit this past Tuesday night to invalidate Governor Phil Murphy’s Executive Order 177. This unconstitutional order establishes an all vote by mail scheme that violates New Jerseyans’ 14th Amendment right to vote, as well as the Elections and Electors Clauses of the U.S. Constitution. This unlawful power grab by New Jersey Democrats has demonstrably opened up to fraud the State’s election system and will lead to the widespread disenfranchisement of New Jersey voters.
NJGOP Chairman Doug Steinhardt offered the following comment:
“Phil Murphy has ravaged our constitutional rights, upended our economy and sacrificed the health of our veterans and senior citizens. The NJGOP will not let him hijack our right to send his party a message this November, too. We will always fight for free, fair and open elections where every person who is legally entitled to vote can do so.
“Today, we have joined forces with Donald J. Trump for President Inc. and the Republican National Committee, and are once again being represented locally by attorney and State Senator Michael Testa, Jr., opposing Governor Phil Murphy’s all vote by mail scheme in its entirety on the grounds that Executive Order 177 is beyond the scope of powers granted to the Governor under the Elections and Electors Clauses of the U.S. Constitution, and because we reject any system that makes universal vote by mail standard and in person voting provisional.
“We said every option was on the table. We picked one. Governor Murphy, we’ll see you in court, again.”

FIVE STORIES PRESIDENT TRUMP DOESN'T WANT YOU TO MISS
Education Cannot Be Paused for a Pandemic
-The Hill
“More than our physical health is being affected by this novel coronavirus. With the nation moving towards virtual living to continue social distancing, we are risking under-educating a generation. Children need the option to have an in-person education,” physician and Congressman Michael Burgess writes.
AG Barr Says Feds Have Made Nearly 1,500 Arrests in ‘Operation Legend’
-New York Post
“Attorney General William Barr said Wednesday that federal agents helped make 1,485 arrests as part of the nine-city anti-violent-crime Operation Legend . . . Barr said federal charges can put away violent criminals for longer periods of time. He slammed what he said are often soft penalties in local cases,” Steven Nelson reports.
Blackouts Expose Perils and Costs of California’s ‘Electrify Everything’ Push
-Forbes
“The blackouts that hit California over the past few days exposed the fragility of one of the most-expensive and least-reliable electric grids in North America. They also show that California’s grid can’t handle the load it has now, much less accommodate the enormous amount of new demand that would have to be met if the state attempts to ‘electrify everything’” relying solely upon renewable energy, Robert Bryce writes.
Trump Right to Back Arms Embargo on Iran, a Dangerous State Sponsor of Terrorism
-Fox News
“Iran is the chief threat to stability in the Middle East. A stable Middle East is important to America’s interests. From the start, Trump has sought to rebalance U.S. commitments . . . Unlike Obama, Trump is smart enough to know disengaging from the region is even worse, leaving open running for the likes of Iran,” James Jay Carafano writes.
How to Set World Trade Straight
-The Wall Street Journal
The World Trade Organization “needs new rules to stop the economic distortions that flow from China’s state capitalism. It’s impossible to sustain public confidence in an international trade system when nonmarket practices destroy prospects for workers and businesses around the world,” U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer writes.

Hi Friends,
According to a recent report, New Jersey has spent less than 10% of the almost $2.4 billion it has received from the federal government.
NJGOP Chairman Doug Steinhardt released the following statement:
“Andy Kim, Josh Gottheimer, Tom Malinowski and Mikie Sherrill are completely feckless. They voted for the CARES act to ensure New Jersey’s small businesses stayed open, workers got paid and our healthcare system and frontline medical workers were supported. None of that has been accomplished because these weak leaders did little more than show up, press a green button and go home. Not one of them has had the courage to stand up to Governor Murphy and see through ensuring their districts received the support their tax dollars are paying for.
“Instead of putting that money to use helping struggling small businesses, Murphy is hoarding it hoping he can use it to balance his bloated budget. New Jersey’s federal delegation should be banging on Murphy’s door, demanding that the Governor send that money where it belongs, to create jobs, save businesses and help New Jersey’s nearly 1 million unemployed.”

Congress Jeff Van Drew
2nd Congressional District
Congressman Van Drew’s bold decision to join the Republican Party immediately made him one of the top targets of Nancy Pelosi and the national Democrat Party. Jeff’s Democrat challenger is Amy Kennedy, the wife of former Congressman Patrick Kennedy and daughter-in-law of the late Senator Ted Kennedy, which has already resulted in money pouring in from all over the country to support the latest Kennedy seeking elected office. However, Kennedy enters the General Election carrying half a million in debt after a bitter and divisive Democrat Primary that exposed vulnerabilities like her family profiting half a million dollars a year from their non-profit mental health policy forum.
Jeff is a winner and perfectly fits his blue collar hard-working district: he has won more than fifteen general elections in South Jersey over the last three decades and even the DCCC’s internal, post-primary polling acknowledges Van Drew leading Kennedy and President Trump winning the district like he did in 2016.
SUPPORT CONGRESSMAN JEFF VAN DREW!

"This district is THE MOST COMPETITIVE DISTRICT in the state of New Jersey.  View this email in your browser
,
All eyes are on the Garden State as we approach one of the most pivotal elections of our lifetime.
Everything is on the line this November, not only for Republicans in the Third District, but for our whole New Jersey Republican Team up and down the ballot.
NJ-03 is THE MOST COMPETITIVE DISTRICT in the state of New Jersey. In 2018, this race came down to less than 4,000 VOTES -- that’s less than 1% of all votes cast.
HELP US FLIP NJ-03 RED!
This election is a once-in-a-generation event. The stakes have never meant so much and the cost of failing to act has never been so high. The path to the House Majority runs right through NJ-03, , and we’re one of THE BEST pick up opportunities in the country for the GOP.
I’m running in NJ-03 to flip this seat RED AGAIN and put a stop to leftist Andy Kim. Across New Jersey there are Republicans in competitive races and they all need our help to put a stop to the radical left’s onslaught of dark money donors.
HELP US FLIP NJ-03 RED!
Every dollar donated helps get out the vote, it helps us make phone calls to spread our conservative message, it helps send text messages, it helps order more literature and yard signs, the list goes on but we can’t do it without your help!
HELP US FLIP NJ-03 RED
$250
$100

That’s why we are reaching out to you today. Can you chip in right now to our General Election victory fund? Every donation received will be equally split between my campaign and the NJGOP.
HELP US FLIP NJ-03 RED!
We can make history, , can we count you in?

Hi Friends,
Democrat politicians in Trenton have come together on yet another income tax and another election year tax gimmick.
Check out this quote from NJGOP Chairman Steinhardt responding to the new tax:
“Blink and you’ll miss the next Trenton tax hike. That’s how fast Phil Murphy and his Democrats are spending your money. Let’s be clear, these newest tax schemes will land in the same place every other Democratic tax scheme lands: in the pockets of New Jersey’s middle class. At a time when Trenton should practice restraint and find creative ways to spend less so you can save more, they don’t, can’t and won’t. NJGOP will continue the fight for leadership that will have the government give back to the people when times are tough, not ask even more of our overburdened citizens.”

# Bucco: Murphy Shouldn’t Divert Clean Communities Funding & Undo Decades of Environmental Progress
Senator Anthony M. Bucco said Governor Phil Murphy shouldn’t divert budget funds that have been dedicated for decades to a statewide litter abatement program that has helped to clean-up New Jersey while providing savings for property taxpayers.
“Over the past several decades, New Jersey has made great strides through the Clean Communities program to collect litter, educate residents, and protect our environment,” said Bucco (R-25). “The program has been so successful that no governor or Legislature has proposed cutting funding over the past two decades, even in the toughest of fiscal times. I’m sure that if Governor Murphy takes the time to examine the many successes of Clean Communities, he’ll understand why there has long been bipartisan opposition to raiding the program’s dedicated funds for other purposes.”
Clean Communities is New Jersey’s only statewide, comprehensive, litter abatement program. The program provides grants to municipalities and counties, allowing local governments to fund trash cleanups along roadsides and around stormwater drains without imposing an additional burden on property taxpayers.

In his FY 2021 State Budget proposal, Governor Murphy proposed diverting $10 million from Clean Communities — half of the program’s annual funding — to support unrelated executive branch payroll expenses.
“Everyone’s budgets are tight these days, but that doesn’t mean we should gut funding for a program that has continually produced such an amazing benefit for both the New Jersey environment and our property taxpayers,” added Bucco. “I urge the governor to rethink his budget and join us in protecting New Jersey Clean Communities.”
A recent editorial by Pat Ryan, the first president of the New Jersey Clean Communities Council, highlighted the massive long-term environmental progress achieved by the Clean Communities program and called for the funding to be restored.
