Friend,
Did you see Governor Holcomb take the debate stage on Tuesday?
He laid out a bold vision of what One Indiana for All looks like and talked about all the progress we’ve made over the last four years.
Watch the Debate
Watch the Debate
“I want to thank every Hoosier watching tonight, as it’s they who helped create such positive, forward momentum over the last four years.” - Governor Eric Holcomb
He spoke at length about recovering from the pandemic, dropping our infant mortality rate to an all-time low, increasing adoptions, building a record-breaking economy, and bringing huge numbers of jobs to our state.
It was a great moment for our campaign, and all Hoosier voters should take a moment to hear what the Governor had to say about our state. We’re facing a crucial choice in less than two weeks, and it’s never been more important to stay on top of the key issues.
Want to catch up on what Governor Holcomb said about supporting small businesses, funding our schools, and why he’s the right leader to continue getting Indiana back on track?
Make sure you watch a replay of the debate below!

We hope you take some time to watch the debate — you’ll be hearing from us soon!

What does that mean? It means we need every single Hoosier who wants to keep building One Indiana for All to go all-in for Governor Holcomb from today through November 3rd.
Alternate text
Friend, the stakes are high in 2020 and we need experienced, steady leadership more than ever.
We can’t take anything for granted and we need to push hard in the final sprint to Election Day. Building One Indiana for All isn’t going to be easy — it’s going to take all of us, working together to create a brighter and better future for our state.
Re-electing Eric is the first step toward reaching the goal of One Indiana for All.
Eric made it clear during the first debate that he’s the right choice to lead Indiana into the future, and he’s set to do it again tomorrow. But he can’t win this thing without your help, friend.

Eric Holcomb for Indiana
Friend,
The last few months have been challenging — there’s no doubt about it.
But I’ve been amazed by the resiliency and strength that I’ve seen from Hoosiers across our state. We’ve truly come together as One Indiana, and it’s been inspiring to see up close.
We have a long way to go, but friend, we’re going to come back stronger than ever before.
I’m excited about our future, and I can’t wait to work with you for another four years and build One Indiana that delivers the promise of the American dream to every Hoosier who wants it.
But I can’t do it alone — I’m going to need your support, and the support of thousands of Hoosiers like you who believe in our mission.
That’s why I’m reaching out and asking you to make an investment in our campaign before the month ends on July 31. If you want to help me keep building One Indiana, make sure we have the resources we need over the next three months of this campaign by donating any amount using the link below.

Eric Holcomb for Indiana
Friends,
Governor Holcomb shared some BIG news today.
As you know, he’s been looking at the health data – and together, we’ve made progress. Our state’s 7-day positivity rate has dropped to 3.9%.
And with that progress comes the news that:
Indiana is entering into Stage 5 of Governor Holcomb’s Back on Track Plan.
Governor Holcomb explains what this means for Hoosiers:
Watch and Share
WATCH: Governor Holcomb Explains Stage 5
Here’s a quick breakdown:
* Continue to maintain social distancing
* Wash your hands and stay home if you’re sick
* Events of more than 500 people must receive sign-off from local health department on written plan
* Full capacity: restaurants, bars and nightclubs (with social distancing)
* Bar patrons must use seating
* Personal services and fitness centers may resume normal operations
* Size limitations removed for social gatherings and meetings
* Indoor and outdoor venues open at full capacity

Stage 5 begins this Saturday. Together as Hoosiers, we’ve made it to Stage 5 because of your commitment to our state – which includes your continued efforts to make smart choices about your health and the health of your friends, neighbors, coworkers and fellow Hoosiers.
We cannot stop now. COVID-19 is not over.
So, Hoosiers, let’s all keep doing our part.
“We ought to be real proud to be Hoosiers in this state… When you think about where we are compared to a lot of other states… We don’t get here by accident. We got here by working together…” – Governor Eric Holcomb

"We LOVE Hoosier BBQ here at the Holcomb Crew, and have tried quite a few places in Indiana.
One Indiana: BBQ
Friend,
Summer is in full swing, and that means it’s time for BBQ.
We LOVE Hoosier BBQ here at the Holcomb Crew, and so does Eric. After all, who can resist the smell of pork, brisket and chicken in the smoker? So as Indiana re-opens, we wanted to share with you a list of some of Eric’s favorite places to chow down on slow-cooked meats.
Restaurants are starting to reopen, and we can safely support them! Remember — as you start to patronize your favorite restaurants and local businesses, be sure to check the Indiana State Department of Health website. Local leaders and the businesses in your community might have additional requirements, too, so be sure to check with them, and please follow all guidelines.
Check out our list, and let us know if we missed your favorite spot.
One Indiana: BBQ
* Squealers, Indianapolis and Mooresville \- Some of the best BBQ in the whole state, don’t miss out on trying their award-winning brisket and ribs!
* Doc’s Smokehouse, Dyer \- They know the true meaning of low and slow. Their hickory-smoked BBQ is mouthwatering, smoky goodness, and one of our absolute favorites!
* Bird's Smokehouse BBQ, Daleville \- Follow your nose on I-69, and you'll find yourself in a large log cabin in Daleville with perfectly smoked meats.
* Big Hoffa’s, Westfield \- They smoke both their brisket and their pork for more than 24 [[URL REDACTED]] said. You gotta check it out.
* King Ribs, Indianapolis \- One of the first BBQ restaurants in Indiana! When you get to the drive-through, be prepared for a long line (it’s worth it).
* Shigs in Pit, Fort Wayne \- Born out of a competition BBQ team, Shigs serves up award-winning BBQ and their founders still compete in contests across the Midwest.
* Rick’s Smokehouse BBQ & Grill, Terre Haute \- Back in the 90s, you might have had Rick’s meats at the Parke County Covered Bridge Festival. Today you’ll find his BBQ full-time in Terre Haute!
* Firehouse BBQ and Blues, Richmond \- This is absolutely one of Indiana’s most unique restaurants and a great place to get a bite. And, yes, it’s inside an actual firehouse!
* Porky’s BBQ, Paoli \- Come enjoy some of Indiana’s finest BBQ outdoors!
* Legends of Notre Dame, South Bend \- Right on Notre Dame’s campus, this classic Hoosier eatery serves thousands of hungry students every single year.
* Thirty-Six Saloon, Rockville \- Lined with award-winning wood carvings, animal trophies, and Harley Davidson decor, you have to come see Thirty-Six Saloon for yourself.
* Jefferson Street BBQ, Converse \- They are committed to being 100% local, and are proud members of Indiana grown.
* Rusted Silo, Lizton \- Come and see for yourself why “farm to table, doesn’t have to cost an arm & a leg!”
Thanks for reading our list! No matter whether you’re dining in or ordering take-out, be sure to be safe while supporting our Hoosier small businesses.
Know a great BBQ place we haven’t listed here? We definitely want to know about it! Let us know using the comment box below.

"Here on the Holcomb Crew, we love Independence Day – and we’re so excited to celebrate our nation’s 244th birthday this weekend!
One Indiana: July Fourth
Friend,
Here on the Holcomb Crew, we love Independence Day – and we’re so excited to celebrate our nation’s 244th birthday this weekend!
We realize we may be a little biased, but we think that Indiana may be the best place in the country to celebrate the 4th of July. While a few things may be a little different this year as we continue to make it through this pandemic, there’s no state that displays the American spirit better than Indiana!
For this week’s One Indiana list, we wanted to share with you a few of our plans for this Independence Day weekend:
One Indiana: July Fourth
* Watch Fireworks – Fireworks are perfect for social distancing! Many communities across the state are continuing their fireworks displays, which can be seen from miles around.
* Read the Declaration of Independence – Approved by the Second Continental Congress on July 4, 1776, the thirteen colonies officially declared themselves free and independent states. Take a few moments to read the Declaration of Independence to reflect on the reason for the creation of the United States and the values our country was built on.
* Fly Your Flag! – Wave your flag proudly this weekend – red, white and blue! Here’s a FAQ from the American Legion on the proper ways to display Old Glory.
* Have a Backyard BBQ – Get a small group of family or friends together, and enjoy some time together outside. And remember – continue to play it safe. Avoid shared dishes and stay home if you’re feeling sick.
* Visit a Military Memorial – Did you know that the state’s capital city, Indianapolis, has more acreage dedicated to honoring our fallen heroes than any other U.S. city – and the city’s number of war memorials is only second to Washington, D.C.? Plan a socially distanced visit to the outside of one of these memorials.
* Attend a Local Celebration – Pekin, Indiana is home to the oldest consecutive 4th of July celebration in the nation (this is the 190th year!), and they’re keeping it going this year while accommodating for social distancing. And the Valpo Fourth of July Celebration is also being held with accommodations this year. If you’re in the area, check one of these events out, or check to see if there’s a celebration near you.
* Visit Holiday World – Holiday World is now open with just a few changes (but all the fun). Plan ahead, and make sure to purchase a ticket for the day you plan to attend. Check out how they’re keeping it safe for guests.
* Rock the Patriotic Tunes – Maybe you’re a fan of Indiana’s own John Mellencamp as he R.O.C.K.s in the USA, or perhaps you love to belt out Lee Greenwood’s God Bless the USA. Now’s the time to build your patriotic playlist on your favorite streaming platform.
* Watch a Patriotic Movie or Documentary – What’s your favorite movie or documentary about America? We love history, so we definitely recommend Ken Burns’ documentaries – The War, The Vietnam War, and The Civil War. If you like musicals, you can’t beat 1776 and Hamilton (starts streaming on July 3).
* Make a Pie – They say nothing’s more American than apple pie, but here in Indiana we enjoy the state’s unofficial state pie, the Sugar Cream Pie! Here’s a recipe.
* Watch a Celebration on TV – The Boston Pops always put on a great show (including a tribute this year to our frontline workers!), and you can plan to watch A Capitol Fourth from Washington, D.C. on PBS.
* Watch the Brickyard – Auto racing is back! The first-ever NASCAR road course will be held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway on July 4, followed by the Brickyard 400 on July 5. Make sure you tune in!
We hope you have a fun and safe July 4th weekend! Tell us – what’s your favorite thing to do to celebrate Independence Day in Indiana?

Friend,
We can’t believe it, but there are only 106 days left until Election Day 2020.

Sign up!
Sign up and volunteer!
We barnstormed across the state, and assembled an incredible team. Together, Hoosiers in all 92 counties came together and did what they said couldn’t be done in just 106 days. We created a movement that continues today around a simple idea — building One Indiana for All.
And, friend, we never looked back.
While we’ve seen some tough times over the last couple of months, we’re proud of how far Indiana has come. We were setting records before the COVID-19 pandemic hit, and trust us — we’ll be setting them again soon.
But just like in 2016, we can’t take anything for granted.
We’ll need the help of Hoosiers across the state over the next 106 days, which is why we’re reaching out right now.
We’re looking for 106 Hoosiers to sign up and volunteer for us during the homestretch.
Can we count on you to come through for us over the next 106 days? We need Hoosiers to contact voters, display yard signs, and everything in between?

Eric laid out his vision of One Indiana at the 2020 Indiana Republican Convention last week, and he made one thing crystal clear.
The best is yet to come for Hoosiers across Indiana.
Before the COVID-19 pandemic, we set records for job creation, wages, international investment in our state, and investments in our roads and bridges. We lowered the infant mortality rate, fought the drug epidemic, expanded education, and much more.
And trust us, we’ll be setting records again before you know it.
We have work ahead of us to truly become One Indiana — but we know that Hoosiers love a challenge. We need to get back to work, create more jobs, raise wages, improve schools, build better roads, and much, much more.
We can’t turn back the clock — we need to move forward.
And to do that, we need your help. friend, we need you to be all in.
That’s why this quarter, we’re asking you to join us on our mission to build One Indiana.

Eric Holcomb for Indiana
Friends,
September 11, 2001, is a day seared into the hearts and minds of every single American.
We saw unspeakable tragedy, and pure, unadulterated evil strike American soil. The worst terror attack in American history took almost 3,000 lives and shook Americans across the country to their core.
It’s a memory that we will carry with us until the day we die.
We witnessed a horrific tragedy that day, but we also saw unbelievable courage and bravery from the first responders who stormed into the breach in order to save as many lives as they could.
The heroism of our first responders that day, and that of the Soldiers, Airmen, Sailors, and Marines who deployed to the Middle East to seek justice for the victims will also never be forgotten.
I’d like to close today by inviting you to join me in taking a moment to reflect on those whose lives were lost on September 11, 2001. We must never forget what transpired that day, and strive to ensure that we never see a tragedy like that again on American soil.
Sincerely,
Governor Eric Holcomb

Endorsement Alert
Join the NRA and Endorse Eric
Friend — did you hear the big news?
The National Rifle Association (NRA) just endorsed Governor Holcomb’s reelection campaign!
“Hoosiers’ rightful Second Amendment rights are well protected in Indiana by Governor Eric Holcomb. Governor Holcomb proudly signed laws that support law-abiding gun owners, and therefore keep our communities and state safer. And he’s welcomed the NRA’s world-renowned marksmanship championship competitions to their new home in Indiana. We’re proud to give him our endorsement in this race.”
\- John Weber, NRA Director of Indiana
Join the NRA and Endorse Eric
Our Second Amendment isn’t a talking point for Eric, it is personal. In fact, as a certified NRA firearms instructor, First Lady Janet Holcomb has been teaching Hoosiers how to safely exercise their Second Amendment rights for years.
Eric knows that our Second Amendment rights are sacred and that is why he has worked so hard to create an environment where every law-abiding Hoosier can safely access a firearm. As Governor, Eric has signed into law legislation that:
* Eliminates state fees on five-year handgun carry permits
* Allows law-abiding Hoosier gun owners to register to vote while applying for a carry permit
* Creates a Second Amendment-friendly environment by bringing the NRA’s National Marksmanship Competition Center to Indiana’s very own Camp Atterbury in Johnson County
Here’s what Eric had to say about the endorsement.
“There’s simply no place more friendly or more supportive of the Second Amendment than right here on Hoosier soil. We value our freedom, liberty, and the importance of being able to bear arms and protect and provide for ourselves and our families. That’s a bedrock commitment of mine – as sturdy as our Constitution in protecting our rights.”
\- Governor Eric Holcomb
Hoosier gun owners know that Governor Holcomb has been a strong advocate for our Second Amendment freedoms. If you believe in protecting our Second Amendment rights and want to help Governor Holcomb defend them, follow the NRA and endorse Eric today.

"Indiana is known for setting records - but this one might be the most meaningful one of them all.
Eric Holcomb for Indiana
Friend,
Indiana is known for setting records – but this one might be the most meaningful of them all.
As governor, Eric has been a leading pro-life advocate and today marks another amazing chapter in our fight for life.
Indiana officially leads the ENTIRE NATION in increasing the number of children adopted from foster care.
Watch and Share
Watch and Share
Since 2019, 2,489 Hoosier children have been adopted through the Indiana Department of Child Services (DCS). That means 2,489 children will finally have loving, permanent families and access to life-changing opportunities thanks to Governor Holcomb’s leadership.
Setting a national record like this doesn’t just happen – it takes intentional action and a commitment from top leaders.
Thankfully, Governor Holcomb is leading the charge. He made increasing adoptions a key priority in his Next Level Agenda by:
* Creating adoption units within DCS
* Providing more resources to assist in the adoption process
* More than doubling the number of adoption consultants from 7 to 19 to ensure families and children find the right match
* Launching an enhanced database that allows quicker processing of adoption inquiries
* Identifying and removing internal barriers through the Adoption Rapid Permanency Review
Indiana’s record-breaking year for adoptions caught President Trump’s attention. The administration rewarded Eric’s efforts with $4.7 million to continue to enhance our adoption system and ultimately place more children into loving homes.

"Here’s a quick rundown on how this aid for our job creators will go to work for Hoosiers
Eric Holcomb for Indiana
Friends,
Through it all, Indiana’s getting Back on Track.
As we continue through Stage 3 of Governor Holcomb’s Back on Track plan, Governor Holcomb has announced nearly $44 million to help restart the engines of our state’s economy – small businesses and manufacturing!
That’s because these two sectors are responsible for so many good, high-wage Hoosier jobs:
* Indiana is home to approximately 104,335 small businesses that employ fewer than 150 associates, supporting 941,578 Hoosiers across the state
* Indiana has more than 8,500 manufacturing facilities
* We’ve got the highest concentration of manufacturing jobs in the U.S.
* Manufacturing accounts for more than 27.8% of Indiana's total economic output
Here’s a quick rundown on how this aid for our job creators will go to work for Hoosiers:
* Small Business Restart Fund: Gov. Holcomb approved $30 million in federal funding made available through the CARES Act to go to small business restart grants, helping accelerate the speed of economic recovery activity by providing working capital to cover certain expenses related to the global pandemic.
* Small Business Relief & Planning Resources: The Indiana Small Business Development Center (Indiana SBDC) received nearly $3.7 million from the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) through the CARES Act to support increased resources for Hoosier entrepreneurs and small businesses over the next 18 months.
* Manufacturing Support & Long-Term Growth: The Indiana Economic Development Corporation (IEDC) board of directors approved $10 million to launch the Economic Activity Stabilization and Enhancement (EASE) program aimed at supporting technology and operational advancements in the manufacturing industry, which has long been a key driver of the state’s economy.
Learn More About the Small Business Restart Fund
Indiana is fortunate for the strong fiscal stewardship we had heading into this crisis. That leadership is allowing us to continue our fiscal responsibility while lifting up our job creators. Together, we’ll come out of this pandemic stronger than ever before!

"From the beginning of this pandemic, Governor Holcomb has been committed to ensuring that our schools remain fully funded.
Eric Holcomb for Indiana
Friends,
From the beginning of this pandemic, Governor Holcomb has been committed to ensuring that our schools remain fully funded. It’s critical for our students, our parents, our teachers and the future of our state.
And yesterday morning, the State Board of Education affirmed Governor Holcomb’s long-standing commitment.
Governor Holcomb explains it all here:
Watch Here
Watch the video and share it with your friends -- it's critically important that all Hoosiers know that when it comes to education, Governor Holcomb believes that our students must be equipped for the opportunities and 21st century careers of today and tomorrow.
That’s why he’s led the charge with the legislature to invest $1.6 billion in new funding in K-12 education since 2017, and that’s why 98% of Indiana school districts reported raises last year for teachers thanks to additional state funding for school liabilities.
Together, we’re making progress, and together, we’ll continue to get Indiana Back on Track.

One Indiana
Friend,
Indiana is known for a lot of amazing things — great steakhouses, basketball, an adorable First Dog named Henry, and much more.
But Indiana has also filled a few shelves when it comes to great American literature. These Hoosier writers know how to tell a story!
Indiana is a cultural center with a deep literary tradition, and we want to celebrate that tradition with our One Indiana list this week. We had our crew pick out their all-time favorite Hoosier writers — check out our list, and let us know if we missed any big names!
One Indiana
* Sarah T. Bolton \- Considered an unofficial poet laureate of Indiana, Bolton also played a crucial role in fighting for women’s property rights in Indiana’s constitution. If you want to read a beautiful tribute to our state, check out one of her best-known poems, “Indiana.”
* John Green \- Best known for The Fault in Our Stars set in Indianapolis (which debuted at number one on the New York Times bestseller list!), Green is another proud literary son of Indiana. In 2014, he was even included as one of Time’s 100 most influential people in the entire world!
* Gene Stratton Porter \- As well as writing several best-selling novels that were adapted into films, Porter was a leading conservationist who fought to preserve much of the beautiful Indiana outdoors we enjoy today. If you want to learn more, you can visit one of her historic homes in Indiana!
* Ernie Pyle \- One of the most famous American war correspondents in history, Pyle won a Pulitzer Prize for his first-person wartime reporting in both the European and Pacific theatres. Tragically, Pyle was killed by enemy fire during the Battle of Okinawa. As President Truman said, “He deserves the gratitude of all his countrymen.""
* James Whitcomb Riley \- Who could forget the “Hoosier Poet?” Riley helped to usher in the Golden Age of Indiana Literature and was a crucial part of establishing our unique cultural identity.
* Booth Tarkington \- One of only four novelists in history to win the Pulitzer Prize for fiction multiple times, Tarkington was once considered America’s greatest living author. He’s a true Hoosier — even serving one term in the Indiana House of Representatives!
* Kurt Vonnegut \- Maybe the most famous of all Hoosier authors, Vonnegut secured his place in literary history with Slaughterhouse-Five — one of the most compelling anti-war novels ever written.
* Lew Wallace \- A man of many talents, Wallace was a general in the Union Army and governor of the New Mexico Territory as well as a best-selling author. His most famous novel “Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ,” was one of the most influential books of the 19th century.
That’s our list for this week — did we miss one of your favorite Hoosier authors? Let us know below!

"Governor Holcomb is committed to making sure that Indiana’s schools receive 100% of their funding
Eric Holcomb for Indiana
Friends,
""School is back in session, and as we've talked to schools around the state, there's a lot of excitement not just about connecting, but learning."" – Gov. Holcomb
Across the state, Hoosier students are back in school, with learning and safety as the cornerstones.
And whether that school is in-person, virtual, or a hybrid of the two, Governor Holcomb is committed to making sure that Indiana’s schools receive 100% of their funding – providing some consistency and certainty for our students, parents, and teachers.
And that includes a $182 million scheduled budget increase for K-12 schools in 2021.
WATCH: Governor Holcomb commits to 100% K-12 school funding>>
WATCH
This will be achieved by pushing back the official count of student enrollment to at least December, with the Indiana General Assembly returning for its annual session in January to continue the conversation.
Governor Holcomb made this commitment clear today, just as he’s led with more school funding, more access, and greater educational opportunities throughout his administration – especially through this crisis.
This includes:
* Grants for high-quality pre-K available in every Indiana county
* A historic $1.6 billion in new education funding since 2017
* 98% of Indiana school corporations reporting an increase in teacher pay last year with Governor Holcomb paying off a teacher pension liability
* PPE available to every Indiana district before school officially started
* Continual guidance from the Indiana State Department of Health
Governor Holcomb is continuing this commitment, but we need your help, too.
If you’re a parent, keep your child home if he or she is sick, or if they’re waiting on a COVID-19 test result.
If you’re a student, stick with a cohort of classmates, limiting the spread in the case of infection.
And for every Hoosier, let’s continue to wear our masks, wash our hands, and practice social distancing. It’s the difference-maker that keeps our businesses, schools, and economy going!

"The Governor’s Emergency Education Relief fund is evidence that Governor Holcomb and his team will continue to lead and do all that is necessary
Eric Holcomb for Indiana
Friends,
Governor Holcomb continues to step up to support Hoosiers who need it most. And this week specifically it is our teachers and students both in K-12 and higher education who are heading back to school and need extra support to teach and learning during the ongoing pandemic. That’s why Governor Holcomb stepped in and made $61 million available via the Governor’s Emergency Education Relief Fund (GEERS).
One area that most of this grant will cover ($49.8 million to be exact) is devices and connectivity. We will see connectivity increase in the following ways:
* 68,689 student devices
* 2,885 teacher devices
* Internet access for households in need
The other $11.2 million is being poured into our colleges and universities to help with educator training, support our students with special needs, and provide resources for online learning.
The Governor’s Emergency Education Relief fund is evidence that Governor Holcomb and his team will continue to lead and do all that is necessary to ensure Hoosiers across the state are receiving access to and support for the education they not only need, but, more importantly, deserve.

“Throughout this pandemic, the power of Indiana manufacturing has been on full display, working safely and quickly to produce critical supplies like PPE. Now and always, Hoosier manufacturers are thankful to operate in Indiana, where Governor Holcomb’s leadership has helped build the environment for manufacturers to grow and for Hoosiers to build the skills for great jobs. His leadership has been key to our industry’s continued success – and will continue to be critical in the years ahead. He’s the leader we need, now, and for the next four years.”

The IMA represents more than 1,100 Hoosier businesses and is the second oldest manufacturers’ association in the entire country. We couldn’t be more honored to have the support and trust of so many job creators as we navigate through COVID-19 and continue to build One Indiana for All.
Indiana has the highest concentration of manufacturing jobs in the country, and Eric has worked hand-in-hand with our many Hoosier manufacturing businesses to help safely jumpstart our economy as a part of the Back on Track Plan.
Since Governor Holcomb assumed office, Indiana has
* Set a record with 100,000 new private-sector job commitments
* Tripled Indiana’s foreign direct investment over the last three years
* Started the Next Level Jobs initiative and helped more than 10,000 Hoosiers earn a credential for a high-wage, in-demand job
Here’s what Eric had to say about the endorsement.
“Indiana is home to the nation’s highest concentration of manufacturing jobs, and we’re working to keep it that way as our state continues to get back on track. Indiana’s manufacturers produce everything from cars and RVs to vital PPE. But beyond that, they also produce great Hoosier jobs and opportunity as we continue to build One Indiana for All. I thank the Indiana Manufacturers Association for their support as we continue to support our job creators across the state.”

One Indiana
Friend,
Watching the Indy 500 last weekend got our team thinking about one of our all-time favorite songs, Back Home Again in Indiana Again. It’s a Hoosier classic!
That’s why we decided to make this week’s One Indiana all about some of the best musicians our state has produced. We had a team pull a list of some of our favorite Hoosier singers, songwriters, piano players, and more.
Check it out below, and click on their name to see these Hoosiers perform.
One Indiana
* Joshua Bell \- One of the most celebrated violinists of his generation, Bell is a native of Bloomington and one of the brightest music stars in Hoosier history!
* Hoagy Carmichael \- Also from Bloomington, Carmichael is one of the greatest songwriters of the 20th Century. “Stardust” is perhaps his most famous composition and one of the most recorded songs of all time.
* The Gaithers \- Two of the biggest names in gospel music, Bill and Gloria call Alexandria, Indiana home.
* Kenneth “Babyface” Edmonds \- This 11-time Grammy winner is from Indianapolis and even has a stretch of I-65 named after him!
* The Jackson Family \- The Jacksons’ mark on pop music can’t be overstated.
* John Mellencamp \- No one has done more for the soundtrack of Indiana over the last 40 years than this musician who was “born and raised in a small town.”
* Bill Monroe \- Known as the Father of Bluegrass, his legacy continues in Brown County with the oldest continuously running bluegrass music festival.
* Wes Montgomery \- One of the most influential jazz guitarists in history, he inspired many fellow legends including Jimi Hendrix and Stevie Ray Vaughn.
* Cole Porter \- The Peru, Indiana native was a prolific composer and songwriter who contributed many timeless classics to The Great American Songbook like I’ve Got You Under My Skin.
* Axl Rose \- Was “Paradise City” inspired by this Guns N’ Roses front man’s hometown of Lafayette?
* David Lee Roth \- Diamond Dave was a Hoosier long before he met the Van Halen brothers.
* Jim Nabors \- Coming off race weekend, we’re thinking of the late, great Jim Nabors. He’s an honorary Hoosier. We included his Back Home Again in Indiana last week, but let’s take another listen!
* Florence Henderson \- And while we’re talking about Indianapolis 500 traditions, who can forget Indiana’s own Florence Henderson singing God Bless America?

Holcomb for IN
Friend,
Good news as Indiana continues getting Back on Track.
Yesterday, Governor Holcomb announced that by October 1, Indiana will gain a total of 95 new COVID-19 testing sites – where testing will be free.
Find your testing site
As you can see from the map above, the testing sites are spread across 76 counties, with more than a dozen sites opening last week and 22 more slated to open by the end of this month.
Information about new testing sites will be available HERE as sites open.
FIND A TESTING SITE NEAR YOU
This additional testing capacity will supplement state-sponsored OptumServe sites – which since May have already tested 284,000 Hoosiers.
Why is this a big deal?
Well, first, as Governor Holcomb says, it’s all about teamwork. And this additional testing capacity wouldn’t be possible without partnerships with communities – and between communities, as local health departments work hard to keep their residents healthy.
And second, as testing capacity continues to expand, more Hoosiers can easily get tested – and that means we can continue to slow the spread, and that means we can continue to keep our state open!
Together, your actions are making the difference – we see it all across the state. So continue to keep up the great work, and if you feel sick, check out one of Indiana’s many new COVID-19 testing sites here.

"Governor Holcomb’s dedication to keeping construction projects moving forward safely during the pandemic and his commitment to expanding workforce...
Eric Holcomb for Indiana
Friend \- we have huge news!
Associated Builders and Contractors of Indiana/Kentucky (ABC) just endorsed Governor Eric Holcomb’s campaign for a second term.
Join ABC and endorse Eric
Governor Holcomb’s dedication to keeping construction projects moving forward safely during the pandemic and his commitment to expanding workforce training options are major reasons why he earned ABC’s endorsement.
Indiana’s construction companies have played a key role in Indiana’s unemployment rate dropping to 6.4% (below the national rate and the rate of all neighboring states) and Eric is looking forward to continuing to work with them on building One Indiana for All (literally!).
Endorsement Alert
Here’s what the president of ABC had to say about Eric’s leadership:
“Governor Holcomb’s leadership has helped Indiana’s construction industry continue to build Indiana’s economy, even through a global pandemic. Hoosier construction professionals are working safety on jobs across the state, while job training programs expanded by Governor Holcomb are helping more Hoosiers build the skills for great careers in construction. Governor Holcomb has built the environment for business success, and he’s the right person to keep it going for another four years.” - J.R. Gaylor, president of ABC
ABC is made up of 515 companies across the state that employ more than 95,000 Hoosiers. The group offers construction education, training, and on-the-job apprenticeships.
Governor Holcomb has led the way in creating opportunities for Hoosiers to build skills for high-wage, in-demand jobs, including jobs in the construction industry, such as
* Launching and expanding Indiana’s Next Level Jobs program — including investing a total of $75 million in CARES Act funding to help Hoosiers impacted by COVID-19.
* Providing Workforce Ready Grants that have helped more than 10,000 Hoosiers receive free job training for high-wage, in-demand jobs. Since June, more than 5,500 Hoosiers have used these grants to enroll in classes or training.
* Providing Employer Training Grants that reimburse employers who train, hire, and retrain Hoosiers to fill in-demand positions. Since June, these grants have helped more than 7,300 employees to improve their skills.
* Serving on the Trump Administration American Workforce Policy Advisory Board.
Join ABC and endorse Eric
The impact of Governor Holcomb’s proven workforce training strategies is extending beyond our state’s borders — he is working hand-in-hand with Ivanka Trump and Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross to strengthen America’s pipeline of skilled workers.
Here’s what Eric had to say about ABC’s endorsement:
“Indiana’s economy is gearing back up, and that starts with supporting our job creators and making sure all Hoosiers have opportunities to thrive. ABC Indiana/Kentucky and their members across the state are key partners as we’re stepping on the gas to expand training opportunities and get all Hoosiers into great careers – including in construction.” - Governor Eric Holcomb

"He couldn’t share his vision for the next four years in front of 2,000 other Hoosier Republicans due to social distancing, but he was still ecstatic..
Eric Holcomb for Indiana
Friends,
Eric just gave the keynote speech at the 2020 Indiana Republican State Convention.
Because of COVID-19, he couldn’t share his vision for the next four years in front of 1,800 other Hoosier Republicans, but he was still ecstatic to talk about his plans for Indiana’s future.
In case you weren’t able to tune in, our team pulled together some of the best moments from his speech below.
Eric on Indiana’s Resilience…
“This year, we’ve been tested in unimaginable ways. A pandemic cut short the lives of too many Hoosiers and brought our roaring economy to a sudden halt. And an act of abhorrent brutality in Minnesota ended George Floyd’s life and brought into national focus a needed reckoning on matters of racial equality. Through it all, we’ve shown the world what a resilient, welcoming, and big-hearted place Indiana is... and that’s why we’ve been able to make some progress... and are on track to continue to make some more.”
Eric on the progress we’ve made so far...
“Lowering infant mortality, fighting the drug epidemic, investing in our urban centers, expanding education and job training opportunities... these actions are having real results. But we’re far from done... in terms of healthcare, criminal justice reform, affordable housing, economic development in our inner cities, as well as policing standards and race relations for those disproportionately affected. But we Hoosiers have never been afraid of hard work... in fact we relish a challenge.”
Eric on where we’re going in the next four years…
“Becoming One Indiana For All means getting Hoosiers back to work and connecting more with higher-wage jobs. It means attracting more business leaders, job creators and entrepreneurs to Indiana. One Indiana For All means working together to overcome racial inequality.
It means taking a long look at some of the restrictions and regulations we set aside during the pandemic to see which ones can go away permanently. One Indiana For All means continuing to modernize your state government... making sure it is running efficiently for the taxpayers... and shrinking those elements that are barriers to progress. It means finishing I-69. It means taking long-lingering health issues—head on. It means hitting our goal of being the best state in the Midwest for infant mortality by 2024. We’re on our way, but we’re not done yet.”
Eric on what he’s asking from Hoosiers...
“So... I’m asking you to join us on this mission.
Because if we want to recover quickly... If we want to tackle issues of social equality that have festered for too long... If we want to get our state at full employment again... If we want a smaller, more efficient government, better equipped schools, better roads, better technology and better health...
If we want to not only GROW the highest quality corn, livestock, and timber but also GROW OPPORTUNITIES for more Hoosiers to climb life’s ladder of success... and rise as high as they choose to go... If we're to MAKE not only world-class autos, RV’s and medical devices, but also MAKE INVESTMENTS cultivating our pro-growth ecosystem so our creative class and our universities of higher learning continue to churn out the discoveries of tomorrow...
If we want to accomplish all these things, we can’t... “turn back the clock”.
As Coach Dale says in Hoosiers our “team’s on the court.”
My friends... I’m asking you to do everything you can to make sure we stay there. I’m humbled by your support... honored to serve as your governor... and ready to keep the pedal to the medal for four more years...
Because the best is yet to come.”
We’ve been through a lot in the last couple of months, but we’re better prepared than ever to take on the challenges of the future and build One Indiana thanks to Eric’s leadership.
Thank you for reading and we hope that you are as inspired by Eric’s vision for the future as we are.

Eric Holcomb for Indiana
Friend,
We have big news — we just released our first statewide TV ad of 2020, and we need your help to get it in front of as many Hoosiers as possible (watch here).
New Ad
Like Eric said, we’re a strong and resilient group of Hoosiers. We’ve faced our fair share of challenges, but we’re proud of how we stepped up to meet them head on.
We’ve come together as a community, and it’s been inspiring to see Hoosiers from all walks of life and every corner of our state come through for their neighbors in need.
Simply put, we couldn’t be more proud to be Hoosiers.
Eric can’t wait to spend another four years working to build One Indiana for All, but he needs to spread his message to as many Hoosiers as possible. Starting tomorrow, this ad will be airing on TV statewide, but that’s not enough.
That’s where you come in.
Friend, will you watch our new ad and share it with your family and friends on social media?

"On Friday, Indiana officially entered Stage 4 of Governor Holcomb’s Back on Track Plan (two days early!).
Eric Holcomb for Indiana
Friends,
On Friday, Indiana officially entered Stage 4 of Governor Holcomb’s Back on Track Plan (two days early!).
It means that Hoosiers will be getting out more, as you’re likely doing this beautiful Indiana weekend. And as you’re getting out, we want to make sure that you have all the tools you need to stay safe.
You know the basics because you’ve been practicing them so well – socially distancing, wearing your face mask, and practicing great hygiene…
But last week, Governor Holcomb provided two big updates you might have missed that will continue to dramatically expand Indiana’s COVID-19 testing.
1. ANY Hoosier can now get a COVID-19 test.
With now more than 200 testing sites across Indiana, the state’s testing capacity is strong. And with that strength, any Hoosier can now make an appointment and get tested – you don’t need to be at a high-risk, and you don’t need to be showing symptoms. Find a site near you here.
1. Indiana is DOUBLING testing capacity.
Through a partnership with Eli Lilly and the Indiana Hospital Association, the state is leveraging its buying power to compete more efficiently to purchase supplies, equipment and reagents for testing. By forming a network with 10 labs across Indiana, we’ll be doubling our current testing capacity.
Indiana has administered more than 335,000 COVID-19 tests across the state. But in order to keep that number growing, we need you! If you have any concerns that you may have COVID-19, go get tested. In many cases, it’s free!
Together, we’re fighting the spread of COVID-19 in Indiana, keeping our fellow Hoosiers safe, and keeping Indiana’s reopening safely on track. Keep up the great work, and continue to enjoy your weekend!
#BackonTrack,
-Your Holcomb Crew

Friend,
You may have heard the big news….
We released our first statewide TV ad this week!
Working as a Team
If you missed it the first time around, don’t sweat it — you can watch the ad and share it on social media here.
Like Governor Holcomb says in the ad, Hoosiers have shown amazing resiliency and strength of spirit over the last couple of months. We’ve cared for our neighbors, stepped up to meet challenges head-on, and showed the world what it truly means to be a Hoosier.
“We’re a strong, resilient group of Hoosiers. There’s no challenge we can’t overcome when we come together. It has been a real proud moment to see people come out of the woodwork and pitch in to help. Nothing is stronger than the bond we have for our neighbors and our [[URL REDACTED]] just makes you proud to be a Hoosier.”
\- Governor Eric Holcomb
This first ad highlighted so many ways that our fellow Hoosiers have come together for our communities and neighbors, and we picked a few of our favorites for this week’s One Indiana. Check it out below!
One Indiana: for all
Common Experiences
* Working as a team \- Hoosiers have stepped up and worked together to keep businesses open, slow the spread, and produce PPE. We couldn’t be more impressed by the teamwork we’ve seen in every corner of our state.
* Wearing masks \- It’s been amazing to watch Hoosiers make personal sacrifices to keep their family and neighbors safe. Wearing masks is simple, but incredibly important to slowing the spread of COVID-19.
* Relying on our faith, family, and friends \- In times of struggle, we remember what gives us strength. We’ve all relied on these core Hoosiers values over the past several months, and they’ve come through for us in a big way.
* Helping our neighbors \- We’ve really seen new meaning come to the phrase ""we don't know a stranger in times of trouble.”
* Making masks \- Whether it’s a local business or a local sewing group, Hoosiers have stepped up to make the masks keeping our communities safe, and we couldn’t be more thankful.
* Bonding over common experience and emotions \- We’re stronger than COVID-19, and we’ve proved it. Our shared experience and emotions are going to help us push through this adversity and come out the other side stronger than ever.
Thank you for reading. This is a message about all Hoosiers, for all Hoosiers -- so will you help us make sure all Hoosiers see it? Use the button below to watch our new ad and share it on social media.

Eric Holcomb for Indiana
Friend,
COVID-19 has hit small businesses across Indiana hard.
Last week we received good news that Indiana's unemployment rate has dropped again (now lower than all of our surrounding states), but there's no doubt that the economic fallout from COVID-19 represents a daunting challenge for Hoosiers across our state.
That’s especially true for our small businesses – the shops on Main Street and our local Hoosier restaurants – who are responsible for more than a million Hoosier jobs.
We’re doing everything we can to get Hoosier businesses #BackOnTrack, and we need your help to keep our small businesses open.
Hoosiers are always stronger when we work together, and we all need to do our part to support small businesses.

Friends,
Hoosiers are some of the greatest people on the planet — we’re hard-working, resilient, and we treat our neighbors like family.
Those uniquely Hoosier traits have been on full display as we navigate through the pandemic, together.
We’ll be honest — there are a lot of telltale signs that you might be a Hoosier. From the paint job on your barn to the sports memories you just can’t let go, there are so many signals that showcase our Hoosier pride.
We wanted to have a little fun with this week’s list, so we pulled together ten reasons why you might just be a true Hoosier.
Check it out below!
One Indiana
* If your mailbox, barn or body has your favorite driver’s number on it...
* If you know what a Full Pull is...
* If you know what the Snake Pit is...
* If you still talk about Keith Smart (or Christian Watford) hitting the buzzer-beater...
* If you've been on the Tenderloin Trail…
* If you’ve visited Brazil, Mexico, Paris, and London without leaving the state...
* If you consider County Fair Season as a fifth season
* If you've ever made a lantern by putting fireflies in a Ball jar...
* If you've experienced Gnaw Bone & Hope in one day...
* If you've wondered if the sweet corn will be knee-high by the 4th of July...
* If you know North Vernon is in the south and South Bend is in the north...
Did we miss a telltale sign that you might be a Hoosier? Let us know!

"These resources are either no or low cost – so if you’re ready to take the next step in getting into a great Hoosier job
Eric Holcomb for Indiana
Friends,
“People are our state’s most valuable resource and they are what define Indiana as a great place to live, work and grow.” -Gov. Holcomb
There’s no doubt: Hoosiers are facing new challenges in today’s economy due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
But thankfully, we know that Hoosiers are never down for long.
On Friday, Governor Holcomb unveiled a new plan – Rapid Recovery for a Better Future – that’s putting its resources directly into Hoosiers – helping us all learn, connect and take the next step toward building the skills needed to land a good-paying, in-demand job.
* Learn About Your Options: It starts with visiting the online hub, [[URL REDACTED]], to learn about resources. Hoosiers will also learn from their trusted sources – like community and faith leaders.
* Get Connected: Talk to a real person to answer your questions and determine your best path forward.
* Take the Next Step: Advance your career with convenient access to accelerated programs and credentials that value prior learning and experiences, such as the Workforce Ready Grant and Ivy Tech’s Rapid Recovery program—which will provide free courses and training for 10,000 Hoosiers.
And what’s most exciting?
Thanks to the federal CARES Act, Indiana is investing an additional $50 million into the workforce programs Governor Holcomb has been leading since he first took office in 2017!
And it’s now expanded and accelerated.
This includes:
* Expanding the Workforce Training Grant in Next Level Jobs
This will support grants for at least an additional 10,000 Hoosiers as they gain in-demand job credentials – at no cost to the student.
* Growing the Employer Training Grant
This is going directly to Indiana’s employers – with a focus on women-, minority- and veteran-owned businesses, to help an additional 25,000 Hoosiers skill-up on the job.
* Providing Career Coaching
This is creating a single online network to direct Hoosiers to career coaching, and is working to ensure populations most impacting by COVID-19, underrepresented populations and rural communities, can have someone in their corner as they work toward a great job.
These resources are either no or low cost – so if you’re ready to take the next step in getting into a great Hoosier job, your first step is visiting [[URL REDACTED]]

"There are a lot of late nights at the Holcomb Crew HQ, and that means our team has been ordering a lot of pizza to keep us going.
One Indiana
Friends,
We’re in the final stretch of our campaign.
That means there are a lot of late nights at the Holcomb Crew HQ, and that means our team has been ordering a lot of late night pizza to keep us going. It’s one of our favorite foods, and we’ve tried more than our fair share of pizza joints across our state.
It’s so important that we support these small businesses and job creators in our communities. They’ve adjusted their way of doing business to keep it safe (so check for amended hours!) -- and we, too, must do our part to follow all local health guidelines while chowing down.
Let’s (safely) support our local pizzeria -- and here’s a few of our favorites.
One Indiana
* Arni’s – Arni’s originally opened at the Market Square Shopping Center in Lafayette in 1966! They now bring their old-school style pizzas to 18 Indiana locations!
* Bazbeaux Pizza, Downtown Indy, Carmel & Broad Ripple – Bazbeaux is no stranger to the “Best Pizza in Indianapolis” title. They have 3 convenient locations where you can try out their pies!
* Big Woods Pizza – Nashville, Speedway, Bloomington, Franklin, Noblesville – Big Woods Pizza is always a fun environment with great beverages and unique pizzas. Be sure to stop by if you’re nearby.
* Brozinni Pizzeria – Indianapolis Southside – The Almost World Famous Garlic Knuckles, and a giant slice of New York-style pizza are must-tries!
* King Dough Pizza - Indianapolis Holy Cross neighborhood – King Dough has something for everyone with vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free pizzas and amazing salads.
* Mad Anthony’s Brewing Company – Fort Wayne, Auburn, Warsaw, Angola – Are you a fan of Chicago-style deep dish? You have to check out Mad Anthony’s and enjoy deep-dish pies in a unique place.
* Miller Pizza Co. – Gary – Unbelievable Chicago-style pizza conveniently located near the South Shore Line? You don’t need to cross the state line to get some great deep dish. Sign us up!
* Mother Bear’s Pizza - Bloomington – The students and staff of IU have voted Mother Bear’s best pizza in Bloomington for ten straight years!
* Mozzi’s Pizza – Greenfield – As a basketball fan, Eric (and really, all Hoosiers) can appreciate the basketball memorabilia, signatures, jerseys and magazines on display here. Make sure to try the cinnamon dessert pizza!
* New Bethel Ordinary – Wanamaker – This place is anything but ordinary. The pizza’s worth the wait, and there’s no need to order extra cheese. Trust us, they’ve got you covered with cheese.
* The Original Bill Bobe’s Pizzeria, Vincennes – Follow Eric's lead, and get the Farouk Special. Trust us on this one.
* Perillo’s Pizzeria – North Salem – Located in a converted former doctor’s office, Perillo’s is a small-town gem owned by a former chef from Sicily. Try the garlic rolls! Cash only.
* Pizza King – Once you’re seated, don’t be alarmed by the red phone – that’s how you order!
* Puccini’s Pizza & Pasta, Indianapolis, Hamilton County, West Lafayette – You have to try their famous Campfire pizza- it’s made with smoked sausage, sweet onion marmalade, gorgonzola and fresh rosemary.
* Rocco’s, South Bend – Authentic Italian food with a unique family story! You can enjoy incredible pizza made from scratch, made the same way the original Rocco made it in 1951.
* Turoni's Pizzery & Brewery, Evansville, Newburgh – We don’t know what’s in their secret sauce but we do know that it’s delicious.
* Union Jack Pub, Broad Ripple & Westfield – Incredible community atmosphere and great food — what’s not to like!
* 450 North Brewing Company, Columbus – Pizza and beer. That’s all we have to say.
Did we miss your favorite Indiana pizza joint? We’ll add it to the list!
One Indiana
Happy pizza eating!

Friend,
We’re officially in the final sprint to Election Day 2020.
There are now fewer than 100 days left until November 3rd (we know, we can’t believe it either).
That means there are going to be a lot of late nights and early mornings for our crew between now and Election Day, but friend, — we’re fired up for the final sprint.
We’re ready to go, but we can’t do this alone. We need to know that you’re 100% in.
Become one of 100 Hoosiers who help us build One Indiana —>
That’s why we set a goal of 100 individual donors between now and midnight on July 31.
Friend, Indiana needs four more years of Eric’s experience and strong leadership.
Four more years means better schools and more workforce training programs. Four more years means a stronger economy built to set more records again. Four more years means better roads and bridges (and finishing I-69!).
Eric is locked in. He’s focused on the health of Hoosiers, and building One Indiana that works for Hoosiers from every walk of life. But he can’t do it alone, and he needs to know that he has the support of Hoosiers like you from every corner of our state.

Eric Holcomb for Indiana
Friends,
This week, Governor Holcomb updated Hoosiers on the latest in Indiana’s response to COVID-19 and the continued impact the pandemic is having on our state.
As we safely and responsibly continue moving through the governor’s Back on Track plan, it can’t be forgotten that the pandemic disrupted the education of over 1 million Hoosiers. One of Governor Holcomb’s top priorities is strengthening education, and that’s why he is committed to maintaining the record level of K-12 investments for our students.
So, while the pandemic will necessitate budget cuts in several state government agencies, Governor Holcomb will not cut K-12 funding to make up for revenue shortfalls due to the pandemic. In fact, a scheduled increase of $183 million will continue!
Listen to what Governor Holcomb had to say about this great news:
Gov. Holcomb Explains Indiana’s K-12 Budget Increase
WATCH: Gov. Holcomb Explains Indiana’s K-12 Budget Increase
Here are some additional updates regarding education funding:
* Schools are receiving an additional $192 million in federal funding from the CARES Act.
* Governor Holcomb’s education relief fund will provide $61 million for remote learning resources.
* Governor Holcomb will seek legislative approval to ensure schools that shifted to virtual instruction during the pandemic will still receive 100% of their tuition support.
* Additional resources and funding are available for schools through the Indiana Department of Homeland Security.
From the first day of his administration, Governor Holcomb has been committed to improving the quality of and access to education for all Hoosier students. While the pandemic has certainly caused some disruptions in our daily lives, it hasn’t changed his commitment to Hoosier teachers, parents and students.

"Thanks to Governor Holcomb's leadership, Indiana's infant mortality rate just fell to the LOWEST level EVER recorded in our state’s history.
Eric Holcomb for Indiana
Friend,
We have amazing news.
Thanks to Governor Holcomb's leadership, Indiana's infant mortality rate just fell to the LOWEST level EVER recorded in our state’s history.
We’ve taken direct and impactful action to protect our state’s most vulnerable citizens, including:
* Implementing Levels of Care certification for perinatal programs at hospitals and birthing centers to ensure that mothers and babies get care at a facility with a level of care that matches their risk.
* Expanding the Nurse-Family Partnership Program to combat infant mortality rates.
* Starting Indiana’s OB Navigator program that connects pregnant women in Indiana’s highest-risk ZIP codes with wraparound health services.
There’s still work to do on this front, but this news is wonderful for our state. It’s just the latest pro-life success story from the Holcomb administration, coming on the heels of the big news that Indiana leads the nation in adoptions out of foster care!

”We are committed to ensuring the best chance for a healthy pregnancy and a strong start to life for Indiana’s newborns. While we celebrate these results, our work is far from finished, and we won’t rest as we work to protect our youngest.” - Governor Eric Holcomb
Friend, Indiana has seen amazing results thanks to Governor Holcomb’s leadership, including three straight years of decline in our infant mortality rate. It’s now at its lowest level since 1900 - the first year Indiana started recording infant mortality rates!
“We’ve known all along that reducing Indiana’s infant mortality rate would take time and partnerships, and it’s gratifying to see that work pay off. We must continue to encourage early prenatal care and promote safe sleep practices so that we can celebrate more first birthdays in Indiana.” - State Health Commissioner Kris Box, M.D., FACOG
Governor Holcomb has made reducing Indiana’s infant mortality rate a priority, with the goal of achieving the lowest infant mortality rate in the Midwest by 2024.
Spread the good news on Facebook
Under Governor Holcomb’s leadership, Indiana has taken the following steps to improve infant and maternal health in recent years, including:
* Creating an obstetrician-gynecologist navigator program that provides personalized support, resources, and referrals to mothers through the first year of their babies’ lives.
* Developing a Levels of Care system for birthing hospitals to ensure that women deliver their babies at the facility that best meets their needs.
* Adopting obstetrical safety bundles through the Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health
* Allocating more than $27 million in Safety PIN grants since 2017 to community partners for both novel and evidence-based programs to reduce infant mortality and improve the health and well-being of mothers and babies.
* Requiring prenatal care providers to conduct a verbal screening for substance use disorder for all pregnant women so they can receive services that improve their health and that of their babies.
* Establishing a committee to review every maternal death in the state, with the goal of understanding the causes and developing strategies to prevent future cases.

One Indiana
Friend,
Indiana is a land of proud food traditions — we’re home to legendary steakhouses, amazing breweries, classic diners, and much, much more.
But here at the Holcomb Crew, there’s one Hoosier food tradition that stands above the rest.
The Indiana pork tenderloin.
You know, the delicious, fried sandwich that’s frequently the size of your head (with a normal sized bun, of course).
In fact, there’s probably no Hoosier who loves a good breaded pork tenderloin more than Governor Holcomb. He’s got this list of his favorite places to enjoy this classic Hoosier meal — and as we’re getting back out safely to our favorite restaurants again, he wanted us to share it with you.
It’s a long list (like we said, he really loves pork tenderloins), so get ready for this mouth-watering tour across our state.
One Indiana
* Edwards Drive In, Indianapolis \- Originally opened as a Dog’n Suds drive-in, Edwards has been serving their famous tenderloin since August 10, 1957. It’s a true Hoosier tradition and an absolute must-try — don’t forget to order a side of their hand-dipped onion rings!
* Mr. Dave’s, North Manchester \- Mr. Dave’s has been a North Manchester institution since 1962. From a tenderloin to broasted chicken, you won’t leave hungry.
* Nick’s English Hut, Bloomington \- What a great American story. Founded by Nick Hrisomalos, a Greek immigrant and entrepreneur with only a third-grade education, IU students have been stopping by to get their tenderloin since 1927!
* Nick’s Kitchen, Huntington \- This classic joint has been around since 1908, with a claim to fame as the home of the original pork tenderloin. But they’ve also got some fantastic homemade pies and hand-dipped shakes.
* Ray’s Drive In, Kokomo \- They claim to be home to Indiana’s largest tenderloin!
* The Friendly Tavern, Zionsville \- It’s all in the name — their tagline is “You are a stranger here but once."" They serve up world-class hospitality alongside their world-class Hoosier tenderloins.
* The Aristocrat, Broad Ripple \- The first restaurant to ever offer patio seating in Indy, you can wash down one of their amazing tenderloins with one of the 60 delicious draft beers they have on tap!
* The Overlook Restaurant, Leavenworth \- The only thing better than the view at the Overlook? The food, of course. Enjoy a tenderloin when overlooking the gorgeous Ohio River.
* Triple XXX Family Restaurant, West Lafayette \- Famous for their root beer — the perfect drink to wash down your tenderloin!
* Slippery Noodle Inn, Indianapolis \- The Yeagy family has been serving up delicious food and drinks for 50 years at Indiana’s oldest bar (it was originally founded in 1850!). Stop by for some live music (socially distanced, of course), and try out their jumbo tenderloin.
* Loughmillers, Indianapolis \- Come for the great historic theme and location (just across the street from the Statehouse!), stay for the great food.
* Mug N’ Bun Drive In, Indianapolis \- The Mug N’ Bun had social distancing down before it was cool. This Indy West Side drive-in is a great place to grab some root beer and enjoy a tenderloin from your car!
* Workingman’s Friend, Indianapolis \- Another great Indy joint, there’s no better place to chow down after a hard day’s work.
* Storie’s, Greensburg \- Serving homemade Indiana delicacies since 1977, Storie’s is a small-town gem.
* Crossroads Family Restaurant, Versailles \- They really do treat every customer like they are a part of their family. Come on down to Versailles and get a classic hand-tenderized pork tenderloin.
That’s our list for this week — did we miss the best pork tenderloin in Indiana? Let us know your favorite place to get one below!
Let us know!

Just a few years ago, the digital divide in the state was immense.
Students were being hurt by the lack of internet access. Family farms were struggling to compete due to a lack of reliable broadband. Our seniors couldn’t access telehealth services that are so important today.
Our rural communities needed someone to step up and deliver for them.
Governor Holcomb identified the problem as soon as he got into office, and started to work on a solution immediately.
He realized that words alone weren’t going to cut it and that decisive action was going to be required if we wanted to close the digital divide and make a difference for our rural communities.
That’s why he devoted $100 million to building broadband infrastructure and partnered with local providers to connect communities and people across our state.
That’s what building One Indiana for All looks like.

"it’s critical that the violence we saw this weekend never happens again
Eric Holcomb for Indiana
Friends,
“Every breath that we take…that we have left should be devoted to making sure what happened to Mr. Floyd never happens again.” -Gov. Holcomb
This weekend, Indiana and the nation saw a time of turmoil. Following the heinous death of Mr. George Floyd in Minnesota, Hoosiers took to Indiana streets to make their voice heard, rightfully protesting to shine a light on injustice and inequity.
We stand with those who peacefully exercised their first amendment right, while we condemn unnecessary and tragic violence and destruction.
Mr. Floyd’s last words – “I can’t breathe” – should forever remind us that what happened to him must never happen again, and that we must hold those responsible to the fullest extent of the law. It’s a calling worthy of every breath we take.
But it’s also critical that the violence we saw this weekend never happens again.
Bridge, Not Divide
Watch: “We must harness—not squander—the energy generated in the aftermath of the Floyd injustice.”
That’s why the Indiana State Police and Indiana National Guard will continue to assist local communities with the resources they request to help them enforce the rule of law and protect the safety of all Hoosiers.
As Governor Holcomb said, “Violence in the streets makes progress harder…it sets us back from forming that more perfect union.”
No citizen has the right to threaten another Hoosiers’ safety.
In Indiana, we’ve made progress on supporting Hoosiers from diverse backgrounds, including passing Indiana’s first ever hate crimes law protecting 6.7 million Hoosiers, launching free training for in-demand jobs, and providing resources to address infant mortality in Indiana’s hardest hit areas.
But we’re not done yet. We must create a to-do list, with action steps including:
* Better healthcare access
* Affordable housing
* Educational opportunity
* Job training and placement
* Urban economic development
* Criminal justice reform
We cannot let the voice of the peacemakers be cast aside. Will you take the time to watch Gov. Holcomb’s five-minute remarks, and share them widely?
Together, we will make progress – we don’t have more time or lives to lose.
“Use your breath and your will in efforts to bridge, not divide.”-Gov. Holcomb

"We’ve seen increases in Indiana’s testing positivity rates, but the good news is that there are 200 testing sites across the state – so anyone can...
Eric Holcomb for Indiana
Friends,
""We have to be prepared. And we are."" – Governor Holcomb
It’s almost the 4th of July – and over this holiday weekend and beyond, Governor Holcomb is looking at COVID-19 data with Hoosiers’ health as his top priority.
That’s why he announced that, while a few restrictions will lift this weekend to allow for outdoor events – where the risk of transmission is up to 19 times less – the majority of Phase 4 will remain in place through at least July 17.
Here’s what we can now expect in Indiana for the next few weeks as part of the Back on Track plan –
* Social Gatherings: Following the CDC’s social distancing guidelines, gatherings will be limited to up to 250 people.
* Eating Out: Dining room food service may continue up to 75 percent capacity as long as social distancing is implemented.
* Bars: Bar seating in restaurants may continue operations at 50 percent capacity with social distancing.
* Entertainment: Cultural, entertainment, amusement parks, tourism sites and similar facilities may continue operations open at 50 percent capacity.
And that’s while fairs and festivals can move forward this summer – as long as it’s done safely.
As always, state and local communities can impose stricter guidelines – and places like Elkhart County will remain in Stage 4 until at least July 13.
Why the delay? Governor Holcomb has always said this will be a data-driven decision, and here’s where the data currently stands:
Hospitalization Census
* Hospitalizations – As you can see from the chart above, Indiana is seeing a slight uptick in our hospitalization rate. While the uptick isn’t as strong as a few other states – it’s still an important change to watch.
* Surge Capacity – Indiana’s hospital surge capacity still remains strong, with 40% of ICU beds available and 83% of ventilators available.
* Testing – We’ve seen increases in Indiana’s testing positivity rates, but the good news is that there are 200 testing sites across the state – so anyone can now get tested (and for free at state-sponsored sites).
* Contact Tracing – Indiana’s contact tracing team is making 2,500 daily calls to people who have tested positive or their close contacts.
This Back on Track plan might take just a little bit longer – but remember: Indiana is making progress. And it’s all while Hoosiers’ health comes first.
So as you’re out and about this Independence Day weekend, please remember to be safe. Practice social distancing, wear your mask, and let’s look out for our fellow Hoosiers!
Happy (early) 4th,
-Your Holcomb Crew

"As Governor Holcomb said yesterday, #INThisTogether isn’t just a slogan – it’s how Hoosiers approach our team effort to getting back on track.
Eric Holcomb for Indiana
Friends,
“The words ‘In This Together’ aren't rhetorical – this is a playbook.” – Gov. Holcomb
We’re now almost a week into Phase 3 of Indiana’s Back on Track plan – it’s a step-by-step playbook to Indiana’s safe and steady reopening.
But it’s not the only playbook. As Governor Holcomb said yesterday, #INThisTogether isn’t just a slogan – it’s how Hoosiers approach our team effort to getting back on track.
We’re in this together by being safe as we go out – wearing masks, keeping a six foot distance, washing our hands, and using hand sanitizer.
But we’re also being safe by looking out for our mental health. Here’s just a few examples –
* We’re using telehealth services: Claims for mental health services have remained at a steady rate compared to pre-pandemic rates. And that’s because we’re seeing an increase in services provided through telehealth.
* We’re watching out for substance use disorder: Indiana is providing more naloxone kits directly to the public – one of the only tools available to reverse an overdose. And remember – treatment is available. Just call 211 or visit [[URL REDACTED]] to get connected to help.
* We’re providing resources for domestic violence and suicide prevention: Resources are available if you’re in a bad situation at home or have thoughts of suicide. Call the Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-779-7233 or the Suicide Crisis Line at 1-800-273-TALK.
* We’re using online resources for help: Last month, Indiana unveiled a new website, [[URL REDACTED]], that’s putting free mental health resources at Hoosiers’ fingertips. And so far, there have already been more than 10,000 clicks on the website’s resources.
And another way we look out for each other is ramping up again. Phase 2 of Indiana’s scientific study of the spread of COVID-19 across our state will begin next week – with invitations to participate going out this week (ensuring a random, scientific sample).
If you get a text message or a postcard inviting you to participate – please respond. Your response helps guide Indiana’s data-driven reopening and informs our decisions – keeping our fellow Hoosiers safe.
Now more than ever, it’s critical that we remain #InThisTogether. It’s a critical part of our shared Hoosier playbook.
#BackOnTrack,

"There were so many important points in his big speech that we wanted to send you a few of our favorite clips...
One Indiana for All
Friend,
Last week, Indiana Republicans made history by holding the first-ever Indiana Republican State Convention to be aired to a statewide audience.
Bringing 2,000 of Eric’s fellow Indiana Republicans together for the state convention wasn’t possible this year, but the Governor was still excited to share his vision for building One Indiana for All.
As he said, One Indiana for All means providing opportunity for all Hoosiers – with more Hoosiers back to work, and a modernized state government that runs efficiently for taxpayers. It means finishing I-69 and taking on long-lingering health issues. And it means working together to overcome racial inequities.
There were so many important points in his big speech (and from his partner, Lt. Governor Suzanne Crouch) that we wanted to send you a few of our favorite clips –
One Indiana for All
* The Hoosier Spirit is Strong: Hoosiers have remained strong and resilient through it all! We’ve made progress, and we’re on track to make some more. Watch as Eric talks about his vision for Indiana.
* What Can’t Wait is Urgency: Indiana has risen to many challenges during Eric’s first term, and he’s ready to rise to the occasion during a second term as well. Watch here.
* Indiana is a Home for Everyone: Eric said he’s dedicated to creating One Indiana for All! What does that mean? Watch this clip.
* Think of All We’ve Accomplished Together: Indiana sets records. And while some of our momentum slowed, we’re revving up again. Watch here.
* Let’s Keep Indiana on a Roll: Check out what Lt. Governor Suzanne Crouch has to say about writing the next chapter of the Hoosier success story! Watch here.
* The Right Leader for the Right Time: The Indiana Republican State Convention panel talked about how Eric is the leader who is making Indiana strong – not just today, but for decades to come. Watch here.
* Bonus! Governor Holcomb’s Convention Intro: This video perfectly tells the story of Eric’s leadership for Hoosiers – and how it’s led Indiana through the most difficult of times. Watch here.
In case you missed it (or you’re like us, and want to watch it again!), you can view Eric’s full speech here.
Together we’re building One Indiana – and we can’t do it without your help!

Eric Holcomb for Indiana
friend,
Just like the lives of folks across our state, earlier this year our campaign was put on hold.
Governor Holcomb put 100% of his energy behind fighting COVID-19. And -- like Hoosiers -- we stood behind him.
As your Holcomb Crew, we’ve been spending our time helping spread accurate and reliable information, listening to Hoosiers' concerns over the phone or online, and helping Governor Holcomb keep Hoosiers safe and healthy in any way that we can.
But Election Day 2020 is coming no matter what and like the rest of the state, we need to get back to work (safely!). If anything, the last couple of months have taught us how important it is to have a leader who is dedicated to building One Indiana.
They’ve also taught us that Indiana needs a leader who knows how to bring high-wage, high-demand jobs to Indiana and who has done it before. That we need a leader who knows how to bring Hoosiers together. That we need a steady and experienced leader that we can trust.
That we need another four years of Governor Holcomb.
Our 2020 campaign will most likely look a little bit different. While Governor Holcomb and Hoosiers across the state are getting Indiana back on track, there are still many unknowns.
But we do know that we’ll need your help more than ever. That’s why we’re reaching out today. Our end of quarter deadline is coming up later this month, and we need to pick up right where left off.
friend, will you chip in any amount using the button below and invest in One Indiana for another four years?
Invest in One Indiana
We know that times are tough for a lot of Hoosiers because of COVID-19, and we don’t want you to give unless you have the means.
If you are able to give, we’d love to have your support.
Thank you for everything you do,

"The Indy 500 is back this weekend, and we couldn’t be more excited to watch the Greatest Spectacle in Racing.
One Indiana
Friend,
We’re fired up.
The Indy 500 is finally here this weekend, and we couldn’t be more excited to watch the Greatest Spectacle in Racing. Back Home Again in Indiana, the cold bottle of milk on victory lane — the traditions are too many to count.
We won’t be able to crowd Indianapolis Motor Speedway this year, but we had our crew come up with a list of things we can do to celebrate race day.
One Indiana
* Host a socially distanced tailgate in your backyard \- Having an at-home tailgate is the next best thing to the party in the infield. Invite some family and friends over for a cookout!
* Watch it on TV \- The good news about this year’s Indy 500? There’s no blackout! You’ll be able to watch all the excitement from your couch.
* Watch this classic clip of the late Jim Nabors singing Back Home Again in Indiana \- This is one of our favorite traditions of all time, and race day wouldn’t be the same without the annual performance of this Indiana classic.
* Pick the driver you'll cheer for \- It’s always more fun when you have some skin in the game. Pick a driver, and yell until your voice is gone!
* Wear patriotic clothes \- It’s not the traditional Memorial Day weekend, but there’s perhaps no better time to don your red, white, and blue than for race day!
* Enjoy your favorite adult beverages responsibly \- There’s nothing like sipping on a cold one while watching the Indy 500! We recommend grabbing something from an Indiana brewery, winery, or distillery. Remember you can now buy on race day (Thank you, Gov. Holcomb!)
* Fly the checkered flag \- There’s nothing as exciting as the checkered flag waving at the end of the race. So get your checkered flag out at home and recreate the moment.
What are you planning on doing to celebrate the Indy 500? Let us know below!
Let us know!

Friend,
Did you see yesterday's Lieutenant Governor debate?
There’s no question about it, Hoosiers are lucky to have the best Lieutenant Governor in the country — Suzanne Crouch.
Her knowledge, poise, and dedication to Indiana were on full display yesterday during the debate and I couldn’t be prouder to call her my Lieutenant Governor.
But don’t take my word for it.
Take Team Holcomb’s! Governor Holcomb has worked closely with her over the last four years to build One Indiana for All and he knows Lt. Governor Crouch better than anyone. Take a look at some of the tweets the team sent yesterday:

Being pro-life is deeply personal to Eric, and he’s made defending the sanctity of life a top priority while Governor.
There is nothing more important to him than protecting Hoosier lives. And in this race, he is the ONLY pro-life candidate.
Under Eric’s leadership, Indiana has taken clear and decisive action to protect the most vulnerable members of our society and improve the lives of children both born and unborn, including:
* Reducing Indiana’s infant mortality rate. In 2019, Hoosiers saw the largest drop in infant mortality rate in six years!
* Increasing adoption opportunities - Indiana leads the nation in children adopted from foster care.
* Championing opportunities for Hoosiers with disabilities.
* Signing every pro-life bill that’s crossed his desk.
Here’s what Eric had to say about the endorsement.
“In Indiana, we don’t shy away from our biggest challenges – we set major goals and tackle them [[URL REDACTED]] in Indiana we’re celebrating more first birthdays, more permanent, loving families and more Hoosiers with different abilities finding independence. We still have more work to do – but together, we’re making a difference.”

Eric Holcomb for Indiana
Friends,
All of Indiana is now in Phase 4 of Governor Holcomb’s Back on Track Plan – and as more shops, restaurants and venues open – Indiana is continuing to deliver on COVID-19 testing and data.
And when it comes to data on COVID-19, Indiana is leading the nation!
You’ll probably remember back in April when Governor Holcomb announced a partnership with the IU Fairbanks School of Public Health to complete a multi-phased study looking at the true spread of COVID-19 across Indiana.
Well, we’ve now completed two phases of the study – and here’s what we’ve found:
* Active infections -- 1.7% (Phase 1) to 0.6% (Phase 2)
* Positive antibodies - 1.1% (Phase 1) to 1.5% (Phase 2)
* They observed fewer active infections, but more Hoosiers with COVID-19 antibodies
* There’s a higher rate of spread among households
* 43% of Hoosiers who are infected show no symptoms
Indiana remains the only state that has conducted random sample testing now in two waves. Many people from other states are looking at Indiana – impressed with that we’ve been able to accomplish by working together and focusing on data.
Governor Holcomb is continuing to look at that data – and it’s that information that’s driving his decisions as we continue to fight this pandemic and get Indiana Back on Track.
It is all Hoosiers’ responsibility to keep the transmission of COVID-19 low – and the data shows that so far, you’re doing great work!
-Your Holcomb Crew
P.S. Remember, any Hoosier can now get a COVID-19 test – with 200 testing sites available across the state. If you’re concerned, go get tested!

"a few examples that Governor Holcomb provided yesterday on how we’re reimagining your state government
Eric Holcomb for Indiana
Friends,
If you’ve been listening to Governor Holcomb for long, you know that “great government service” is one of his five fundamental governing principles.
And today, he discussed how – because of COVID-19 – we’re not just providing great government service, but we’re continuing to reimagine the way we’re serving Hoosiers as we get Indiana’s economy back on track.
Here are just a few examples that Governor Holcomb provided yesterday on how we’re reimagining your state government –
1.) Broadband Internet for Rural Indiana
Governor Holcomb is leading Indiana's largest single state investment in broadband in our state's history – announcing a $100 million phased investment in 2018.
Here’s a map of broadband investments made just last year:
Rural Broadband Investments
And now during a pandemic, it’s more important than ever to make sure we’re all connected. That’s why in July we’ll be announcing the next round of broadband funding, with 72 applications received in 47 counties. Stay tuned!
2.) Help for Hoosier Small Businesses
We all know that small businesses are the backbone of Indiana’s economy. And that’s why Indiana is launching a new phase of the COVID-19 Response Program to help those small businesses who have been hit hard by the pandemic.
Helping Hoosier Small Businesses
Local governments can apply for up to $250,000 in funding, and then use that funding to provide either grants or loans of up to $25,000 to small businesses that keep their employees working. If you’re a community interested in applying for this funding stream, contact the Indiana Office of Community and Rural Affairs at [[URL REDACTED]]
3.) Helping Hoosiers With Healthcare Expenses
More big news today! Indiana has received a waiver for a first-in-the-nation program that’s helping Hoosiers transition from Indiana’s Healthy Indiana Plan (HIP) to private insurance, without experiencing a gap in coverage.
Helping Hoosiers with Healthcare Expenses
This newly-approved program allows Hoosiers transitioning out of HIP access to up to $1,000 from their POWER account for up to 12 months to pay premiums, deductibles, copayments and coinsurance during their transition to commercial coverage. This will provide critical assistance as HIP members skill-up and continue to pursue meaningful employment.
As you can see, Governor Holcomb is committed to providing great government service to Hoosiers – now, and always.

"WARNING: THE FOLLOWING LIST COULD PROVOKE HUNGER.
One Indiana
Friends,
WARNING: THE FOLLOWING LIST COULD PROVOKE HUNGER.
There’s nothing better than a great steak.
This is a principle we firmly stand by here at the Holcomb Crew. Eric has spent a lot of time at these amazing steakhouses across Indiana throughout the years -- small businesses, and true institutions of our Hoosier history.
Now more than ever we need to support our local restaurants who’ve been hit hard by the pandemic. They’ve adjusted the way they run their business, from increasing their take-out to adjusting their dine-in hours. While it may not be the experience you’re used to, know that your support will help them keep their doors open!
Here are some of Eric’s favorite places he wanted to share with you for this week’s One Indiana list!
We hope they inspire you to chase down a great cut of beef from one of these local steakhouses in the near future. And while you’re visiting, please make sure to continue to follow all local health guidelines.
Check out Eric’s list below!
One Indiana
* The Beef House, Covington \- Family owned & operated since 1964, four generations of the Wright family continue to make the Beef House a special place today (the rolls!!). The Beef House has made a couple of appearances on our best food in Indiana lists — it’s just that good.
* Bonge’s, Perkinsville \- Serving Hoosiers since 1934, Bonge’s is a true Indiana classic and one of Indiana’s premier dining destinations. If you haven’t been, you have to add it to your steakhouse bucket list!
* Broadway Tavern, Madison \- Right in the heart of Madison’s “Landmark Historic District,” Broadway Tavern has been feeding hungry Hoosiers for more than 185 years as Indiana’s oldest tavern. It’s a unique part of Indiana history and a great place to get a steak if you’re in Madison!
* Bynum’s, Martinsville \- A great place to grab a steak with friends and family, it’s a must-visit if you’re passing through Martinsville.
* Haub Steak House, Haubstadt \- Housed in a century-old grain warehouse, this steakhouse is one of the most unique restaurants you will ever see. Be sure to stop by to try one of their amazing dry-aged, hand-trimmed steaks and enjoy the antique atmosphere.
* Joseph Decuis, Roanoke \- They are resurrecting the old ways with a ‘Farm to Fork’ experience. Their dinners live up to the ideals of the restaurant’s namesake, who described dining as “the stage for the bonding of family, friends and business associates.”
* Kelsey’s Steak and Seafood, Valparaiso \- Amazing food, better service. Kelsey’s serves award-winning steaks that are “Rarely This Well Done.”
* Little Zagreb, Bloomington \- Feeding hungry college students for 40 years, Janko’s is one of the best places to get a steak in Indiana. They are a Bloomington classic and well worth a visit.
* The Red Geranium, New Harmony \- One of the most charming and romantic restaurants in all of Indiana, you can enjoy a world-class steak while looking out over a panoramic view of a beautiful lake.
* Ruth's Chris Steakhouse, Fort Wayne, Indianapolis & South Bend \- When your steak comes out, don't touch the plate. It's heated to 500 degrees! This chain's locations in Fort Wayne, Indianapolis and South Bend are great for celebrating a special occasion.
* Story Inn, Story \- Established more than 150 years ago, the Story Inn has been serving delicious steaks to Hoosiers for more than a century. The inn sits on 18 acres of beautiful Indiana countryside that have been home to many weddings and special moments over the last 150 years.
* St. Elmo’s, Indianapolis \- The oldest Indianapolis steakhouse still in its original location, this James Beard Award-winning classic is one of the best. It’s even been named one of America’s 10 Great Classic Restaurants Well Worth A Visit!
* 1875: The Steakhouse, French Lick \- Do you know the famous date this steakhouse was named after? 1875 celebrates the first running of the Kentucky Derby! Come check out one of French Lick’s signature restaurants and one of our state’s best steaks.
Are you hungry yet? We sure are after making this list!

Eric Holcomb for Indiana
Friend,
Building One Indiana means working on a lot of things in our state (improving education, skilling up our workforce, lowering the infant mortality rate, and much, MUCH, more).
But sometimes, it just means literally building.
Before COVID-19, we were making record investments in our roads and bridges. That record road construction continued -- at an accelerated speed!
And now we’re committed to continuing to help Hoosier families and businesses by taking our infrastructure to the next level.
Including finishing I-69.
Add your name and help us finish I-69 —>
Finishing I-69 will provide a powerful economic engine for all of Indiana and make sure that Hoosier families can travel across our state safely. It’s a symbol of our commitment to building a 21st-century economy, and an infrastructure system that truly works for all Hoosiers.
We’re on the road (pun intended!) to building One Indiana, and following through on infrastructure projects like finishing I-69 is a crucial part step towards our future.
Friend, we need to know that you stand with us on this journey. Will you add your name and help us in our push to finish I-69? We’re almost there.
Add your name and help us finish I-69 —>
Thank you for everything you do. We’ll be in touch soon.

Eric Holcomb for Indiana
Hoosiers,
You are not alone. We are all ready to put COVID-19 behind us.
Governor Holcomb is with us, too. But, as Governor Holcomb reminded us yesterday, the data and science show that we are not over COVID-19 yet – in Indiana, or anywhere else.
This is why Indiana will remain in Stage 5 of the Back on Track Plan, our current managed stage of this public health crisis.
Indiana has launched a county-by-county, color-coded map on its COVID-19 Dashboard, and you can check daily on how things are going in your community. Each color comes with recommendations on organizing gatherings and how we can all continue to fight the spread.
Color-coded counties
COVID-19 DASHBOARD: Check Your County’s Numbers Now
Our state’s current mask requirement has also been extended.
Governor Holcomb said it perfectly today: “In my mind, wearing a mask is a layup.”
That’s because, as more Hoosiers are returning back to work, back to school, and back to their routines, it’s the simplest actions we can all take to keep us and our fellow Hoosiers healthy.
It’s how we show our Hoosier Hospitality.
So Hoosiers, let’s take the easiest shot together. Wear your mask, wash your hands, stay home if you’re sick, and keep your distance (6 feet, that is).

"Today, Eric issued a statewide mask mandate in order to keep at-risk Hoosiers safe and help our recovery along. Here’s what he had to say:
One Indiana: Masks
Friend,
It’s time to mask up, Hoosiers!
Today, Eric issued a statewide mask mandate in order to keep at-risk Hoosiers safe and help our recovery along. Here’s what he had to say:
“When I asked you months ago to hunker down, you did. We did. We slowed the spread. It's just factual. We protected our hospitals. While we have continued to fare better than many other states, now we have to hunker down in a different way. Which is why wearing masks will become the fashion of the day.” - Governor Eric Holcomb
Wearing your mask is an easy way to make sure Hoosiers stay healthy, our businesses stay open, and our students can safely return to school when the time comes.
Many Indiana counties are already under local mask ordinances and the governor’s statewide mandate will be effective for the rest of the state on Monday, July 27.
We had our team pull together the best reasons to wear a mask, but we want to hear your reasons, too!
One Indiana: Masks
* Slow the spread \- This one’s basic, but incredibly important. Face coverings can and do blunt the spread of COVID-19. It’s that simple.
* Keep our businesses open \- Our local businesses are always there for us, and we need to be there for them. The better we are about wearing masks, the more businesses can stay open and the better off our economy will be.
* Protect at-risk Hoosiers \- Wearing a mask helps keep Hoosiers who are at-risk for COVID-19 safe. Being a good neighbor starts with wearing a mask!
* Keep your family safe \- Nothing is more important than protecting your loved ones, and Eric’s mask mandate is helping keep them safe.
* Get Hoosier students back to school \- Hoosier students are counting on us to be responsible and wear masks. The more people wear masks, the faster they’ll be able to get back in the classroom.
Why are we doing this? Eric pointed to several reasons that a statewide mask mandate is now needed:
* We’ve seen an increase in the COVID-19 positivity rate.
* Hospitalizations related to COVID-19 have been ticking up.
* Surrounding states are seeing an increase in positive COVID-19 cases.
Wearing masks is a safe and simple way to slow the spread of COVID-19.
Please be a part of the solution and wear a mask.
What’s your number one reason for wearing a mask? Share it with us below!
Let us know!
Thanks for reading — we’ll be in touch soon.

Friend,
We told you last month — we restarted our grassroots fundraising campaign, and we can’t afford to take our foot off the gas.
That’s why we’re inviting you to join the One Indiana Club.
Join the One Indiana Club
The One Indiana Club is a select group of grassroots donors who we’re going to rely on every step of the way from today until Election Day. Grassroots donors like you help us pay for ads, yard signs, t-shirts, travel — you name it.
We could not run this campaign without you and that’s a fact.

"Starting July 23, gatherings of MORE than 250 Hoosiers, such as fairs, festivals, parades, graduations, concerts, conferences, etc., must work...
Eric Holcomb for Indiana
Friends,
Governor Holcomb is working hard to get Indiana back on track. As he’s said all along, the data will drive the timing of this plan – and this week, we learned more about where the data stands in Indiana.
Positivity Rate
As you’ll see from the chart above, like many states across the county, Indiana is seeing an uptick in the percentage of Hoosiers who are testing positive each day for COVID-19.
These are the four guiding principles Governor Holcomb is watching closely –
* Hospitalizations – 15% of all positive cases are currently leading to hospitalization, which is down slightly from last week
* Surge Capacity – Our hospitals’ surge capacity remains strong with 35.5% of open ICU beds and 84% of ventilators available
* Testing – 182,000 Hoosiers have taken advantage of free community testing provided by OptumServe or the Indiana State Department of Health. As you’ll see in the chart, 7.1% of those tests are coming back positive – which is up
* Contact Tracing – Indiana’s contact tracing team is in high-gear making calls to people who have tested positive or their close contacts
With all of this data in mind, this week Governor Holcomb announced that Indiana will remain in Stage 4.5 for at least the next two weeks. Elkhart County will remain in Stage 4.
Starting July 23, gatherings of MORE than 250 Hoosiers, such as fairs, festivals, parades, graduations, concerts, conferences, etc., must work with their local health department to develop a written plan to mitigate against COVID-19.
We’ll continue to keep you updated on the latest in Indiana’s COVID-19 data here. In the meantime, let’s all continue to be safe. Wear a face covering when you go out, wash your hands frequently, and social distance when you can. By taking these steps together, we’ll get Indiana back on track!
-Your Holcomb Crew
P.S. Remember – testing capacity remains strong throughout Indiana. Have COVID-19 symptoms? Have you been around someone who tested positive? Go get tested today. The Indiana State Department of Health and OptumServe sites are free and don’t require an appointment. Find the site near you.

"Governor Holcomb is committed to keeping us in the pole position when it comes to infrastructure.
Holcomb for IN
Friends,
Governor Holcomb mentioned it yesterday, and we will tell you it again today – Hoosiers are getting out and about at almost the same rate we were before the pandemic.
And one place we are seeing the most movement again is on our roads. Traffic is down just 13% compared to early this year.
After all, we’re the Crossroads of America and Governor Holcomb is committed to keeping us in the pole position when it comes to infrastructure.
That’s why Governor Holcomb announced that the state’s incredibly popular local road funding program is back! The Community Crossings Matching Grant Program assists local communities in the repair, ongoing maintenance, and improvement of their roads and bridges – making sure Hoosiers’ first and last miles of their days are durable and safe.
In the last two years, $738.3 million has been invested into local projects throughout all 92 counties. $120 million of that was invested early this year alone. And the funding does not stop there.
Is there a road or bridge in your local community that still needs to be fixed? This program can help. The second Community Crossings call of 2020 is now moving forward.
Here are some dates you need to know:
* Sept. 25, 2020 – Application period opens
* Oct. 23, 2020 – Application period ends
* November 2020 – Awards announced
Keep up-to-date with the latest information about Community Crossings grants.
Communities large and small across the state are evenly feeling the positive impacts of these roads and bridge investments. It’s towns like Mauckport along the Ohio River in Southern Indiana with a population of less than 100 people. They received $100,000 and are seeing 3 miles of road improved – and your community could be next.
Governor Holcomb knows that our state can only be supported when every community is supported. This is a team sport, and together we’ve got Indiana in the fast lane for continued recovery and growth.

"Gov. Holcomb is Leading Indiana’s Comeback
Eric Holcomb for Indiana
Friends,
In case missed yesterday’s big news: Indiana’s unemployment plummeted in July, falling 3.3% and now standing at a pandemic-period low of 7.8%. The Indiana Department of Workforce Development released the July numbers yesterday. The state’s unemployment figure is now 2.3% below the national average.
Even though this is race weekend, Governor Holcomb isn’t taking a victory lap and we’re keeping the pedal to the metal. However this unemployment report is good news as we’re all working together to get Indiana Back on Track.
Kyle Hupfer, manager of the governor’s reelection campaign, had this to say: “We’re certainly not out of the woods, but July’s unemployment drop is great news and shows that Governor Holcomb’s measured, data-driven leadership through this pandemic is working for Hoosiers. We’ve seen how quickly COVID-19 can change things, so we’re greeting this news with cautious optimism. However, this is certainly a positive development and I know Hoosiers are glad to be getting back to work.”
In April, when the state’s economy was essentially shutdown as the coronavirus pandemic took hold, Indiana’s unemployment rate jumped to 16.9%.
“Safely reopening the economy is the governor’s top priority and yesterday’s news is further proof that Governor Holcomb’s leadership during this unprecedented crisis continues to benefit Hoosiers,” Hupfer added.

Friend - do you have a second?
I wanted to reach out and take a moment to talk about the stakes tomorrow, and what this election means for the future of our state.
All over Indiana, Hoosiers are going to be headed to the polls to decide what the future holds for our communities, our businesses, our farms, and our families.
There’s a clear choice before Hoosiers, friend — a choice that will have lasting impacts on our state and future generations of Hoosiers.
I know as Hoosiers, we will choose to continue building One Indiana for All.
But we can’t sit back and take victory for granted — we need to go out and earn it.
Getting the vote out is an absolutely crucial part of continuing to build One Indiana for All. In order to keep building on all of the success that we’ve had over the past four years, I need you to come through for us at the ballot box tomorrow.

"We’ve said it before – combatting this pandemic is a team effort, and we all have a role to play. And teams work best when we all know the situation
Eric Holcomb for Indiana
Friends,
We’ve said it before – combatting this pandemic is a team effort, and we all have a role to play. And teams work best when we all know the situation at hand.
That’s why yesterday, Governor Holcomb gave us an update on the data behind the four guiding principles he’s watching most closely as we get our economy back on track:
* Testing: Indiana now has 216 testing sites statewide, with more than 724,200 Hoosiers tested. The daily COVID-19 positivity rate has ticked up statewide (see the numbers here).
* Hospitalizations: 907 Hoosiers are currently hospitalized with COVID-19, up from 595 Hoosiers on June 26. Daily hospital admissions have dropped (53 admissions on July 23, 74 on July 13).
* Surge capacity: Indiana’s hospital capacity remains strong – 43.1% of ICU beds are currently available and 84.8% of Indiana’s ventilators are available.
* Contact Tracing: Nearly 80% of all cases have been successfully contract traced, helping contain the virus.
As you can see, a higher percentage of COVID-19 tests are coming back positive, with more Hoosiers facing severe symptoms leading to hospitalization.
With all of this information in mind, Governor Holcomb has extended Stage 4.5 of the Back on Track plan to August 27th. Unlike some other states, we don’t want to go backward!
And a little good news – despite the pandemic, Indiana’s private sector added 128,900 jobs in June. Our labor force participation rate stands above the national average at 64.3% -- and is on par with what we saw in February before any shutdowns. This means that Hoosiers are willing, able and energized to work!
Hoosiers, we’re known for our work hard — both in our jobs, and in doing our part to fight COVID-19. Thank you for being on this team, and for looking at the data alongside Governor Holcomb. Together, we’re in the game to get Indiana #BackonTrack!

Eric Holcomb for Indiana
Friend,
Did you get a chance to watch Eric’s speech?
He just addressed Indiana on the issues of equity and inclusion, and we wanted to make sure you got a chance to see what he had to say.
“What I’ve laid out today are the first steps in a broad effort to make sure Indiana is a place where every Hoosier has an equal opportunity to achieve our founders’ vision of ‘Life, Liberty and that pursuit of Happiness.’” – Governor Holcomb
Eric delivered a thoughtful, open, and groundbreaking speech on his vision for making historic progress together on so many critical issues - criminal justice reform, education and workforce development, transparency, health care and more.
After months of speaking with Black leaders and stakeholders statewide – including business owners, college presidents, law enforcement, corporate executives, church leaders, and everyday citizens – he laid out a plan that addresses the root causes of inequity and takes action to promote equality, inclusion, and opportunity for all.
You can watch the full speech here.
Alternate text
We had our crew pull together the biggest takeaways from his speech — please check them out below.
Modernizing Policing & Criminal Justice Reform
“If you want change, don’t throw a brick; use a brick to lay a foundation for something better.” – Gov. Holcomb
1. Governor Holcomb’s first priority is the protection of our citizens AND our officers.
2. Indiana is increasing minority representation among police officers, and it will work to modernize training and work with the legislature on criminal justice reforms.
3. To protect our citizens and officers, Governor Holcomb is mandating body cameras for every frontline state trooper by Spring 2021.
4. To modernize officer training, Governor Holcomb is directing a 3rd-party, top-down review of our state police and law enforcement academy curriculum and training, including use of force, de-escalation training, and implicit bias training.
5. Governor Holcomb will work with the legislature to add more civilian representation to the Indiana Law Enforcement Academy (ILEA) board.
6. Governor Holcomb will continue working with members of the legislature, judiciary and prosecutors on ideas that can be brought forward during the 2021 legislative session to collaborate on sentencing reform, earned credit time, jail overcrowding and exorbitant fees.
Promoting Economic Opportunity Through Education & Workforce Development
“I believe that the surest path to equal opportunity is with an high-quality education.” – Gov. Holcomb
1. Black students have lower high school graduation rates and lower college enrollment.
Governor Holcomb will direct Indiana’s new Secretary of Education to make one of their first tasks to look at actions that can be taken immediately to improve minority teacher recruitment, learning gaps and other areas to bridge the divide.
2. State leaders will submit specific recommendations on how the state may adjust policies for all our workforce programs to create greater opportunity for people of color.
Reforming State Government
1. Governor Holcomb will appoint Indiana’s first-ever Chief Equity, Inclusion and Opportunity Officer who will report directly to him as a member of his cabinet.
2. This person will focus solely on improving equity, inclusion and opportunity across all state government operations as well as drive systemic change to remove hurdles in the government workplace and services we provide.
In short, this new Cabinet member will help every state agency raise their game.
Increasing Transparency
1. As Governor Holcomb said, we’re putting “our cards on the table, face up.” Indiana’s Management Performance Hub will create a Public Disparity Data Portal to show the state’s progress on these issues.
2. The portal will track information on Pre-K enrollment; graduation, college enrollment and employment rates; access to capital; Healthy Indiana Plan enrollment; foster care placement rates; incarceration and recidivism rates, etc.
And, of course, this isn’t a new topic. We’re already taking action on many important issues facing Black Hoosiers:
1. Minority representation among graduates of the Indiana Law Enforcement Academy has increased from 14% to 28% between 2016 and 2019.
2. Indiana’s infant mortality rate, which disproportionately affects many Black mothers and children, is at its lowest rate since 2012.
3. Governor Holcomb set a goal for Indiana’s infant mortality rate to be the best lowest in the Midwest by 2024.
4. He launched Indiana’s OB Navigator program that helps mothers and babies in Indiana’s highest-risk areas get the care they need.
5. Next Level Jobs provides free job training to help Hoosiers skill-up for high-wage, in-demand jobs, and has now helped more than 10,000 Hoosiers. Governor Holcomb added an additional $50 million to bolster career training this year.
Please take some time to watch Governor Holcomb’s full speech, and if you can, share it with your friends, family and contacts.

One Indiana: Ice Cream
Friend,
Indiana is getting back on track, and businesses are reopening -- including restaurants across the state!
The COVID-19 pandemic has hit our restaurant industry especially hard. Now that our restaurants are reopening, we’re all excited to get out and support them in a safe and healthy way.
For this week’s One Indiana, we thought we’d share some ideas about where to start, so we had our crew pull together Eric’s favorite ice cream places in Indiana (yum!). These are all time-tested favorites -- no matter your preferred flavor!
Remember - as you start to patronize your favorite restaurants and local businesses, be sure to check the Indiana State Department of Health website. Local leaders and the businesses in your community might have additional requirements, too, so be sure to check with them, and please follow all guidelines.

One Indiana: Ice Cream
* Ivanhoe’s, Upland \- 100 different milkshakes. 100 different sundaes. Need we say more?
* Traders Point Creamery, Zionsville \- This organic farm and award-winning creamery is a great way to cool off in the summer heat! Stop by and grab some dessert at their Dairy Bar.
* Zaharakos, Columbus \- This old fashioned ice cream parlor is one of our crew’s favorites and an Indiana tradition since 1900.
* Bo-Mac’s Drive In, Shoals \- Travel back in time at this drive-in restaurant and get your sundae delivered by a car hop!
* Tasty Freeze, Montezuma \- A classic spot to stop for top-notch burgers and ice cream on a summer day!

* LICS, Evansville (multiple locations) \- What does LICS stand for? Lloyd’s Ice Cream Shoppes, of course. Serving premium ice cream to Hoosiers since 1950.
* Alexander’s, Cicero and Noblesville \- You need to stop by and try one of their 36 amazing flavors of hand-dipped ice cream.
* Zesto’s, Fort Wayne \- Locally owned and operated for more than 50 years, many Fort Wayne residents consider their opening the first sign of spring.
* BRIC’S, Indianapolis (Broad Ripple Ice Cream) \- Located in the historic Monon Railway Station and owned by life-long Indianapolis residents, this is a must for Indy residents.
* Fair Oaks Farm, Newton County \- Fair Oaks is a great outdoor escape and the number one agritourism destination in the Midwest! Take a visit, grab a cone, and reconnect with nature!
* Jimmie’s Dairy Bar, Pendleton \- Jimmie’s is an Indiana staple, and also home to some pretty amazing barbeque. Check it out if you’re near Pendleton!
* Cone Palace, Kokomo \- The Cone Palace certainly has our crew’s endorsement — it’s one of Eric’s favorite places to eat in the whole world and a must-try.
* Handel’s Homemade Ice Cream & Yogurt, Fishers \- They’ve been serving Hoosiers daily made ice cream since 1945. Come and see why they claim to be recognized as the number one ice cream in the world!
* Dairy Sweet, Grabill \- Dairy Sweet has been open for more than 70 years. You need to stop by and try out one of their 13 delicious flavors of soft serve.

Hey friend \- it’s Governor Eric Holcomb.
This won’t take long, but I wanted to ask you for a personal favor.
As governor, it’s my job to keep Hoosiers safe. I take that job seriously — there’s nothing more important to me than making sure everyone in our state has a chance to thrive.
Right now, that means making sure our economy powers through COVID-19 and that our small businesses come out the other side of this stronger than ever.
There’s no doubt that, together, we’re making progress.
* Indiana’s unemployment rate has dropped and is now 2.4% below the national average as more Hoosiers get back to work safely.
* Our labor force participation rate is nearing pre-pandemic levels.
But there’s more work to be done.
That’s why I’m reaching out right now and asking you for a promise. Will you pledge to support our small businesses (safely) as we work to get them back on track?
Whether that’s going out to eat, ordering take out, or shopping at your favorite Main Street store, you’ll be helping our small businesses weather this storm, just like they’ve helped our communities so many times before.
Use the link below and join me in pledging to do whatever we can to support Hoosier small businesses (safely).

Hey friend - we’re reaching out today because we have an urgent request.
Our final End of Quarter fundraising deadline before Election Day is this Wednesday (September 30th) at midnight.
This is one of the last big fundraising opportunities we have left before Election Day, and we’re reaching out to every member of our grassroots community and asking them to help us capitalize on this opportunity.
We’ve made a lot of progress over the last four years, but here’s the truth — there’s still a lot of work to be done to build One Indiana for All.
If we want to keep building on the best infrastructure in the country, getting our economy back on track, helping Hoosiers skill-up for high-wage careers, and much, much more, we need to go all in until Election Day.
That’s why we’re asking every single one of our supporters to chip in before our End of Quarter deadline hits.
Friend, can we count on you to come through for us and help push our campaign over the line on Election Day? Donate before our deadline ends below.

Friend,
Governor Holcomb has been out hitting the campaign trail, meeting with Hoosiers from all over our great state.
We pulled together a video of our favorite stops so far — take a ride with Eric below and check out where he’s been!
Share The Video!
Watch and Share
Eric and Lt. Governor Crouch have finally been able to get out and do what they love most — talk to incredible Hoosiers, hear their stories, and find out how they can better serve the people of our state.
From the Johnson County GOP Picnic to the Morgan County Lincoln Day Dinner to the Spencer-Perry Picnic, we’ve had some pretty great experiences so far on the campaign trail (Governor Holcomb even got a customized basketball jersey from the students at Eminence High School!).
It’s been amazing to see some friendly faces after the last couple of months and get back to doing what we love. We can’t wait to get out and see more of the people who make our state so special.
We hope that you enjoy our video, and share it with your friends and family on Facebook!

"Governor Holcomb knows that we’ve all been impacted by COVID-19, and potentially nobody’s been harder hit than our tourism industry
Eric Holcomb for Indiana
Friends,
Governor Holcomb knows that we’ve all been impacted by COVID-19, and potentially nobody’s been harder hit than our tourism industry, the keepers of our world-renowned Hoosier hospitality.
Many museums had to close their doors, festivals had to refrain from putting up their tents, and musicians had to stop performing. Most of our arts and cultural organizations have had to temporarily cease operations.
However, Governor Holcomb and Lt. Governor Suzanne Crouch are working hard to make sure these institutions can reopen!
Lt. Governor Crouch announced Wednesday that a $10 million grant will help fund these beloved programs, preserving them and their history within our local communities. Federal CARES Act money provided through the Indiana Destination Development Corporation will ensure that events, festivals, fairs, expos, and gatherings continue to be valuable and vital parts of our lives.
If you or someone you know belong to one of the following categories, you may be eligible to receive a portion of this grant starting August 10:
* Arts and cultural organizations
* Museums
* Theaters
* Community event organizations
* Festival organizations
* Destination marketing organizations
You can find the application here.
Hoosiers, I don’t know about you, but we are ready to stroll through galleries, eat a funnel cake, and enjoy live music in the park once again! We’re one day closer to getting there, and these grants will help. So, remember to wear your mask, wash your hands, and social distance. We can all do our part to support our tourism industry!

Eric Holcomb for Indiana
Friends,
It is safe to vote. It will be safe to vote in person on Election Day. It will be safe to vote in person the 28 days of early voting before Election Day.
Election Day is 68 days away and Governor Holcomb wants you to know that in Indiana, your vote will count!
The governor and Secretary of State Connie Lawson gave an update on election preparations yesterday during the weekly briefing and this is what you need to know about Indiana’s safe and secure voting process:
* On November 3, the polls will be open for you to vote in person!
* All Hoosiers have the opportunity to vote early. Skip the lines and vote early starting October 6.
* Absentee voting protocol is in place as usual. Curious if you are eligible? Look here.
* Your vote is protected as measures are in place to secure the voting process.
* Safety is our top priority, as always. PPE materials will be distributed to all poll workers and voters in all counties thanks to the generous help of the Indiana National Guard. Social distancing will also be enforced.
And to power our elections, counties and local political parties across the state are recruiting poll workers and absentee ballot counters. These positions are paid – and they’ll be plenty of PPE to keep our workers safe. If you want to help make democracy count, sign up to be a poll worker!
""There's no better year to volunteer and do your civic duty. We're all in this together, and we'll get through this safely together, too."" – Gov. Holcomb
If you do need to vote absentee by mail, it’s recommended that you mail in your application by October 19 (or you can apply online), and mail your completed ballot back to your county by October 27.
We want to thank Secretary Lawson and her team for their efforts to keep the decades-long tradition of voting alive and well! It is leadership like her’s that gives us the confidence to say that voting in-person is safe, secure, and healthy!

Eric Holcomb for Indiana
friend,
We wrote to you earlier this week and let you know — our end of quarter deadline is coming up at the end of the month on June 30th.
This quarter, we need you more than ever.
As Governor Holcomb has put 100% of his energy behind fighting COVID-19 and getting Indiana back on track, we’ve changed everything about the way we campaign. Just like the rest of our state, we’ve had to do our jobs at a distance.
And because we haven’t been able to hold in-person events or normal fundraisers, we’re relying on our online grassroots community more than ever before.
Our One Indiana agenda has never been more important.
Hoosiers need strong, compassionate, and effective leadership not just right now, but for the next four years and beyond. We need someone who knows how to build an economy, create jobs, and keep Hoosiers safe.
You can help us secure the leadership that Indiana needs by chipping in any amount before the end of the quarter. Our finance team will be reaching out again later this month, but we wanted to give you a chance to chip in right now.

"Governor Holcomb’s team is also getting critical PPE to schools across the state – just in time to safely reopen schools for a new year.
Eric Holcomb for Indiana
Friends,
Businesses across Indiana are reopening, with more Hoosiers getting back to work.
It’s definitely a welcome sign – but as we’re getting out, it’s critical that we’re being safe. To limit the spread of COVID-19, the CDC recommends wearing a cloth face covering to protect your fellow Hoosiers.
Yesterday, we received an update on how Governor Holcomb and his team are leading the way when it comes to providing Hoosier frontline workers, businesses and schools with the resources we need to mask up!
In fact, the state has already worked with Indiana manufacturers and suppliers from across the state to supply over 26 million pieces of PPE – including masks, disinfectant, gloves, hand sanitizer and more.
PPE for Schools
Governor Holcomb’s team is also getting critical PPE to schools across the state – just in time to safely reopen schools for a new year. They have more than 3 million reusable masks available for students!
This program is available to all schools, and as of yesterday, 472 Indiana school corporations are participating.
In addition to a reusable mask for Hoosier students, here’s what else schools will receive:
Facemasks and sanitizer
PPE for Businesses
As the Back on Track plan launched, so did the Indiana Small Business PPE Marketplace. Since May, it’s filled more than 30,000 orders to over 600 cities across Indiana, protecting thousands of Hoosiers on the job at our state’s small businesses!
And now that requests are shifting, the state is launching the Indiana PPE Directory, which is directly connecting Hoosiers with our local businesses that manufacture or distribute PPE. You can check it out here.
We have so much to be thankful for here in Indiana, and that includes Governor Holcomb’s leadership as we continue to navigate this pandemic.

"We wanted to update you on how Indiana’s doing. Indiana’s guiding principles are looking good
Eric Holcomb for Indiana
Hoosiers,
Back in May, Governor Holcomb detailed Indiana’s four guiding principles – the benchmarks and the data he’s following through the Back on Track plan.
And now that we’re in Stage 5, we wanted to update you on how Indiana’s doing. Indiana’s guiding principles are looking good – and that’s a credit to your hard work.
Here’s where the data stands:
Hospitalizations – Fewer Hoosiers Admitted
As you can see, on Sept. 25, 64 Hoosiers were admitted to the hospital for COVID-19 – down from 94 Hoosiers admitted just a month ago.
Hospitalizations
Surge Capacity – Remains Strong
From the outset of the pandemic, “flattening the curve” has been all about ensuring our healthcare system doesn’t get overrun and that we have the resources to care for those Hoosiers most in need. Well, on Tuesday, 37% of the state’s ICU beds and 80% of the state’s ventilators were available – and that’s holding steady.
Surge Capacity
Surge Capacity
Robust Testing – Available Statewide
Governor Holcomb has ensured that any Hoosier who needs a test can get a test. We have 251 active testing sites across Indiana right now. In fact, since May, more than 2 million COVID-19 tests have been administered across Indiana.
Robust Testing
Contact Tracing – Strong & Continuing to Grow
Nearly 700 Hoosiers have stepped up to the plate to be state contact tracers – plus nearly an additional 350 at Indiana’s local health departments. Their work is helping track the spread of this virus – and it’s critical to keeping our economy open safely.
Contact Tracing
Hoosiers, good news continues to come to our state and it’s because of Governor Holcomb’s leadership, and because of your dedication. We’re staying healthy, our economy is bouncing back – and together, we’ll reach even greater heights.
#BackonTrack,
-Your Holcomb Crew
P.S. We also heard from Lt. Governor Suzanne Crouch about two new grants. If you’re helping lead one of Indiana’s critical meat processing facilities or if you’re a local government leader looking to help Hoosiers with disabilities in your community, make sure to check out these grants!

"Rising temperatures and increased hours of sunshine (sunset is now after 9 p.m. ET!) have many Hoosiers throughout the state looking to get out
One Indiana | Phase 3
Friend,
Memorial Day is officially behind us.
That means that the unofficial start of summer in Indiana is now underway!
Rising temperatures and increased hours of sunshine (sunset is now after 9 p.m. ET!) have many Hoosiers throughout the state looking to get out and about.
Most of Indiana officially entered Phase 3 of the Back on Track plan on Friday (a few days early).
And Hoosiers have earned it!
As a whole, we’ve done a great job social distancing and following safety guidelines. And as a result, hospital admissions have remained low and our surge capacity has remained strong.
But what’s open now? What are capacity limits? And what are recommendations to stay safe? Here’s a quick rundown of what you need to know.
One Indiana | Phase 3
* Shopping: Shops and small businesses can now open at 75% capacity while maintaining social distancing.
* Going Out to Eat: The dining room at your favorite restaurant can now be open at 50% capacity, with groups sitting at every other table.
* Gyms & Fitness: Get ready to sweat! Your favorite gym can now open with limited class sizes, social distancing, and equipment cleaned after every use.
* Entertainment: State parks have been open, and remain open! Does a drive-in movie sound like fun? Because that’s open, too!
* Outdoor Recreation: Let’s get outside! Playgrounds remain closed, but community tennis courts, basketball courts, soccer and baseball fields are open with social gathering guidelines.
* Camping: Another great way to get outside. Indiana campgrounds can now be open with social distancing, sanitation, and proper precautions.
* Day Camps & Non-Contact Sports: Community recreational youth and adult sports may resume practices and conditioning. And kids’ summer camps can open starting June 1!
* Community Pools: Grab your swimsuit! Community pools can open, but they must follow CDC guidance.
* Personal Services: Really need a haircut? We get it. Personal services like haircuts are now open by appointment.
Phase 3 is now active in most of Indiana – and is slated to kick-start in Marion, Lake and Cass counties on June 1. You can learn more about Phase 3 here.
Of course – don’t forget. If you’re getting out, let’s be safe.
Wear your mask, keep at least six feet from other groups, wash your hands frequently, use hand sanitizer – and together, let’s keep our fellow Hoosiers safe, and keep getting back on track!

Did you see the news?
President Donald J. Trump tapped another Hoosier to serve our nation.
Yesterday, the President nominated South Bend’s Amy Coney Barrett to fill the vacancy on the United States Supreme Court.
Governor Holcomb supports this additional dose of Hoosier common sense in Washington, saying Judge Barrett has a “compelling combination of experience and intellect.”
Eric knows that Judge Barrett, a graduate of—and later a professor at—the prestigious Notre Dame Law School, “would serve our country well on the Supreme Court.”
Do you agree with Eric that the nation would benefit for some more Hoosier common sense in Washington DC?
Add your name if you support the confirmation of Hoosier Amy Coney Barrett as the next Associate Justice on the United States Supreme Court.

"The Indiana Fraternal Order of Police (FOP) just endorsed Governor Holcomb’s reelection campaign!
Eric Holcomb for Indiana
Friend,
Have you heard the exciting news?
The Indiana Fraternal Order of Police (FOP) just endorsed Governor Holcomb’s reelection campaign! This is the organization’s first endorsement of a Republican in a governor’s race since 2008.
“Over the last four years, our team has had the opportunity to work alongside Governor Holcomb, and we’re gotten to know him as a man of character and friend to our state’s law enforcement professionals. He stands with us as we stand for safe Indiana communities – and we’re proud to endorse him for reelection.” - Bill Owensby, president of the Fraternal Order of Police.
Endorsement Alert
The Indiana FOP represents more than 13,000 law enforcement professionals serving communities across Indiana. The organization’s mission is to protect and serve Indiana law enforcement professionals as they in turn work to serve Hoosiers and keep Indiana communities safe.
Governor Holcomb actively supports Indiana’s brave law enforcement and public safety officers who keep Hoosiers safe throughout the state, having already earned the endorsements of the Indiana State Police Alliance and the Indiana Professional Firefighters PAC.
Join the Indiana FOP in endorsing Governor Holcomb
The Indiana FOP is now the eleventh group to endorse Governor Holcomb for reelection – including the Indiana State Police Alliance and the Indiana Professional Firefighters PAC.
Governor Holcomb is proud to stand by these heroes – and he’ll continue to support them every single day. It’s one of the top priorities of his administration.
“Indiana’s law enforcement officers put their lives on a thin blue line daily, selflessly dropping everything whenever duty calls. They spring into action, putting themselves into harm’s way – and as Hoosiers, we are forever grateful. I’m committed to standing with our law enforcement, now, and always.” - Governor Holcomb.

Eric Holcomb for Indiana
Friend \- this will only take a second.
We’re just following up on our team’s emails from earlier this week.
Indiana is on the comeback trail and we’ll be back to setting records before you know it. But first, we need to win at the ballot box on November 3rd.
Governor Holcomb is counting on Hoosiers to turn out across the state, but we can’t sit on the sidelines and wait for Election Day.
Friend, we’re officially in the final sprint to Election Day and what we do every day between now and November 3rd matters.
That’s why we’re reaching out now and asking you to chip in any amount — every little bit counts — to keep Indiana red and help me continue building One Indiana for All.

One Indiana | Summer
Friend,
The first official day of summer may not be until June 20 – but our state is starting to reopen and Hoosiers are ready to enjoy the outdoors.
With temperatures rising, the sun staying out longer, and the state safely progressing through Eric’s Back on Track Plan, it’s the perfect time to get out and enjoy this beautiful Indiana weather. And while some activities may look different this year, there are still lots of great opportunities to get outside.
Our team pulled together a list of our favorite summer activities, and we hope they inspire you to get outside and enjoy our beautiful state.
One Indiana | Summer
* Grilling out or lighting a bonfire – Food never tastes better than when cooked over an open flame!
* Catching fireflies – Did you know that in 2018, Governor Holcomb signed into law making the Say's Firefly the Indiana state insect? So that means it’s time to get outside and light up your evening!
* Gardening – Do you have a green thumb? Consider growing a peony, the Indiana state flower!
* Home repairs – With this great weather, why not build some equity into your home with a little light construction?
* Exercise! – Feeling stressed or overwhelmed? Exercise! Head outside and find your nearest trail for running, walking or biking!
* Go camping – Indiana campgrounds are now open! Take a home away from home trip and head to your favorite Indiana campground!
* Go for a round of golf – Indiana is fortunate to have been home to one of the most legendary golf course designers in the world, Pete Dye. He designed seven golf courses in Indiana, which comprise the Pete Dye Golf Trail. Check it out!
* Water fun – While some local public pools are closed this year, you can still cool off by turning the sprinklers on, or making a slip-n-slide at home. Or with Holiday World in Southern Indiana opening next week, right now their waterpark – Splashin’ Safari – is scheduled to open in July.
* Go on a road trip – You don’t have to go far to find a new, exciting place! As Indiana continues our phased reopening, find a place here in Indiana you’ve never visited and start planning your destination!
* Visit an Indiana State Park – Indiana State Park Inns are now open, and our state parks are ready to welcome you for a daytrip (or longer)! Have you tried the Three Dunes Challenge at Indiana Dunes?
* Check out a drive-in movie – There’s no better way to be outdoors, practice social distancing, and enjoy time with friends and family than at the drive-in!
There are lots of ways to get outside and enjoy this incredible weather and make the most out of summer. However, remember – let’s be safe, and continue to practice safe social distancing as we go out.
Happy summer!

This is one of the last big fundraising opportunities we have left before Election Day, and we’re reaching out to every member of our grassroots community and asking them to help us capitalize on this opportunity.
We’ve made a lot of progress over the last four years, but here’s the truth — there’s still a lot of work to be done to build One Indiana for All.
If we want to keep building on the best infrastructure in the country, getting our economy back on track, helping Hoosiers skill-up for high-wage careers, and much, much more, we need to go all in until Election Day.
That’s why we’re asking every single one of our supporters to chip in before our End of Quarter deadline hits.

"Indiana unemployment rates have dropped below the national average, while our labor participation rates are moving above the national average!
Eric Holcomb for Indiana
Friends,
First off, thank you for your continuous effort getting Indiana Back on Track. Because of your work, Governor Holcomb had some good news to report this week:
Indiana unemployment rates have dropped below the national average, while our labor participation rates are moving above the national average!
Watch as Governor Holcomb highlights this Hoosier momentum
Watch as Governor Holcomb highlights this Hoosier momentum
Because of COVID-19, Indiana’s unemployment rate is still much higher than it’s been in years, but Hoosier opportunity is still strong! That’s because there are currently 93,000 jobs ready to be filled by Hoosiers across the state – 9,000 of which have been added just in the last six months.
You can find and apply for those jobs here!
Indiana’s housing market is also booming. Home sales are currently on pace to beat last year’s sales. And single-family home building permits are stronger so far in 2020 than they were through this point of 2019 – even in the midst of a pandemic.
And the good news does not stop yet! Hoosier-made RVs and boats are selling through the roof, while Indiana’s auto dealers are clamoring for more inventory! The country wants to buy what Indiana is building!
Governor Holcomb said it best, “The numbers are trending in the right direction, and it’s because of a team effort – and that’s all Hoosiers.”
So Hoosiers, thank you again for your continued effort and thank you in advance for helping Indiana get Back on Track – and stay Back on Track!

"Fall is in the air, and it’s a perfect time to explore Indiana’s great outdoors.

Friend \- can you feel it?
Fall is in the air, and it’s a perfect time to explore Indiana’s great outdoors.
Eric, Janet and Henry love taking advantage of Indiana’s natural beauty and have spent a lot of time taking in the majestic views that our state has to offer. We hope that you get lots of time to explore the great outdoors this fall, and we put together a list of Indiana’s best views to help guide your fall activities!
Check out our list below — we hope it inspires you to go on some road trips and adventures this fall!
One Indiana
* Overlook Restaurant, Leavenworth \- Want to enjoy a burger and a beer while looking at a gorgeous view of the Ohio River? Say no more — the Overlook Restaurant is for you. Be sure to stop by if you’re passing through Leavenworth!
* The Point, Hanover College \- Hanover is one of the most beautiful schools in the entire country, and The Point is one of the biggest reasons why. Stop by, tour the historic college, and be sure to snap a picture with the Ohio River in the background!
* West Baden Springs \- Beautiful hot springs and the West Baden Springs Hotel aren’t the only reason to stop by — it’s also the birthplace of Hoosier legend Larry Bird! Book a getaway and take a step back in time.
* Touchdown Jesus \- Facing Notre Dame’s football stadium, the facade of the Theodore Hesburgh Library is certainly a sight to behold in South Bend. It’s become a familiar sight on fall Saturdays for anyone tuning into a Notre Dame game!
* Brown County State Park \- An Indiana natural treasure, it’s one of our most beautiful state parks. Be sure to climb the 90’ Fire Tower and get an amazing view of the hills o’ Brown!
* Turn 4 in the Grandstand at the Indy 500 \- The smell of gasoline, the thrill of victory, the agony of [[URL REDACTED]] can’t beat Turn 4 at Indianapolis Motor Speedway. We weren’t able to pack the grandstand this year, but we’ll be back before we know it.
* Indiana Dunes National & State Parks \- You can’t beat the shoreline of Lake Michigan. Take a stroll through some of the 50 miles of trails and check out some of Indiana’s most beautiful and unique natural resources.

"Now that our restaurants are reopening, let’s support them in a safe and healthy way.
One Indiana: Fried Chicken
Friend,
Indiana is getting back on track, and businesses are reopening -- including restaurants across the state!
The COVID-19 pandemic has hit our restaurant industry especially hard. Now that our restaurants are reopening, we’re all excited to get out and support them in a safe and healthy way.
For this week’s One Indiana email, we thought we’d continue sharing some of Eric's favorite places to eat across the state. Last week we pulled together a list his favorite ice cream shops, and now here's a few of his favorite fried chicken places (no matter your preferred piece, these are all Indiana classics).
Remember - as you start to patronize your favorite restaurants and local businesses, be sure to check the Indiana State Department of Health website. Local leaders and the businesses in your community might have additional requirements, too, so be sure to check with them, and please follow all guidelines.
Check it out -- but another warning like last week, you may get hungry!
One Indiana: Fried Chicken
* Brau Haus, Oldenburg \- The Brau Haus is home to delicious chicken and a unique past. Check out their unique history and learn a thing or two about Oldenburg.
* MCL Restaurant and Bakery, Multiple Locations Statewide \- Owned and operated since 1950 by The McGaughey Family, this is the home of the original American comfort food!
* Putnam Inn, Greencastle \- Their slogan says it all — stop by and have a “meal you will never forget!”
* Gasthof, Montgomery \- They call the Gasthof Amish Village an ""oasis in the farmland"" of Southern Indiana. Don’t forget to try something from their famous bakery.
* The Beef House, Covington \- Family owned & operated since 1964, four generations of the Wright family continue to make the Beef House a special place today
* Kramer's, Columbus \- One of our crew’s favorite haunts, Kramer’s also makes amazing breakfast food! Stop by when you’re in Columbus.
* McKinley Orchards, Oaktown \- They’ve been feeding Hoosiers in a beautiful location since 1976!
* Abe Martin Lodge restaurant, Nashville \- A little gem of a restaurant at Brown County State Park, serving fresh home-style meals and Indiana favorites!
* The Chicken Place, Ireland \- The Leinenbach family has been serving up their great-grandmother’s chicken recipe in Ireland since 1948 — make sure to check it out!
* Teibel's Family Restaurant, Schererville \- The Region favorite is now led by its fourth generation. Stop in for many of the same favorites you'd have found there when they first opened their doors more than 90 years ago (like their homemade fried chicken).
* Kountry Kitchen, Indianapolis \- This family-owned restaurant is a piece of Indy history. It sadly suffered a fire in January, but the owners have plans to rebuild and bring this favorite back to life!
* The Blue Gate Restaurant & Bakery, Shipshewana \- The Blue Gate's got it all — great Amish and Mennonite cooking, entertainment, shopping, a hotel and more.
* Das Dutchman Essenhaus, Middlebury \- The Essenhaus is a destination in Northern Indiana, and you definitely won't leave hungry. After you've had your chicken, stop by the bakery.
* Hollyhock Hill, Indianapolis \- There's a reason why they've been ranked among the best fried chicken in America. They've been serving their homestyle favorites since 1928!
Thanks for reading our list! No matter whether you’re dining in or ordering take-out, let’s support our Hoosier small businesses.

Eric Holcomb for Indiana
friend,
Like the lives of folks across our state, earlier this year our campaign was put on hold.
Governor Holcomb put 100% of his energy behind fighting COVID-19. And -- like Hoosiers -- we stood behind him.
As your Holcomb Crew, we’ve been spending our time helping spread accurate and reliable information, listening to Hoosiers' concerns over the phone or online, and helping Governor Holcomb keep Hoosiers safe and healthy in any way that we can.
But Election Day 2020 is coming no matter what and like the rest of the state, we need to get back to work (safely!). If anything, the last couple of months have taught us how important it is to have a leader who is dedicated to building One Indiana.
They’ve also taught us that Indiana needs a leader who knows how to bring high-wage, high-demand jobs to Indiana and who has done it before. That we need a leader who knows how to bring Hoosiers together. That we need a steady and experienced leader that we can trust.
That we need another four years of Governor Holcomb.
Our 2020 campaign will most likely look a little bit different. While Governor Holcomb and Hoosiers across the state are getting Indiana back on track, there are still many unknowns.
But we do know that we’ll need your help more than ever. That’s why we’re reaching out today. Our end of quarter deadline is coming up later this month, and we need to pick up right where left off.
friend, will you chip in any amount using the button below and invest in One Indiana for another four years?

We know that times are tough for a lot of Hoosiers because of COVID-19, and we don’t want you to give unless you have the means.

Eric Holcomb for Indiana
We won, friend. It’s official.
I couldn’t be more grateful that our neighbors, families, friends, and Hoosiers from all across Indiana put their trust in us to lead our great state for another four years.
Over the last few years, together we achieved a lot — record-high wages, a record-low infant mortality rate, providing tens of thousands of Hoosiers with the skills they need to compete in a 21st-century economy, and much, much more.
And friend, we’re just getting started.
There’s no beating around the bush — COVID-19 is an unprecedented challenge that slowed us down. But Hoosiers are the most resilient people in the world. We’re getting back on track, and our victory today is the first step toward getting our state back to setting records.
As we know, Building One Indiana for All isn’t easy, but few things that are worth doing are. It’s going to take a lot of hard work, dedication, grit, and commitment from Hoosiers like you.
I couldn’t be more grateful for your support during this campaign, and winning today is an amazing accomplishment. We should be proud of our work, and I think that tonight calls for a little bit of celebration.
But tomorrow, it’s time to get back to building One Indiana for All.

"Hoosiers are resilient. They are strong. And they NEVER back down from a challenge.
Eric Holcomb for Indiana
Friend,
The last couple of months have been tough.
But Hoosiers are resilient. They are strong. And they NEVER back down from a challenge.
Before COVID-19, Indiana was setting records.
We were creating jobs at an unprecedented pace, raising Hoosier wages higher than ever before, and investing in our infrastructure -- and more importantly, our people. And we did this all while balancing our budget, keeping taxes low, and building one of the best environments for job creators in all of America.
Join Indiana’s Economic Comeback
When COVID-19 hit Indiana, we had to slow down — nothing is more important than the safety of our families, friends, and neighbors.
The fight against COVID-19 isn’t over, but we can see the light at the end of the tunnel in Indiana. Friend, we’re poised to start setting records again.
As Eric put it last month, the best is yet to come for Indiana.
And we need the support of Hoosiers from all walks of life and from every corner of Indiana.
Will you help lead our economic comeback? If so, add your name using the button below.

"we’re moving into Stage 4 of Governor Holcomb’s Back on Track Plan two days early!
Eric Holcomb for Indiana
Friends,
Big news! Governor Holcomb just announced that because of Hoosiers’ continued good work social distancing and practicing good hygiene – we’re moving into Stage 4 of Governor Holcomb’s Back on Track Plan two days early!
Stage 4 of this phased reopening officially begins on Friday, June 12 at 12:01 a.m.!
And what does this mean for Hoosiers?
* Social gatherings can include up to 250 Hoosiers
* Restaurants can operate at 75% capacity (with social distancing)
* Bars, nightclubs, movie theaters, bowling alleys, amusement parks, water parks, and entertainment and tourism sites can open at 50% capacity
* Retail stores and malls can operate at full capacity
* Community recreational games, leagues and tournaments may resume
* Racing venues may open at 50% capacity
* Charity gaming and casinos may open on June 15
* Playgrounds may reopen
* State government buildings are open by appointment
Why is this possible?
We’re seeing a statewide decline in the Hoosiers hospitalized with COVID-19, we’re seeing ICU and ventilator capacity remain strong, we’ve got more than 200 testing sites available statewide, and we can effectively contact trace COVID-19 cases to contain the spread.
Now – in order to keep Indiana on track to reach Stage 5 in July, we’re going to need you to continue your great work as we go into Stage 4. That means continuing to social distance and wearing a facemask when you go out, and it means frequently washing your hands and using hand sanitizer.
Yesterday, Governor Holcomb made it clear that this major benchmark is a credit to you – ranging from our healthcare heroes to our everyday Hoosiers doing the right thing to protect our most vulnerable friends, family and neighbors.
Now let’s keep it up as we launch Phase 4 on Friday!

"If you’d take a second to help us share this exciting news
Eric Holcomb for Indiana
79% Approval!
Friends,
BIG news today! Last week, we did a poll asking Hoosiers their thoughts on a few issues – and the results came back to show that Hoosiers approve of Governor Holcomb’s job serving us all by historic margins.
The poll showed that:
* 79% approve of Governor Holcomb’s overall job performance
* 83% approve of his leadership so far during the COVID-19 pandemic
But it didn’t stop there. A head-to-head match-up against the presumptive Democrat nominee in November also favors Governor Holcomb in a landslide, with 64% saying they’d vote for Governor Holcomb compared to 21% supporting the Democrat.
You can read more about the poll here.
There’s no doubt – Governor Holcomb has created a special connection with Hoosiers during this crisis like we’ve never seen between an elected official and a constituency. That’s because Governor Holcomb knows that when you have the right policies, the politics will take care of themselves. These poll numbers show that to be the case.
Governor Holcomb’s steady, data-driven and compassionate leadership has resonated with Hoosiers, and it will keep making an impact as he continues to lead our state through this pandemic.
If you’d take a second to help us share this exciting news – I know together we’ll be poised to help Governor Holcomb lead for another four years:

"Hoosier farmers are the backbone of our state, and this week’s One Indiana is all about celebrating the incredible products coming out of Indiana’s...
One Indiana
Friends,
Agriculture is Indiana’s calling card, and has been for over 200 years. As we celebrate fall harvest, this week’s One Indiana is all about celebrating the incredible products coming out of Indiana’s farms.
Farmers contribute an estimated $31.2 billion to Indiana’s economy!
We’re the 10th largest farming state in the entire country, and the 8th largest agricultural exporter — exporting over $4.6 billion worth of ag products --and growing! (pun intended)
There are 94,000 farmers in Indiana, and 96% of the farms in our state are family-owned or operated. Hoosier farmers get up early and work hard to make sure that Americans have access to the incredible bounty coming out of Indiana and they deserve to be recognized for their efforts.
Check out just some of the areas our agriculture industry is leading the way below!
One Indiana
* Corn \- Hoosier farmers sold $3.28 billion worth of corn in 2017, making it the number one commodity by sales value in our state! We’re also #2 in the entire country in popcorn production, so next time you settle down for a movie with a bowl of popcorn you can thank our Hoosier farmers!
* Duck \- Man, it feels good to be #1. Hoosier farmers lead the entire country in duck production and make many fine-dining classics like duck a l’orange, duck confit, and Peking duck possible.
* Soybeans \- The second largest commodity by sales value, soybeans are a crucial part of Indiana’s economy and Hoosier farmers sold $3.08 billion worth of soybeans in 2017.
* Spearmint and peppermint \- What’s that fresh smell? It’s all of that spearmint and peppermint being produced by Hoosier farmers. We’re the #3 spearmint producer and the #4 peppermint producer in the entire country!
* Pork \- Hoosiers love their pork tenderloins, so it’s no surprise we’re top 5 in hog production. There are currently more than 4.2 million hogs in Indiana - man, that’s a lot of pork!
* Melons \- Another commodity, another top 5 finish for Hoosier farmers. We produce the fifth most watermelons in the country — an American summer classic!
* Dairy \- The #5 agricultural commodity in Indiana, Hoosier farmers produce $750 million worth of dairy products a year from 187,000 cows. Have a sweet tooth? Our farmers have you covered — we’re the #2 ice cream producer in the entire country!
* Poultry and eggs \- Another top #5 Hoosier commodity, there are more than 20.5 million turkeys alone in Indiana and our farmers sell more than $1.18 billion worth of poultry and eggs a year!

Eric Holcomb for Indiana
Friend,
Shhhhh….can you hear that?
It’s the sound of engines roaring.
That’s right, the Indy 500 is back!
On Sunday, drivers will return to Indianapolis Motor Speedway to compete in “The Greatest Spectacle in Racing.” It’s going to be a little different this year — there won’t be 300,000 screaming fans at the Brickyard and joining together to sing Back Home in Indiana. And, of course, the race is running a little bit later in the year.
But that doesn’t mean it’s going to be any less exciting to watch 33 of the world’s best drivers compete for the chance to sip from the traditional bottle of milk on victory lane.
Governor Holcomb will watch the race from home this Sunday. With no local blackout this year, let’s set a new record. Since we can’t pack the Speedway, let’s join Eric and set a ratings record for the 500!
Our crew cannot wait to watch on Sunday, but we want to know — are you planning on watching the Indy 500? Let us know.
Yes, I’m excited and planning on watching the Indy 500
Thanks,

"Together, we can all do our part to keep our fellow Hoosiers healthy and keep our state open!
Eric Holcomb for Indiana
Friends,
As Indiana’s COVID-19 rates rise (positivity rates, hospitalizations, etc.), Hoosier leaders across our state are standing in support of Governor Holcomb’s statewide mask mandate.
Together, we’re all working hard to get Indiana back on track – and we want to keep it that way. By socially distancing, washing our hands, and wearing our masks when we go out, we can do what it takes to keep our state open!
“Governor, I want everyone in this state to know the President and I and our entire team fully support your leadership and the steps you’ve taken in Indiana to keep this state on the right track.” – Vice President Mike Pence
“We are very pleased to see that the executive order he signed today does not include a criminal penalty for non-compliance, and we will continue to provide input in our role as part of the legislative branch of state government."" – Senate President Pro Tem Rod Bray
“Wearing face coverings inside public spaces or outside where social distancing is not possible protects yourself and those around you. With the importance of a safe return to school and to avoid moving ‘backwards’ in our efforts to get through this, I ask that we all comply with the Governors mandate” – Warsaw Mayor and AIM President Joe Thallemer
“Tough decisions are part of good leadership. I appreciate Gov. Holcomb taking the lead on mask mandates so that we can keep our businesses open, allow schools to open safely, and get Indiana Back on Track.” – Wabash Mayor Scott Long
“Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, Governor Eric Holcomb has led Indiana through this challenging time with a clear vision and a path to bring our state “Back on Track.” Despite our efforts, the Governor today found it in our best interests to mandate the wearing of masks. As the number of positive tests in our state, and more urgently to me, in our county, continue to rise, I support the Governor in taking this step and am urging residents of Huntingburg, Dubois County and Indiana to comply with the Governor’s order to “Hunker Down” and allow our schools to reopen and our businesses to continue to rebound from the effects of the pandemic.” – Huntingburg Mayor Denny Spinner
""We all recognize that difficult decisions are part of good leadership. As the Mayor of the City of Huntington, I support Gov. Holcomb’s difficult decision to implement a statewide mask-wearing mandate to fight the spread of COVID-19. While Huntington has been fortunate to avoid the higher COVID-19 infection rates other communities have experienced, I recognize that we could easily suffer the same fate.” – Huntington Mayor Richard Strick
“Governor Holcomb today announced a Mask Mandate for all Hoosiers beginning Monday, 7/27/2020, to address the escalating risks of COVID-19 across the State. I support the Governor’s action as it is the step that was under consideration here in Dubois County. Our county currently has the highest rate of COVID-19 per capita across the entire state. Memorial Hospital and Healthcare Center and Dubois County Health Department have expressed the need to support mandatory masks due to recent trends in metrics. Today, we also recorded two additional deaths attributed to COVID-19. By following the Governor’s Executive Order, we can minimize risks in the future. Citizens of Jasper and Dubois County must be part of the solution as we wish to avoid another “stay-at-home” order or the ultimate consequence, loss of loved ones.” – Jasper Mayor Dean Vonderheide
“The Martin Administration stands in support of Governor Eric Holcomb's recent mask mandate. As leaders, we sometimes have to do what is unpopular in the name of public safety and for the greater good. I still believe we can get through these uncertain times if we all do our part and strive to work together, rather than against each other. #INThisTogether” – Logansport Mayor Chris Martin
“Indiana is where I met my wife, my 3 kids were born, and I became a doggy daddy. I’ve always supported governors doing what they can and what they feel is appropriate to promote health in their state. Kudos to Indiana for promoting - it will help schools safely reopen! I also appreciate the statement on enforcement- ‘The state will approach enforcement of the face covering requirement with an emphasis on education.’ If local authorities help people understand why they should do something and how they benefit, they are more likely to comply.” – U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams
""Our economy will not be on the full road to recovery until some certainty is brought to this uncontrolled pandemic. The wearing of masks is a proven strategy for enhancing our health – both physical & economic.” – Kevin Brinegar, Indiana Chamber of Commerce President & CEO
“Governor Holcomb is doing the right thing and we applaud his continued leadership. Now, it is up to each one of us to do our part to keep Indiana on track by masking up. Our efforts will determine whether students can successfully return to school, small business owners can restart, and that our family and neighbors can stay healthy.” – Rob McLin, Indiana Hospital Association Board President & President/CEO of Good Samaritan Hospital
“Front-line workers in Indiana's hospitals have put their lives at risk each and every day to care for patients and contain the spread of the virus. They will continue these efforts throughout the pandemic and beyond. In return, the least we can do is wear a mask, wash our hands, and social distance.” – Brian Tabor, Indiana Hospital Association President
“The Indiana State Medical Association applauds Gov. Holcomb’s courageous leadership to require face masks for all Hoosiers throughout the state. This mandate is a necessary step to reverse the rising trend of COVID-19 and protect Indiana’s health care system from further strain. Face masks are a proven and effective tool to prevent transmission of the coronavirus and will allow Hoosiers to more safely visit their doctors for the preventive and ongoing care needed to stay healthy.” – Dr. Lisa Hatcher, President of the Indiana State Medical Association
""We appreciate Gov. Eric Holcomb's action and other efforts to keep people safe and to help reduce the impact of COVID-19 in Indiana. The science is clear that masks reduce the spread of COVID-19, and that’s why we require masks at our facilities around the world. We support all global efforts to increase safety as we continue to combat the virus.” – Tom Linebarger, Chairman and CEO, Cummins
You can read the entire mask order here. Together, we can all do our part to keep our fellow Hoosiers healthy and keep our state open!

We’ve got great news.
You’re invited to the 2020 Indiana Republican State Convention!
Like a lot of events, the convention is going to be a little bit different this year.
We wish we could all gather in-person to hear from Governor Holcomb and Lt. Governor Crouch, but the COVID-19 pandemic has forced the convention to be entirely virtual.
But don’t worry — you can still join us via livestream or local TV and hear Eric’s keynote address!
Get the details on the 2020 convention
He’s going to lay out his vision for the next four years and present his plan on how we will continue to get back on track, restore our economy, and build One Indiana — together.
You can find all the most important details below:
* When: June 18, 5:30 - 7:00 PM EST
* How you can watch it live: You can find the convention live on WISH-TV or any of its statewide broadcast partners. It will also be live-streamed at this link.
* Who’s speaking: Governor Eric Holcomb, Lieutenant Governor Suzanne Crouch, and the candidates for attorney general
We hope that you join our crew and watch Governor Holcomb lay out his vision — we know that he wants as many Hoosiers to hear what he has to say as possible, and it would mean a lot to him if you watched his speech.

Alex,
As you’ve probably guessed from our previous emails, we’re working hard to keep Indiana’s 5th Congressional District from falling into the Democrats’ hands.
It’s considered one of the KEY battleground races in 2020, and if we have any hope of flipping the House, we can’t lose this seat.
We’re pushing to raise funds specifically to fight Nancy Pelosi’s liberal machine from stealing this election.
Will you chip in to help us keep this seat RED?
Liberals know how important this seat is, and they’re pouring in out-of-state resources to try and steal it. We cannot let that happen!
Once the primary is over and we have a Republican nominee, it’s critical that we have these funds ready to support him or her from Day One.
We’ve been through enough in the past two months to know how important it is to elect a new conservative majority in Washington. Speaker Pelosi is drunk on her own power, and she’s not going to stop until we flip the House and make her stand down.

Making History
Last night, we made history, with thousands of Hoosiers tuning in for our 2020 Indiana Republican State Convention.
While we all would have preferred to be together in person, I’m so excited that we had this opportunity to share our Republican message on this wide stage to so many of our fellow Hoosiers.
When I took the stage at our 2018 state convention, I made a commitment to grow this party and ensure that we reflect the tremendous diversity found in Indiana. I issued a call to action for everyone in our grassroots team to get involved in this mission. And last night, I gave an update on our progress.
I’m excited to share that we’re developing a statewide diversity series through the Indiana Republican Party to help identify, educate, train and invest in diverse Hoosiers who believe in the principles of the Republican Party. And we've got the perfect person on our team leading the charge. Whitley Yates, who joined our Indiana GOP team last December, is absolutely on fire, as you probably saw last night.
With her help, Indiana Republicans are currently building relationships in places our party has not been before. We’ll be announcing more details soon about our diversity series, so stay tuned.
Together, as Republicans we made history last night, we’re making history daily with our actions, and I know we’re ready to make more history together this November.

Governor Holcomb's Week That Was
One Indiana For All
Last night, Governor Holcomb delivered the keynote address at our 2020 Indiana State Convention. Thanks to the hard work and determination of Hoosiers, we have Indiana in a position to come out of these difficult times faster and stronger than many of our neighbors.
""For us to be firing on all [[URL REDACTED]] must cultivate this new economic and societal terrain to become One Indiana that provides opportunities for all."" - Gov. Holcomb
Building One Indiana For All means:
* Getting Hoosiers back to work and connecting more Hoosiers with higher-wage jobs.
* Attracting more business leaders, job creators and entrepreneurs to Indiana.
* Working together to overcome racial inequality.
* Taking a long look at some of the restrictions and regulations we set aside during the pandemic to see which ones can go away permanently.
* Continuing to modernize your state government, making sure it is running efficiently for the taxpayers.
* Finishing I-69.
* Taking on long-lingering health issues.
* Hitting our goal of being the best state in the Midwest for infant mortality by 2024.
* Focusing on mental, physical and fiscal health.
""One Indiana For All... strengthened by our regions, our diversity, our communities, our history and most importantly, our people."" - Gov. Holcomb
Through all the challenges this year have brought us, one thing has remained true. The Hoosier spirit has remained strong and resilient. It's going to take all of us working together to truly create One Indiana that provides opportunities for all!
To watch Governor Holcomb's full speech, click here.
Celebrating Juneteenth
Today we celebrate Juneteenth – the day when slavery finally came to an end in America, following President Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation almost two and a half years earlier.
Join us as we celebrate freedom and the fall of slavery in the United States, and we reflect on the importance of this day. As Governor Holcomb has said, “We don't have more time or lives to lose.”

Coalitions of Support
One of the most gratifying aspects of my role is to help build coalitions across the state for the party and for Governor Holcomb. This year has been a whirlwind as I have met with so many wonderful Hoosiers and groups that are making a difference in our state.
That's included our business leaders with groups like the Indiana Chamber of Commerce, the National Federation of Independent Businesses, and the Associated Builders and Contractors of Indiana/Kentucky, who have worked hard to keep our economy growing through this pandemic.
It's included our police and firefighters. I'm so honored that as they go out and stand for us daily, several of their top associations -- including the Professional Firefighters Union of Indiana, the Indiana State Police Alliance, and the Fraternal Order of Police -- have chosen to stand with Governor Holcomb in support of his reelection.
It's included those who stand for our 2nd Amendment rights, such as the NRA.
And it's included the strongest defenders of life in this state, the Indiana Right to Life.
I thank all of them for their time and efforts. Just today, we witnessed a great example of that coalition building when Indiana Right to Life submitted an op-ed supporting Governor Holcomb's fight for life. You can read it here.
This is among dozens and dozens of other examples that show the depth and breadth of the support for the Republican Party and our candidates from President Trump and Vice President Pence, Governor Holcomb and Lt. Governor Crouch, Todd Rokita, our congressional and statehouse candidates and local candidates across the state.
-Chairman Kyle Hupfer

Governor Holcomb's Week That Was
More Hoosier Jobs Are On The Way!
It's been another busy week for Governor Holcomb! As he continues building One Indiana for All, he is working hard to create more opportunities for Hoosiers.
On Thursday, Governor Holcomb joined local officials and executives of POET, the world's largest biofuels producer, to break ground on an expansion to the company’s bioprocessing facility in Alexandria.
Thanks to our state's business-friendly environment, POET is investing $25 million into its Indiana operations and is planning to scale-up production of purified alcohol, a key component of hand sanitizer. To make this announcement even better, POET purchases more than 100 million bushels of Indiana-produced corn annually. This supports Hoosier farmers and the state’s agricultural economy. And with this expansion, that number is growing.
This week, Governor Holcomb also announced that the U.S. Department of Defense will establish its Joint Hypersonics Transition Office (JHTO) Systems Engineering Field Activity in Indiana, accelerating research and development (R&D) and testing in hypersonic technologies at Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) Crane Division.
Governor Holcomb has set a goal to triple Indiana’s defense investment by 2024, and this huge announcement is bringing us another step closer to that goal. The new facility will allow the Department of Defense to develop and improve technologies and capabilities in hypersonics by utilizing NSWC Crane's strategic assets and growing network of government, industry and academic partners.
""Today's announcement is another signal to the world that Indiana is poised to be a leader in hypersonics, with strategic assets such as NSWC Crane and our world-class research institutions fueling growth and advancements in the field. We're excited the Department of Defense has chosen Indiana to establish its JHTO Systems Engineering Field Activity, and grateful to our state's leaders in Washington D.C. and here at home for their commitment to increasing defense investment and opportunities in Indiana."" -Governor Holcomb

Judge Barrett Proves Qualifications & Wisdom
at Confirmation Hearings
The Supreme Court confirmation hearings have finished, and Judge Amy Coney Barrett proved to all Americans that she's more than qualified to join the high court!
Democrats spent their time during the confirmation hearings asking questions trying to trip her up -- but they struck out every time. Her answers were quick, concise, and to the point. At one point during the hearing, she was even asked to show what notes she had written down on her note pad. In response, she flipped it around, showing it was empty (watch that moment here).
Amy Coney Barrett showed time and time again during the hearings that she was not there for games, and is ready to join the U.S. Supreme Court!
Endorsement Alert: Gov. Holcomb and Todd Rokita Endorsed
by Times of Northwest Indiana
We have more big endorsement news! The Times of Northwest Indiana has endorsed both Governor Holcomb for reelection and Todd Rokita for attorney general.

""Incumbent Gov. Eric Holcomb continues to ensure projects and priorities for Northwest Indiana remain at the top of his agenda. Holcomb has demonstrated a keen understanding of how our Region's economic fortunes feed the state as a whole...Holcomb deserves another term to see this and so many other initiatives through.""
Check out what they had to say about Todd Rokita below:
""We endorse Region native and former Republican Congressman Todd Rokita for the office of attorney general.. Rokita would make a worthy watchdog in this role and has shown the type of tough posture to be effective.""
New Ad: Governor Holcomb’s Leadership is Building
One Indiana for All
Governor Holcomb's latest ad, titled “Momentum,” features a Hoosier mother and small business owner from Boone County. She discusses how Governor Holcomb’s leadership has helped build Indiana’s momentum over the last four years – and how his leadership will continue that momentum over the next four years.
That leadership includes:
* New Jobs: Companies have committed to create more than 100,000 new Hoosier jobs since 2017 – with a record high wage of $28.60/hour in 2019.
* Higher Teacher Pay: Last year, the state paid down a teacher pension liability for schools, helping 229 out of 304 school bargaining units statewide (98% of school corporations) report increased teacher compensation.
* Improved Internet Connections: Governor Holcomb has made expanding affordable, high-speed broadband to unserved communities a top priority of his administration. That’s why he’s launched the $100 million Next Level Connections Broadband Grant Program.
* Skilling Up Our Workforce: Governor Holcomb launched Next Level Jobs to offer free training to Hoosiers looking to skill up for a high-wage, high-demand jobs – programs expanded this year to help Hoosiers impacted by the pandemic.

Free & Independent States
It was just 244 years ago this Saturday that the Second Continental Congressed approved the Declaration of Independence, charting the course for the founding, growth and greatness of the United States.
This revolutionary document declared ideas that at the time seemed radical – that “all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.” Today, these ideals are the bedrock of our country.
It avowed our 13 original colonies to be “free and independent states.” And while our nation has grown to 50 states, that emphasis on the importance of our states continues to this day. Over those 244 years, our nation has been through a lot of challenges, and there’s no doubt that COVID-19 has presented a deep challenge to these free and independent states.
Here in Indiana, Governor Holcomb has been leading Indiana skillfully through this crisis – working to get Indiana back on track, while looking at the data and always prioritizing the health and wellbeing of Hoosiers. Our economy is starting to see some positive movement, and he very wisely decided this week to delay a full reopening while we see some COVID-19 indicators rise.
There’s a reason why 83% of Hoosiers say they approve of how Governor Holcomb is guiding us through this pandemic – it’s true leadership at work!
And, of course, there’s no doubt that the states have received excellent support from our full partners in President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence.
Have a wonderful weekend – and happy Independence Day!
\- Chairman Kyle Hupfer
Governor Holcomb's Week That Was
Indiana: Back on Track
Governor Holcomb's top priority is keeping Hoosiers safe and healthy. That's why he is continuing to look at COVID-19 data to help inform his decisions as we continue to get Indiana back on track.
This week he announced that while a few restrictions will lift this weekend to allow for outdoor events – where the risk of COVID-19 transmission is up to 19 times less – the majority of Phase 4 will remain in place through at least July 17. This new phase is set to last from July 4 through July 17. For the full details of Phase 4.5, click here.
Here’s what we can now expect in Indiana for the next few weeks as part of the Back on Track plan:
* Social Gatherings: Following the CDC’s social distancing guidelines, gatherings will be limited to up to 250 people.
* Eating Out: Dining room food service may continue up to 75 percent capacity as long as social distancing is implemented.
* Bars: Bar seating in restaurants may continue operations at 50 percent capacity with social distancing.
* Entertainment: Cultural, entertainment, amusement parks, tourism sites and similar facilities may continue operations open at 50 percent capacity.
As always, state and local communities can impose stricter guidelines – and places like Elkhart County will remain in Stage 4 until at least July 13.
Why the delay? Governor Holcomb has always said this will be a data-driven decision, and here’s where the data currently stands:
* Hospitalizations: Indiana is seeing a slight uptick in our hospitalization rate, from 595 Hoosiers on June 26 to 668 Hoosiers on July 1. While the uptick isn’t as strong as a few other states – it’s still an important change to watch.
* Surge Capacity: Indiana’s hospital surge capacity still remains strong, with 40% of ICU beds available and 83% of ventilators available.
* Testing: We’ve seen increases in Indiana’s testing positivity rates, but the good news is that there are 200 testing sites across the state – so anyone can now get tested (and for free at state-sponsored sites).
* Contact Tracing: Indiana’s contact tracing team is making 2,500 daily calls to people who have tested positive or their close contacts.
If the guiding principles of Governor Holcomb's Back on Track plan look good -- including numbers of hospitalizations, surge capacity, availability of testing and expanded contact tracing -- then we should move to phase 5 by July 18. However, that will require the work of all Hoosiers!
While you’re out this 4th of July weekend, please remember to be safe. Practice social distancing, wear your mask, and let’s look out for our fellow Hoosiers!
To stay up to date on the latest developments, please make you're following Governor Holcomb on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram!

Alex,
We have a battleground race on the ground in the 5th district. The DCCC has targeted it as part of their Red-to-Blue campaign, and Nancy Pelosi is helping the Democrat raise money.
We have a solid conservative candidate running for this open seat, and it’s imperative that we keep it RED this November.
Victoria Spartz needs us to band together as she fights hard to bring home this win for the GOP. If we lose this seat, there is almost no chance that we’ll be able to win our House majority back.
We cannot afford another term with Nancy Pelosi in the Speaker’s Office.
The Democrat base is fired up to win this seat, and they are pouring huge amounts of outside special interest money into electing Christina Hale. She’s running as a “moderate,” but don’t be fooled! She’s exactly the kind of tax-and-spend liberal that Democrats can’t wait to impose on Hoosiers. If elected, she’s a vote in Nancy Pelosi’s pocket.
If you’re able, please rush a donation right now to help Victoria and keep Indiana’s 5th red!
Donate $5 to defeat the Dems!
Donate $10 to defeat the Dems!
Donate $15 to defeat the Dems!
Donate $25 to defeat the Dems!
Donate $50 to defeat the Dems!
Donate $100 to defeat the Dems!
Donate another amount to defeat the Dems!
We have to show up strong in this key battleground race. The future of our country may depend on it.
If we can’t stop the spread of socialism in its tracks before it’s too late, who knows what might happen?

Alex,
My finance team just sent me a report this morning on our end-of-quarter fundraising numbers. And I’ll be honest – to meet our targets between now and Election Day, we’re going to need your help now.
We only have until 11:59 p.m. tonight until this quarter’s fundraising numbers are final. This is the funding that’s critical to getting our Indiana Republican ticket first across the finish line.
Will you rush a $5, $10, $25, or $50 contribution to help us close the gap?
We can’t afford to fall short, Alex. Indiana needs to carry the flag for Republicans across the country. Fellow Hoosier Amy Coney Barrett is poised to become the next Supreme Court justice, and our candidates here are fully supporting her!
But if we lose here, we’ll lose America to the extreme-left Democrats. They’ve already threatened to impeach the President again, abolish the Electoral College or pack the Supreme Court if they return to power!
Will you chip in to help our Indiana Republican ticket win big and keep Indiana RED?
DONATE NOW >>
Please respond today. We have less than 24 hours to go until this all-important end-of-quarter deadline, and we need EVERY supporter on board.
Every dollar counts, and I’m sure that if all of our supporters contributed $5 right now, we will be in a position for victory on November 3rd.

"Indiana leads the nation for increasing the number of children adopted from foster care.  View this email in your browser
Alex,
Indiana’s known for setting records. And today, our pro-life governor and our pro-life federal administration announced perhaps Indiana’s most meaningful record yet:
Indiana is now the top state in the ENTIRE NATION for increasing the number of children adopted from foster care.
In fiscal year 2019, 2,489 Hoosier children were adopted through the Indiana Department of Child Services (DCS).
WATCH & SHARE: Gov. Holcomb Announces Adoption Record
“I make a lot of jobs announcements, and those in many respects pale in comparison to the impact that 2,489 number is having on the families in our state and the true opportunities people will have to realize their God-given talents and their future.”
-Governor Holcomb
Setting a national record like this doesn’t just happen – it takes intentional action, and a commitment from top leaders. Thankfully, Governor Holcomb is leading the charge, as he made increasing adoptions a key priority in his Next Level Agenda. Here’s how:
* Gov. Holcomb created the first adoption unit within DCS. Each region has gained additional staff whose sole focus is to assist family case managers with finding permanent homes for children when parental rights have been terminated.
* DCS has more than doubled the number of adoption consultants in Indiana from seven to 19 and provided specialized training.
* The agency also launched an enhanced database for better tracking of adoption inquiries and a digital picture book of Indiana’s Waiting Children.
* DCS is looking at identifying barriers to adoption and additional strategies to remove them through the Adoption Rapid Permanency Review.
Because of Indiana’s record-breaking year for increasing children adopted from foster care, today the Trump Administration is awarding Indiana $4.7 million to continue to enhance our child welfare system – helping even more Hoosier children in need.
“Every child deserves to have people who will love and support them forever, so we’ve set out to ensure each is a part of a permanent, loving family. With more than a thousand kids in Indiana who are still waiting to be adopted, we appreciate our federal partners’ continued support as we pursue forever homes for each and every one.”
-Governor Holcomb
And, of course, this is in addition to Indiana’s incredible work lowering our infant mortality rate today to its lowest point in six years, having decreased from 7.3 to 6.8 deaths per 1,000 live births. This translates to saving real lives.
Thank you, Governor Holcomb, for your leadership – and for your commitment to Indiana’s kids.
-Indiana Republican Party

ICYMI: Indiana is Open for Business
as the Illinois Exodus Continues
Thanks to strong Republican leadership, Indiana is open for business -- while Democrats in Illinois continue to pursue a path of higher taxes, more regulation and staggering debt.
In case you missed it, check out this column from the Chicago Tribune contrasting Indiana's pro-growth, balanced-budget, low-tax, stable approach with Illinois' Democrat dysfunction:
Read ""Indiana is Open for Business"" Here >>
Excerpts from ""Indiana is Open for Business as the Illinois Exodus Continues""
By John Kass
“Illinois business owners know that even with all these issues, there are some state officials who care about them. Only they’re not from Illinois. They’re from Indiana...
“There is no hope because there is no political will in Illinois to solve its own problems...
“Indiana had Gov. Mitch Daniels who swung his budget ax years ago and straightened his state out. He was followed by Mike Pence, the vice president, and current Gov. Eric Holcomb. And what did these three accomplish?..
“Indiana property taxes are much lower than Illinois. Indiana has little legacy debt. Indiana pays its bills on time: Illinois currently owes more than $6.5 billion in overdue bills. Indiana’s credit rating is Triple-A from the three main rating agencies while Illinois’ credit rating is near junk. In terms of doing business and livability, Indiana ranks at the top of Midwestern states by U.S. News & World Report for long-term stability and affordability.""
“The trial lawyers don’t run Indiana politics.""

Today is the final day before the end-of-quarter reporting deadline at midnight. We’ve been telling you about our 5th District candidate, Victoria Spartz – and I really want to do what we can for her so Republicans can win BIG!
It’s a battleground race, and it could determine control of the House. That’s why the Democrats are already pouring buckets of out-of-state money into the district to try and win it.
Can you chip in what you can now to give Victoria a boost?

With your help, we can have a strong showing, and win this race in November.

Alex,
Democrats are trying to challenge our Republicans supermajority in the Indiana General Assembly, and we must fight back to keep that from happening.
We’ve seen what happens in Democrat-run cities in America — not to mention Congress with Nancy Pelosi in charge — and it is absolute chaos.
And we certainly haven’t forgotten about the days of debt, dysfunction, and walkouts when they were in charge here at home.
We can’t let them take over our state!
Under Republican leadership, together we’ve made Indiana a home to eight straight balanced budgets, a AAA credit rating, and a government that focuses on serving taxpayers efficiently. We absolutely cannot let the liberals take over.
Will you chip in what you can now so that we can help Republican candidates across our great state win BIG in November, and keep the leftists out of the Statehouse?

We can get through this as a state and a country. Indiana is leading the way and is poised to get back on track quicker than many other states because of the groundwork and leadership of Governor Holcomb and the Republicans in the Indiana General Assembly.
However, Democrats are already trying to turn our state blue this November. We need principled leaders who will fight for Hoosiers, not protect their own special interests.
I hope I can count on your support!
Thanks,
Kyle Hupfer

Alex,
Is Democrat Christina Hale California dreamin’?
Hale was first endorsed by San Francisco’s own Nancy Pelosi, and last week, California Senator and (and now Democrat Vice Presidential nominee) Kamala Harris said she was supporting Hale, too.
With all of these California liberals jumping in to support Hale, it makes you wonder if Hale were a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, how would she vote – with Hoosiers, or with left coast socialists like Harris and Pelosi?
* Would she side with Kamala Harris – the first Democrat to announce that she’d co-sponsor Bernie Sanders’ single-payer healthcare bill? Would she work to eliminate private health insurance and institute Medicare for All like Kamala Harris?
* Would Hale applaud efforts to defund our police, like Kamala Harris has done in Los Angeles?
* Or would she side with Nancy Pelosi whenever the vote is close and they need another Democrat to support blocking the progress President Trump and Vice President Pence are leading for America?
We all know the answer to the last question.

This November, the choice couldn’t be clearer when it comes selecting Indiana’s voice in Congress from the 5th District. We must keep this seat in Republican hands, and we do that by electing Victoria Spartz. She’s a businesswoman, a community leader, and she’s got a track record at the Statehouse of fighting to limit regulations, reform health care, and improve our schools.
California and the coastal elites already have enough influence in Washington – let’s not let them gain a congressional district in Indiana, too. They’re endorsing here, and they’re spending their out-of-state campaign dollars here. Would you chip in a today to help us protect Indiana’s voice from California’s influence and money?
Is Hale California dreamin’? If she wins, her dream will quickly become a nightmare for Hoosiers.
Let’s send her a wake-up call.

We don’t think anyone can deny it – 2020 hasn’t been what we expected.
This pandemic has taken its toll on all of us and that’s layered on top of conversations on important topics on race that have the attention of all Hoosiers.
There’s a lot going on right now. With these issues at play, this November’s election is slated to be one of the most important in our nation’s history.
You’ve been identified as one of our top Indiana GOP supporters. As a Hoosier who is actively involved in the political process, we want to get a read on where your thoughts are.

"It was a busy week for your Indiana Republican Party and some of the biggest news came today as we learned our unemployment rate continues to plummet. View this email in your browser
Unemployment Plummets
Exciting news to end a busy week! We learned this morning that Indiana's unemployment rate continues to plummet. Our rate is now 7.8%, 2.4% below the national average. Governor Holcomb is getting Indiana Back on Track and Hoosiers are getting back to work.
Earlier this week, during a statewide address, Governor Holcomb announced initiatives that will enhance equity and inclusion in our state. The governor’s ongoing commitment to these issues shows, once again, that he’s dedicated to building One Indiana for All. You can read more about the speech below.
Our Lt. Governor, Suzanne Crouch, did us proud earlier this week when she won her debate against the Democrat and Libertarian lt. governor candidates. Indiana farmers and rural residents couldn’t have a better champion in their corner than Suzanne. Her knowledge, experience, and passion for these issues were on full display. Congratulations Suzanne!
Less than a week after we welcomed Hobart Mayor Brian Snedecor to our party, Lowell Town Council President, and now former Democrat, Mike Gruszka joined our party as well! He cited the far leftward tilt of today’s Democrats as a reason for his switch. We’re happy to have you join and our welcome mat is always out for more disaffected Democrats!
All these great things were happening while the bedrock of our party, our grassroots supporters, continue to demonstrate why we’re going to win big this November. Hundreds of GOP volunteers canvassed the state, knocking doors for President Trump, Governor Holcomb, Todd Rokita, and all our Republican candidates up and down the ballot. Our energy and enthusiasm can’t be matched!
Thank you for all you do to support this party.

Governor Holcomb's Week That Was
Opportunity For All
Earlier this week, Governor Holcomb delivered a thoughtful, open, and groundbreaking speech on equity and inclusion in Indiana. After months of speaking with Black leaders and stakeholders statewide – including business owners, college presidents, law enforcement, corporate executives, church leaders, and everyday citizens – Governor Holcomb laid out a plan that addresses the root causes of inequity and takes action to promote equality, inclusion, and opportunity for all.
“What I’ve laid out today are the first steps in a broad effort to make sure Indiana is a place where every Hoosier has an equal opportunity to achieve our founders’ vision of ‘Life, Liberty and that pursuit of Happiness.’” – Gov. Holcomb

id:2020-04-23-15:43:59:705t
Alex,
Everything is on the line for the 2020 elections. We’re in an intense battle to keep our Senate majority, win back the House and fire Speaker Pelosi, AND we need to elect as many conservative attorneys general as possible.
The AG race in Indiana is heating up, and we need all Hoosiers to step up to the plate to elect Todd Rokita.
The coastal elites are trying to prop up an ally who will relentlessly go after President Trump and VP Pence. They’re already doing it in liberal states like New York, and we can’t let it happen here in the heartland!
Todd Rokita is proven public servant who has already represented Hoosiers as our Secretary of State and Member of Congress. He’s a constitutional conservative who will protect us from crime, uphold the rule of law, fight lawlessness in our streets, and defend — not de-fund — our men and women in blue.
Will you chip in $5, $10, $25, $50, $100, $250, or what you can to win this race for the GOP?
We can’t let the Democrats win this one. They will never stop their baseless, targeted attacks against the president. Our only hope is to elect principled leaders like Todd Rokita who will have President Trump's back.
DONATE NOW >>
I know that we can show up strong in this battleground race and send a message that the Dems can’t buy Indiana.

Alex,
Can you imagine what will happen if we don’t win in Indiana’s 5th district?
The seat is open this election cycle, and some national pundits are calling it a battleground race.
We have a strong, conservative candidate running, and she needs our help! Will you chip in what you can now to ensure victory for Victoria Spartz?
Donate for victory for Victoria! >>
In today’s world of uncertainty, we need a Republican Congress who will work with President Trump to get our economy rolling full-speed-ahead again.
The Democrats are determined to defund the police, confiscate guns, provide abortion on demand, and more! It sounds crazy, but the liberals have gone so far to the left that their vision for America isn’t even recognizable.
We have to get Nancy Pelosi out of the Speaker’s Office and it starts with winning in the 5th District.
Donate for victory for Victoria! >>
It’s going to be a disaster if Speaker Pelosi is in charge for another term, especially at a time like this.
We’re building a special list of Hoosier supporters who step up and help us in the 5th District in 2020. This could be a turning point, and we want you to have a chance to be remembered on our donor wall.
Winning this seat is going to go a long way toward winning back our majority in the U.S. House and firing Speaker Pelosi. Can we count on you to chip in?
Donate $5 NOW & add your name to the wall! >>
Donate $10 NOW & add your name to the wall! >>

Donate $50 NOW & add your name to the wall! >>
Donate $100 NOW & add your name to the wall! >>
Donate $250 NOW & add your name to the wall! >>
Donate another amount NOW & add your name to the wall! >>
We can win this for Victoria, the GOP, and the future of America. But everyone is going to have to step up and band together.
Thanks for your support,
Indiana GOP

Alex,
We have a lot riding on the 2020 elections.
The Democrats have truly gone too far this time, and the only way to stop them is to take back the House. That’s why it’s crucial that we win this battleground race in Indiana’s 5th Congressional District.
Chairman Hupfer is building a special donor list for supporters who are helping us win this district. Will you chip in now and add your name?

Donate what you can to WIN Indiana’s 5th! >>
We simply can’t afford another term with Nancy Pelosi in the Speaker’s Office. The Democrats know that Hoosiers are tired of politics as usual and the coastal elites trying to drag us towards socialism.
They’re going to do everything in their power to prop up my radical opponent, but we can fight back.
Donate NOW to fight back! >>
Every dollar donated helps us reach Republican voters in my district and get them to the polls. I’m working my tail off on the campaign trail, but I can’t do it alone. I need your help.
Are you in?
Thanks,
Victoria Spartz

Indiana Republicans,
First, I would like to say congratulations to all Hoosier Republicans elected on Tuesday to serve as delegates at our virtual 2020 Indiana Republican State Convention. Due to continuing impacts of COVID-19, our 2020 Indiana Republican State Convention will look a little different this year – but will still ensure our delegates select our nominees for lieutenant governor and attorney general.
With our virtual convention on June 18 approaching quickly, we wanted to make sure that you had all the information about convention -- including how voting will work.
That's why we've put together this video taking you through the process step by step, and answering a few frequently asked questions. I'd really encourage you to take a few minutes to watch this video, and share it with anyone who will also be a delegate this year.
And then for more information -- including upcoming deadlines, a link for paying delegate fees, and more FAQs -- you can also visit our updated convention website here. For Hoosiers serving as delegates, make sure you pay your $50 delegate fee by June 9.
Your Indiana Republican State Committee is committed to protecting our delegates’ rights to select our party nominees for lieutenant governor and attorney general. Through it all, delegates’ voices and votes are fundamental.
Thank you,
Chairman Kyle Hupfer

Alex,
It is more important than ever that Hoosiers band together to support a solid, principled candidate to be Indiana’s next attorney general.
You’ve know what’s at stake. Liberal AGs across the nation are ignoring the rule of law. They’re trying to defund the police, not defend the police like they deserve.
We cannot let that happen in Indiana.
Todd Rokita has a proven record of Conservatism as our former secretary of state and a member of Congress. He will fight for Hoosiers’ God-given, Constitutionally-protected rights, and defend the President’s America First agenda.
All citizens have a right to protest and express their freedom of speech, but the violence we’re seen across the nation must end. Todd won't ask our law enforcement to turn the other way when it comes to defending our citizens, and he will work hard to protect every Hoosier.
Will you please help us support Todd Rokita for Attorney General and protect the rule of law in Indiana?
<< Donate $10 NOW! >>

Hitting the Target
Leading is about delivering results for the people you serve – and there’s no doubt that Governor Holcomb has a track record of results. You could even say he’s hitting the target for Hoosiers.
Take two big news items this week as examples.
Yesterday, the Trump Administration recognized Indiana as the top state in the entire nation for increasing the number of children adopted from foster care. Indiana Department of Child Services facilitated 2,489 adoptions in fiscal year 2019 alone -- check out more information on that below.
And then some big news today. The National Rifle Association – our nation’s longest-standing civil rights organization – today endorsed Governor Holcomb for a second term, awarding him and Lt. Governor Suzanne Crouch with an “A” grade for their commitment to protecting our Second Amendment rights.
I’m a lifetime member of the NRA – and I'll tell you that you won’t find bigger supporters of our freedom, liberty and the importance of bearing arms than Governor Holcomb and First Lady Janet Holcomb.
Last year, Governor Holcomb proudly signed into law legislation that eliminates state fees on a five-year license to carry a handgun – protecting a fundamental right for Hoosiers. This same legislation allows Hoosier gun owners to register to vote when they apply for a license to carry a handgun and provides greater protection to gun owners when exercising the right to self-defense.
And you all might remember that First Lady Janet Holcomb, as a certified NRA firearms instructor, has been teaching Hoosiers how to safely exercise their Second Amendment rights for years.
Governor Holcomb is a pragmatic leader who isn’t afraid of tackling our state’s biggest issues. He goes in with a team effort, and like we’ve seen this week – he hits the target.
-Chairman Kyle Hupfer
Governor Holcomb's Week That Was
Building One Indiana For All
It’s been another big week for Governor Holcomb, with several huge announcements!
This week Governor Holcomb announced that Indiana is now the top state in the nation for increasing the number of children adopted from foster care – with 2,489 Hoosier kids adopted in 2019.
Governor Holcomb made increasing adoptions a priority of his Next Level Agenda and thanks to his pro-life leadership, Indiana is now the number one state in the nation for increasing the number of children adopted from foster care! As part of this record breaking year of adoptions, the Trump Administration has awarded more than $4.7 million to be used to help even more kids find their forever homes.
“Every child deserves to have people who will love and support them forever, so we’ve set out to ensure each is a part of a permanent, loving family."" - Governor Holcomb
Governor Holcomb also announced that the popular local road funding program Community Crossings is back! This program helps local communities repair, maintain and improve their roads and bridges – making sure Hoosiers’ first and last miles of their days are durable and safe. As the Crossroads of America, Governor Holcomb is committed to keeping us in the pole position when it comes to infrastructure. For more information about Community Crossings, click here.
To stay up to date on the latest developments, please make sure you're following Governor Holcomb on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram!
Indiana State Association of Health Underwriters Endorses Governor Holcomb
Governor Holcomb has officially been endorsed by the Indiana State Association of Health Underwriters (ISAHU) and ISAHU-PAC. The worldwide pandemic has brought to light the importance of accessible healthcare, and Governor Holcomb has been at the forefront of this charge for Indiana and has shown his commitment to these values throughout his first term.
ISAHU President Jennifer Mitchen said, “ISAHU is looking forward to seeing what Governor Holcomb will accomplish over the next four years, and is excited for the potential to continue working with him to improve the landscape of the health industry in Indiana.”
Todd Rokita Earns Indiana State Police Alliance Endorsement
On Wednesday, attorney general candidate Todd Rokita earned the endorsement of the Indiana State Police Alliance. As our state's attorney general, Todd will always stand with Indiana's brave state troopers and their families.

"President Trump just nominated fellow Hoosier Amy Coney Barrett and we need to show our support! View this email in your browser
id:2020-04-23-15:43:59:705t
Alex,
Have you heard the news?
President Trump nominated an excellent Constitutional conservative to serve on the Supreme Court, and we can’t miss our chance to confirm her.
It’s a fellow Hoosier – Amy Coney Barrett! Judge Barrett calls South Bend home and is a professor at Notre Dame. President Trump nominated her to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in 2017 and she was confirmed with a bipartisan majority in the Senate.
Barrett brings a clear record of interpreting the Constitution as written, not as a judicial activist legislating from the bench.
That’s the way it should be — the way our Founding Fathers intended it to be.
Over the coming weeks, she will undoubtedly be the victim of a relentless and unfounded smear campaign from radical leftist Democrats, but the Indiana Republican Party remains steadfast in our support of President Trump’s pick.
President Trump has fulfilled his constitutional obligation to fill a Supreme Court vacancy and Hoosiers can rest assured that their senators, Todd Young and Mike Braun, will do their duty as well.
Amy Coney Barrett’s addition to the Supreme Court will cement a constructionist majority for years to come. One that will follow the laws set forth in our Constitution, as written.
Of course, the liberals are not happy, and are doing everything in their power to convince the Senate not to confirm Judge Barrett. The radical left is even threatening to pack the court, abolish the electoral college, add states to the union, and even impeach the President again if they ever return to power!
To help Judge Barrett, I’m asking every single patriot to contribute now and help us defend her!
Let the United States Senate know that we MUST confirm Judge Amy Coney Barrett NOW!
Rush your support for fellow Hoosier Amy Coney Barrett!
Please be a part of history and show your support for the Constitution and America. Click to contribute today.
Thanks for your support,
Kyle Hupfer
Chairman, Indiana GOP
Rush your support for fellow Hoosier Amy Coney Barrett!

There are only 50 days left until the election, and we still have a lot of work to do! The leftwing Democrats have made it their mission to tear down our Republican candidates – while boosting their own far-left candidates who would spell disaster for Indiana.
We are fighting back by helping our Republican candidates, especially Governor Holcomb, Victoria Spartz in the 5th district, and Todd Rokita for Attorney General.
These three conservatives need our immediate help, as they have been targeted by the Democrat machine, led by Nancy Pelosi!

id:2020-04-23-15:43:59:705t
Alex,
I don’t need to tell you that a lot is riding on the 2020 elections!
We’ve seen what happens under the failed “leadership” of Nancy Pelosi as the Speaker of the House. That’s why one of our highest priorities this year is to WIN the battleground race in the 5th district.
The Democrats know that if they steal this seat, they’ll likely keep their majority in the House.
They even brought in liberals’ favorite senator, Elizabeth “Medicare for All” Warren, to endorse their campaign.
Can we really afford another term of Speaker Pelosi? Can we afford leaders hand-picked by Elizabeth Warren?
No, we cannot.
Thankfully, we have a fantastic conservative candidate running in this race — Victoria Spartz. We’ve already earned some great support from our grassroots team, but we’ll need everyone mobilized to counter the out-of-state Democrat super money machine.
Will you chip in $5, $10, $25, $50, $100, $250, or what you can right now to ensure a victory for Victoria this November?
I want to make sure everyone who contributes during this critical time is recognized, so we’re going to include your name on our official Hoosier Donor Wall. For a limited time, everyone who donates will have a spot and be remembered as a generous benefactor who stepped up against the liberal elitist super donors.
Can you dig deep to support Victoria and help us win back the House?
Donate $5 for victory for Victoria! >>
Donate $10 for victory for Victoria! >>
Donate $25 for victory for Victoria! >>
Donate $50 for victory for Victoria! >>
Donate $100 for victory for Victoria! >>
Donate $250 for victory for Victoria! >>
Donate another amount for victory for Victoria! >>
I have faith that we can get through these trying times, and that we will emerge even stronger on the other side. But we have to band together to get there and elect a new conservative majority in the House.
Will you help us today, and be remembered for years to come by putting your name on the wall?

A New Republican Mayor
In the heart of Lake County, we saw some big news this week -- and a big message sent to Democrats not just here, but around the country.
Longtime Hobart Mayor Brian Snedecor made the decision to leave the Democrat Party and officially become a Republican this week. He made the call after watching his former party continue to move further and further to the left -- staking their ground on issues like raising taxes, opening our borders, eliminating private health insurance, and defunding the police.
A special thank you goes out to Dan Dernulc, Dana Dumezich, and Mike Simpson for your leadership in Lake County and the 1st District and role in this announcement.
Mayor Snedecor said it perfectly, “The efforts of the progressive left have driven many people, moderates and conservatives, away from the Democratic Party.""
It's a trend we're continuing to see, with more Hoosiers stepping up and saying that today's Democrats aren't the same Democrats we saw even a generation ago. Democrats are on a radical leftward shift, and Hoosier voters have clearly spoken that Democrats no longer speak for them.
Mayor Snedecor's decision this week expands the Republican majority of mayoral seats to 71 statewide -- more than any party has ever held at one time in state history.
While Democrats go further into the fringes, here in Indiana, Republicans will continue to lead and deliver results.
\- Chairman Kyle Hupfer
Governor Holcomb's Week That Was
Gov. Holcomb's Commitment to K-12 Education
Across the state, Hoosier students are back in school. And whether that school is in-person, virtual or a hybrid of the two, Governor Holcomb is committed to making sure that Indiana's schools receive 100% of their funding \-- providing some consistency and certainty for our students, parents and teachers. This includes a $182 million scheduled budget increase for K-12 schools in 2021.
This will be achieved by pushing back the official count of student enrollment to at least December, with the Indiana General Assembly returning for its annual session in January to continue the conversation.
Governor Holcomb has made his commitment to our state's K-12 schools clear, continuing his track record of:
* Grants for high-quality Pre-K available in every county
* A historic $1.6 billion in new education funding since 2017
* 98% of Indiana school corporations reporting an increase in teacher pay last year with Governor Holcomb paying of a teacher pension liability
* PPE available to every Indiana district before school officially started
* Continual guidance from the Indiana State Department of Health
To stay up to date on the latest developments, please make sure you're following Governor Holcomb on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram!
This Saturday Will Be Super
We’re just 81 days from Election Day, and those 81 days are critical. We're talking with voters, sharing our message, and putting in the hard work it takes to elect Republican leaders statewide.

Victoria Spartz Has the Momentum!
Some big news this week out of the 5th District! A new poll from the Club for Growth shows that Victoria Spartz has taken a seven-point lead in the district's congressional race. She's the voice we need in Washington to stop Nancy Pelosi and regain control of the House.
Read more about the poll here.
Todd Rokita Travels the State
Even through a pandemic, Todd Rokita is barnstorming the state! He recently attended Lincoln Day Dinners at both ends of Indiana - St. Jospeh County and Clark County.
Keeping the attorney general's office in conservative hands is vital this November, and Todd Rokita will always stand up for and defend conservative values and the rights of all Hoosiers.

"President Trump and Vice President Pence have delivered huge results for Indiana during this pandemic View this email in your browser
Hoosier Republicans,
Vice President Pence was Back Home Again in Indiana yesterday, praising the decisive actions Governor Holcomb has taken to lead Indiana through the COVID-19 pandemic and leading a roundtable with education leaders.
“Governor, I want everyone in this state to know the President and I and our entire team fully support your leadership and the steps you’ve taken in Indiana to keep this state on the right track.” –Vice President Mike Pence
WATCH – Vice President Pence: ""Wearing a [[URL REDACTED]] How We Keep Indiana Open""
President Trump, Vice President Pence and their team have been invaluable partners to Governor Holcomb as he leads the state through the COVID-19 Pandemic. Under President Trump’s leadership, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has provided Indiana with:
* $55.5 million in federal support
* 1.5 million N95 respirators
* 860,534 gloves
* 187,793 face shields
* 440,683 surgical masks
* 110 ventilators
* 43,300 swabs and 30,900 units of media for testing
President Trump and Vice President Pence have also delivered huge results for Indiana during this pandemic through the CARES Act and the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP):
* The CARES Act is providing up to $2.6 billion in aid to Indiana.
* The PPP has provided more than $9.4 billion in loans to nearly 79,000 Indiana businesses.
* The third round of PPP is protecting 1 million Indiana jobs.
* More than 3.2 million Hoosiers have received Economic Impact Payments, totaling over $5.7 billion in aid.
Additionally, Vice President Pence led an education roundtable with Governor Holcomb, United States Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, and other education leaders at Marian University. The panel discussed the need for schools to safely reopen to in-person instruction this fall and the actions the government is taking to ensure this is done.
The Vice President had a full day in the Hoosier state, with his first stop being an event supporting our attorney general nominee, Todd Rokita.
It's always a thrill to welcome Vice President Mike Pence and Second Lady Karen Pence back home again to Indiana. They continue to serve our nation with honor, humility and grace. We couldn’t be prouder of how they represent Indiana on the global stage.

"Don’t let Indiana fall victim to a “blue wave”! View this email in your browser
** FROM THE DESK OF VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE **
Alex,
Across the country, we’re locked in a battle for the heart and soul of America.
We have JUST WEEKS now until the most consequential election of our lifetime, and things are heating up in the Hoosier State.
President Donald Trump and I need you to deliver for us again! In 2016, Indiana was first on the board for President Trump’s upset win. Can the president and I count on you as we make history for the second time?
The Socialist Democrats aren’t even hiding the far-left wish list they want to enact should they win the White House and Congress. They will pack the Supreme Court, grant statehood to Washington D.C., and enact the economy-crushing brainchild of AOC, the Green New Deal.
President Trump needs Indiana to deliver, and not just deliver for us in Washington D.C., he needs you all to deliver for the Statehouse, too. This means re-electing Governor Eric Holcomb and Lt. Governor Suzanne Crouch and making Todd Rokita Indiana’s next Attorney General.
And, to make sure we send Nancy Pelosi into retirement, President Trump and I need more conservatives in Congress. So, we’re asking Hoosiers to deliver a resounding victory for Victoria Spartz in the Fifth District!
I can’t bear to think of the consequences if my home state were to fall under Democrat control, where radical liberals would surely tear down years of prosperity and growth we’ve built together!
That’s why I’m writing you today. Your emergency support now is CRITICAL.
Republicans have the momentum to keep Indiana and our nation RED ... but Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, Elizabeth Warren, Joe Biden and the Socialist Squad are attempting to bury Hoosier conservatives in national left-wing campaign cash.
Donald Trump and I are counting on TOP supporters like you at this critical time.
Tap or click here to rush a $5, $10, $25, $50, or $100 emergency donation.
Help the Indiana Republican Party keep up the fight!
KEEP INDIANA RED!
Victory in Indiana is mission-critical to protecting President Trump and me from Pelosi and Schumer’s left-wing cronies and preserving the freedoms Hoosiers enjoy.
We MUST stop this radical-left power grab... and Republican supporters like you are on the front line!
Help your Indiana Republican team finish strong. We can’t let the Democrats buy Indiana!
Make your most generous possible contribution here.
Sincerely,
Mike Pence
Vice President of the United States of America

In Motion
It’s been a busy week for Indiana, and also here at your Indiana Republican Party headquarters. We’re in motion, just like the state of Indiana.
Today is the first day of Stage 4 of Indiana’s Back on Track Plan, and it’s clear that Governor Holcomb’s leadership is safely getting Indiana back to business. Read below on what this new stage means for us all as we're getting out and about.
Here in the office, this week was the deadline for delegates to the 2020 Indiana Republican State Convention to pay their delegates fees. And we’ve been busy finalizing the schedule of events we have planned for our convention broadcast – and I have to tell you, it’s definitely going to be must-see-TV.
We’ve got all four attorney general candidates scheduled, Lt. Governor Suzanne Crouch is giving a speech, and Governor Holcomb will deliver the keynote address talking about his vision for continuing to build One Indiana over the next four years. Plus we’ve got some really fun panel discussions…and even some surprises.
We’re all disappointed that we won’t be able to meet in person for convention. But we're working to make this historic event -- the first time our convention has EVER been broadcast -- something that you'll never forget. I'm excited for this live broadcast, bringing us all together with the energy we’ll need to deliver more Republican victories in November!
#BackonTrack,
\- Chairman Kyle Hupfer
PHOTO: Indiana GOP Chairman Kyle Hupfer has been doing a lot of interviews lately, including chatting with the Portage GOP Live team about next week’s 2020 Indiana Republican State Convention. Check out the interview here.
Governor Holcomb's Week That Was
Getting Indiana Back on Track: Stage 4 Starts Today!
Great news! Indiana is entering Stage 4 of Governor Holcomb's Back on Track plan two days early! Check out what businesses are reopening & new safety guidelines below:
* Social gatherings can include up to 250 Hoosiers
* Restaurants can operate at 75% capacity (with social distancing)
* Bars, nightclubs, movie theaters, bowling alleys, amusement parks, water parks, and entertainment and tourism sites can open at 50% capacity
* Retail stores and malls can operate at full capacity
* Community recreational games, leagues and tournaments may resume
* Racing venues may open at 50% capacity
* Charity gaming and casinos may open on June 15
* Playgrounds may reopen
* State government buildings are open by appointment
Indianapolis and Marion County will begin Stage 4 on June 19.
How is this possible?
Statewide, we are seeing a decline in the number of Hoosiers hospitalized with COVID-19, we’re seeing ICU and ventilator capacity remain strong, we’ve got more than 200 testing sites available statewide, and we can effectively contact trace COVID-19 cases to contain the spread.
In order to keep Indiana on track to reach Stage 5 in July, we are going to need all Hoosiers to continue the great work they have done to get us to Stage 4 earlier than expected. That means continuing to follow safety guidelines like wearing a facemask & continuing to social distance.
To stay up to date on the latest developments, please make sure you're following Governor Holcomb on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram!
Thank you to every Hoosier who is doing his or her part to stop the spread of the coronavirus and flatten the curve. We're #INThisTogether, and we're getting #BackOnTrack!

"President Trump said it perfectly yesterday. View this email in your browser
Hoosier Republicans,
President Trump said it perfectly yesterday – “When you are not able to socially distance, wear a mask.”
It’s science. It’s patriotic. And it’s the action we must take in order to keep our economy opening across the state.
WATCH – President Trump: “Wear a mask.”
Today, Governor Holcomb announced that in certain situations, Hoosiers will be required to wear a face covering when they’re in public spaces.
Wearing a mask can help us prevent the transmission of the virus, prevent us from having to go back to stay-at-home orders, and it’s the next prudent step that we need to take as a state.
This requirement applies to Hoosiers over the age of 8 in indoor public spaces, at commercial entities, using transportation services, or outside where you cannot socially distance. When in school, mask use will be required for our kids in grades 3 and up, for faculty and staff, and anyone in a school.
And as Governor Holcomb said today, with ALL of us working together to prevent the spread of COVID-19, we can prevent Indiana from (like other states) needing to go backwards:
""We have, as Hoosiers, worked very hard to get to where we are today. Businesses are open and operating at various levels of capacity, people are getting haircuts, we're eating in restaurants and we're working in all kinds of facilities, both large and small. And we want to keep it that way.
""We want businesses to stay open. We want more Hoosiers to continue this trend of going back safely to work. We don't want to dial it back or put it in [[URL REDACTED]] as some are, shutting down again. Face coverings can and will help us blunt this increase.""
-Governor Eric Holcomb
All along, Governor Holcomb has said that the data behind four guiding principles – hospitalizations, surge capacity, testing and contact tracing – will guide his decisions. Here’s where Indiana stands now:
Hospitalizations - Daily admissions are up from 595 Hoosiers admitted on June 26 to 803 Hoosiers admitted on July 20.
Surge Capacity – Hospital capacity remains strong, with 36.6% ICU beds available and 82.% vents available
Testing – Indiana’s test positivity rate has increased to 7% (up from 4.3% on June 18). Indiana has 214 testing sites available, with 654,000 Hoosiers tested.
Contact Tracing \- Robust contact tracing continues, contacting all Hoosiers within 48-72 hours of a positive test.
Together, we can follow President Trump and Governor Holcomb’s lead. We can wear our masks, we can save lives, and we can keep Indiana’s economy on the path of reopening.
We don’t want to go back – and together, we can keep Indiana moving forward.

Thankful
Today I’m writing to you from on the road. Governor Holcomb and I are up in Northern Indiana, talking with Hoosiers about the big issues in this election.
As we all go to vote (I voted yesterday), there’s a lot on the line, and we all know that it’s critical that we do everything we can in these final days to elect Republicans up and down the ballot and keep Indiana moving forward.
And with just four days to go until Election Day, I’m thankful for each of you who have helped your Indiana Republican Party this year. There’s no doubt that this has been another unusual election (and for that matter, an unusual year), but, as Governor Holcomb says, Hoosiers have come together. Whether you’ve been out putting in yard signs, making calls, or talking with your friends, family and neighbors, your contributions are making the difference to make sure that Indiana keeps moving forward – and doesn’t move back to the Democrat days of debt and dysfunction.
And we can’t let up the gas now. Over the next four days, I’ll be talking to everyone I can to support our entire Republican team.
Will you join me? Make sure you’ve made a plan to vote, and then let’s finish this election strong…together!

Governor Holcomb's Week That Was
Building One Indiana for All
It's been another busy week for Governor Holcomb!
On Tuesday he took part in the final gubernatorial debate (which he won!), where once again he clearly outlined his plan for the next four years as he continues building One Indiana for All.
He spoke about building a record-breaking economy, bringing huge numbers of jobs to our state, making sure Hoosiers are skilled-up and ready to fill new jobs, how important access to broadband is for our rural communities, how the hardworking men and women at DCS are making a difference in the lives of Hoosier families, and how his pro-life leadership has protected the most vulnerable Hoosiers. We’re facing a crucial choice in a few days, and it’s never been more important to stay on top of the key issues. If you missed the debate watch a replay here.
This week, Governor Holcomb also fulfilled a key promise of his Next Level Agenda. On Wednesday, he announced construction will begin on the state’s largest public transit investment in Indiana history – expanding commuter rail service from the West Lake Corridor to Chicago. This transformational project will boost economic development in Northwest Indiana and create new opportunities for Hoosiers!
“By bringing commuter rail through the heart of Lake County, the West Lake Corridor project is a game changer for northwest Indiana and the entire state."" -Governor Holcomb
Governor Holcomb then yesterday joined local officials and executives from Midwest Truck to officially break ground on the company's new facility in Merrillville! In September, the company announced its intentions to expand its Midwest operations in Merrillville with plans to create new jobs for Hoosiers! Under Gov. Holcomb's leadership, Indiana is continuing to attract investment and jobs, even during a pandemic.
""It’s an exciting day as we celebrate Midwest Truck’s decision to fuel its growth in Indiana, and I’m so grateful for the company's commitment to increasing its footprint and creating quality career opportunities in northwest Indiana.”
To stay up to date on the latest developments, please make sure you're following Governor Holcomb on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram!
Four Days: Go Vote!
Early voting is now available statewide, and Election Day is this Tuesday. More than a million Hoosiers have already cast statewide, and we need to make sure you vote, too! Our Republican team up and down the ballot needs your vote, so consider getting out this weekend to vote. And if you can’t vote then, make sure you vote on Tuesday.

Alex,
I’m so grateful for all Hoosiers who have already stepped up in the name of winning our battleground race in the 5th District.
The fight isn’t over yet, though.
We still need patriots to come through for the GOP and help us win big for Victoria Spartz!
This is your last chance to get your name on our special donor wall. We’re closing access tonight at midnight, and I wanted to make sure you got the opportunity to give before then.
This list of donors will be specially recognized and remembered as the Hoosiers who made the difference to help us win BIG.
Add your name NOW! >>
Victoria and I appreciate your support. She’s ready to get to work in Washington, and fight for the hardworking men and women in the 5th District. She’s not afraid to stand up to Nancy Pelosi and the other liberal elites, and will always do what’s right for Indiana.
Will you help us send Victoria to D.C.? If we lose this seat, there will be virtually no hope of winning back our House majority. I don’t think America can afford another term with Speaker Pelosi in charge, do you?

"Indiana’s Attorney General election is going to be a tight race — and may determine our Second Amendment rights! Read more >> View this email in your browser
id:2020-04-23-15:43:59:705t
Alex,
We can’t stress enough how important it is that conservatives in Indiana band together to support Todd Rokita for Attorney General.
The Democrats are targeting this race, along with several other attorneys general elections across the country. They have made these races an absolutely critical priority because they KNOW that that they can use them to go after President Trump and Vice President Pence.
Not only that, but if the anti-gun coastal elites manage to take over attorney generals’ offices in the heartland, they’ll try to follow the attorney general’s lead in New York and prosecute conservative organizations like the NRA!
With all the turmoil in today’s political environment, do you want Washington bureaucrats to take away your right to defend your family and loved ones?
Todd Rokita has a proven, A-rated record in defending our Constitution’s Second Amendment. He will fight for Hoosiers’ God-given, constitutionally-protected rights, and defend the president’s agenda.
Todd is the common-sense conservative that we need as our next attorney general.
Todd’s Democrat opponent is well-funded, and he’s got “C” rating from the NRA, which begs the question – does he support the New York attorney general’s attack on the Second Amendment, too?
We know where Todd stands.
As we gear up for the election in November, we need to put as many resources behind Todd as we can to defeat the liberal machine that is already at work in Indiana.
Will you donate now to elect Todd Rokita and protect our Second Amendment rights?
Chip in $10 to protect 2A rights in Indiana!
Chip in $25 to protect 2A rights in Indiana!
Chip in $50 to protect 2A rights in Indiana!
Chip in $100 to protect 2A rights in Indiana!
Chip in $150 to protect 2A rights in Indiana!
Chip in another amount to protect 2A rights in Indiana!
We can’t let Nancy Pelosi and her minions win this race with a rubber-stamp candidate who will do nothing but her bidding. Hoosiers deserve better than that.
Please take a stand for conservative values and donate today to make sure we win big for Todd this November!
Thanks for your support,
The Indiana GOP

id:2020-04-23-15:43:59:705t
Alex,
We hope you've heard the exciting news!
On Saturday, President Trump nominated fellow Hoosier Amy Coney Barrett, an excellent Constitutional conservative, to serve on the Supreme Court.
We couldn't be more excited for her nomination, and wanted to share what your fellow Hoosier Republicans are saying about this perfect nomination!
Support Fellow Hoosier Amy Coney Barrett!
""Congratulations Judge Amy Coney Barrett!"" - Vice President Mike Pence
""Judge Barrett’s compelling combination of experience and intellect would serve our country well on the Supreme Court bench, adding another healthy dose of Hoosier hospitality to our nation’s capital."" -Governor Eric Holcomb
""Judge Amy Coney Barrett has shown she upholds our country's Constitution while serving on the U.S. Court of Appeals. While today's nomination is only the first step, it is a significant step as she looks to become the first woman justice from Indiana. Our nation could benefit with another exceptional Hoosier voice in Washington."" -Lt. Gov. Suzanne Crouch
""Today is a big day for Indiana with fellow Hoosier Judge Amy Coney Barrett slated to be nominated to the United States Supreme Court. Judge Amy Coney Barrett of South Bend has distinguished herself in many ways."" - Todd Rokita
“Once again, President Trump has selected a Hoosier to serve in a position of national importance. I congratulate Notre Dame’s Amy Coney Barrett for her nomination to the Supreme Court and applaud the president for his choice. A brilliant legal mind, Judge Barrett is an inspired choice to serve on our nation’s highest court and I know she will serve honorably."" - Chairman Kyle Hupfer
""I am thrilled with POTUS's nomination of fellow Hoosier, Judge Amy Coney Barrett, to serve on the Supreme Court. I've come to know her as an incredibly sharp legal mind, a woman of great integrity, and a dedicated mother of seven."" - Senator Todd Young
""I fully support Amy Coney Barrett’s nomination and will vote to confirm her without hesitation."" - Senator Mike Braun
“I can think of no one better qualified to serve on the Supreme Court than my fellow Hoosier, Judge Amy Coney Barrett. Her record as a Notre Dame law professor and as an appellate judge demonstrates her first-rate legal mind and her unwavering commitment to constitutional principles. Given her impeccable credentials, the Senate should confirm her nomination without delay. I applaud President Trump for again fulfilling his promise to appoint judges who will faithfully uphold the rule of law, defend the Constitution, and protect the life and liberty of every American.” - Representative Jackie Walorski
""ACB already received bipartisan support from the Senate in her 2017 confirmation hearings. That’s because she is well-qualified, with sterling personal credentials and an impressive professional record. Senate, let’s get this done!"" - Representative Jim Banks
""Judge Amy Coney Barrett is immensely qualified to serve on the United Stated Supreme Court. I have tremendous respect for her record and commitment to the Constitution. I look forward to her confirmation without delay."" - Representative Jim Baird
""I applaud President Trump for nominating 7th Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court. As a strict constitutionalist, I admire her commitment to uphold her judicial and constitutional oath. As a former beloved Notre Dame Law professor, working mom of 7, and Hoosier for many years, she will be an excellent Justice on our Supreme Court."" -Representative Susan Brooks
“Judge Amy Coney Barrett is supremely qualified, principled, a dedicated mother of seven, and is a brilliant choice for the Supreme Court by President Trump. She will be a strong Conservative judge and interpret the Constitution faithfully. I am proud to see a fellow Hoosier commit her life to service as Judge Barrett has done and I look forward to seeing her fill the 9th seat of the highest court in the land.” -Representative Greg Pence
""Congratulations to Amy Coney Barrett on being nominated by President Trump to The Supreme Court of the United States. Well deserved!"" - Representative Larry Bucshon
President Trump has fulfilled his constitutional obligation to fill a Supreme Court vacancy and Hoosiers can rest assured that their senators, Todd Young and Mike Braun, will do their duty as well.
Over the coming weeks, Judge Barrett will be the victim of attacks by the radical left, but the Indiana Republican Party will remain steadfast in our support for her.
Will you support us as we support our fellow Hoosiers -- from Judge Barrett to Vice President Pence to Governor Holcomb -- as we defend them over the next 36 days? Click to contribute today.
Thank you,
Indiana Republican Party
Support Fellow Hoosier Amy Coney Barrett!

id:2020-04-23-15:43:59:705t
Alex,
The Senate is set to vote TONIGHT to confirm Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the United States Supreme Court.
And as the Senate is poised to add another constitutional conservative on the Supreme Court, Democrats have made their plans clear.
Democrats will pack the court if they return to power!
We have to make sure that doesn’t happen, and I need your help. We need to make sure that we keep the Senate, and take back the House to end Nancy Pelosi’s rein in the Speaker’s Office.
Will you please chip in what you can right now to help win back the House and FIRE Speaker Pelosi?
FIRE Speaker Pelosi now!
There is so much at stake in 2020 — I know I don’t need to tell you that it’s one of the most important elections in our lifetimes.
But if we all stand together, we can get through this, keep our Senate majority, and WIN BACK THE HOUSE.
Please help, before it’s too late.

"Republican Victoria Spartz is running in the 5th District against a Pelosi-Warren-Harris-Buttigieg-Obama-Squad handpicked liberal! Read more >> View this email in your browser
id:2020-04-23-15:43:59:705t
Alex,
We need all hands on deck for this race.
The national Dems – Nancy Pelosi, Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, The Squad, and Barack Obama – have targeted a congressional district right here in Indiana and endorsed the liberal candidate, Christina Hale.
Conservative Victoria Spartz is ready to go to Washington to fight this liberal Democrat machine.
The Cook Political Report has classified this race a “toss-up,” after being held by Republicans since 1993! It would be absolutely devastating to lose this seat – and would almost assuredly dash our chances of winning back the House majority.
Can you imagine another term with Nancy Pelosi in the Speaker’s Office? Nobody should have to picture that – which is why we need everyone to chip in now.
Will you please donate $5, $10, $25, $50, $100, $250, or what you can right now to elect Victoria Spartz?
Keeping this seat RED is a major factor in winning back our majority in the House and finally firing Speaker Pelosi. We absolutely cannot let the national Dem machine win it.
We’re counting on Hoosiers like you to step up and chip in. If everyone donates just a few dollars, we’ll be able to fight back against the Pelosi-Warren-Harris-Buttigieg-Obama machine and win this one for Victoria and the Republican Party.
Thanks,
Indiana GOP

"Governor Holcomb shared some BIG news this week. Tomorrow, Indiana is officially going to Stage 5 of the Back on Track plan!  View this email in your browser
We're Doing This Together
Governor Holcomb shared some BIG news this week. Tomorrow, Indiana is officially going to Stage 5 of the Back on Track plan!
Now, COVID-19 isn't over -- across the state, we still see Hoosiers' health impacted by this virus in a very real way. However, as you know, Governor Holcomb's been looking at the data every step of the way, and the data shows that the actions you're taking are making a clear difference. One thing is clear -- we have done this together.
Indiana’s 7-day positivity rate is continuing to stand around 4 percent, and the number of Hoosiers hospitalized and in need of critical care beds and ventilators is down. We’ve got robust testing available throughout the state. If you're feeling sick, don't hesitate to make an appointment at one of the many testing sites that are available to you.
As we are set to enter Stage 5, make no mistake that this success is because of your actions. You can read more about Stage 5 here – but in essence, capacity restrictions are lifted at restaurants, shops and fitness facilities as long as social distancing is continuing to be considered. Large events can move forward with input from local heath departments on events larger than 500 people. And local communities can impose more restrictions if their data requires it.
This is great news as Indiana’s economy continues to bounce back. Indiana’s unemployment rate has dropped to 6.4%, and more Hoosiers are going back to work.
As Governor Holcomb says, we’re getting back to setting records – and Indiana’s best days are still ahead.
-Chairman Kyle Hupfer
PHOTO: This week, Chairman Hupfer joined the University of Southern California Cybersecurity Initiative for an Indiana online workshop focusing on the importance of cybersecurity. He talked about efforts we've taken, both here at the party and in our elections. You can read more about it here.
Governor Holcomb's Week That Was
Indiana: Back on Track
On Wednesday, Governor Holcomb announced that Indiana is set to enter Stage 5 of the Back on Track plan tomorrow! It is thanks to the actions Hoosiers have taken that have led us to this moment. This pandemic isn't over, but with continued vigilance, we're able to continue the measured, data-driven opening of our state.
Here's a quick breakdown of Stage 5:
* Continue to maintain social distancing
* Wash your hands and stay home if you’re sick
* Events of more than 500 people must receive sign-off from local health department on written plan
* Full capacity: restaurants, bars and nightclubs (with social distancing)
* Bar patrons must use seating
* Personal services and fitness centers may resume normal operations
* Size limitations removed for social gatherings and meetings
* Indoor and outdoor venues open at full capacity
* Nursing homes & assisted living facilities required to offer visitation hours
* Face coverings still required
Together as Hoosiers, we’ve made it to Stage 5 because of your commitment to our state – which includes your continued efforts to make smart choices about your health and the health of your friends, neighbors, coworkers and fellow Hoosiers.
“We ought to be real proud to be Hoosiers in this state… When you think about where we are compared to a lot of other states… We don’t get here by accident. We got here by working together…” – Governor Eric Holcomb
To stay up to date on the latest developments, please make sure you're following Governor Holcomb on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram!
Governor Holcomb: Right to Life Endorsement
Indiana Right to Life PAC this week announced its endorsement of Governor Eric Holcomb for a second term, the only pro-life candidate in the gubernatorial race. The organization recognized Governor Holcomb and Lt. Governor Suzanne Crouch’s pro-life leadership and dedication to protecting all human life.
“The sanctity of life is a fundamental right – and in practice we’ve seen it as a fundamental priority of Governor Holcomb’s as he leads our state,” said Mike Fichter, president and chief executive officer of Indiana Right to Life. “Every day he works to protect Hoosier lives, including the unborn and the most vulnerable among us. He’s the only pro-life candidate in this race, and the right person to lead Indiana for another four years. We're proud to give him our endorsement.”
New Ad: We Can Do It Again
Check out Governor Holcomb’s latest TV ad airing statewide, “We Can Do It Again!”
It talks about Indiana's economic records -- we were attracting record job commitments with record wages, we'd reached a record low unemployment rate. But as Governor Holcomb says, we're just getting started -- and we'll hit those records again with new opportunities for Hoosiers.
\--> Watch Governor Holcomb's new ad now <\--
New Ad: Putting Hoosiers First
This week, Todd Rokita launched his first TV ad of the campaign, focusing on his record of Putting Hoosiers First.
He’s prosecuted criminals, won a Supreme Court cases protecting our elections, stands for Hoosier jobs, fights corruption, defends our Constitution, and stands with our police. He’s the right pick to be our next attorney general.
\--> Watch Todd Rokita's new ad now <\--
Senators Young and Braun Pledge Support
for Speedy Supreme Court Nomination
This week, both of Indiana’s senators, Senator Todd Young and Senator Mike Braun, pledged to support the speedy nomination of a new Supreme Court justice.
""When this Republican president was elected in 2016 and the American people expanded the Republican majority in the Senate — the expectation of the American people was that should a Supreme Court vacancy arise, that that vacancy should be filled."" -Senator Young
“We do control the presidency and the Senate. And I think for the majority of Hoosiers that elected me, they’d be disappointed if we didn’t do it.” -Senator Braun
Victoria Spartz Wins Town Hall Meeting
While unfortunately liberal Democrat Christina Hale has refused all requests to participate in debates, Republican Victoria Spartz clearly won this week’s town hall meeting among the candidates for Congress in the 5th District.
Here’s a statement from her campaign:
“The contrast at tonight’s Town Hall meeting could not have been clearer. Victoria Spartz has the diverse experience, proven record and command of the issues to advocate for Indiana’s 5th District in Congress, and help rebuild our economy, lower healthcare costs and ensure all children receive a good education. Meanwhile, Christina Hale proved she is nothing but an empty suit and the hand-picked candidate of Nancy Pelosi. Hale spewed her scripted talking points and ran from her record of serving special interests and liberal party bosses at Hoosiers’ expense. Hale is exactly the kind of self-serving political opportunist who will make the mess in Washington worse.”

Praying for a Safe Recovery
While President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump are now safely quarantining at the White House after positive COVID-19 diagnoses, Hoosiers are coming together. We're praying for the health and recovery of the First Family, and the health of all with COVID-19.
This disease has again proven that no one is immune, and it’s another reminder to focus on good hygiene, social distancing and wearing masks.
We’re now just over 30 days away from Election Day, with early voting in person beginning this Tuesday. Indiana’s economy is bouncing back with an unemployment rate that keeps dropping (now 6.4%), and health benchmarks showing that Indiana is making progress. Governor Holcomb shared this week that Indiana's COVID-19 positivity rate is continuing to stay around 4%, while more schools and employers are opening for business.
Republican leadership delivers results. Starting on Tuesday, make your voice heard that you want to see this progress continue.
Go out and cast your vote for our entire Republican team!
-Chairman Kyle Hupfer
PHOTO: This week, Chairman Hupfer presented the keynote remarks at the La Porte County Reagan Day Dinner. He talked about Indiana’s Republican leadership, with Governor Holcomb and our Republican legislators making sure Indiana was ready to handle the impacts of COVID-19 – with record job creation, record high wages, low taxes, balanced budgets and a responsible rainy day fund. That same leadership is now working to take Indiana to even greater heights.
Governor Holcomb's Week That Was
Pro-Life Leadership
Yesterday, Governor Holcomb announced some huge news! Thanks to his pro-life leadership, Indiana's infant mortality rate just fell to the lowest level ever recorded in our state’s history.
Gov. Holcomb has taken direct and impactful action to protect our state's most vulnerable citizens, including:
* Implementing Levels of Care certification for perinatal programs at hospitals and birthing centers to ensure that mothers and babies get care at a facility with a level of care that matches their risk.
* Expanding the Nurse-Family Partnership Program to combat infant mortality rates.
* Starting Indiana's OB Navigator program that connects pregnant women in Indiana's highest-risk ZIP codes with wraparound health services.
There's still work to do on this front, but this news is wonderful for our state. It's just the latest pro-life success story from Governor Holcomb, and that's not to mention the big news just weeks ago that Indiana leads the nation in adoptions out of foster care!
To stay up to date on the latest developments, please make sure you're following Governor Holcomb on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram!
Get Well Soon, Mr. President!
This morning, we learned that President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump have tested positive for COVID-19. We know that they’re fighters, and as Hoosiers, we’re all praying for their speedy recovery -- and for the health of all diagnosed!
Todd Rokita Earns Right to Life Endorsement!
Indiana Right to Life PAC today announced its endorsement of Todd Rokita for Attorney General! Todd Rokita is a lifetime advocate for the unborn, earning a 100% pro-life voting record as a member of Congress. In addition, Todd Rokita was endorsed by Indiana Right to Life during his two terms as Secretary of State.
“Todd Rokita is the pro-life choice for attorney general,” states Indiana Right to Life PAC chairman Mike Fichter. “We have absolute certainty that he will strongly defend Indiana’s pro-life laws in the courts, including future laws as well as those laws already being challenged in the federal courts.”
Let’s Support Hoosier Amy Coney Barrett!
Last weekend, President Trump nominated a fellow Hoosier, Judge Amy Coney Barrett, an excellent Constitutional conservative, to serve on the Supreme Court. Judge Barrett brings a clear record of interpreting the Constitution as written, not as a judicial activist legislating from the bench.
She calls South Bend home, is a professor at Notre Dame, and was confirmed to her role on the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in 2017 with a bipartisan majority in the Senate.
This week she met with Senators Todd Young and Mike Braun – and we can’t wait to see her confirmed by the entire Senate!

As Todd says, the stakes couldn't be higher in this election, and we must keep the attorney general's office in conservative Republican hands. With your continued support, we will be victorious in November!
Thanks,
-Your Indiana Republican Party

Alex,
I hope everyone was able to tune into the RNC last night, especially to see Mike and Karen Pence speak.
It was awesome to see our fellow Hoosier accept his renomination as Donald Trump’s running mate for the 2020 presidential election, and he and his wife inspired us all with their heartfelt words.
And they’re right. If we want to Keep America Great, we need four more years of President Trump’s administration. He has done more for the American people in the last three and half years than Joe Biden has done in Washington in nearly five decades.
President Trump continually puts people first, and tirelessly fights for the right of every single citizen to pursue their American Dream, regardless of race, age, gender, religion, economic status, or anything else.
We need every single grassroots supporter to show their support for the Trump-Pence ticket by donating now. The radical left is hard at work for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, but we know they don’t represent Hoosier values.
Help us fight back by chipping in $5, $10, $25, $50, $100, $250, or what you can now!
We can win the White House again in 2020, but only if we all stand with our former Indiana Governor and current Vice President to re-elect President Trump!
Thanks for your support,
Kyle Hupfer

Indiana Republicans,
While there’s no doubt that this year’s state convention process looks a lot different, we’re excited to report that Hoosiers from every county have made their voice heard.
With today’s 5 p.m. ET deadline for delegates to return their ballots, we’re excited to report that 98% of all ballots have been returned. That’s a higher number than the Democrats had for their convention this year!
Tomorrow, we’ll count the votes in presence of election watchers from all four campaigns. We’ll share the winner with you in a live video on Facebook tomorrow afternoon. We hope to have results around 1:30 p.m. ET, but it could be earlier or sooner depending on how long counting takes. We'll send out an email update before we go live with the results.

There are just days left until the 2020 election. We have thousands of Hoosier volunteers working around the clock in Indiana to get out the vote, and they need your help.
We understand that not everyone has the ability to volunteer their time, but you can still help elect our Republican ticket as they’re working to keep Indiana moving forward.
Will you chip in to help with the vital funds we need to keep our grassroots volunteers going? It is critical that we keep them out in the field, going full steam ahead until the polls close on November 3rd.

Every bit helps. For $5, we can feed a volunteer lunch. For $10, we can ensure they have the campaign materials needed to pass out to voters. For $50 we can pay for the yard signs our team is placing across the state!

id:2020-04-23-15:43:59:705t
Alex,
We just wrapped up our state convention last week – and as I said, there’s a reason why Indiana Republicans now hold every statewide elected position, both U.S. Senate seats, and seven of Indiana’s U.S. House seats.
Indiana Republicans deliver results!
Well, now in 2020, there’s a battleground race happening in Indiana’s 5th Congressional District – and the Democrats are starting to raise some big out-of-state dollars to pour into this race, all with the goal of stopping our Indiana GOP momentum!
We’ve got the end-of-quarter fundraising deadline coming up on June 30. And to make sure we’re competing with the Democrats dollar-for-dollar, we have partnered with our candidate in the 5th District – Victoria Spartz.
Will you chip in $5, $10, $25, $50, $100, $250, or what you can now before midnight on June 30th?
When you donate, you’ll see that half of your contribution goes directly to the Victoria’s campaign, and the other half will stay with us here at the Indiana Republican Party to support our grassroots ground game contacting voters in the 5th District.
We need to raise as much as we can before the end-of-quarter reporting deadline so we can make sure we’re counteracting the Democrats’ out-of-state dollars…and that we’re reaching as many voters as possible.
If we want to flip the House RED and fire Speaker Pelosi in November, we have to throw our support behind Victoria and help her win this race.
Will you help?
Donate $5 NOW to win this battleground race! >>
Donate $10 NOW to win this battleground race! >>
Donate $25 NOW to win this battleground race! >>
Donate $50 NOW to win this battleground race! >>
Donate $100 NOW to win this battleground race! >>

Donate $500 NOW to win this battleground race! >>
Donate $1000 NOW to win this battleground race! >>
Donate what you can NOW to win this battleground race! >>
Victoria is working hard to win this thing. She’s also counting on our support. You can make the biggest impact by chipping in now to support her and your Indiana GOP.

Listening & Leading
It's been another busy week for your Indiana GOP. It didn’t look like we had originally planned with 1,800 delegates together in Indianapolis, but this week voting finally concluded as part of our 2020 Indiana Republican State Convention.
Congratulations to our attorney general nominee, Todd Rokita. Our team is organized, energized and ready to deliver victories for Governor Holcomb, Lt. Governor Crouch, Todd Rokita and Republicans up and down the ballot in November.
And earlier this week, I'm excited to finally share a program that's long been in the works for us -- the Indiana Republican Diversity Leadership Series. Through this program, we'll work to bring more historically underrepresented communities into civic leadership roles. We'll achieve this by hosting monthly seminar-style classes and by providing mentorship as the members of our to-be-recruited class look to grow their involvement in our party. It's a continuation of the listening and learning we as a party have been undertaking -- and will continue undertaking.
If you know anyone interested, please encourage them to check out our website, ask questions and apply.
And, of course, all of that news is on top of another record fundraising quarter for Governor Holcomb (more details below). Hoosier like leadership, and that's what they see from him daily.
It’s been a week of listening and leading. It’s what we do at your Indiana Republican Party and what we’ll continue to do everyday to serve you.
\- Chairman Kyle Hupfer
P.S. We did a few media interviews this week on our new Indiana Republican Diversity Leadership Series. Here's one of them from the IndyStar \-- check it out.
Governor Holcomb's Week That Was
Indiana: Back on Track
Today, Governor Holcomb is in Evansville as he joins the Southwest Indiana Chamber of Commerce for their (socially distanced) luncheon. He was excited to discuss how Indiana is getting safely back on track, and how together we’re taking steps to continue fighting this pandemic.
One way we’re fighting the pandemic is by using the right PPE when we’re out and about, including wearing a cloth face mask. On Wednesday, we received an update on how Governor Holcomb and his team are leading the way when it comes to providing Hoosier frontline workers, businesses and schools with the resources we need to mask up!
* PPE For Schools: Governor Holcomb’s team is getting critical PPE to schools across the state – just in time to safely reopen schools for a new year. They have more than 3 million reusable masks available for students! In addition to masks, schools will also receive hand sanitizer. This program is available to all schools, and as of Tuesday this week, 472 Indiana school corporations are participating.
* PPE For Businesses: As the Back on Track plan launched, so did the Indiana Small Business PPE Marketplace. Since May, it’s filled more than 30,000 orders to over 600 cities across Indiana, protecting thousands of Hoosiers on the job at our state’s small businesses! And now that requests are shifting, the state is launching the Indiana PPE Directory, which is directly connecting Hoosiers with our local businesses that manufacture or distribute PPE. You can check it out here.
We have so much to be thankful for here in Indiana, and that includes Governor Holcomb’s leadership as we continue to navigate this pandemic.
To stay up to date on the latest developments, please make you're following Governor Holcomb on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram!
Another Record Fundraising Quarter
Governor Holcomb had another record-setting fundraising quarter. After pausing campaign activity in March and fully focusing on leading Indiana through this pandemic, Governor Holcomb closed the second quarter of 2020 with $8.05 million cash on hand. This impressive total includes $1.48 million raised in less than one month of active fundraising during the quarter. You can read more about his fundraising totals here.
There’s no doubt about it – Hoosiers appreciate results-driven leadership, they’ve witnessed it firsthand, and the numbers prove that they like what they see!
The Convention Results Are In
It was an unconventional convention, but we were excited to have our delegates fully engaged, with 98% of all ballots returned.
Congratulations to Lt. Governor Suzanne Crouch for her unanimous re-nomination. The delegates’ voices have been heard and Todd Rokita will be the Republican nominee for attorney general. We’re looking forward to more Republican victories in November!
Apply for the Indiana Republican Diversity Leadership Series
This week, we were excited to officially announce the Indiana Republican Diversity Leadership Series, a seminar and leadership training program that will provide the preparation and resources needed to increase the engagement of minority Republican leaders in Indiana.
This program is open to Hoosiers of all backgrounds and all ages as we work to bring more historically underrepresented communities into civic leadership.

American Greatness
This week, American greatness was on display. I hope you had the opportunity to tune into the 2020 Republican National Convention, because it was a four-night display of the people, principles and values that make the United States the ""greatest and most exceptional nation in the history of the world.""
I had the honor of attending President Trump's speech last night at the White House -- and I have to tell you, being there in person, surrounded by so many symbols of our history, President Trump provided the perfect commentary on where we've been as a nation -- and where, together, we can go.
""For America, nothing is impossible."" - President Trump
Under the continued leadership of President Trump and Vice President Pence, America will continue to be the home of growing jobs, security at home, the sanctity of life, and the protection of the 2nd Amendment.
Over the last four nights, we heard from everyday Americans like you and me -- small business owners, farmers, teachers, local elected officials, and folks from the heartland of America -- who are better today thanks to President Trump and are proud to join in support to continue this mission.
Are you feeling inspired? I certainly am. If so, I encourage you -- let's make sure that we Keep America Great, and let's ensure more Republican victories this November. Sign up to help us reach our fellow Hoosier voters here at home \-- and most importantly, get ready to vote!
-Chairman Kyle Hupfer
P.S. In addition to the pomp and circumstance in the evenings, the RNC held its official business meetings on Monday in Charlotte, and while there, I was honored to officially nominate Mike Pence to be our Republican nominee for Vice President, and to cast all of Indiana's 58 delegates for President Trump. Watch the videos here and here.
Governor Holcomb's Week That Was
Start Your Engines
On Sunday, Governor Holcomb joined fellow Hoosiers and fans worldwide to watch “The Greatest Spectacle in Racing!""
He started off race day with some media interviews and then watched the race from home with a group of his best friends. It may have looked a little different this year without 300,000 fans in the stands, but the Indy 500 is a Hoosier tradition that is not contained to the Speedway. Across the state Hoosiers gathered safely to watch the race and spend time with friends and family, and that's what it's all about. Congratulations, Takuma Sato, for winning this year's race and becoming a two-time Indy 500 winner!
To stay up to date on the latest developments, please make sure you're following Governor Holcomb on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram!
A Different Kind of Campaign
Earlier this week, Governor Holcomb's reelection campaign launched its second campaign ad of the cycle! The ad titled ""Different Kind of Campaign"" notes the strong bonds that Hoosiers have built with each other during the pandemic. Governor Holcomb is proud of the resiliency that Hoosiers have shown and is optimistic that -- together -- we can build an even stronger Indiana for future generations.
“We’ve bonded together through our shared Hoosier values. We are One Indiana, closer than ever before and this election shouldn’t divide us. We’ll run a campaign people can be proud of.” -Governor Holcomb

Statewide Airwaves
One way you know we're now officially 88 days away from Election Day? Turn on your TV, and there are political ads! We've officially arrived.
This week, Governor Holcomb launched the first ad of Indiana's general election. It's called ""Proud to Be a Hoosier,"" and I think it perfectly encapsulates the unity Hoosiers have displayed over the last few months. As the governor narrates in the ad, ""We're a strong resilient group of Hoosiers, and there's no challenge we can't overcome when we come together.""
And through these difficult times, we've come together under Governor Holcomb's leadership. Usually, Hoosiers don't see their governors lead firsthand, but these aren't usual times. Hoosiers have tuned in and watched every step of the way, and they've seen the tough decisions. Governor Holcomb and Hoosiers statewide have grieved together, celebrated together, and they're continuing to weather this storm together. It's a unique bond.
We're excited to be up on the air with this uniting message. We've purchased seven-figures worth of television ad time, and we're taking our message statewide.
We are One Indiana. And we are One Indiana for All. If you haven't seen it yet, you can watch and share the ad here.

Governor Holcomb's Week That Was
Building One Indiana For All
Yesterday, Governor Holcomb earned the endorsement of the Indiana Manufacturers Association (IMA)! He joined the IMA for the announcement at Major Tool and Machine, a contract manufacturer located in Indianapolis that employs more than 400 Hoosiers.
Governor Holcomb has worked throughout his administration to build the best environment for manufacturers. And as part of his Back on Track Plan, he has worked to help safely jumpstart the state’s economy.
“Indiana’s manufacturers produce everything from cars and RVs to vital PPE. But beyond that, they also produce great Hoosier jobs and opportunity as we continue to build One Indiana for All. I thank the Indiana Manufacturers Association for their support as we continue to support our job creators across the state.” – Gov. Holcomb
As Governor Holcomb continues building One Indiana for all, he is dedicated to keeping Indiana the top state in the nation for manufacturing.
Earlier this week, Governor Holcomb also announced measures to support Hoosier housing stability as the moratorium on evictions and foreclosures ends on August 14.
* The Indiana Rental Assistance Program is available for Hoosier renters who have lost income because of the pandemic, are having trouble paying rent and face eviction. For more information and to apply, Hoosiers outside of Marion County can check here. Hoosiers in Marion County can check here.
* The Indiana Foreclosure Prevention Network is for Hoosiers who are struggling with mortgage payments due to involuntary employment-related financial hardship. Hoosiers at risk of foreclosure can seek assistance through Indiana’s Hardest Hit Fund. To apply, check here.
* The Settlement Facilitation Program for Landlords and Tenants this new program through the Indiana Office of Judicial Administration will help tenants and landlords reach agreements in eviction lawsuits by using a neutral third party facilitator. If an agreement is reached, the dispute and any further court action is ended.
The Indiana Housing and Community Development Authority has also built a COVID-19 resource page that is continually updated as their housing assistance programs become available and are updated. Check it out here.

Watch Governor Holcomb’s First 2020 Ad
Governor Holcomb launched his first TV ad of 2020 this week, backed by a seven-figure ad buy. The ad, titled ""Proud to be a Hoosier,"" highlights Hoosiers’ resiliency through the pandemic, sharing a message of unity as Governor Holcomb continues his work of building One Indiana for All
“We were reminded what we always knew about Indiana, and that’s we're a strong, resilient group of Hoosiers, and there’s no challenge we can’t overcome when we come together, and we’re reminded of that fact every single day…We are One Indiana. And we are One Indiana for All,” said Governor Holcomb

Todd Rokita Will Protect Our Elections & Our 2nd Amendment
Our attorney general nominee, Todd Rokita, has a track record of standing up to the liberal elite and protecting our 2nd Amendment rights. That’s why this week when the New York attorney general announced that she’s filing a lawsuit to dissolve and eliminate the NRA, Todd Rokita spoke out.
""I have always, and will always, stand up and defend our constitutional 2nd Amendment Rights. Period. Instead of an agenda attacking our constitutional rights, these liberal attorney generals should be focused on restoring the rule of law in our country."" - Todd Rokita
As attorney general, Todd Rokita will always stand up for and defend Hoosiers' 2nd amendment rights.
But it doesn't just stop at the 2nd Amendment. As the leader behind Indiana's first-in-the-nation voter ID law, Todd Rokita will also work to help continue safeguarding our elections! Listen to this interview he did this week on SiriusXM radio!

Alex,
Last week, we emailed you saying that this is an all-hands-on-deck election if we want to stop the Dems in Indiana. I just checked the list of our online donors from the last few days, and I didn’t see your name.
We’ve set aggressive goals this year, Alex, in grassroots voter outreach. But in order to reach those goals, we need to keep on pace with a donation from you by midnight tonight.
End-of-Month Fundraising Status
Email: [[EMAIL_REDACTED]]
Status: PENDING
Suggested Contribution: $25
Nancy Pelosi and her cronies are trying to expand their hold on Congress, and Indiana is on the frontlines of this battle. People like Victoria Spartz in the Fifth District are fighting for open seat elections and we can’t afford to give those seats up to the Democrats.
We set an aggressive grassroots goal because it’s what we will need to secure victory in November for Victoria and our local Republicans up and down the ticket – and I’m counting on you to help us reach it with your support.
Help us fight back across the state by chipping in $5, $10, $25, $50, $100, $250, or what you can now!
Thanks for your support,
Kyle Hupfer
P.S. There are only HOURS to go until midnight tonight, and – as we told you last week – it’s going to take all hands on deck to stop the Dems. Make a secure contribution right now, click or tap here.

Full Video: Watch the 2020 Indiana Republican State Convention
A Little Good News
Over the last few months, it’s sometimes felt like cancellations, restrictions and somber news have overwhelmed our lives as we’ve come to adapt to life during COVID-19. And while we’re still very much living through this pandemic, there have been a few bright spots of good news this last week that have me feeling optimistic about the future of our state – and I hope they’ll leave you feeling good, too.
First, last weekend your Indiana Republican Party had our first Super Saturday where we’ve spoken to Hoosiers by going door to door. We did it by staying socially distanced, and we wore our masks. I’m excited that we can start getting out again to talk with and listen to voters in person again.
Next, this week state convention ballots officially started to hit delegates’ mailboxes. While it’s disappointing that we couldn’t hold our convention in person, I’m still so excited to see this voting in action.
And finally, Governor Holcomb shared some really encouraging economic numbers this week. Indiana unemployment rates have dropped below the national average, while our labor participation rates are moving above the national average! He talks about it more in this video.
That’s while home sales are currently on pace to beat last year’s sales, and while single-family home building permits are stronger so far in 2020 than they were through this point of 2019.
I’m so proud of Governor Holcomb’s work leading our state, I’m proud of our progress, and I can’t wait to see what’s next!
\- Chairman Kyle Hupfer
Governor Holcomb's Week That Was
Indiana: Back on Track
Indiana is getting back on track! Our unemployment rate has dropped below the national average, and more Hoosiers are returning to work. But Governor Holcomb knows that there are still Hoosiers who are struggling.
That's why he's continuing his work on President Donald Trump's American Workforce Policy Advisory Board, which met today at the White House. Here's what he had to say about his work on this critical board that's working to help Americans build their skills for high-wage, in-demand jobs:
“Now more than ever as Indiana and the country grapple with the economic impacts of COVID-19, I remain focused on investing in people and their potential. I‘m so pleased to partner with the Administration and our nation’s top leaders on the American Workforce Policy Advisory Board to share Hoosier successes and develop a strategy to empower the American workforce to better meet today’s challenges.”
To learn more about Governor Holcomb's workforce development initiative, Next Level Jobs, click here.
And while many Hoosiers are struggling, Governor Holcomb is also putting federal CARES Act funding to work for Hoosiers who are having trouble paying their rent due to COVID-19.
The Indiana COVID-19 Rental Assistance Program will provide stability for 12,000 Hoosier households:
* Provides up to $500 per month for four months in rental assistance (a maximum of $2,000 in assistance) for those unable to pay rent due to COVID-19
* Assistance is available in 91 counties (Marion County will administer its own program with CARES Act funds)
* The state will make the rent payments directly to the landlord
Applications for assistance open on July 13. To learn more about qualifications and to appy, visit [[URL REDACTED]] now.
Super Saturday was Super!
Thank you to all of our grassroots volunteers for your work last weekend during another very successful Super Saturday! We were excited to talk with Hoosiers across the state about the results Republicans like President Trump, Governor Holcomb and our Congressional leaders are delivering every day.
Interested in helping elect more Republicans in 2020? Sign-up here and we'll get you plugged in for our next Super Saturday.
State Convention Voting is On!

Welcome to the General Election
This week, Indiana held its primary election. We now officially have most of our nominees who will represent our party and secure more victories up and down the ballot this November.
Welcome to the general election!
And in less than two weeks, I’m excited that we’ll have our Indiana Republican State Convention, which will finalize our ticket by officially nominating our candidates for Lt. Governor and Attorney General. While I’m still disappointed we won’t all be together, I’m looking forward to putting our Party of Purpose on full display to a statewide audience through a TV broadcast and livestream.
Here at your Indiana Republican Party, we’re in full preparation mode for holding your state convention. As you know, the live broadcast will be on June 18 at 5:30 p.m. ET/4:30 p.m. CT. It’ll be aired by WISH-TV, and its statewide news partners. It’ll also be livestreamed, and available on our website for viewing after the event.
But new this week, we released a video for our delegates, explaining in detail how voting will work this year. We don’t want there to be any confusion, so please take a few minutes to watch this video. It takes you through when you’ll get your ballot in the mail, how rounds of voting will work, and how your votes will be counted.
And also don’t forget, if you’ve been elected or appointed to serve as a delegate, your deadline to pay your delegate fee is Tuesday, June 9. We’ve got all of this information – including the link to pay your delegate fees – updated at [[URL REDACTED]]
It’s certainly an unusual year, but together, I know our hard work will earn Republicans more wins and more opportunities to continue to lead our state and our communities.
#BackonTrack,

Governor Holcomb's Week That Was
We Don't Have More Time or Lives to Lose
Over the past week, many Hoosiers have joined in the nationwide protests of the death of George Floyd. Governor Holcomb stands with those who are peacefully exercising their first amendment right, while he condemns unnecessary and tragic violence and destruction.
Watch his full remarks on this important topic from Monday here.
“I implore every Hoosier… to use your breath and your will in efforts to bridge, not divide. Violence in the streets makes progress harder… and sets us back from forming that more perfect union.”
In Indiana, we’ve made progress on supporting Hoosiers from diverse backgrounds, including passing Indiana’s first ever hate crimes law protecting 6.7 million Hoosiers, launching free training for in-demand jobs, and providing resources to address infant mortality in Indiana’s hardest hit areas.
But we’re not done yet. We must create a to-do list, with action steps including:
* Better healthcare access
* Affordable housing
* Educational opportunity
* Job training and placement
* Urban economic development
* Criminal justice reform
""George Floyd’s final words ‘I can’t breathe’ haunts and should forever remind us that every breathe that we take… that we have left should be devoted to making sure what happened to Mr. Floyd never happens again. We must harness, not squander, the energy generated in the aftermath of the Floyd injustice.”
Governor Holcomb is dedicated to creating an inclusive state that works for all Hoosiers and upholds the values of our great country. We have brighter days ahead, but it is going to take all of us working together to get there.
2020 Indiana Republican State Convention
Congratulations to all delegates to the state convention elected on Tuesday!
Our 2020 Indiana Republican State Convention is now less than two weeks away. For the first time in state history, we’ll be broadcasting our convention LIVE on TV and on the internet.

For more information, including a new video explaining voting procedures, visit [[URL REDACTED]]
Congratulations, Primary Winners!
Congratulations to all Hoosier Republicans who threw their hats into the ring to run for office this primary, and congratulations to all of our new Republican nominees. Together, we’ll work hard to secure more Republican victories up and down the ballot the November.

Indiana: Best in the Midwest for Business
It’s official (again!). This week, Chief Executive magazine ranked Indiana as having the best business climate in the Midwest and the fifth-best business climate in the nation. With this strong foundation built by our Republican leaders, Indiana is well-positioned to continue recovering from COVID-19 and keep getting back on track!
\--> Check out the full ranking here! <\--
We're Bouncing Back
As states and businesses across the country have begun their phased reopening, the economy is beginning to recover! The U.S. economy gained 2.5 million jobs in May and the unemployment rate dropped to 13.3 percent, down from 14.7 percent in April, according to the monthly employment report released Friday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics!
""We're going to be back higher next year than ever before."" -President Donald Trump
After these numbers were released, the Dow Jones Industrial Average also rose by almost 800 points in premarket activity! Investors have begun to train their focus on the nation's reopening and positive signs of recovery.
“This recovery begins today. We’re going to do whatever it takes to get the American people through this pandemic.” -Vice President Mike Pence

Never Forget
Nearly two decades ago, our nation experienced horrific violence and tragedy -- and also remarkable unity. Our country was attacked, but we came together stronger.
I'll never forget the events of September 11, 2001. I'll never forget watching on television and seeing the photos of our American heroes -- our police, our firefighters, our EMTs -- running toward the falling buildings, directly toward danger. They did it because it was their job, because of their duty. Protect and serve.
I'll never forget the victims. I'll never forget the brave men and women who signed up to serve in our nation's armed forces. And I'll never forget those who didn't come home.
I'll never forget. I remember. And I hope you'll remember as well.

Governor Holcomb's Week That Was
Indiana: Getting Back on Track
As Indiana continues getting back on track, Governor Holcomb has some good news. Earlier this week he announced that by October 1, Indiana will gain a total of 95 new COVID-19 testing sites, where testing will be free. Testing sites are spread across 76 counties, with more than a dozen sites opening last week and 22 more slated to open by the end of this week. Information about new testing sites will be available HERE as sites open.
Why is this a big deal?
* As Governor Holcomb says, it's all about teamwork. And this additional testing capacity wouldn’t be possible without partnerships with communities – and between communities, as local health departments work hard to keep their residents healthy.
* As testing capacity continues to expand, more Hoosiers can easily get tested – and that means we can continue to slow the spread, and that means we can continue to keep our state open!
Together, your actions are making the difference, and we see it all across the state. Keep up the good work, and if you feel sick, check out one of Indiana's many new COVID-19 testing sites here.
To stay up to date on the latest developments, please make sure you're following Governor Holcomb on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram!

New Ad: Gov. Holcomb is Bridging the Digital Divide
on Monday, Governor Holcomb's campaign launched a new TV ad. The ad is focused on Governor Holcomb's leadership to bridge Indiana's digital divide.
Governor Holcomb is leading the largest ever investment in rural broadband through his Next Level Connections Broadband Grant program. Through $100 million in matching grants, Indiana is making a historic investment in broadband infrastructure that's expanding affordable, high-speed internet to thousands of Hoosiers were previously unserved or underserved.
“When I became governor, we focused on finding solutions. We devoted $100 million and then partnered with local providers connecting communities, connecting people to the technology they needed, prioritized making One Indiana for All."" -Governor Holcomb

Endorsement Alert:
Indiana Fraternal Order of Police Endorses Governor Holcomb!
The Indiana State Fraternal Order of Police (FOP) today announced their endorsement of Governor Eric Holcomb for a second term. This is the organization’s first endorsement of a Republican in a governor’s race since 2008.
“Indiana’s law enforcement officers put their lives on a thin line blue line daily, selflessly dropping everything whenever duty calls,” said Governor Holcomb. “They spring into action, putting themselves into harm’s way – and as Hoosiers, we are forever grateful. I’m committed to standing with our law enforcement, now, and always.”
Governor Holcomb actively supports Indiana’s brave law enforcement and public safety officers who keep Hoosiers safe throughout the state, having already earned the endorsements of the Indiana State Police Alliance and the Indiana Professional Firefighters PAC.

Alex,
Top-name liberals are quickly trying to tip the congressional race in our 5th District from “toss-up” to “Democrat,” and I need your help NOW before it’s too late!
Earlier this month, Barack Obama endorsed my opponent in this battleground race, Christina Hale. Nancy Pelosi, Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris and Pete Buttigieg have thrown their weight behind her, too!
That means my Democratic opponent is backed by the full weight of the liberal money machine, and the deep-pocketed leftist donors that have a habit of stealing elections from principled conservatives.
My campaign relies almost solely on you — the hardworking men and women of America who are just trying to do a good day’s work for a decent wage to support their families.
These are the people who will be hurt the most by the Democrats’ socialist agenda, and the people whose rights and freedoms I vow to protect in Congress.
Will you please chip in what you can now to help me fight the liberal machine in Indiana?

It’s obvious that the DC Democrats are scared they are going to lose big in 2020 if they are going after the heartland so hard. We have to fight back just as hard to keep this seat RED and win back our majority in the House.

Alex,
The Supreme Court confirmation hearings for our fellow Hoosier, Judge Amy Coney Barrett, are underway.
By nominating Judge Barrett, President Donald Trump is fulfilling his constitutional duty and following this week's confirmation hearing for Judge Barrett, there should be no question of her qualifications to serve on the Supreme Court. Throughout each step of her career, Judge Barrett has won the admiration and respect of peers across the ideological spectrum.

Judge Barrett is fully qualified to serve on our nation's highest court, but Democrats will stop at nothing to try to discredit her nomination. The media and Democrats have even stooped so low as to attack her family and faith!
That’s why we’re sending you this note: Will you help us make sure that fellow Hoosier Amy Coney Barrett is nominated to the Supreme Court by donating $5, $10, $25, $50 or $100 today?

It is the duty of President Donald Trump and the Senate to fill a Supreme Court seat vacancy. We know that Hoosier Republicans will stand behind President Trump and Senate Republicans as they fulfill their constitutional responsibilities.

Alex,
We have a battleground race happening right here in Indiana. The 5th District is up for grabs, and the Dems have their sights set on taking it.
In fact, Elizabeth Warren just thew her weight behind the Democrat nominee. You remember Elizabeth Warren – the failed Dem presidential nominee who wanted to raise our taxes, destroy the American health care system, and reverse the economic momentum our nation saw before the pandemic hit.
This is an election of national importance here in Indiana.
The Dems are pouring buckets of outside special interest money into this race because they are terrified of losing their House majority. And they know that they don’t have a chance of winning on their own merit.
We’re going to have to fight fire with fire on this one. We have a fantastic conservative candidate running, Victoria Spartz, who will fight for all Hoosiers in Congress.
Will you chip in what you can now to help Victoria Spartz win BIG in Indiana’s 5th this November?
We’re adding the name of every person who contributes before the end of the month to a special donor wall. Will you cement your name in Hoosier history by donating now?
Add your name NOW! >>
Even just a few dollars helps us with our grassroots efforts to get the vote out and get conservatives to the polls in 2020.
Winning this seat is going to get us a huge step closer to winning back the House majority, and evicting Nancy Pelosi from the Speaker’s Office once and for all.
Donate $3 for Indiana's 5th!
Donate $6 for Indiana's 5th!
Donate $10 for Indiana's 5th!
Donate $20.20 for Indiana's 5th!
Donate $50 for Indiana's 5th!
Donate $100 for Indiana's 5th!
Donate $250 for Indiana's 5th!
We’re counting on you to help us get Victoria across the finish line in 2020. She’s a true conservative who will fight for Hoosiers and all Americans against the liberals’ radical leftist agenda in Congress.
Thanks for your support,

Alex,
There’s a battle waging in the 5th District. It’s an open seat in a historically red district, but the Democrats are swinging HARD to win this one.
Nancy Pelosi has unleashed her liberal money machine, and Barack Obama has even endorsed the Democratic candidate. We need to fight back now to support conservative rock star Victoria Spartz in this race and keep this seat RED!
KEEP INDIANA RED!
We don’t rely on deep-pocketed liberal donors from California and New York to fund our get-out-the-vote efforts. Our candidates like Victoria rely almost solely on supporters like you — the hardworking men and women of America who are just trying to do a good day’s work for a decent wage to support their families.
These are the people who will be hurt the most by the Democrats’ socialist agenda, and the people whose rights and freedoms we need to protect in Congress.
Will you please chip in what you can now to help us fight the liberal machine in Indiana?
DONATE $5 TO DEFEAT THE DEMS >>
DONATE $15 TO DEFEAT THE DEMS >>
DONATE $35 TO DEFEAT THE DEMS >>
DONATE $50 TO DEFEAT THE DEMS >>
The left is terrified of losing their grip on the House, so they are pouring every resource they have into winning this seat here in Indiana. It shows how scared they really are if they are going after the heartland so intently.
Together, let’s keep Nany Pelosi away from Indiana!
There has never been a better time to support a conservative like Victoria. Please help us fight back against Nancy Pelosi and the rest of the radical left by making a donation today.
Thanks for your support,
Kyle Hupfer

Prudent Next Step
Let’s take a moment to remember our thoughts when we were all hunkered down. Many of us were willing to do anything to get our economy open again (me included). Well, there’s something easy we can all do that could help slow the spread of COVID-19: Wear A Mask.
Here are the facts today: For two straight days, Indiana has reported our largest single-day spikes in COVID-19 cases (954 yesterday and 1,011 today) since the pandemic began. We’re seeing the rate of positive cases increase (3.6% a month ago to 7% 7-day average today), and hospitalizations climb (about 600 a day at the end of June, about 800 a day now).
We all want to keep our loved ones safe, while also keeping our economy getting back on track. We don’t want to have to hunker down again, and we don’t want to go backwards.
Today, to keep our economy open, we must limit the spread of COVID-19. And to do that, we have a tool at our disposal – wearing a face mask. Other states (including many led, like Indiana, by conservative governors) have had to take steps backward in their reopening plans. Governor Holcomb doesn’t want that.
There are no easy decisions left now during this pandemic. Let’s continue to be able to go to work and shop. Let’s send our kids to school and live our lives.
If just a few months ago, you were calling to keep our economy open, please join me in wearing a mask. You don’t have to love it, but you can be part of the solution.
\- Chairman Kyle Hupfer
Governor Holcomb's Week That Was
More Hoosier Jobs Are On The Way!
One of Governor Holcomb's biggest priorities is bringing more great jobs and opportunities to all Hoosiers. This week, he was on hand to celebrate the expansion of Hoosier family-owned Palmer Trucks and the groundbreaking of a new Subaru production plant in Lafayette!
On Tuesday, Governor Holcomb joined executives from Palmer Trucks, a third generation, family-owned truck sales, parts and service provider, as the company announced plans to expand its operations in Central Indiana! This $17 million expansion will create up to 220 new jobs for Hoosiers.
""With homegrown Hoosier companies like Palmer Trucks at the wheel, Indiana will continue to position our state for long-term economic stabilization and growth."" - Gov. Holcomb
On Thursday, Governor Holcomb joined executives from Subaru of Indiana Automotive to break ground on the company's $158 million Lafayette expansion. To support this growth, the company plans to create up to 350 new jobs for Hoosiers. Subaru is one of more than 300 Japanese businesses in Indiana that together employ more than 67,230 Hoosiers.
“For nearly 35 years, Subaru of America has been an important partner in supporting Indiana's economy and creating great career opportunities in the community.” - Gov. Holcomb
To stay up to date on the latest developments, please make sure you're following Governor Holcomb on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram!
Vice President Mike Pence Thanks Governor Holcomb
Earlier today, Vice President Mike Pence was in Indiana, and he had a message for Hoosiers:
“Wearing a mask wherever state or local health officials indicate that it’s appropriate or when social distancing is not possible is how we keep Indiana opening up.”
“Governor, I want everyone in this state to know the President and I and our entire team fully support your leadership and the steps you’ve taken in Indiana to keep this state on the right track”
Click here to watch the video and hear what Vice President Pence had to say!
Mask Up Hoosiers!
Governor Holcomb announced that starting this Monday, Hoosiers will need to mask up in certain situations in order to combat the state's rise in COVID-19.
This includes while inside a business, a public building, or public space that is open to the public, while using public transit, or while you're not able to socially distance outside.
It doesn't include private offices/workspace, or in many situations where social distancing can be achieved. It also excludes Hoosiers with health conditions that would prevent wearing a mask, Hoosiers who are eating, and Hoosiers attending religious services. Read the full executive order here for full guidelines and exemptions.
Compliance will focus on continuing to remind Hoosiers about the importance of wearing face coverings.
Read the full order here.
Welcome Home, Vice President Pence!
It's always great to welcome home Indiana's own Vice President Mike Pence! As we continue to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, he was in Indiana today for a roundtable discussion with Governor Holcomb and education leaders at Marian University to discuss a safe reopening of schools.
Thank you, Vice President Pence, for your leadership during this challenging time!
Last Saturday Was Super!
Thanks to every volunteer across Indiana who was out in the heat last weekend talking to Hoosiers as part of our Super Saturday! This is crucial work that will make a big difference for our entire Republican team – led by our statewide candidates President Trump, Vice President Pence, Governor Holcomb, Lt. Governor Crouch, and attorney general nominee Todd Rokita!

Historic Approval
Throughout these last few months, Governor Holcomb has been talking with Hoosiers directly. On an almost daily basis, he's shared updates about actions he's taken to protect Hoosiers' health and how he's worked to get our state safely back on track.
In this crisis situation, there’s been a connection built between an elected official and his constituency like we’ve never seen. We did a poll last week to see what Hoosiers were thinking, and they told us.
They said that 83% percent approve of the governor’s response to the pandemic and 79% approval of his overall job performance. It's consistent with numbers we've seen from the Washington Post poll released last week.
That support then carries over to November. A head-to-head match-up favors Governor Holcomb by a landslide margin. Sixty-four percent support the governor with only 21% supporting the presumptive Democrat nominee.
Governor Holcomb knows that when you have the right policies, the politics will take care of themselves. That’s why he’ll continue to be laser-focused on guiding our state through the pandemic and ensuring we come roaring back better than ever before.
#BackonTrack,
\- Chairman Kyle Hupfer
Governor Holcomb's Week That Was
Back on Track:
Mental Health & Scientific Testing
As we continue our state's phased reopening, most of Indiana is in Phase 3 of Indiana's Back on Track plan! And as we continue Indiana's phased, safety-focused reopening, Governor Holcomb wants to make sure Hoosiers are continuing to take care of the full sphere of their health.
Check out some resources he highlighted this week:
* Telehealth services: Claims for mental health services have remained at a steady rate compared to pre-pandemic rates. And that’s because we’re seeing an increase in services provided through telehealth.
* Naloxone & Substance Abuse Treatment: Indiana is providing more naloxone kits directly to the public – one of the only tools available to reverse an overdose. And remember – treatment is available. Just call 211 or visit [[URL REDACTED]] to get connected to help.
* Domestic Violence and Suicide Prevention Hotlines: Resources are available if you’re in a bad situation at home or have thoughts of suicide. Call the Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-779-7233 or the Suicide Crisis Line at 1-800-273-TALK.
* Online Mental Health Tools: Last month, Indiana unveiled a new website, [[URL REDACTED]], that’s putting free mental health resources at Hoosiers’ fingertips. And so far, there have already been more than 10,000 clicks on the website’s resources.
Starting next week, Phase 2 of Indiana’s scientific study of the spread of COVID-19 across our state is beginning! If you get a text message or a postcard inviting you to participate, please respond. Your response helps guide Indiana’s data-driven reopening and informs Governor Holcomb's decisions. This is just another way we can be #INThisTogether and help our communities.
To stay up to date on the latest developments, please make sure you're following Governor Holcomb on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram!
Thank you to every Hoosier who is doing his or her part to stop the spread of the coronavirus and flatten the curve. We're #INThisTogether, and we're getting #BackOnTrack!
Thank you, President Trump!
Huge news! Just yesterday, President Donald Trump announced that as part of the CARES Act, the U.S. Department of Transportation was investing $177.5 million into Indiana's infrastructure. This encompasses a $100 million investment into the South Shore Line in Northwest Indiana and a $77.5 million investment into the IndyGo Purple Line in Marion County.
Thank you, President Trump!
Primary Day is Tuesday
Primary Day is this Tuesday! Just a few things to know:
* Polls are open from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Tuesday. Please wear a mask when you go to vote.
* Early voting is open through Monday, June 1.
* If you requested an absentee ballot, make sure it's received by your local clerk or Board of Elections by 12 p.m. on Tuesday.

2020 Indiana Republican Convention Goes Virtual
Earlier this month we announced that unfortunately, due to restrictions because of COVID-19, this year's 2020 Indiana Republican State Convention would be held virtually.
The Indiana Republican State Committee unanimously approved temporary rules that will allow us to hold a virtual contention and mail-in voting, which will mirror many aspects of our in-person conventions, ensuring all delegates will be able to vote.
A few important dates:
June 2 – Indiana Primary (delegates will be elected)
June 22 – Approximate date that delegates will receive ballots from a third-party vendor
July 9 – Deadline for a delegate’s ballot to be received by the third-party accounting firm
July 10 – Ballots will be counted with watchers present, and winners will be announced
More updates will continue to be provided. For more information, read Chairman Hupfer’s full letter here or watch his video here.

The Indiana Republican Party is Indiana’s only Party of Purpose. As Governor Eric Holcomb says, our focus is on “people, people, people.” When we serve people, we are serving with purpose!

"Would Weinzapfel defend your rights? Not on voting. Rokita will! View this email in your browser
Alex,
Liberal Democrat Attorney General nominee Jonathan Weinzapfel supports Election Day chaos. Todd Rokita wants to protect your ballot!
Just yesterday, a federal judge ruled that the State of Indiana is unable to administer our own elections. Instead of maintaining the practice of having all absentee ballots returned on Election Day, a judge decided that ballots can trickle in for several days afterwards, delaying the outcome and possibly opening vote counting to nefarious activity.
And where does liberal Jonathan Weinzapfel stand on this?
As Attorney General, Weinzapfel would allow such activist rulings to occur without defending Hoosiers. He supports this decision to arbitrarily extend Election Day and delay vote counting.
Thankfully, the Attorney General’s Office is fighting this ruling, something, if elected, Todd Rokita would do as well. We know where liberal Jonathan Weinzapfel stands. He wouldn’t lift a finger.
Defend Your Rights: Support Todd Rokita for Attorney General!
If Jonathan Weinzapfel won’t defend your fundamental voting rights, what other laws will he not defend?
* Will he defend the sanctity of life?
* Will he defend your Second Amendment Rights?
* Will he defend our brave men and women in law enforcement?
It’s clear: Jonathan Weinzapfel will outsource legislative duties to an activist judicial branch. That’s not how our system was designed and not what Hoosiers want in an Attorney General.
If you want to make sure we elect Todd Rokita this Novemebr -- and stop Weinzapfel and his liberal agenda in its tracks -- please consider donating $10, $25, $50 or $100 today.
We need an Attorney General who will vigorously defend our elections, our laws, and our rights.
Todd Rokita will be that Attorney General.

Alex,
I won’t mince words. Indiana could determine where control lands in the U.S. House of Representatives – and whether we can finally kick Nancy Pelosi out of the Speaker’s chair once and for all.
I know that my race in the 5th District could be the decision-maker, and I’m up for this challenge.
Our state Republican chairman, Kyle Hupfer, reached out to me and asked how Hoosiers can help in my battleground race.
My answer was simple: We need proper resources to fund a strong grassroots campaign.
The Democrats are determined to keep their House majority, but we can’t let that happen. We must take it back and we must win this seat.
Kyle told me that his grassroots team (which includes you!) has a track record of winning across the state, so that’s why I’m reaching out to you. Can you help by chipping in what you can now?

We have an important deadline coming up at midnight on June 30. It’s the end-of-quarter fundraising reporting deadline, and the funds we raise will determine our budget to reach voters leading up to the 2020 elections.

We can’t let the socialist Democrats win.

Alex,
2020 is shaping up to be a tumultuous year.
It’s never been clearer that we need to remove Nancy Pelosi from the Speaker’s office for her failed leadership.
We have a special message from Senator Todd Young about our plan to make that happen:
Are you ready to help us fire Speaker Pelosi once and for all?
We have a battleground race right here in Indiana. Victoria Spartz needs our help to win in the 5th Congressional District if we have any hope of flipping the House RED this November.
With fundraising numbers finalized in our end of quarter report on June 30, we need to make a strong showing to send the message that Hoosiers aren’t going to stand idly by for business as usual in Washington.
Will you please rush a donation of $5, $10, $25, $50, $100, $250, or what you can now, if you agree with Senator Young that it’s time to fire Speaker Pelosi for good?
We’re going to get through this trying time. We’re going to elect a new conservative majority, and flip the House for the GOP.
Your support will be critical to our success in 2020. If you’re able, we hope to have your immediate support today.

95 Days
It may seem hard to believe, but we’re now less than 100 days away from Election Day. And anyone who’s ever been involved with a campaign or a local party knows exactly what’s happening now inside our Indiana GOP headquarters and across the state.
With 95 days to go, we've entered the stretch of long days and hitting big goals. We’re planning and executing for activities, announcements and scheduled events over the next three months, and our grassroots teams are fanned out in ALL 92 counties.
Our Republican statewide ticket of President Trump, Vice President Pence, Governor Holcomb, Lt. Governor Crouch and attorney general nominee Todd Rokita are doing what it takes now to win in November.
Just yesterday, we were excited to announce that Governor Holcomb had earned the endorsement of the Indiana REALTORS PAC and its 19,000 members statewide. In case you’re keeping track, that’s his eighth endorsement so far from a wide range of groups he’s bringing together to continue building One Indiana.
And on Monday, Governor Holcomb’s got another big announcement. I don’t want to spoil it now (you’ll have to wait for Monday), but if you want to hear the news first, click here to sign up for texts from the campaign.
Just 95 days. There’s a lot that’ll happen between now and then, but I know that by working together, we’ll deliver more Republican victories on November 3.

Governor Holcomb's Week That Was
The Hoosier Spirit!
It's been another busy week for Governor Holcomb! Yesterday, he earned the endorsement of the Indiana REALTORS® PAC and attended the Muncie-Delaware Chamber of Commerce lunch.
The Indiana REALTORS® are a statewide trade association with 19,000 members involved in nearly all aspects of real estate. Governor Holcomb has worked to support a robust economy and real estate market across Indiana. As our state gets back on track, Governor Holcomb will continue working with our realtors, and all Hoosiers, to build One Indiana for all.
Governor Holcomb also attended the Muncie-Delaware Chamber of commerce lunch to talk about the Hoosier spirit and how we are in a strong position to bounce back from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Hoosiers are strong and resilient, and there's nothing that we can't overcome when we stand together as One Indiana

Alex,
Earlier today in Charlotte, 336 delegates from every U.S. state and territory came together and made it official -- President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence will be our 2020 Republican nominees for President and Vice President of the United States!
I was honored to be there to officially award Indiana's 58 delegates (watch the video here), and show our Hoosier pride off to the nation -- including yesterday's 104th running of the Indy 500, our basketball legends, our status as the home of Mike Pence, and the fact that Indiana was first on the board on Election Night 2016 for our Trump-Pence team.
I can't wait for November 3, when together we're the FIRST state to deliver victory for President Trump and Vice President Pence!

Alex,
The Democrats are mobilizing big time in Indiana’s 5th Congressional District — one of the most watched congressional races of 2020!
Nancy Pelosi’s liberal machine is pumping money into that district to try to flip this seat blue, and it’s imperative that we stop that from happening.
There is NO WAY we can win back a Republican majority in the House this November if the Dems get their hands on this seat!
If you’re able, will you donate now to help us reach our goal of raising money to fund our 5th District Victory operation?
5th District Victory Operation
Email: [[EMAIL_REDACTED]]
Status: Pending
Suggested Amount: $23.76
Donate >>
With your help, we’ll be ready the minute after the winner is called in the primary – making sure our party’s nominee has the support he or she needs from Day One.
Due to COVID-19, we haven’t been able to do any in-person fundraising events for months, and it’s still unclear when we’ll be able to again. That’s why it’s more important than ever to raise funds online to reach more voters and get them to the polls.
We need to build our war chest to make sure Nancy Pelosi and her ultra-left friends don’t steal this election!
Donate $5 NOW to win a Republican majority >>
Donate $10 NOW to win a Republican majority >>
Donate $25 NOW to win a Republican majority >>
Donate $50 NOW to win a Republican majority >>
Donate $100 NOW to win a Republican majority >>
Donate what you can NOW to win a Republican majority >>
We’re going to get through this, and in November, we’re going to elect another conservative to this important seat.
And if you’re able – your help will make the difference.
Thanks for your support,
Indiana Republican Party

The Final Quarter
We’re in the final quarter of this campaign season. The clock is down to just 11 days. And the future of Indiana – and the nation – is on the line.
I’ve been on the road with Governor Holcomb, and everywhere we go, we’re seeing Hoosiers energized about this election. We’ve got players statewide making a big assist – making calls, knocking on doors, and talking with voters. I can’t thank you all enough. And then we’ve got our MVPs, waiting in lines to cast their votes early for the entire Republican team.
Today, Vice President Mike Pence joined that team of MVPs, casting his vote early in Indianapolis. And that’s after another excellent rally last night in Fort Wayne (you can watch the video here). It’s always an honor to welcome Vice President Pence home!
This weekend, I challenge each of you to make a difference as the clock ticks down on this election. Sign up for a shift here to volunteer for our Republican candidates. Find your polling place and times, and go cast your ballot early. You’ve got the ball – now’s the time to make a play.

Governor Holcomb's Week That Was
Building One Indiana for All
It's been another busy week for Governor Holcomb! He joined executives of Advanced Accelerator Applications to break ground on the company's new Indianapolis facility and participated in Indiana's first gubernatorial debate.
Advanced Accelerator Applications, a pharmaceutical group specializing in the field of nuclear medicine, broke ground on the company's new, $72 million, 60,000-square-foot Indianapolis facility that's bringing new jobs to Indiana. The new facility will significantly expand the company's manufacturing capacity in the U.S. and will feature state-of-the-art, advanced manufacturing technologies. Under Governor Holcomb's leadership, Indiana is continuing to lead the way when it comes to manufacturing critical medical devices!
Governor Holcomb also participated in Indiana's first gubernatorial debate where he clearly outlined his plan for the next four years as he continues building One Indiana for All. He spoke at length about recovering from the pandemic, dropping our infant mortality rate to an all-time low, increasing adoptions, building a record-breaking economy, and bringing huge numbers of jobs to our state. We’re facing a crucial choice in less than two weeks, and it’s never been more important to stay on top of the key issues. If you missed the debate watch a replay here.
""I want to thank every Hoosier watching tonight, as it’s they who helped create such positive, forward momentum over the last four years.” - Governor Eric Holcomb
To stay up to date on the latest developments, please make sure you're following Governor Holcomb on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram!

Big News: Indiana Moves Up in State Tax Climate Ranking
The Tax Foundation, an independent tax policy research organization, updated its State Business Tax Climate Index for 2021. The new rankings have Indiana maintaining its status as the best tax climate in the Midwest. Indiana also moved up in overall ranking to the ninth-best business tax climate in the nation.
“Governor Holcomb and our Republican General Assembly have cut taxes and kept Hoosiers’ overall tax burden low. That why, even during this pandemic, Indiana continues to be a magnet for job creators and investment. Under Governor Holcomb’s steady leadership, Indiana is balancing lives and livelihoods, making our state an even more attractive state for business,”
-Kyle Hupfer, chairman of the Indiana Republican Party
Todd Rokita on the Road
Indiana’s next attorney general, Todd Rokita, has been busy on the road this week talking with Hoosiers across the state.
That’s included attending a Right to Life banquet in Daviess County, talking with Hoosiers before they voted in West Lafayette, attending a Back the Blue rally in Plainfield, and catching up with more Republican friends at a rally in Boone County.
Check out some of the photos above, and even more photos by following Todd Rokita on Facebook!

Revving Up Again
As we head into Labor Day weekend, we're now officially 60 days away from Election Day. And just as campaigns across our state are revving up (and we're staying very busy at your Indiana Republican Party), we're seeing more signs that our nation and state are revving up again, too, with promising economic news.
Nationally, some good news. Under the leadership of President Trump and Vice President Pence, 1.37 million more Americans were on payrolls in August, with the unemployment rate continuing to drop. Read more here.
And here in Indiana, economic development is continuing at rapid speed, with the fundamentals of Indiana's business-friendly environment remaining strong. So far this year, we're already approaching 20,000 job commitments (at high wages!). Indiana's unemployment rate is also dropping and is below the national average.
There's no doubt that we have a long way to go. But thanks to the strong Republican leadership of President Trump, Vice President Pence and Governor Holcomb, we've got a solid foundation, and we're revving up again.
-Chairman Kyle Hupfer
PHOTO: Events are kicking-off again! I had great time yesterday at the Perry-Spencer Republican Picnic, as did Governor Holcomb and Lt. Governor Crouch.
Governor Holcomb's Week That Was
Connecting Hoosiers Every Step of the Way
It’s been another busy week for Governor Holcomb as he's continuing to connect Hoosiers in ALL parts of Indiana -- whether that's in-person or through much-needed high-speed broadband!
This week he joined local leaders to celebrate the completion of another trail as part of his Next Level Trails program (this one in Clarksville in Southern Indiana).
And as part of Governor Holcomb's Next Level Broadband, he announced the program's second round of funding this week totaling $51 million in matching grants for rural broadband infrastructure. In total, the $100 million Next Level Broadband Grant Program is the largest single investment in broadband in our state’s history. Governor Holcomb is bridging the digital divide for Hoosiers and connecting unserved areas to affordable, high-speed broadband.
“This latest round of grants will give more Hoosiers access to more affordable, quality internet regardless of where they live, work or go to school.” -Governor Holcomb
To stay up to date on the latest developments, please make sure you're following Governor Holcomb on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram!

Let's Go Vote
To anyone who's ever put their name on the ballot (and I know that's many of you), you know why this was a BIG week in Indiana. Early voting began on Tuesday, and we're already seeing strong turnout statewide.
To avoid the lines, I’d recommend going to cast you ballot now. Our entire Republican team -- from President Trump to Governor Holcomb to Todd Rokita to your local members of Congress to your state representatives and senators to the local candidates in your county -- all need and would appreciate your support. We’ve put together a website for you to easily find your early voting locations and hours. You can access it here - [[URL REDACTED]]
And another reason why it was a big week in Indiana politics -- our own Hoosier vice president, Mike Pence, debated on the national stage. Vice President Pence made Hoosiers incredibly proud on Wednesday night, and expertly communicated the record of results he and President Trump have delivered the American people. He has done Indiana proud with his leadership of the Coronavirus task force, and I know he’ll continue to make us proud for another four years.
But first, we must vote.
-Chairman Kyle Hupfer

Governor Holcomb's Week That Was
More Hoosier Jobs Are On The Way!
As Governor Holcomb continues to build One Indiana for All, one of his top priorities is bringing more great jobs and opportunities to Hoosiers. On Tuesday, he joined executives from Ohio-based Phillips Tube Group, a welded steel tube manufacturer, to cut the ribbon and celebrate the company's new Richmond facility!
Thanks to our state's business friendly environment, Phillips Tube Group announced plans to establish its first operation in Indiana. The company invested $8.2 million to renovate and equip its new 109,000-square-foot facility in Richmond, with plans to create new Hoosier jobs.
As our state continues getting back on track, Gov. Holcomb is working hard to create new opportunities for Hoosiers.
To stay up to date on the latest developments, please make sure you're following Governor Holcomb on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram!
New Polling in Governor's Race
As early voting begins statewide this week, new internal polling released this week from the Holcomb campaign shows Governor Holcomb defeating his gubernatorial challengers, winning 60% of the vote in a head-to-head matchup. On the ballot, Governor Holcomb leads the Democrat by a 60-21 margin, with the Libertarian receiving 6%.
The poll was conducted between October 4-5 and surveyed 600 likely Hoosier voters throughout the state.
Here are toplines from the poll:
Question: If the election for Governor was held today, and the candidates were Eric Holcomb, the Republican candidate, Woody Myers, the Democratic candidate, or Donald Rainwater, the Libertarian candidate, for whom would you vote?
Eric Holcomb - 60%
Woody Myers - 21%
Donald Rainwater - 6%
Question: Thinking about the job Eric Holcomb is doing as Governor, would you say you approve or disapprove of his performance in office?
Approve - 72%
Disapprove - 20%
Question: Thinking about the way things are going in the state of Indiana, would you say that Indiana is on the right track or the wrong track?
Right Track - 60%
Wrong Track - 31%
Unsure - 9%
The poll, conducted by BK Strategies, surveyed Hoosiers using both landlines and cell phones, and has a margin of error of +/- 4%
Continued Prayers for President Trump
Earlier this week, President Trump returned to the White House and he and First Lady Melania are well on the road to recovery from COVID-19. While almost fully recovered from the virus, we know that the First Family remains in the thoughts and prayers of countless Hoosiers. There’s still time to sign our get well card for the President and First Lady.

Your 2020 Republican Ticket
A week ago today, we counted the votes, and delegates to our 2020 Indiana Republican State Convention selected Todd Rokita to be our Republican nominee for attorney general. And then on Monday we made the voice of our delegates official, as Todd signed the paperwork to put him on your ballot.
We now have your 2020 Indiana Republican statewide ticket, and I have to say, there’s a lot to be excited about going into November. These candidates are all proven leaders who have the vision and drive to continue leading Indiana through these turbulent times.
Nationally, our ticket will be led by President Donald Trump and our own Vice President Mike Pence. Together, they’ve taken on many of our nation’s biggest issues – trade imbalances, national security, growing our economy, etc. And even through this pandemic, President Trump is continuing to deliver, with the new USMCA trade agreement becoming official earlier this month.
Governor Holcomb leads our ticket here at home with a 79% approval rating. Through his leadership, Indiana has seen a coordinated, data-driven response to this pandemic. Over the last three and a half years, Governor Holcomb has helped Indiana attract more than 100,000 new job commitments, fully-funded a 20+ year roads and bridges program and led our state to over $1.6 billion in new education funding.
When it comes to our lieutenant governor, we’ve got the best one in the nation. Lt. Governor Suzanne Crouch is the perfect partner to Governor Holcomb, leading on critical issues from agriculture to supporting Hoosiers with disabilities.
And finally rounding out our statewide ticket, there’s attorney general nominee Todd Rokita. As Secretary of State, Todd helped protect our elections from fraud by instituting the nation’s first voter ID law, and as a member of Congress he was a strong conservative voice protecting the right to life and the 2nd Amendment. As our attorney general, he’ll work to fight for us and protect our rights.
We've got a team of proven leaders on your ballot this November. And it's these leaders who will help Indiana rebound again through this crisis.
\- Chairman Kyle Hupfer

Governor Holcomb's Week That Was
Investments & Endorsements
Jobs announcements and endorsements! It's been a busy week for Governor Holcomb!
Yesterday, Governor Holcomb was on hand to celebrate the opening of MonoSol's new high-tech, 150,000-sq.-ft. production facility in Boone County! This is the company’s fifth location in Indiana, where the company will create more new, high-wage positions for Hoosiers. Since 2017, Indiana has attacted more than 100,000 job commitments like this across the state!
This week, Governor Holcomb also earned the endorsement of the Professional Firefighters Union of Indiana. This is the organization's first gubernatorial endorsement since 2008. Our state's firefighters are always there for us, and Governor Holcomb is dedicated to serving them!
“Our Hoosier firefighters are the original essential workers. No matter the situation – whether it’s floods, tornados, blizzards, earthquakes, or a global pandemic – our firefighters are always there for us. I am profusely grateful for them and their support, and I’ll work to continue to earn that support every single day.” - Gov. Holcomb
And then finally this week, Governor Holcomb announced that as Indiana's rate of COVID-19 test positivity continues to climb, Indiana will remain in Stage 4.5 through at least the end of the month. You can find full details on Stage 4.5 and the Back on Track plan here.
To stay up to date on the latest developments, please make sure you're following Governor Holcomb on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram!
Thank You, Former Speaker Bosma!
Today, former Indiana Speaker of the House Brian Bosma announced that he’ll be officially retiring from the General Assembly at the end of the month. As Indiana’s longest-serving House speaker, his leadership has been instrumental in Indiana’s turnaround from a middle-of-the-pack state to a nationally-recognized leader in balanced budgets and responsible government.
Here’s what Indiana GOP Chairman Kyle Hupfer had to say –
“Although we’ve known this day was coming, that doesn’t make it any less bittersweet. Brian Bosma’s positive impact on Indiana simply cannot be overstated. Even now, as we navigate our way through a global pandemic, Brian’s leadership and fiscal stewardship has Indiana in a strong position to weather this storm. Congratulations, Brian, on a well-earned retirement from the General Assembly. Our thanks to you and Cheryl for your decades of service to our state.”
Fiscal Responsibility Leads Indiana Through Crisis
Raise your hand if you can remember multiple times when Democrats said Indiana should spend the state’s budget surplus for any number of issues…
Well, this week, Hoosiers can be thankful for responsible Republican leadership that built up Indiana’s savings for a rainy day. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the state faced a $900 million budget shortfall at the close of the fiscal year. Thankfully, Indiana has been able to responsibly maintain essential services to Hoosiers during this difficult time – all without going into the red.
That’s largely due to some budget reversions, federal assistance…and the use of our surplus that was built by our fiscally responsible Republican leaders for a rainy day like this. While our surplus now stands at a lower total of $1.4 billion, we’re so thankful to live in a state that remains stable even through a crisis. That's Republican leadership at work.

"The AG of New York is using the NRA. Todd Rokita will be an attorney general that fights to protect your rights, not take them away.  View this email in your browser
Alex,
Earlier this week we received a stark reminder of just how important a state’s attorney general’s office is and why we must keep it Republican in Indiana by electing Todd Rokita.
The attorney general of New York, to burnish her radical, far-left resume, is using the power of her office to sue the largest pro-Second Amendment organization in the country, the National Rifle Association. Her goal is the total elimination of this organization.
While this lawsuit is occurring in New York, it is a threat to responsible gun owners everywhere. It also begs the question:
Does Democrat Jonathan Weinzapfel support this attack on the Second Amendment?
This is what’s on the line in this race and this is exactly why we need to elect Todd Rokita as Indiana’s next Attorney General.
\--> Donate NOW to ELECT an AG to fight for our rights! <\--
Todd will be an attorney general that fights to protect your rights, not take them away.
Jonathan Weinzapfel has a far-left voting record and only has a “C” rating on gun rights from the NRA.
Does Weinzapfel want Indiana to follow New York? Will he use the office to attack the Second Amendment, dissolve the NRA, and leave you unable to hunt and protect your family?
Todd Rokita has always—and will always—stand up and defend your constitutional rights. Liberal attorneys general, like the one in New York and the type Weinzapfel would be, can’t be trusted to do the same.
The choice is clear.
Thank you,
-Your Indiana Republican Party

"Gov. Eric Holcomb’s word isn’t worth the paper it’s written on. In his State of the State speech tonight, he talked about teacher pay and health care costs as if they’re something he will fix if he’s reelected.
SPOILER ALERT: they’re not. He’s spent the last three years with a supermajority in both the House and the Senate, and we’ve seen no action from this do-nothing governor. Words are one thing. But actions matter.
Someone is benefitting from Holcomb’s leadership, the well-off and well-connected. Under Holcomb’s Party, the TOP 1% saw a TAX CUT of $2,446. The BOTTOM 60% of the middle class and working families saw an average TAX HIKE of $36.
Chip in $20 to show Holcomb and his cronies, we’re not falling for their empty promises.
Let’s not beat around the bush, Holcomb is building a war chest for 2020.
While we wait for a nominee, we’re the only organization doing the groundwork to beat him. So when you contribute to the Indiana Democratic Party, you’re helping us mobilize volunteers, inform voters, train candidates, and gear up to defeat Eric Holcomb in 2020.
Every penny matters. If we want accountable leadership that takes action and works for working Hoosiers and not the well-off or well-connected, we need your help.

Chip in $20.20 to help us flip the 5th.
We've known all along that this was a battleground race for Hoosier Democrats, but now national press and outside organizations are taking notice.
But so are Republicans.
Indiana Republicans are blasting out fundraising emails and calling in their big-money allies to fundraise before it's too late. They are going to try to buy this race.
Let's be clear: this race is one of the most flippable districts in the country. We can win as long as we don't let Republicans buy it.
Contribute $13 to help offset the GOP's big-money advantage.
TONIGHT at MIDNIGHT marks our second-quarter fundraising deadline, and we're just $4,833 away from reaching our goal.
Will you give $4.80 to help us reach our goal and get out the vote in the 5th?
By investing now, we can send a strong signal to Republicans and all the eyes focused on this race: we're going all out. The stronger the fiscal position we show in Q2, the more momentum we build.
Every dollar counts!

"Team, let’s not mince words: this Wednesday marks the most critical point yet: our final FEC deadline before the election. Your investments in the next three days will determine our success on November 3.
There's never been a better time to chip in your first $3 to our 2020 Safe Voting Initiative.
Why does this deadline matter? The GOP uses our public fundraising reports to evaluate our campaign.
On our last deadline, the GOP outraised us by $1k and even though we’re outpolling them, they’re claiming a victory. This narrative has the power to tip the election in their favor and undermine all of our hard work.
We need to raise another $5k by MIDNIGHT on Wednesday to ensure their dark-money-backed scheme doesn’t outrun our people-powered campaign. Can you give your first $3, or whatever you can, to help us get this done?

"MIDNIGHT tomorrow marks our final, and most important, FEC deadline before the election. This is what the media and our opponents will use to evaluate the success of our campaign.
Right now, we’re just $4k short of reaching our goal. Friend, you have the power to flip the switch on the story the GOP is spinning. That’s why I’m asking you to contribute your first $7 to our 2020 Safe Voting Initiative.
On our last deadline, they outraised us by just $1k. Then, they told their supporters we couldn’t catch up. We need to show the GOP that our grassroots movement is stronger than their special interest-backed campaign.
I’m worried that if we don’t make this deadline, they’ll claim another victory and tip this election against the voice of the people. We need your help to make sure that doesn’t happen.

"Curtis Hill is the worst Attorney General in Indiana's history. He lost his law license, committed criminal battery, and has been under fire for sexual misconduct with multiple women. Hill is dedicated to taking away over 560,000 Hoosiers’ health care, robbing the LGBTQ+ community of their rights, and making sure Hoosiers can’t exercise their right to choose. Curtis Hill must go.
It’s no surprise that the Cook Political Report moved the Indiana Attorney General's race from ""leans Republican"" to ""toss-up.""
Yet at the Republican Convention, Curtis Hill contended, “the Democratic Party wants [the Republican Party] to take me out because they know they can’t.”
The truth is not only can we vote him out in November, we will.
We’re not going to let Hill blatantly lie without pushing back. So here’s the plan: we need 1,000 Hoosier Dems to sign the Pledge to #FireCurtisHill by the end of the day TODAY. Then, we’ll send him a boxful of pledges to remind him his days in office are numbered.
Friend, will you chip in $3 to take the pledge to Fire Curtis Hill?
We can't let him get away with this.
Every dollar goes directly into our Fire Curtis Hill Fund, helping us make calls, run ads, and get Dems voting in November. Will you consider chipping in more to make sure we #FireCurtisHill in 2020?

"January 9, 2020
-Republicans overtly reject using the $291 million surplus for teacher pay-
The Republican-controlled House Ways and Means Committee voted to reject a proposal to use $291 million in surplus state revenue to give teachers a one-time bonus. The surplus, which could’ve given all 50,000-plus Hoosier educators a $5,800 bonus, will instead be used to cash fund construction projects. Yep, as flocks of teachers leave our state in search of fair pay and students are subject to a rapidly deteriorating education system, Republicans think they can make better use of taxpayer money.
Republicans like Eric Holcomb have repeatedly said they will not be introducing teacher pay raises because 2020 is a non-budgetary year. Actions like this demonstrate that their decisions have nothing to do with the budget and everything to do with their lack of concern for public education.
-GOP sets the tone for the legislative session-
We are one week into the legislative session, and House Republicans have already voted against lowering prescription drug prices, expanding Pre-K, and raising teacher pay. And while they vote to maintain the status quo, Hoosiers are suffering from staggering medication costs, the worst pre-k education system in the country, and the lowest teacher pay of all neighboring states. It’s as if they’re trying to show everyday Hoosiers they don’t care.
However, we did learn exactly where the GOP's priorities lie: discriminating against trans and non-binary Hoosiers. This week, Representative Christy Stutzman is writing House Bill 1088 to exclude trans women from competing in female sporting events. Meanwhile, Senator Jim Tomes authored a bill to eliminate the Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles’ proposal to create gender-neutral driver’s licenses.
Republicans aren't focused on the issues everyday Hoosiers face; instead, they're spending this legislative session discriminating against the LBGTQ community.
-Democrats push for fairly drawn districts-
On Monday, Senate Democrats pledged to support changes to redistricting. Since 2020 is the final year for the next decade that lawmakers can alter the redistricting process, they must address partisan gerrymandering now. For years, Republican officials have been able to choose their voters, instead of allowing voters to choose them. Democrats are on a mission to replace this corrupt practice with a non-partisan and transparent redistricting process.
-Hoosiers take action on marijuana reform-
Advocates and legislators rallied at the Statehouse for marijuana reform on Monday. They exchanged stories of its medicinal capabilities and the damage its criminalization has had on Hoosiers. Currently, marijuana-related offenses constitute the second most arrested crime in Indiana. Democrats are looking to move the Legislature’s position on Marijuana forward this session to protect everyday Hoosiers from unnecessary criminal charges.
-Blue Bench Training-
Ready to run for office in 2020 but unsure where to begin? The Indiana Democratic Party, in partnership with the National Democratic Training Committee, is hosting a candidate training on January 25 in Indianapolis.
More details and sign up here.
-Petition deadline approaching-
In 2020, we have a real shot at winning the Governor’s office, and petitions are the key to getting your candidate on the ballot. All three candidates to be our nominee for Governor in the fall need to gather 4,500 petition signatures of registered voters to get on the ballot.

1. Dr. Woody Myers – contact: Aaron Schaler - [[URL REDACTED]]
2. Josh Owens – contact: Claire Griffith - [[URL REDACTED]]
2. Print the petitions and hit the pavement

"We’ve got to show Pence that Hoosiers stand with the LGBTQ+ community.
As our governor, Mike Pence made a name for himself discriminating against the LGBTQ+ community.
Hoosiers know that if VP Pence gets another four years with a SCOTUS majority, he will work tirelessly to stop gay marriage, rip health care away from transgender people, and remove protections for LGBTQ+ Americans. Can you rush $25, or whatever you can, to our Fire Mike Pence Fund before he takes the debate stage tonight to help us vote him out?
We’ve got to show Pence that Hoosiers stand with the LGBTQ+ community. That’s why from now until the end of tonight’s debate, every dollar you give to our Fire Mike Pence Fund will be split with the Indiana Stonewall Democrats.
We need 100 allies to chip in by 11 PM TONIGHT to help us replace Pence with a VP that will fight for LGBTQ+ Hoosiers. Can you contribute to show him where you stand?
Plus, we’re raffling off our famous Fire Mike Pence merch to THREE lucky debate night donors. Chip in any amount to our Fire Mike Pence Fund from now until the debate ends to enter to win!

"-March 13, 2020-
-The Indiana Democratic Party responds to the coronavirus-
The coronavirus is a rapidly developing situation, and we want to be as prepared as possible. We also want to keep communities, candidates, and campaign workers safe. That's why we've issued guidance to county parties today.
That guidance includes advising county parties and campaigns to halt non-essential events for two weeks. We also are advising campaigns to conduct voter contact virtually for two weeks.
Likewise, we have made the difficult decision to cancel all scheduled Party events for the next two weeks. We hope to reschedule once we can confidently meet without putting Hoosiers' health in jeopardy.
Thank you all for understanding, and please stay safe!
-Holcomb does little to protect Hoosiers in wake of coronavirus-
Since Gov. Holcomb gave his one and only press conference last week, Kentucky and Ohio governors have given 14 to keep their constituents updated on their states' responses.
In the time since his last address, travel from Europe was banned, the NBA season was suspended, and several states have canceled school in the coming weeks.
Nonetheless, Gov. Holcomb hasn't taken any further action on COVID-19.
-Coronavirus demonstrates Indiana workplace weaknesses-
Indiana is not among the 11 states that mandate paid sick days. In January, on a party-line vote, Indiana House Republicans blocked a proposal to institute paid sick leave. And while Statehouse Republicans are talking about what a 'blessing' Indiana's fiscal position is when facing the coronavirus, many working Hoosiers won't benefit.
Bottom line: Indiana is growing low-income jobs; Hoosiers in low-income occupations are the least likely to have paid leave, and if a single mother in Avon wants to keep food on the table, she may need to keep working.
-End of the legislative session sheds light on GOP's loyalty-
The legislative session is officially over, and one thing is crystal clear: Republican officials took every opportunity to cut deals for special interests who dumped cash into their campaign accounts. They did nothing to demonstrably lower health care costs, gutted proposals to address maternal mortality, and failed to give Hoosier educators a much-deserved raise.
The message is clear: if you line their pockets with campaign cash, then you have a friend in the GOP. But if you're like the majority of working Hoosiers, then don't expect a bigger paycheck or smaller health care bills.
-County Parties gear up to win big-
Last weekend, we held our 2020 County Party Summit. Panels of experts presented on engaging with volunteers, building a field program to flip counties blue, fundraising, and promoting new candidates.
County Party officials left the Summit with the tools to fight hard and win big. This is how we expand the battleground across the State and win seats up and down the ballot.

"Friend,
2020 will be the most important election of our lives. Not only can we win back the White House, but also we can flip the 5th Congressional District, take the governor’s office, beat Attorney General Curtis Hill, add seats to the Senate, win local races across the state, and break the supermajority in the Indiana House.
We are building a grassroots war chest to make 2020 the year we flipped our state. But it takes resources to do that.
We're nearing our first fundraising deadline of 2020, and we are just $3,800 away from our January goal. That means if everyone reading this chipped in, we’d expand our capacity to build the bench, inform voters, and push back on the GOP.
Give $10 to help us reach our goal.

"A quick convention update.
Hoosier Democrats --
First, we hope you are staying safe. In trying times, Hoosiers always rise to meet the challenge. If you’re looking for ways to help, or need a hand, we’ve put together a statewide list of resources here.
Second, we wanted to give you an update on the State Convention. Our team is working non-stop to prepare options, and we intend to hold our Party’s convention on June 13. We’re looking at all possibilities, including exploring a digital convention, delegate voting by mail, and even online voting. Next week, the State Central Committee will meet to discuss this, as well. We are in discussions with the Democratic National Committee about any changes needed to our Delegate Selection Process for the Democratic National Convention, which appears to now be moving to mid-August in Milwaukee.
Bottom line: we wanted you and everyone else interested to know that we’re working to have our Convention on June 13.
Stay safe and healthy, and we’ll stay in touch with you as plans come together.

"Republican officials took their cash
-February 20, 2020-
-Republicans raked in cash from corrupt virtual charter schools-
The same virtual charter schools that stole millions of dollars from Hoosier taxpayers made over $100,000 in campaign contributions to the GOP.
More than 50 Republican officials took their cash, including Gov. Holcomb and House Speaker Brian Bosma.
For eight years, Republican Senator Travis Holdman was paid a monthly retainer by one of the schools for legal and business consulting. Bosma, who received $10,000 in campaign donations, deemed the schools' conduct 'criminal,' without even batting an eye at his hypocrisy.
The GOP's fingerprints are all over this scandal. They put their own greed above public education, and we aren't going to let them get away with it.
-The GOP blocks amendment to lower the cost of insulin-
State Rep. Robin Shackleford recently introduced a proposal to cap the total amount an individual is required to pay for a 30-day supply of insulin at $100. The average cost of insulin has risen by nearly $200 in the last decade, and Hoosiers have lost their lives because they could not afford the drug.
House Republicans blocked Shackleford's proposal from debate. Hoosiers' lives are at stake, and they won't even entertain the idea of lowering the cost of prescription drugs.
This is what happens when your legislators are in the pockets of special interests.
-The GOP replaces [[URL REDACTED]] more racism-
Republican Roger Stewart was handpicked for the Kokomo city council after his predecessor, Greg Jones, resigned due to Islamophobic posts on Facebook.
Now, Stewart is under fire for Islamophobic posts of his own.
Representative André Carson spoke out on the subject, mentioning that this behavior should not be tolerated. Hoosiers are better than rhetoric that sets out to divide us and stereotype members of our communities.
-The GOP votes down another teacher pay raise-
Senator Eddie Melton proposed a teacher pay raise that would have given teachers the $75 million that the Indiana State Teachers Association requested as a good faith ""down payment"" for this session.
This marks the sixth time The GOP has voted down a teacher pay raise this year.
-Educators rallied at the Statehouse. Again-
In November of 2019, 20,000 educators rallied at the Statehouse to ask for fair teacher pay, decoupling standardized test performance and teacher compensation, better public school funding, and the end to the teacher externship.
This week, educators returned to the Statehouse to say they've had enough. They've made it clear that they will never stop fighting for public education.
If your educators are rallying every three months, you're doing something wrong.
-We're Hiring-

"Politicians like Eric Holcomb and Donald Trump lie, manipulate statistics, and take credit when none is due.

"Friend, early investments in our campaign have made battlegrounds out of red districts. We’ve built the momentum to flip seats for the first time in decades and beat back Republican gerrymandering for good.
But races are won and lost in the last three weeks. If we’re going to send a wave of Dems to office this year, we’ve got just 22 days left to ramp up our efforts and get it done.
We’ve estimated that the remainder of our 2020 Safe Voting Initiative will cost $20k. This initiative is grassroots-backed. We can’t get this done without your support. Will you chip in your first $7, or whatever you can, to help us finish out this epic get-out-the-vote plan in time? Even a small donation will make a huge difference.
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Here’s what Hoosiers’ investments have helped us accomplish in the last few months:
1. We started a voter protection hotline with legal help ready to thwart any attempts at voter suppression.
2. We hired a bilingual organizer to expand our voter and volunteer outreach into Spanish speaking communities.
3. We built a tool to connect voters with every Democratic candidate on their ballot.
4. We hired new data staffers and collected early vote locations across the state. Then, we built a tool to connect Hoosiers with early vote locations in their area.
5. We purchased software to easily connect volunteers with events in their area, expanding our coalition of Hoosiers ready to get out the vote like never before.
6. We’ve produced and shared educational tools to help voters understand their options to vote safely.
7. We’ve hired new staff members and interns to run a field program designed to educate voters on their candidates and their options to vote safely in 2020. They’ve been on the phones every day recruiting volunteers and talking about our winning message.
The 2020 Safe Voting Initiative is our most groundbreaking GOTV effort to date. It doesn’t stop there. Here’s what is left to get done:
1. We need to invest in software to reach out to mail-in voters and make sure they’re getting their applications and ballots in before the deadline.
2. We’re hoping to continue our massive texting and phonebanking program to educate voters on their options to vote safely.
3. Our field staffers have a goal of making hundreds of thousands of calls and sending one million texts before the election.
4. We need to engage Democratic lawyers to help address voter suppression at the county-level.
5. We’ve got to continue to produce and share voter educational tools with the help of a legal team.
Friend, there has never been a better time to make your first donation. Can we count on you to make sure we don’t lose our momentum?

"-September 11, 2020-
-Remembering 9/11-
Today marks the 19th anniversary of one of the darkest moments in our nation's history. The unfathomable loss and unforgettable heroism of September 11, 2001, will be forever etched into our memory.
But as we look at 9/11 through the lens of 2020, a year that has also brought profound grief, we must remember that on this day, 19 years ago, our nation embodied the true spirit of American greatness. We chose compassion, unity, and a commitment to the ideals of freedom, justice and equality over fear, hatred and divisiveness.
If we are truly going to honor the 2,977 lives we lost 19 years ago today, we've must strive to embody those values today and every day.
-Pete Buttigieg endorses INDems' Vote by Mail Program-
This week, former Mayor Pete Buttigieg endorsed our Vote by Mail Program.
""The Vote-by-Mail Outreach Program is Indiana's number one initiative dedicated to getting eligible Hoosiers the tools they need to vote by mail,"" said Buttigieg.
Read about the Vote by Mail Program.
The GOP has rejected no-excuse voting by mail in the general election, refused to send eligible Hoosiers vote-by-mail applications, and failed to provide any tools to make voting by mail easier.
They've made it clear: it's on us to make sure Hoosiers can vote safely this year. That's why we're running the largest statewide, vote-by-mail initiative in Indiana.
As always, this initiative is 100%-grassroots-backed. That means we're counting on Dems like you to make sure eligible Hoosiers have the tools to vote by mail.
The deadline to apply to vote by mail is quickly approaching. We've already sent hundreds of thousands of Hoosiers applications. Now, we need to get out our first round of follow-up by next Friday. It's going to take $3k to get this done.
How many follow-up texts can you help us send?
$5 = 50 texts
$10 = 100 texts
$25 = 250 texts
$50 = 500 texts
Or, another amount
-Weinzapfel earns bipartisan endorsement-
This week, Democratic Attorney General Candidate Jonathan Weinzapfel earned the endorsement of Republican Superintendent of Public Instruction, Jennifer McCormick.
McCormick stated that Weinzapfel ""has a well-earned reputation for bipartisan problem solving, for listening and for making a real difference in every job he's had.""
Her endorsement is a clear indication of Weinzapfel's relentless dedication to building stronger schools and long history of championing Hoosiers' education.

"-January 24, 2020-
-The GOP ignores Indiana's maternal and infant mortality rates-
Indiana has the 3rd worst maternal mortality rate in the country. In 2019, the U.S. had a maternal mortality rate of 17.2 out of 100,000; white Hoosiers had a rate of 41.4, and Black Hoosiers had a rate of 53.4. These numbers have risen in the last year.
Likewise, our infant mortality rate is the 7th highest in the country.
This week, Democratic Senator Jean Breaux introduced an amendment that would combat these abysmal numbers by providing Medicaid resources for pregnant women. But the decision was voted down along party lines, with 100% of Republican senators voting against women and children.
-Republican senators strike down teacher pay raises. Again-
On Tuesday, Democratic senators offered two teacher pay proposals as a joint amendment to House Bill 1007, which opens up the budget. Their amendment would add $100 million annually to the Teacher Appreciation Grant without raising taxes or using the surplus.
However, Republicans remain vehemently against paying our teachers their fair share. The amendment, supported unanimously by Democrats, was voted down by 100% of Republican senators.
This was the third teacher pay proposal Senate Republicans have voted down this year.
If they’ll vote down an amendment that leaves both the surplus and taxes untouched, it seems unlikely that they’ll ever raise teachers’ salaries.
-Mike Braun won't support a fair impeachment trial-
Senator Mike Braun expressed his stance on Trump’s impeachment this week: not guilty. He even went so far as to say that Trump did not ask a foreign entity to investigate a political rival.
Braun has read the same report as us. He has heard the call between Trump and Ukrainian President, Zelensky. So why does he fail to see the apparent corruption?
Well, it appears that Rudy Guiliani and his associate, Lev Parnas, are among Braun’s wealthy and well-connected friends.
In a photo taken at a campaign event for the Senator, Braun can be seen with Guiliani and Parnas. And the men have contributed thousands of dollars to committees and super PACs that spent millions opposing Braun’s opponent in 2018.
With friends like that, we’re willing to bet Braun's stance is more about appeasing his wealthy and well-connected friends than upholding a fair trial.
-Senator Niezgodski receives a well-deserved award-
Democratic Senator David Niezgodski received the Civility in Government Award presented by The Association of Retired Members of the General Assembly. Senator Niezgodski has remained a unifying force during his time in office and has fought hard for Democratic values.
Congratulations to Senator Niezgodski! We are so proud to have leaders like him!
-Petition deadline approaching-
In 2020, we have a real shot at winning the Governor’s office, and petitions are the key to getting your candidate on the ballot. All three candidates to be our nominee for Governor in the fall need to gather 4,500 petition signatures of registered voters to get on the ballot.

"2019 was a monumental year for Hoosier Democrats.
[[URL REDACTED]]
For the first time, Democrats will hold the mayor’s office in Zionsville and seats on councils in Carmel, Avon and Fishers.
Nearly 750,000 more Hoosiers live under Democratic mayoral leadership than Republican leadership.
We won commanding victories for mayor in Indianapolis, Fort Wayne and New Albany, added a council majority in Columbus and Elkhart and strengthened council majorities in Evansville and Portage.
[[URL REDACTED]]
A record number of LGBTQ Hoosier Democrats were elected to the Indianapolis City County Council.
Elkhart has its first African American mayor.
We elected a record number of Democratic women mayors.
We elected Indiana’s first transgender official.
Dozens of first-time, female and millennial Hoosier Democrats will take the oath of office on January 1.
We spent the last year fighting for Democratic victories in places we were told they couldn’t exist. We built a diverse bench and expanded our battleground across the state. And in doing so, we made history.
So, while 2020 may seem daunting, we know we can win because we’ve done it before. Here’s to fighting harder, making more historic victories, and taking back our state in 2020.
And it all starts today.
Chip in $20 to make 2020, our best year yet.

"It's official: Todd Rokita is the GOP's AG candidate.
The bad news? Rokita has spent his political career stripping Americans of their health care and jacking up premiums. His 2020 candidacy puts over 560,000 Hoosiers' health care at risk.
This is a race we can't afford to lose.
Invest $15 in the campaign to take down Todd.
The good news? Rokita is an infamous loser. He lost the race to replace Mike Pence in 2016 and got outgunned in the 2018 Senate primary. The GOP even drew him out of his own legislative district to keep him from running. His unprecedented losing streak explains why the AG's race moved from ""leans Republican"" to ""toss-up.""
This is a race we can win as long as we have the resources to do it.
Friend, will you contribute $5 to our Take Down Todd Fund?
Every dollar you invest in the campaign to keep Rokita out gets us closer to restoring integrity to the AG's office, holding onto our health care, and protecting our rights.
This is an investment worth making.

"That’s right. For the first time, EVERY SINGLE HOOSIER voter can vote by mail in the June 2 primary election, if they choose. That’s huge because Hoosiers shouldn’t have to put their health at risk to exercise their right to vote.
But there’s a catch.
To date, Republicans haven’t agreed to mail every voter an application to receive their ballot at home.
Become a founding member of our 2020 Vote by Mail Fund by chipping in $35.
That means we need to raise the money to make it happen. This could be a game-changer for Hoosier Democrats. You know Republicans have made it harder to vote in Indiana, with some of the shortest voting hours in the country and countless other barriers to the ballot box.
We’ve set a goal to raise $24,000 in 6 days. Can you chip in $24 toward hitting the goal?
Honestly, Friend, it’s going to take a lot to get the word out to Hoosiers that the safest way to vote is by mail. But, there’s no doubt this is a tough time for some Hoosiers.
If you are able to support expanding vote by mail to every Hoosier, can you chip in $5?
Thank you for your generosity,
Lauren

"Friend,
I wanted you to be the first to see our announcement of our keynote speaker for our 2020 Hoosier Hospitality Dinner!
I’m thrilled to tell you that this year’s speaker will be DCCC chair, Illinois Congresswoman Cheri Bustos! Cheri made history as the first woman elected to Congress in her district. Now, she’s joining us in the fight to take back our nation in 2020.
Friend, 2020 will be one of the most important elections of our lives.
We have the opportunity to take back the Oval Office, keep the majority in the U.S. House, elect a Democratic governor, flip the attorney general’s seat, break the supermajority in the Indiana General Assembly and win local elections across the state.
But that starts with Democrats like you and me coming together and getting to work.
That’s why I’m hoping you’ll join us at the 2020 Hoosier Hospitality Dinner. This is an exclusive offer to hear from Democrats across the country.
And all you have to do is open your laptop.
When you get a ticket to our virtual Hoosier Hospitality Dinner, you’re unlocking speeches from elected officials and Party leaders. But you don’t have to risk your health to watch them.
Get your tickets here! You won’t want to miss out on this exclusive opportunity.

Getting eligible Hoosiers the tools to vote by mail is an essential part of ensuring everyone can vote safely.

Chip in $10 to elect officials that will fight for equal pay.
Right now, women are on the frontlines of our COVID-19 response, making up a majority of the professions fighting the disease. But Indiana is one of the worst states in the U.S. for wage equality, with women making 75 cents to every dollar a man makes.

"It's official, Friend. The Cook Political Report moved the Indiana Attorney General's race from ""leans Republican"" to toss-up!
They know what we're seeing on the ground: Hoosier Democrats have the momentum to win this seat.
Chip in 20.20 to help flip the Attorney General's office for the first time in nearly two decades
The stakes couldn't be higher. Attorney General Curtis Hill is suing to take 400,000 Hoosiers' health care away in the middle of a global pandemic. The Republican AG playbook couldn't be clearer: put quality affordable health care out of reach for Hoosier families.
We can't give Hill, Todd Rokita, or another Republican another four years to dismantle the progress we've made on health care.
Give $12 to back our Fire Curtis Hill Fund.
2020 is the year we vote out Curtis Hill, protect health care for hundreds of thousands of Hoosiers and flip the AG from red to blue. But we can't do that with your help.
Name, will you give $5 to our Fire Curtis Hill Fund?
Every dollar goes toward making calls, running digital ads, and ensuring Hoosier Democrats cast ballots in November so we can take back the AG's office.

"Team,
I know you’ve heard from me a lot lately; so, I’ll be brief.
Today is the last day we can garner the resources to get out our FINAL round of vote-by-mail application outreach. It's our last chance to save the Vote-by-Mail Program. That means we need to raise $3,231 by MIDNIGHT.
This initiative is 100%-grassroots-backed. If we don't raise the money to help eligible Hoosiers return their vote-by-mail applications, we won't be able to get it done.
The data indicates that scaling this program back could mean losing more than 60,000 votes and significantly increasing the health threat at the ballot box. I'm determined to make sure that doesn't happen. So, I'm personally asking: can you make your first donation to save the Vote-by-Mail Program? We can't do this without you.

"Yesterday, Republican lawmakers voted to supersede your local elected prosecutor and to continue to criminalize small amounts of marijuana.

"-April 3, 2020-
-Hoosiers aren’t getting the COVID-19 tests they need-
We cannot flatten the curve until testing becomes more on-demand.
It is concerning, then, that testing has slowed down significantly this week, with 40% fewer tests given on Wednesday than Tuesday. An unconcerned Holcomb indicated that testing would remain a limited commodity.
Neighboring states are ramping up their testing. Illinois is currently testing 4X as many people as Indiana and their governor has pledged to increase that number to 10,000 tests/day. Ohio’s governor issued an executive order to speed the turn-around time of testing and announced the development of a rapid test.
Bottom line: While the number of cases increases, Indiana's testing isn't. And while our neighbors make huge strides in testing, our Governor is dragging his feet.
-Dr. Myers has a plan to get Hoosiers medical equipment and revive the economy-
While ICU beds, ventilators, protective gear, and testing have been lacking under Holcomb, Dr. Woody Myers has a plan to provide those items while reviving Hoosier manufacturing in the process.
He believes that the coronavirus offers a unique opportunity to make Indiana a major producer of supplies for COVID-19 relief. Myers’ plan includes taking advantage of idle factories, granting manufacturing workers a safe employment opportunity, and developing a global market presence in medical manufacturing.
But most importantly, Myers’ plan would provide life-saving medical equipment to countless Hoosiers.
-Voting by mail made easy-
With the extension of voting by mail to every voter in the state, Hoosiers are experiencing a historic expansion of voting rights.
But that means many of us are going to have to learn a whole new way of voting.
We’ve created a guide to help you vote by mail in the primary election because everyone should have the opportunity to make their voice heard.
Check out the full flowchart here.
You can also find instructions on how to fill out your vote by mail application here.
-Update on State Convention-
Our team is working non-stop to prepare options, and we intend to hold our Party’s convention on June 13.
We’re looking at all possibilities, including exploring a digital convention, delegate voting by mail, and even online voting.
Next week, the State Central Committee will meet to discuss this, as well. We are in discussions with the Democratic National Committee about any changes needed to our Delegate Selection Process for the Democratic National Convention, which appears to now be moving to mid-August in Milwaukee.
-COVID-19 Relief-
We have created a running list of ways you can help others as well as receive relief during this time; you can see what's going on statewide and in your county here.

"Hey friend --
Zoe here. I wanted to let you know that we are just under halfway to reaching our $10k goal by MIDNIGHT tonight.
Invest $25 in our 2020 Grassroots Fund to help us reach our goal in time!
We’re just 90 days away from the most important election of our lives. Republicans have promised to rob us of our reproductive rights, take away our health care, slash through school budgets, and erode voting rights if they keep their supermajority.
Chip in $15 to help build the campaign to vote them out!
So, we’ve got to do everything we can to get out the vote this November. That’s why we’re bringing you an unprecedented opportunity to get involved.
Every single donor that gives to our 2020 Grassroots Fund by MIDNIGHT tonight will have their contribution TRIPLE MATCHED. Yep. Your donation will count 3X.
Will you give $10 to help us turn Indiana blue this November?

"-July 3, 2020-
-#FireCurtisHill-
Curtis Hill, the Republican incumbent for Attorney General, has spent the last four years denigrating the office and threatening the progress we’ve made. Multiple women have accused Hill of sexual misconduct for which his law license was suspended. He is dedicated to taking away over 560,000 Hoosiers’ health care, robbing the LGBTQ+ community of their rights, and making sure Hoosiers can’t exercise their right to choose.
It’s no surprise that the Cook Political Report moved the Indiana Attorney General's race from ""leans Republican"" to ""toss-up."" Yet at the Republican Convention, Curtis Hill contended, “the Democratic Party wants [the Republican Party] to take me out because they know they can’t.”
The truth is not only can we vote him out in November, we will.
We’re not going to let Hill blatantly lie without pushing back. So here’s the plan: we’re asking 1,000 Hoosier Dems to sign the Pledge to #FireCurtisHill by July 7th. Then, we’re sending him a boxful of pledges to remind him his days in office are numbered.
Will you chip in $3 to sign the pledge to #FireCurtisHill?
Opt to share your pledge on social media and encourage your friends to do the same! Then follow along with us on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram as we roll out the case against Curtis Hill all day on July 7th!
We cannot give Hill another four years in office.
-Holcomb's data comes way too late-
For months, Gov. Holcomb hid nursing home COVID-19 data from Hoosiers.
This week, after months of Hoosiers pleading for it, he begrudging announced that he'd begin sharing the data this month.
The problem? Holcomb's administration has continually argued that they couldn't generate a report of this data. His long-overdue release makes it clear: Holcomb had the information all along, yet he refused to share it.
And Hoosiers are paying the ultimate price for his decision. Many weren't able to make informed decisions about their health or their loved ones' health.
One Hoosier lamented, ""My dad could be alive right now if they had only provided that information sooner.""
Holcomb needlessly left one of the most vulnerable populations of Hoosiers in the dark, and because of that, Hoosiers lost their lives.
-Black Hoosiers are still waiting-
Black Hoosiers make up less than 10% of Indiana's population but account for 18% of the COVID-19 cases and 20% of the deaths.
Months ago, the Indiana Black Legislative Caucus issued a series of suggestions to address these racial disparities. Among them, they asked to place testing and triage centers in predominantly Black neighborhoods.
Since then, the Holcomb administration has failed to fulfill this request, leaving countless Black Hoosiers hours away from the nearest testing center.
This week, State Rep. Earl Harris Jr sent a letter to Holcomb urging him to put a testing center in Lake County, the second-most populous county in the state in which 23% of the population is Black.
Bottom line: for Black Hoosiers, this is life or death, but Holcomb continues to drag his feet.
-SCOTUS rules on June Medical Services LLC v. Russo-
On Monday, the Supreme Court struck down a Louisiana abortion law that placed an undue burden on American's right to choose.
The ruling narrowly passed with just one vote keeping Hoosier women's right to make health care decisions intact.
But the war on Hoosiers' right to choose doesn't stop here.
Year after year, Indiana Republicans have pushed legislative policy with only one goal: restricting Hoosiers' right to make their own health care decisions.
This ruling reaffirms the stakes this November. Hoosier Democrats will fight to elect lawmakers who respect the right to autonomy.

"Every ten years, state legislators redraw electoral districts. 2021 represents the first time we can beat back the GOP’s partisan gerrymandering in the last decade.
This election is more than just a chance to win; it’s an opportunity to restore free and fair elections and stop the GOP’s extremism for the next ten years.
The past is prologue. We’re taking a trip in the Wayback Machine to revisit what the last decade under GOP leadership has done to our elections, health care, and public education. Spoiler alert: it's not good.
Friend, with only six critical days left until the election, there has never been a better time to take action. Here are three things you can do to stop another decade of GOP rule:
VOTE VOLUNTEER
CHIP IN
FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS
Gerrymandering. Republican gerrymandering in 2011 allowed the GOP to establish their supermajority in 2012. They took 71% of the General Assembly seats with less than 53% of the statewide popular vote.
This year, Dems called on the GOP to establish an independent redistricting commission so that neither Party could rig the system. The GOP turned every proposal down.
Voter suppression.
> Indiana has some of the shortest voting hours in the country.
> It boasts one of the strictest photo ID laws, disenfranchising many black and brown Hoosiers.
> Our state is one of six refusing to allow no-excuse voting by mail in the general election.
> For years, the GOP cut early voting sites in blue districts and added them in red ones.
HEALTH CARE
The last decade under a GOP majority has wreaked havoc on our health, putting Indiana at the bottom of nearly every public health measure.
> Indiana ranks 40th for overall health care and 42nd for public health.
> The GOP’s Attorney General candidate, Todd Rokita, has vowed to end the Affordable Care Act. The 2.7 million Hoosiers with pre-existing conditions could lose their care.
> Indiana has the 3rd highest maternal and the 7th highest infant mortality rate in the country. The GOP voted down every bill designed to improve these numbers this year.
> The average annual cost of prescription drugs has increased by almost 60% since 2012. Hoosiers have lost their lives because they couldn’t afford medication. This year, Republicans voted against lowering the cost of prescription drugs.
> The number of daily COVID-19 cases hit its all-time peak on October 22; hospitals are now nearing capacity. Gov. Holcomb has continued to remove COVID-19 protections.
PUBLIC EDUCATION
In 2010, at the onset of the Republican majority in the General Assembly, the GOP cut $300 million from public school funding. That money has never been replaced.
> Indiana’s teacher salary growth is the lowest in the country. Republicans voted down every proposal to raise teacher pay this year.
> 92% of school districts report a major teacher shortage.
> Last November, 15,000 educators rallied at the Statehouse, calling on lawmakers to invest in public education. Instead, Gov. Holcomb bumped his administration’s salaries and threw the state's $291 million surplus at construction projects.
> 90% of Indiana students are in public schools. But, the GOP has continued to siphon off taxpayer money to for-profit charters, causing public schools to rely on local referenda for funding.
> Last year, two for-profit charter schools defrauded the state of $68 million and funneled even more to wealthy executives. They also made over $100,000 in campaign contributions to Republicans.
> Dems proposed legislation to require charter schools to refund the state in instances of fraud; Republicans voted it down. Then, the GOP passed legislation to give charters the option to use public schools' referenda money.
Bottom line: the GOP has spent the last eight years with a supermajority in the General Assembly. They've done nothing but denigrate our elections, destroy public health, and sabotage our public schools.
Republicans have made it clear: they don't care about Hoosiers. They care about lining their pockets with campaign contributions from the wealthy and well-connected.
Friend, if we lose this election, we risk our health, our schools, and our voting rights. These next six days are critical. Please, join us in taking action to win our state back.

"This year, we can increase the number of young Democrats at the polls by up to 200,000. That’s enough to flip Indiana blue.
This year, we can increase the number of young Democrats at the polls by up to 200,000. That’s enough to flip Indiana blue.
Read the plan.
We’ve partnered with the College Dems of Indiana to build an integral part of our 2020 Safe Voting Initiative: the Young Voters Project. This is our plan to register a record number of first-time voters, facilitate comprehensive voter education, and mobilize young Dems to cast ballots this year.
Last month, we built a network of student-led voter registration teams at college campuses across the state. Now, we’ve got to get them the tools to register voters safely.
We’re sending our teams pandemic-approved voter registration kits. Each kit includes masks, clipboards, hand sanitizer, pens, and stickers and flyers with a QR code that takes you to the online form for socially-distanced registration.
With the deadline to register to vote just over a month away, we need to build 100 kits by Monday. Each kit costs $12 to make. So, we're hoping to raise $1,200 by the end of the week to get the tools to them in time.
We need all hands on deck to reach this goal by Friday.
How many voter registration kits can the College Dems count on you for?

"Let’s not mince words. We’re already falling behind. Donald Trump’s campaign and the RNC announced they raised over $300 million in the past twelve months.
Kick in $20 to our 2020 Grassroots Fund to offset Trump’s dark money donors
That's a $300 million head start to another four years of Donald Trump’s vision for America: tax cuts for billionaires and corporations while working Hoosiers get buried by the rising cost of living. More than 400 prescription drugs will be more expensive in 2020 and Indiana has some of the highest child care costs in the country.
In 2020, we can elect a Democratic President. Right here in Indiana, we can flip the 5th Congressional District, win back the governor’s office, beat Attorney General Curtis Hill and break the supermajority in the Indiana House.
But friend, it takes resources to knock the doors, register voters, and mobilize our base. Can you step up in 2020 by chipping in $10?
Help us hit the ground running and defeat Trump in 2020.

"Wisconsin voters were forced to brave the virus to cast their ballots last week. They waited in line for hours, potentially putting their health at risk to exercise their right to vote.
I'm worried this is what our election could look like if more action isn't taken to mail vote-by-mail applications to every Hoosier voter before the primary in June.
Will you give $37 to our Vote by Mail Fund to help us keep Hoosiers safe?
Friend, Republicans still haven't agreed to mail every Hoosier an application. But we're not waiting, we've launched an outreach effort to make sure Hoosiers know they can vote by mail.
We want to do our part to make sure Indiana's primary election doesn't look like Wisconsin's. But we can't get there without your help.
Chip in $15, so no Hoosier has to choose between their health and their vote.

"-April 24, 2020-
-We want to hear from you-
Across the state, Hoosiers are feeling the impact of COVID-19. Too often, the experience told on the news isn't reflective of every community. We want to ensure we hold legislators accountable, and every community has access to the resources to rebuild. And we want to hear from you. You can help by completing this quick survey to help us understand how your community and family have been impacted by COVID-19.
-Republicans block safe and secure vote-by-mail proposals-
Republican Election Commission members voted down a number of proposals put forth by Democrats to maximize the safety and security of Hoosier voters. They blocked things like mailing every voter an application to vote by mail and extending the deadline a vote-by-mail ballot can be requested.
You can find the full list of proposals they rejected in the video here.
Hoosier Democrats have been fervent supporters of voting by mail. It is secure, convenient, and the only way to keep both voters and poll workers safe.
The GOP has made it clear: they’re willing to throw out Hoosier voters’ safety to thwart even the perception of expanded voting rights.
It’s on us to make sure no Hoosier has to put their health on the line to cast their ballot. We’re relying on our 100%-grassroots-funded, Vote-by-Mail Outreach Initiative to get every Hoosier the tools they need to vote safely in the primary.
Will you give $8.50 to help us build our Vote-by-Mail Outreach Initiative?
-Black Hoosiers are disproportionately affected by COVID-19-
African Americans make up about 10% of Indiana’s population but account for 18% of COVID-19 cases and 20% of deaths. White Hoosiers, on the other hand, make up 85% of the population, but they comprise 50% of cases and 66% of deaths.
The Indiana Black Legislative Caucus has taken action to address these disparities. State Rep. Robin Shackleford, chair of the Indiana Black Legislative Caucus, addressed the issue and potential solutions in a letter to Gov. Holcomb and State Health Commissioner, Dr. Kristina Box.
Now, the Caucus is working to improve these issues in wake of COVID-19. Their priorities include creating a disparity task force, providing COVID-19 testing in majority-Black neighborhoods, and ensuring that essential workers have the right to sick leave and hazard pay.
-The Holcomb administration rejects donation of COVID-19 tests-
On April 6th, Indiana health commissioner Dr. Kristina Box said the goal was to reach 6,300 tests a day in the coming weeks.
Nearly three weeks later, Indiana is still short of that goal, with testing falling from week to week. Last week’s total number of tests conducted was over 1,000 tests less than the week before.
Meanwhile, the Holcomb administration is refusing test kits from an Indianapolis lab offering to “donate as many as Indiana needs.”
Over 99% of the Hoosier population is unaware of their COVID-19 status, and our Governor is turning down donations of tests.
We’re calling on Gov. Holcomb to step up and get Hoosiers COVID-19 tests now. Sign on to the petition here.
-Hoosiers aren’t getting the unemployment help they need-
In wake of COVID-19, hundreds of thousands of Hoosiers have filed for unemployment. The previous record for unemployment claims in a week was 28,000 in January 2009. Now it is almost 5X that number at nearly 140,000 Hoosiers in a week.
But they aren’t getting the help they need.
People that filed for unemployment over a month ago still have yet to receive word on their status. And many have reported being on hold with the Department of Workforce Development for 12 hours just to have their call dropped.
Bottom line: Hoosier families need unemployment benefits now, but the Holcomb administration is failing to help.

"Trump proudly admitted that he asked his administration to slow down COVID-19 testing.
Chip in $12 to our One-Term President Fund to help vote him out in November.
Time and time again, health care officials have warned us: widespread testing is the key to stopping the spread. So why did the President ask his administration to slow down testing?
Less testing = less documented cases of COVID-19. He’s playing Russian Roulette with our lives so he can forge a successful coronavirus response.
To date, more than 123,000 Americans have died from COVID-19. Hundreds of thousands of people have lost their loved ones. And Trump wants to cut the one thing that could prevent this from happening again.
He’s made it clear: voting him out in November is life or death.
Contribute $5 to our One-Term President Fund to help us elect a president that puts American lives before cheap political scams.
Every donation helps to ensure that Democrats cast ballots in November, so we don’t have to endure another four years of this.

"-January 17, 2020-
-Holcomb’s State of the State disappoints, but doesn’t surprise-
On Tuesday, Governor Holcomb gave his State of the State speech. He stood behind the GOP’s push for “health care transparency” while failing to offer tangible ways to lower the cost of prescription drugs. He touted a decrease in Indiana’s infant mortality rate. He forgot to mention Indiana still lags far behind countries like Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. He failed to mention our maternal mortality rate, which rose in 2019 and is now ranked 48th in the country. And, the problem only gets worse for people of color.
Holcomb kicked the can on teacher pay. His ‘plan’? More than a year away, if ever. We’re also the state with the lowest salary increases since 2002. His plan gives teachers only half the money, Democrats have pushed for, and it does so a year too late.
-Democrats try to save Hoosiers’ health care-
Senate Resolution (SR 5) urges Attorney General Curtis Hill to withdraw Indiana from the lawsuit attempting to strike down the Affordable Care Act. If the ACA is terminated, federal funding for the Healthy Indiana Plan will cease, and hundreds of thousands of Hoosiers will no longer have access to affordable health care.
The lawsuit comes at a time when the cost of prescription drugs has increased drastically, and Hoosiers are in danger of losing their lives due to inaccessible care.
-House GOP attacks Hoosiers’ the right to choose-
House Bill No. 1089 was introduced in the state legislature. The bill consists of a total abortion ban in Indiana and advocates for the arrest of federal officials attempting to enforce contrary laws.
This bill, alongside the GOP’s inaction on health care costs, illustrates the perpetual irony of the GOP: if they were truly pro-life, they would focus on making life-saving treatment more accessible to Hoosiers rather than limiting access to safe and legal abortion.
-Democrats push for minimum wage raise-
Senator Mrvan filed SB 176 to raise Indiana’s minimum wage to $15 an hour. In 2020, 26 states and the District of Columbia have plans to raise the minimum wage. However, Indiana’s has not changed since 2008, and since then, the cost of living has increased significantly; the amount of Hoosiers’ income that expenses eat up has increased by more than 6% in the last decade. Mrvan’s bill would gradually raise the wage to reduce the impact on small businesses.
While raising the minimum wage would have significant positive impacts on our economy, Mrvan also cites its effects on mental health as a critical reason for his bill. A recent study demonstrated that raising the minimum wage would likely lower the suicide rate. Indiana falls in the top half of the country for the highest suicide rate; thus, this is an essential step in improving mental health in our state.
-Celebrating 100 years of Hoosier women voting-
On Thursday, we celebrated the 100th anniversary of Hoosier women receiving the vote. Since the Suffragettes’ hard-fought victory, Hoosier women have continued to make space for themselves in politics.
In 2019, Indiana Democrats elected countless women to public office, including a record number of women mayors. We know that this is a product of the hard work and sacrifice of the Suffragettes, and we are forever grateful for the progress they enabled.
-Blue Bench Training-
The Indiana Democratic Party, in partnership with the National Democratic Training Committee, is hosting a candidate training on January 25 in Indianapolis. However, we're unfortuntately limited to only 300 people and as of now, there are only a few spots left. Make sure to sign up soon!
More details and sign up here.
-Petition deadline approaching-
In 2020, we have a real shot at winning the Governor’s office, and petitions are the key to getting your candidate on the ballot. All three candidates to be our nominee for Governor in the fall need to gather 4,500 petition signatures of registered voters to get on the ballot.
1. Contact the campaigns and get looped in on how to collect signatures
1. Dr. Woody Myers – contact: Aaron Schaler - [[URL REDACTED]]
2. Josh Owens – contact: Claire Griffith - [[URL REDACTED]]
2. Print the petitions and hit the pavement
It's going to take a grassroots effort to win big in 2020. That effort starts today, and it starts with you, friend.

"The GOP has done everything they can to keep Hoosiers from voting by mail.
Chip in $25 to the ONLY initiative designed to help Hoosiers vote by mail.
Across the country, voting by mail has received bipartisan support. But the GOP has done nothing but lie about its efficacy and drag their feet on instituting no-fault voting by mail in the general election.
Here's the kicker: Indiana Republicans just conducted their entire convention via vote-by-mail ballots. And Donald Trump, mail-in voting's biggest opponent, has voted by mail for years.
So why have they done everything they can to stop voting by mail during a pandemic?
They're worried about what mail-in elections mean for Republicans. Because when everyone can vote, the GOP loses out.
Give $12 to help us minimize the risk at the ballot box this year.
They would rather put our lives at risk than give even the perception of expanded voting rights.
The GOP has made it clear: it's on us to make sure eligible Hoosiers have the tools to vote by mail.
That's why we created our Vote-by-Mail Outreach Program, an initiative focused on building educational tools, reaching out to eligible voters, and getting Hoosiers vote-by-mail applications.

"we have to scale the vote-by-mail program back
Team,
Our finance team just finished running the numbers, and it looks like we’re falling short of our October goals.
WEEK GOAL RAISED REMAINING
10/4-10/10 $8,000 $8,055 GOAL HIT
10/11-10/17 $6,700 $5,450 $1,250
10/18-10/21 $7,950 $900 $7,050
Wednesday’s deadline is one of the most critical of this election. It’s the last day we can garner the resources to get out our FINAL round of vote-by-mail application outreach. Can you chip in your first $3, or whatever you can, to help back this program?
This initiative is 100%-grassroots-funded. If we don’t raise the money to run ads, send texts, and make calls, we won’t be able to make sure eligible Hoosiers are ready to return their applications before the deadline on 10/22.
I'll be honest, if we have to scale the vote-by-mail program back, we risk losing more than 60,000 votes and significantly increasing the health threat at the ballot box.
Friend, we need your help. Will you chip in to save the vote-by-mail program?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:

"Indiana Republicans have started running attack ads on our candidates.
Team
I have some good news and some get-to-work news: Indiana Republicans have started running attack ads on our candidates.
The GOP is so terrified of the momentum we've built; they're draining their campaign funds trying to take us down.
They know we are on track to send a wave of Democrats to the Indiana General Assembly -- just in time to draw fair electoral districts and stop their partisan gerrymandering once and for all.
This GOP's shady tactics are a last-ditch effort to stop us. However, their six-figure spending is the kind of money that tips elections against the voice of the people. So, I'm asking for your help today. Can you rush your first $3 to our GOTV program to help us reach our quarterly goal? We're still over $8k short with just six days left.
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
We need to break the Republican supermajority this year. Right now, the prospects are looking really, really good. However, the GOP is not going down without a fight.
Indiana Republicans have held a supermajority long enough. They've shown they are only at the State House to pocket cash from special interests -- not to protect our families or serve our communities.
Voting has already begun. We've got no time to waste — chip in $3 to the Indiana Democratic Party to help us reach our quarterly goal.
Thanks so much -- now let's get to work,
John Zody
Chairman, Indiana Democratic Party

-Launching the 2020 Vote-by-Mail Program-
Right now, COVID-19 cases are surging, and the GOP still hasn’t agreed to an expanded vote-by-mail general election. However, we aren’t wasting any time getting every eligible Hoosier the tools to vote by mail in the 2020 general election.
We’re launching an outreach program to minimize the number of Dems at the ballot box this year by making sure eligible Hoosiers know they can vote by mail. This means:
1. Running a texting and phonebanking program to let eligible Hoosiers know they can vote by mail
2. Sending eligible Hoosiers vote-by-mail applications
3. Providing ongoing support for Hoosiers voting by mail
We're just $1,500 away from our startup goal.
Will you chip in $12 to help us launch the 2020 Vote-by-Mail Outreach Program?
Our Vote-by-Mail Outreach Program is 100% grassroots funded. We’re counting on supporters like you to keep Hoosiers safe during this election.
-Pence threatens Hoosiers' health-
Today, VP Mike Pence is back in Indiana doing what he does best: threatening Hoosiers' health.
Pence is returning to push his careless scheme to rapidly reopen schools on Hoosiers.
As schools across the country have been forced to reopen, teachers are writing their wills and parents are terrified for their children's safety. But Mike Pence is doing everything he can to reopen schools without a plan.
The infamously anti-science Pence has outwardly rejected the CDC's guidelines, instead, signaling that science shouldn't be a factor in schools' approach to reopening.
We're asking 1,000 Hoosiers to take the pledge to Fire Mike Pence before he leaves Indiana.
Will you show VP Pence where you stand? Take the pledge here.
-Democrats call for special session-
This week, Indiana House and Senate Democrats called on Gov. Holcomb to convene a special legislative session to address police reform and expand no-fault voting by mail for all Hoosier voters in the general election.
During a press conference held at the Indiana State House, Sen. Eddie Melton (D-Gary) said in the wake of widespread protests over racial injustice and police brutality, Indiana leaders have done nothing concrete to show they believe Black Lives Matter.
""Because it is not an exaggeration when we say that lives are on the line,"" Melton said. ""Allowing the deep and structural problems in our criminal justice system to continue to prevail is not an option.""
Senate Minority Leader Tim Lanane, D-Anderson, added, ""The violence against Black and brown Hoosiers is blatantly clear, yet all we hear is silence from the governor's office on the IBLC's clear list of immediate solutions. How does this show residents of our state that Black lives actually matter?""
-Rest in power, Congressman Lewis, and the Reverend Vivian-
We have lost a part of the soul of our country in the passing of Rep. John Lewis and Rev. C.T. Vivian. Lewis and Vivian exhibited a moral clarity that could cut through the hatefulness that enshrouded our country and illuminate the righteous path.
Their words will echo through history, but it is their courageous action that has cemented lasting change.
As Congressman Lewis and the Reverend Vivian showed us in the towering achievements made by their hands, lasting progress toward justice is gained only through action.
Their hard-fought victories and immeasurable sacrifices show us that the only way to honor their legacy is to march forward in the fight for justice and equality.
-We want to hear from you-
Health care is on the line for thousands of Hoosiers in 2020. We're fighting hard to make sure no one has to wonder how they're going to afford necessary treatment.
And that starts with understanding the importance of health care in every community.
Will you fill out this brief survey to tell us what health care means to you?
-The 2020 Candidate Toolbox-
We're launching our 2020 Candidate Toolbox, a collection of campaign tips, Indiana stats, and digital content for Hoosier Dems running for office in 2020!
Candidates can email Zoe King, at [[URL REDACTED]] for access!

"-April 10, 2020-
-We launched a Vote by Mail Fund-
For the first time, EVERY SINGLE HOOSIER voter can vote by mail in the June 2 primary election. That’s huge because Hoosiers shouldn’t have to put their health at risk to exercise their right to vote.
Republicans still haven’t agreed to mail every voter an application to receive their ballot at home. But we're not waiting. We're raising money to expand our voter outreach.
If you are able to support expanding vote by mail to every Hoosier, can you chip in $10?
Need a hand applying to vote by mail? Check out the vote-by-mail flowchart here for deadlines and instructions on registering to vote, applying to vote by mail, and mailing in your ballot. You can also find a 30-second video on how to fill out your vote by mail application here.
-Indiana continues to lag behind other states in testing-
Yesterday, COVID-19 testing fell for the third day in a row. Every single neighboring state is testing more per 100,000 than Indiana. And on a per-capita basis, Indiana is the 39th state for testing.
As the number of cases continues to rise, testing is a critical step in stopping the spread of COVID-19. But Gov. Holcomb is in no rush to guarantee COVID-19 tests for every Hoosier that needs them.
This week, Holcomb claimed to be ""pouring it on"" in regard to Indiana's COVID-19 response.
If he's ""pouring it on"" then why are we lagging behind all of our neighboring states and most of the country?
-Rep. GiaQuinta fights for paid sick leave-
House Democratic Leader Phil GiaQuinta has once again urged Gov. Holcomb to ensure that all employers are given 80 hours of paid sick leave. Guaranteed paid sick leave means that sick Hoosiers don’t have to choose between potentially exposing others to COVID-19 and their livelihood.
Holcomb has asked that Hoosiers stay at home, but has done little to flatten the curve regarding the workplace. He has not only failed to ensure paid sick leave but also dragged his feet on enforcing that only essential businesses stay open.
Without these workplace protections, workers and their families will remain vulnerable to COVID-19.
-As cases rise, PPE is not guaranteed-
Personal protective equipment is necessary to keep our first responders and health care providers safe. But as COVID-19 cases continue to rise in Indiana, the state's ability to replenish PPE is uncertain.
Gov. Holcomb has assured Hoosiers that he is confident in Trump’s response to the pandemic. Still, health officials aren’t counting on Trump to deliver more PPE from the national stockpile.
Gov. Holcomb, are you still confident in Trump’s response?
-COVID-19 Relief-
We have created a running list of ways you can help others as well as receive relief during this time; you can see what's going on statewide and in your county here.

"GOP Senators voted down a Democratic proposal that would’ve required charter schools to refund the state in instances of fraud.
-February 28, 2020-
-Republicans vote in favor of virtual charter schools-
Under Indiana’s current policy, two virtual charter schools were able to inflate their enrollment and defraud the state of $68 million.
The schools’ ability to steal millions of dollars was a direct result of the limited oversight for virtual charter schools.
Yet, GOP Senators voted down a Democratic proposal that would’ve required charter schools to refund the state in instances of fraud.
And while it makes zero sense to reject this proposal, the GOP has taken over $100,000 from the virtual charter schools involved in the scandal.
It looks like they have 100,000 reasons to maintain the status quo.
-The GOP can't cover up the truth-
Republicans may be in the midst of damage control, but they’re not fooling us.
This week, Holcomb and his cronies claimed they would donate the money they received from the defamed virtual charter schools.
But here’s the catch: the contributions date back years, and the GOP kept taking the cash even after it became clear the schools were stealing. And they didn’t even acknowledge these contributions until we called on them to donate the money.
They only stopped because they got caught.
-Pence put in charge of coronavirus outbreak-
Hoosiers know the kind of disaster that ensues whenever Mike Pence gets near a public health crisis. Just a few years ago, he enabled the worst HIV outbreak in Indiana’s history. And he’s spent his political career discrediting basic science with statements like “smoking doesn’t kill.”
We literally couldn’t think of a worse person to tackle the coronavirus, but that didn’t stop Donald Trump from appointing him to the position.
Sign our petition if you agree, Pence shouldn't be leading us in a pandemic.
-County Party Summit-
Ready to receive the trainings and tools you need to build a county party organization that elects Hoosier Democrats this fall?
On March 7th, we’re holding our 2020 County Party Summit. We will provide you with the tools to engage with new volunteers, fundraise, and turn energy into action. It’s going to be an interactive day with: panels, breakout sessions and Q&A’s, so bring your questions and get ready to meet Party leadership from around the state.

-We're Hiring-
We’re hiring a Data Director and a Political Director at our headquarters in Indianapolis!
The Data Director will manage the day-to-day voter file needs of the State Party, county party organizations, state and federal campaigns, and activists.
The Political Director will work during the primary election season. They will help manage the political affairs of the Party, build party infrastructure, and prepare for the 2020 State and National Conventions.

"Hoosier Democrats –
The 2020 election will be the most important election of our lives. The stakes could not be higher. In the White House, a President seeks to inflame divisions and refuses to examine the systemic racism that afflicts our country.
That same President wasted precious time, compounding the impact of COVID-19. Too many lost loved ones and now families are facing unemployment levels not seen since the Great Depression.
Health care. Public education. Paid sick leave. Voting rights. They are all on the ballot.
We’re facing the fight of our lifetimes but Hoosier Democrats from around the state have stepped up and put their names on the ballot. They know when we lead with our values, we win. In these unprecedented times, we need voices at every level of government ready and willing to make progress.
On June 12, Hoosier Democrats will come together for our Hoosier Hospitality Dinner – held virtually -- and recommit to building a better tomorrow.
We’ll hear from my friend Congresswoman Cheri Bustos – Chair of the DCCC and tasked with protecting the House majority – on our path forward.
Join us on June 12 and in this fight to build a better Indiana and a stronger, more just country.
\--Congressman André Carson

"We’re a little under halfway to our April goal of raising $30,000 for our Vote-by-Mail Outreach Initiative.
Chip in $25 to help us reach our goal.
Last week the GOP blocked our amendments to extend the date Hoosiers could request and return mail-in ballots and other common sense initiatives to make vote by mail more convenient. That means there are 24 days to make sure Hoosiers sign up to vote by mail.
There’s no time to waste. We’re building an outreach campaign to get out the vote now. Every dollar more we raise is another Hoosier voter we can encourage to vote by mail.
Chip in $15 to help us make sure no Hoosier has to choose between their health and their voice.
Friend, this is about maintaining everyone’s right to vote without jeopardizing the health of poll workers and voters.
If everyone reading this gave just $5, we’d be able to make sure that every voter has the tools to vote safely in the primary.
Will you give $5 to help us build our Vote-by-Mail Outreach Initiative before it’s too late?
Our Vote by Mail Fund is 100% grassroots funded. Your contributions are what make it possible to reach out to Hoosier voters.

"-March 6, 2020-
-Once again, the GOP attacks public schools-
In 2010, Governor Mitch Daniels cut $300 million from public school funding. Since then, public schools have been using been local referendums to increase their funding because state money doesn't cut it.
The GOP's latest attack on public schools aims to take all that away. This week, the Senate voted to allow charter schools to use their referendum dollars.
Yep. The revenue public schools were forced to create for themselves is being siphoned off to charter schools.
-Hoosiers are paying for Pence's assault on women's rights-
As Governor, Mike Pence enacted an illegal abortion law that is costing Hoosier taxpayers more than $180,000 in legal fees. This week, a federal judge ordered the Indiana attorney general's office to pay the ACLU for challenging Pence's 2016 genetic abnormality abortion law.
Pence assaulted women's rights, and now Hoosiers have to foot the bill.
-Hoosiers are dying, and the GOP won't take action.-
Hoosiers are dying because they can't afford insulin. The average cost of the drug has risen by nearly $200 in the last decade.
On Monday, Senator JD Ford introduced an amendment that would combat this problem by capping the price of the drug at $100.
100% of Democrats voted to make the drug more affordable, but the bill failed because the GOP voted it down. They've consistently shown us that they will always put special interests before Hoosiers.
-Happy Women's History Month-
March is Women's History Month! The Indiana Democratic Party is glad to celebrate the many Hoosier women that have worked hard to move us toward justice and equality. We are so grateful for all the women that continue to fight for our future and the chance to fight alongside them.
Together, we will break barriers and build an Indiana that works for everyone.

"51 years ago, the Stonewall Uprising ignited the fight for LGBTQ+ equality.
Friend, chip in $20.20 to make sure their fight doesn’t stop in 2020.
In the last 51 years, we accomplished marriage equality, we fought Mike Pence’s discriminatory RFRA, and we’ve elected LGBTQ+ representatives in the General Assembly and in cities across our state.
But now, all this progress is at stake.
This month, Trump reversed health care protections for transgender Americans. Curtis Hill is trying to rob LBGTQ+ parents of their parental rights. And anti-discrimination policies have narrowly escaped conservative SCOTUS judges.
One thing is clear: the GOP won't stop attacking the progress we've made. And if we keep Republicans like Trump and Hill in office we risk going back.
Contribute $12 to help us stop them from getting re-elected.
Friend, when you give to our 2020 Grassroots Fund, you help us make calls, expand our vote-by-mail operation, and get Democrats to the polls in November.
Will you give $7 to help us build the campaign to vote out every single anti-LGBTQ+ candidate on the ballot this year?
We can’t let 51 years of fighting be in vain.

"Friend,
Over a month ago, we launched our Vote-by-Mail Outreach Initiative. To date, hundreds of thousands of Hoosiers have applied to vote by mail.
Chip in $20 to help us reach even more voters.
Nearly three in every five vote-by-mail applications have gone to Democrats. That tells us our Vote-by-Mail Outreach Initiative is working. But thousands of registered voters still haven’t applied to vote by mail. That means we can’t stop now.
We believe voting by mail is the ONLY way to keep voters and poll workers safe during a global pandemic. So, we are going to keep fighting to get out the vote safely.
Contribute $15 to make sure Hoosiers don’t have to risk their health to vote.
Our goal is to raise $10,000 by May 19, so we can reach every voter that hasn’t applied to vote by mail before it’s too late.
Every dollar you give goes toward sending texts and running ads on social media so that every voter has the tools to vote safely in the primary.
Friend, this is the only way we can get out the vote without putting Hoosiers’ health on the line.
Will you chip in $10 to help us reach every Hoosier?

"-April 17, 2020-
-The Election Commission meets to discuss the primary-
On Friday, the Election Commission met to discuss voting in the 2020 primary.
From the onset, Hoosier Democrats’ position has been to ensure voting is safe, secure and convenient for everyone involved. The agreement the Election Commission reached ensures that local officials have more flexibility in administering the primary election during this unprecedented time.
Democrats fought to make sure strong health guidelines were included in the order, as well as working to make it easier to recruit poll workers and expand sites to count absentee ballots with an expected increase in volume.
In addition, issues were raised by Democrats at the meeting regarding absentee voting deadlines and mailing an absentee ballot application to voters. Unfortunately, these were voted down by the Republicans on the Commission.
But Hoosier Democrats won't give up. We will continue the discussion on why vote-by-mail is the safest option at next week’s April 22 hearing.
The good news is, we aren't wasting any time. We've launched a 100%-grassroots-funded, Vote-by-Mail Outreach Program to make sure Hoosiers know they can vote by mail. But we can't do it without supporters like you helping us get the word out.
Will you give $12 to help voters across our state get access to safe and secure voting by mail?
-Cases reach new single-day high; testing hits a low point-
On Thursday, we reached a record, single-day high of 611 new COVID-19 cases. But this week, testing dropped again, hitting numbers similar to where it was when it first became available to the general public.
As the number of cases rises, Indiana has continued to test well below its capacity. As of Thursday, Indiana had conducted less than half the total number of tests Illinois had done.
This is especially problematic in long-term facilities, where healthy people are living in close quarters with COVID-19 patients. Nursing homes are working blind, unable to diagnose and separate sick residents from healthy ones.
But, Gov. Holcomb has presented zero ideas and no timeline to ramp up testing to save lives.
Help us call on Holcomb to step up and get Hoosiers the tests they need. Sign on to the petition here.
-Rep. Hollingsworth is willing to trade in lives for money-
At the height of the coronavirus outbreak, Trey Hollingsworth was quoted saying that the country will have to choose ""a loss of American lives"" over ""a loss of our way of life as Americans.""
While the Indiana Congressman knows that re-opening the economy would result in the death of countless Americans, he has made it abundantly clear he just doesn’t care.
Let’s not mince words, Hollingsworth is an out-of-touch millionaire with more concern for shareholders’ pocketbooks than Hoosiers' lives.
We’re calling on Hollingsworth to apologize to the Hoosiers whose lives he devalued and those who have lost loved ones to COVID-19. Join us in demanding an apology here.
-We’re moving the 2020 State Convention online-
On Tuesday, the Party officially announced that it would hold its 2020 State Convention on June 13 with events held virtually and votes cast by mail.
The plan to go virtual was unanimously approved by the Party’s State Central Committee.
We are confident that this is the safest way to bring Hoosier Democrats from around the state together and maintain a critical element of the electoral process.

"Mike Pence has spent his entire political career belittling women, spewing sexist rhetoric, and bending over backward to rob us of our rights. Now, we get to watch a woman replace him.
Chip in $20.20 to the Fire Mike Pence Fund.
Pence’s decades-old history of sexism is as outdated and tired as his vice presidency. He has belittled and mocked women in the military. He has done everything in his power to take away our reproductive rights. He’s embraced violence against women and outwardly endorsed Trump’s demeaning comments about us.
In 2017, he infamously said he wouldn’t meet with a woman without his wife present, quite literally removing our seat at the table.
With Kamala’s bid for office, we’re not just taking our seat back; we’re sitting at the head.
Contribute $13 to get our seat back.
No Hoosier needs reminding of the damage Mike Pence did as our governor, so after she wipes the floor with him in the October 7 debate – let’s make sure his home state votes him out on November 3.
Will you give $7 to show Mike Pence where his home state stands?
Every dollar goes toward making calls, sending texts, and getting out the vote so we can Fire Mike Pence in 2020.

-The GOP's cringeworthy bid for AG-
Last night, the GOP held their 2020 Convention Preview. The broadcast, designed to showcase their four (yes, four) Attorney General candidates, turned into a bare-knuckled takedown of Curtis Hill and a clear indicator that they won't win the AG race in November.
Hill's disgraceful criminal battery charges, his misuse of taxpayer dollars for grandiose office renovations, and the dwindling likelihood of him keeping the seat in November were all on the menu.
Todd Rokita, the Party's other frontrunner, is the only candidate to lose the race to replace Mike Pence as governor AND lose the 2018 Indiana Senate primary AND be drawn out of his legislative district by his own Party.
But each of their candidates had two crucial things in common: the unwavering desire to strip Hoosiers of their health care and rob us of our right to choose.
The good news is the Cook Political Report moved the Indiana Attorney General's race from ""leans Republican"" to a toss-up.
We created our Fire Curtis Hill Fund to back the campaign to flip his seat. Every dollar goes toward getting Dems voting in November to protect our rights, save our health care and bring integrity back to the AG's office.
Will you give $7 to help us hit the ground running?
-This week's SCOTUS victories-
The last four days have brought two major victories in the US Supreme Court.
On Monday, the SCOTUS ruled that the 1964 Civil Rights Act protects gay, lesbian, and transgender employees from discrimination based on sex.
Yesterday, the Court blocked Trump from ending DACA. The 5-4 ruling maintains the Obama-era program that protects immigrants brought to the US as children from deportation.
For those affected, these rulings are affirmations that their jobs, their homes, and their humanity will live to see another day. This is what we fight for.
But the work isn't done yet. The DACA ruling was based on the procedural requirements to end the program. This means Trump can still terminate it if he can take the necessary steps. Similarly, the basic rights of the LBGTQ+ community are at stake if Trump gets another SCOTUS pick.
It's essential that we solidify these rulings at the ballot box in November. We can't let Trump take them back.
-Juneteenth-
One hundred fifty-five years ago, the last of the enslaved Black population in Galveston, Texas, received word that they were officially free.
This year's Juneteenth comes just 25 days after the tragic murder of George Floyd. In these 25 days, Americans have fought hard against the racism pervading not only our criminal justice system but also our health care, schools, and businesses.
The perennial fight of Black Americans shows us that the existence of freedom does not temper the absence of equality. If we are genuinely striving for a more perfect union, we must not let their fight for equality fall upon deaf ears.
So, while today is a day to celebrate freedom, it's also vital that we don't lose sight of the future.

"Tonight marks the first big deadline before our 2020 Safe Voting Initiative begins. We’ve got until MIDNIGHT to raise $2,516.
Reaching this goal will be no small feat. It’s going to take all hands on deck. That's why I'm calling on you to help us get there. Will you chip in $25.16 to help build the 2020 Safe Voting Initiative?
Grassroots donations are always vital to the survival of our GOTV program.
But tonight’s deadline is particularly important. If we don’t hit the ground running tomorrow, we risk losing the momentum we’ve built.
Let me be clear: whatever you can afford to contribute today will go further than that same amount would two months from now. Every dollar you give today helps us educate Hoosiers on their options to vote safely before the election day hustle begins.
Chip in $15 to become a founding member of the 2020 Safe Voting Initiative.
In 2020, it’s not enough to just get out the vote. We’ve got to do it in numbers our opponents can’t obscure. We’ve got to do it while keeping Hoosiers safe and protecting Dems from the GOP’s rampant voter suppression.
The GOP is banking on us failing. They're doing everything they can to ensure that we won't vote. They’re scrambling to out-fundraise us in the 11th hour because they don't think our grassroots campaign can out-run their dark-money backed schemes.
We’re counting on you to help prove them wrong.
Contribute $10 to help us hit the ground running tomorrow.

"We’re officially one week into September, and we’ve already made huge strides in getting our 2020 Safe Voting Initiative off the ground. Here’s what you’ve helped us accomplish:
1. We’ve hired new staff members to run a field program designed to educate voters on their candidates and their options to vote safely in 2020. They’ve already been on the phones every day recruiting volunteers and talking about our winning message.
2. We built voter registration teams at colleges across the state. Then, we sent them pandemic-approved voter registration kits to safely register young voters.
3. We’ve held one virtual event to engage with young voters and have another one planned.
4. We created countless voter education tools with the help of a legal team. Now, we’re releasing them and sharing them with campaigns.
5. We produced a series of webinars to help candidates adjust to campaigning during a public health crisis.
6. We hired FOUR new interns that will help expand our capacity to get out the vote.
7. We hired new staff to help us run a record-breaking vote-by-mail program.
The 2020 Safe Voting Initiative is our largest GOTV effort to date. It doesn’t stop there. Here’s what is left to get done:
1. We need to follow up with voters who have received our application to vote by mail.
2. Our college voter registration teams have set a goal of registering more than 10,000 first-time voters. They’re also gearing up to run a texting program to mobilize the voters they register.
3. We’ve got to run a massive texting program to educate voters on their options to vote safely.
4. Once voting starts, we’ve got to maintain a voter protection hotline with legal help ready to thwart the GOP's attempts at voter suppression.
5. Our field staffers have a goal of making hundreds of thousands of calls and sending even more texts before the election.
To reach these goals, we need to contact thousands of voters, purchase texting and phone banking software, produce and ship voter registration kits, maintain a big staff and engage legal help for our voter protection program.
That means we've got to raise $20k by the end of September.
Team, this initiative is 100% grassroots-backed. If we’re going to win, we need your support.
Will you chip in to the 2020 Safe Voting Initiative to help us reach our goals?

"Friend, this week, we launched our Down-Ballot Victory Program to build local and county-level campaigns in every corner of our state. And we’re just $3,000 away from our 5K startup goal!
Chip in $20.20 to help us hit the ground running.
Right now, Democrats are out-raising, out-polling, and out-campaigning their GOP counterparts. Early investments in campaigns have caused countless races across the state to move from “leans Republican” toward a Democratic win.

Will you give $15 to help us hit our goal before Friday?

"In 2019, two first-time women candidates flipped their seats and made history as the first Democrats elected to the Fishers City Council.
Councilors Sam DeLong and Jocelyn Vare are two women, mothers, and first-time Democratic candidates who put in the work to win.
DeLong went door to door with one child on her hip and the other holding her hand. Vare knocked thousands of doors and racked up the most votes a Democrat has ever received for the council.
They were underestimated. But they worked tirelessly for their wins.
We’re building off the momentum candidates like Councilors DeLong and Vare created in 2019. We’re fighting for women, mothers, first-timers, and Democrats to take seats they said we'd never win.

"-February 7, 2020-
-Celebrating Black History Month-
Black History Month has officially begun! Hoosier Democrats are excited to spend the month celebrating the collective work of African American inventors, entrepreneurs, and community leaders that have changed our state and the world. Together, we will build a better Indiana for all of us.
-Protections for pregnant workers gutted by Senate GOP-
Nearly every Senate Republican voted against providing reasonable workplace accommodations to pregnant workers.
The bill would have helped to combat our disgraceful maternal and infant mortality rates. But the GOP thought the accommodations, which included ""unpaid time off work to recover from childbirth,"" ""temporary transfer to a less hazardous position,"" and ""assistance with physical or manual labor,"" were too much to ask for.
They've shown us once again they have no interest in protecting working families and children.
-Trump gives meh State of the Union-
On Tuesday, Trump gave the annual State of the Union. In true Trump fashion, it was nothing more than a series of lies, manipulated statistics, and taking credit when none was due.
Some of his most concerning statements were regarding public schools. ""For too long, countless American children have been trapped in failing government schools,"" Trump alleged. It's no secret he wants to pump billions of dollars into for-profit/voucher schools, stripping public education of funding.
With Indiana officials like Eric Holcomb, we can't afford another person in office tearing down our public education system.
-Senate fails to bring justice in impeachment trial-
The Senate cleared Trump of both impeachment charges this week. 48 Senators found him guilty of abuse of power, and 47 found him guilty of obstruction of Congress. Our Senators, Mike Braun and Todd Young, sided with the president. Sadly, they've opted to hold Trump to a much lower standard.
Even worse, they refused to call for witnesses last week. Fair trials have witnesses. An acquittal from an unfair trial is meaningless.
-Celebrating the first-ever LGBTQ+ Statehouse Day-
On Monday, Democrats rallied at the Statehouse for the LGBTQ+ Statehouse Day. They spoke about seeking anti-discrimination protections for members of the LGBTQ+ community and stopping the GOP's recent anti-trans efforts.
-We've launched a monthly donor club-
2020 is the most important election of our lives. Health care, education, and democracy are all on the ballot. So, we need to start building the bench and getting out the vote now.
When you join the monthly donor club, you're helping us expand our capacity to take back our state. Plus, you get exclusive deals on merchandise!

"Hey friend, -- Just wanted to give you an update, our Vote-by-Mail Outreach Initiative has enabled us to reach out to thousands of Hoosiers Democrats to help them vote by mail. Your donations are making the difference. Here's just a couple of the conversations we've had with Hoosier Democrats:
It's working. Nearly three in every five vote-by-mail applications have gone to Democrats. And countless voters have thanked us for getting them the information they needed. We'd like to expand our effort in the last 48 hours before the deadline to apply to vote by mail on May 21.
Contribute $25 to help make the next 48 hours count.
Help us connect with another 10,000 Hoosier voters by contributing this morning. Anything you can chip in will be directed to voter outreach before the May 21 deadline.
You stepped up and chipped in and we've been able to help Hoosier Democrats vote by mail. It's as simple as that. Thank you for everything you've been able to do.

"Eric Holcomb is one of the least-known governors in the country. Even after three years in office, more than a quarter of Hoosiers haven’t even heard of Holcomb.

Here’s what you can do right now: petitions. All three candidates to be our nominee for governor in the fall need to gather 4,500 petition signatures of registered voters to get on the ballot.
1. Contact the campaigns and get looped in on how to collect signatures

"-August 21, 2020-
-It's official-
The coronavirus has leveled our economy, and tragically left hundreds of thousands of Americans grieving the loss of loved ones too soon. Millions of Americans are without the certainty of a job and a steady paycheck and don’t know if they’ll be able to make rent or cover prescriptions. The global pandemic has brought three and a half years of Donald Trump’s failed leadership into sharp relief.
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are ready to lead. They’re ready to solve this public health crisis. They’re ready to dismantle the barriers that have kept too many Hoosiers and Americans from getting ahead and building back a better, more inclusive economy.
Hoosier Democrats are hungry for change. We’re ready to spend the next 75 days doing everything it takes to send Joe and Kamala to the White House and write the epilogue of Donald Trump’s disastrous presidency.
Can you chip in $7 to help us build the campaign to defeat Trump right here in Indiana?
-When Eric Holcomb shows you who he is, believe him the first time-
Holcomb’s Tuesday address on equity and inclusion was nothing more than a shameless grab at reelection in a state that has outgrown him. In the last four years, Holcomb enjoyed legislative majorities and the political capital to muscle legislation through. If he wanted to take action on systemic racism, we would have seen it by now.
Holcomb’s speech underlined the significant racial disparities in COVID-19, with black Hoosiers making up 20% of all cases and deaths. But in reality, Holcomb has exacerbated this issue by neglecting to put permanent testing centers in areas with a large population of minorities.
He touted his improvements on Indiana’s shameful infant mortality rate, which currently sits at one of the worst in the nation with the rate for black babies at more than double their white counterparts’.
He also vowed to recruit more minority teachers after spending the last four years plummeting Indiana’s teacher salary growth to the lowest in the country. Under Holcomb, we lose 35 percent of our teachers in the first five years, with 88 percent citing pay as the reason for leaving.
-We're hiring-
We’re staffing up our statewide voter outreach effort and we want you to help us elect Hoosier Democrats up and down the ballot in 2020.
We’re hiring a field admin assistant starting immediately.
We know Indiana Republicans will dump millions of dollars in an effort to buy this election. It’s why we’re committed to a grassroots approach that builds genuine relationships, one voter contact at a time.
Take a look at the positions at [[URL REDACTED]] and submit your applications no later than Tuesday, August 25. Details on the applications process are in each position description.
-The Young Professionals Virtual Event-
You're invited to a virtual fireside chat featuring young Hoosier Democrats leading the way!
Join Pete for America Campaign Manager Mike Schmuhl; Evansville City Council President Alex Burton; and candidate for State Senate District 36 Ashley Eason as they discuss their journeys, where they see the Party heading, and how young Hoosier Democrats can continue to lead in our state.
Grab your virtual ticket today and reserve your spot at the early bird rate. Tickets are just $15, and audience members will be able to join the discussion and ask questions!
When: August 27th at 6:30 PM EDT
Where: Zoom link will provided via email after signing up

-We want to hear from you-
Health care is on the line for thousands of Hoosiers in 2020. We're fighting hard to make sure no one has to wonder how they're going to afford necessary treatment.
And that starts with understanding the importance of health care in every community.
Will you fill out this brief survey to tell us what health care means to you?
-The 2020 Candidate Toolbox-
We're launching our 2020 Candidate Toolbox, a collection of campaign tips, Indiana stats, and digital content for Hoosier Dems running for office in 2020!
Candidates can email Zoe King, at [[URL REDACTED]] for access!

"Right now, Pence is on his way to Indiana to tout the incompetence of the Trump-Pence Administration. Since the beginning of the pandemic, the White House has done nothing but discredit medical professionals, reject science, and politicize necessary precautions – and now Mike Pence thinks he can bring it home?
Show VP Pence where you stand. Invest $20.20 in the Fire Mike Pence Fund.
As our governor, Pence made national headlines when his disregard for public health lead to the largest HIV outbreak in Indiana's history.
Now, he's making the same life-threatening blunders on a national scale.
Chip in $16 to build the campaign to vote him out.
We can no longer let this administration devalue American lives with its hateful rhetoric and, worse, its complete inaction. So, we're asking 500 Hoosiers to invest in the Fire Mike Pence Fund by MIDNIGHT tonight to show him where his home state stands.
Will you contribute $5.50 to show Pence where YOU stand?
Friend, Hoosiers know what happens when Pence is in charge of public health. It's up to us to make sure no one has to endure another four years of his science-denying, life-threatening, political stunts.

-Thirteen days left to apply to vote by mail-
Over 200,000 Hoosiers have applied to vote by mail. 59% of those applications were for Democratic ballots, and we aren't done yet.

2. Download the form to mail it in here.

-Democrat, Linda Lawson, files to be Lieutenant Governor-
Former State Representative Linda Lawson has officially filed to be the Party’s nominee for Lieutenant Governor. The Indiana Democratic Party issued the following statement on her filing:
“Linda Lawson is a fighter. In law enforcement and at the Statehouse, she was a trailblazer and a steadfast advocate on issues like pay equity and for victims of domestic violence. Lawson brings a knowledge of the Statehouse that is second to none. In Rep. Lawson, Woody Myers gains an experienced lawmaker and a partner ready to lead on day one.""
-Holcomb trades in Hoosier lives-
On April 22, Indiana was projected to lose 971 Hoosiers to COVID-19 by August 4. Then Gov. Holcomb decided to reopen the economy, and that number jumped to 6,247.
That's a 543% increase in deaths. Holcomb's decision to lift regulations rapidly is projected to cross out the equivalent of an entire town. It's roughly equivalent to the entire population of Cicero.
The Governor has chosen one of the most aggressive reopening plans in the country. Still, he has built one of the least successful responses to date.
Indiana saw it's second-highest, single-day spike in COVID-19 cases on Wednesday. There is no contact tracking program in place. Indiana still fails to meet the testing requirements put in place by experts. And we have a higher fatality rate per capita than neighboring states.
Gov. Holcomb is playing Russian roulette with Hoosiers' lives.
We're joining the collection of governors and health care officials that have asked Holcomb to put Hoosiers lives first and postpone reopening. We can't stand by and let him put lives on the line.
Will you help us fight to save Hoosiers' lives by signing our petition?
-Gov. Holcomb in a pandemic: non-essential travel, ignoring social distancing, going maskless in restaurants-
It's been clear that Gov. Holcomb isn't taking the pandemic seriously. But last weekend, he showed us #NextLevel carelessness.
Holcomb took a non-essential trip to Brown County and was spotted maskless in a restaurant taking selfies with guests.
A month ago, Brown County officials petitioned Holcomb to shut down state parks to stop non-essential travel to their county and keep residents safe.
Now, Holcomb is vacationing there and ignoring nearly every public health measure designed to stop the spread.
Hoosiers have made countless sacrifices to keep each other safe. Our governor won't do the same.

-Voter Registration Deadline-
The deadline to register to vote is MONDAY, OCTOBER 5.
The GOP is doing everything they can to keep us from voting. They’ve made it clear: we’ve got to vote in numbers they can’t ignore. But we can't do that unless a record number of Hoosier Dems are registered to vote this year.
You can find out if you’re registered here by clicking “Check Voting Status.” Make sure your current address is correct; if not, update it!
There are three ways to register:
1. If you have an Indiana driver’s license or ID, register online here by MIDNIGHT local time.
2. You can print the Voter Registration Form and mail in or hand-deliver the form to your county clerk. Any registration form postmarked on or before October 5 can be accepted if the voter is otherwise eligible.
3. You can call your county clerk. If their office is open, you can ask to pick up the form and complete it.
We can’t get out the vote if you and your friends and family aren’t registered. Will you send our voter registration page to THREE people and make sure they’re ready to vote?
-Holcomb’s untimely reopen causes surge-
Two weeks ago, Indiana had the sixth-best rate of COVID-19 spread in the nation. Now, just a week after Holcomb decided to reopen at full capacity, Indiana’s rate has moved to the fourth worst.
Holcomb’s plan to move forward defied experts’ advice. And even as the rate skyrockets and hospitalizations surge, Holcomb has doubled down on his decision.
It looks like Hoosiers’ health is a non-factor in Holcomb’s plan.
-INDems launch Ballot Ready-
This week, we added to our GOTV arsenal with a new tool to see who’s on your ballot!
You can find a comprehensive list of your candidates as well as their websites and social media pages. Visit [[URL REDACTED]] and scroll to “Find out who’s on your ballot” to check it out!
-Can you step up?-
This election is just 32 days away and the stakes couldn’t be higher. Our voter outreach team is working 24/7 to turn Hoosier Democrats out to win up and down the ballot.
But they can’t do it without you.
Friend, we’re running a grassroots campaign. We aren’t buying our support; we’re reaching out to voters and earning it. That’s going to take all hands on deck.
Can you take some time this week to make sure we reach as many voters as possible?

Check out the 2020 program with events now until June 19th here.
-Volunteer Opportunity, June 15-17th-
We're gearing up for our 2020 State Convention on June 13th. And we're looking for volunteers to help count state delegates' ballots on June 15th - June 17th in Indianapolis.
This is a critical step in the 2020 election; it's the last step in our process to select a nominee for attorney general and kick Curtis Hill out of office. So, we need all hands on deck.

-Holcomb, it’s time to step up for Black Hoosiers-
Indiana Black Legislative Caucus has released a series of proposals to protect Black Hoosiers from police brutality. They’ve requested things like banning the use of chokeholds by police during arrests and instituting statewide use of body and dashboard cameras. Gov. Holcomb hasn’t committed to passing any of their proposals yet.
Here’s how you can help call on Holcomb to support the IBLC’s reforms:
1. Take 90 seconds and call Gov. Holcomb’s office at 317-232-4567.
2. Tell the governor to support and stand with the Indiana Black Legislative Caucus and commit to passing every plank of their policy reforms next session.
3. Share your experience on Facebook and Twitter. Make sure to tag us!

"It's the biggest opportunity to help get out the vote to date.
Hey friend --
I just wanted to make sure you saw this. It's the biggest opportunity to help get out the vote to date. Every donor that gives their first donation of the year to our Vote by Mail Fund will have their contribution TRIPLE MATCHED.
We are relying on our 100%-grassroots-backed, Vote-by-Mail Outreach Initiative to make sure every Hoosier has the tools to vote by mail. Will you help us ensure that no one has to risk their health to vote in the primary?

Subject: voting by mail (why it matters)
Hey friend --
Zoe here. This is literally a first of its kind opportunity. For the first time, every single voter can cast a ballot by mail.
So, we want to get the word out to as many Hoosier Democrats as possible. That's why we created the 2020 Vote by Mail Fund. We're fundraising to support voter outreach like texting and digital campaigns to teach Hoosier Democrats how to vote by mail. But that isn't free.
We're just under halfway to goal and need to raise just under $10,000. Every single donor that gives their first donation of the year to our Vote by Mail Fund will have their contribution TRIPLE MATCHED. Yep. Your first donation will count 3X.
Will you make your first donation of the year so we can reach $10,000 in time to make sure every potential voter knows Hoosiers won't have to risk their health to cast their vote in June?
2020 DONOR STATUS
NAME: Hoosier Democrat
EMAIL: [[EMAIL_REDACTED]]
DONATION AMOUNT YTD: $0.00
Every dollar you chip in is going straight into 100%-grassroots-backed Vote by Mail Fund.

-Jim Lucas’ racism has no place in the Statehouse-
Over and over, GOP State Rep., Jim Lucas, has used hateful and divisive language.
His latest offense came this week when he posted a racist meme on Facebook. Now, Lucas is refusing to apologize.
Even members of Lucas’ own party have denounced his barefaced bigotry. Indiana House Speaker Todd Huston (R) called the post “unacceptable.” Still, no GOP official has called for his resignation.
Lucas has made it clear: this intolerance is not an isolated incident. It’s concerning that the GOP seems to think there is room for racism in the Statehouse.
We’re calling on Lucas to resign because anything short of a resignation is just turning a blind eye to unacceptable behavior.
Will you help us show the GOP that racism has no place in our government? Sign on here to call on Lucas to leave.
-Holcomb moves forward with his risky plan-
Governor Holcomb is moving forward with his plan to lift COVID-19 restrictions this week. The underprepared, overly-aggressive plan is slated to skyrocket the Indiana death rate by 543%. That’s more than 5,000 preventable deaths.
Indiana has the highest death rate of any states currently reopening. Expert after expert agrees: widespread testing is the key to reopening the economy; yet, Indiana still falls short of the Trump administration’s testing threshold. Our contact tracing plan operates at less than a quarter of the capacity recommended by medical experts, and only 65% of the capacity Holcomb promised.
Does this sound like a state ready to reopen?
We’re calling on Holcomb to postpone the reopen until he follows public health protocol. You can join us by signing on here.
-Indiana Young Democrats Launch New Brand and Logo-
This week, the Indiana Young Democrats (IYD) announced the launch of a new brand identity. Among other changes is a revamped logo and website.
“The rebranding represents a fresh and progressive organization we are building for our members and candidates,” said Arielle Brandy, President of the Indiana Young Democrats. As the premier youth-led grassroots political organization in the state of Indiana and the official youth caucus of our party, their rebranding signals a progressive shift in vision and strategy over the course of the previous year to the present.
IYD’s initiatives include fostering a statewide network of Young Democrats through chapter outreach and growth, recruiting and electing more Democrats throughout Indiana, and partnering with national organizations to ensure candidates have all the resources and tools they need to flip seats.
In all, the branding embodies an organization that is reinventing itself but is still very committed to its progressive roots and ideas. The new identity builds upon its history of young Democrat Hoosiers, from the late former U.S. Senator Birch Bayh to our very own, Former Presidential candidate and Mayor of South Bend Pete Buttigieg, who has continued to champion the young, progressive cause.
Watch the launch video here. For more information, visit [[URL REDACTED]]

"-October 9, 2020-
-Mike strikes out at the VP Debate-
On Wednesday, the 2020 Vice Presidential candidates took the debate stage. For Hoosiers, the night served as a staggering reminder of our 16 years under Pence's leadership. He resorted to the same science-denying, anti-women, anti-LGBTQ+ talking points he parroted as our governor.
But as much as Pence represented the past we aim to leave behind, Kamala embodied the future we're working toward. She made history as the first black woman ever to take the debate stage and showed us once again just how important this election is.
We're fighting to make sure Pence's home state votes him out this November. Can you help us build the campaign to fire Mike Pence?

-Yet another Dem receives Jennifer McCormick's (R ) endorsement-
This week, Ashley Klein, candidate for Indiana House District 39, received the endorsement of Republican Indiana State Superintendent of Public Instruction Jennifer McCormick.
Klein joins the four other Democrats endorsed by McCormick: attorney general candidate Jonathan Weinzapfel, Aimee Rivera Cole HD-37, Melanie Wright HD-35, and Fady Qaddoura SD-30.
Her endorsements come as the Republican Party continues to shift further and further away from supporting public education.
They've made it clear: when you vote blue, you vote for public education.
-Can you step up?-
This election is just 25 DAYS away and the stakes continue to get higher. Our voter outreach team is working 24/7 to turn Hoosier Democrats out to win up and down the ballot.
But we need your help to make it happen.
Friend, we're running a grassroots campaign. We aren't buying our support; we're reaching out to voters and earning it. That's going to take all hands on deck.
Can you take some time this week to make sure we reach as many voters as possible?

"Trump’s State of the Union went exactly how we expected: lies, exaggerations, and unwarranted bragging.
Chip in $10 to make this Trump’s last State of the Union.
Here are the facts:
Public schools are the backbone of America. Voucher schools often have worse learning outcomes.
Donald Trump is stealing from military projects to build an ineffective and expensive wall.
82% of the Trump tax bill's benefits flow to the top 1% of earners. These tax cuts have helped billionaires pay a lower rate than the working class for the first time in history.
Trump didn't save preexisting conditions. Instead, he's trying to eliminate them for 2.7 million Hoosiers.
The good news is we don’t have to hear another one of Trump’s State of the Unions. We turned Indiana blue in 2008, and we can do it again with your help.
Every contribution goes toward getting out the vote so we can beat Trump.
Give $20 to help us make Indiana blue again.

-Union stands up for workers-
The UFCW (United Food and Commercial Workers) 700 wrote a letter to Gov. Holcomb encouraging him to implement protections for essential workers.
They requested things like enforced physical distancing, respirators, testing, mandatory paid quarantine, and protecting workers who take sick leave from retaliation.
We are nearly two months into Indiana's COVID-18 response, and workers are still receiving scant protections.
It's time Holcomb put the health of essential workers first.
-Indiana at the bottom of the nation for testing-
This week, Indiana reached yet another record number of new cases.
But testing remains remarkably low. On Monday, the Trump administration put Indiana in the bottom ten states in the nation for testing. The data indicates that Indiana is testing 300-400 people per 1,000, while several other states are reaching numbers above 900.
The Holcomb administration claims that this is due to a shortage of testing supplies. The truth is that the testing shortage is a problem that numerous other governors have been able to solve. At this point, Ohio is slated to run more tests in a day than Indiana runs in a week.
You can help us urge Holcomb to get Hoosiers the tests they need by signing on here.
-Holcomb and Pence aren't following public health guidelines-
Gov. Holcomb has encouraged all Hoosiers to wear masks in public spaces. But when he met with Mike Pence on Thursday, he made sure to follow the Pence approach to public health: ignoring medical professional's guidelines.
Pence has been spotted going maskless numerous times since the COVID-19 outbreak. He has even shown up bare-faced in high-risk areas like Mayo Clinics.
While Holcomb can be seen wearing a mask during his photo-op waiting for the Vice President, the two were later spotted schmoozing at the steps of Pence's plane without a mask in sight.
It seems like Gov. Holcomb is willing to ignore his own public health guidelines to impress his science-denying predecessor, Mike Pence.
-We want to hear from you-
Across the state, Hoosiers are feeling the impact of COVID-19. Too often, the experience told on the news isn't reflective of every community. We want to ensure we hold legislators accountable, and every community has access to the resources to rebuild. And we want to hear from you. You can help by completing this quick survey to help us understand how your community and family have been impacted by COVID-19.

"Friend,
If this week’s National Convention has shown us anything, it’s that we’ve got a winning ticket for November. I am so proud to endorse Joe and Kamala as the next president and VP of our country. But the fight for 2020 can’t stop at endorsements. We’ve got to get out the vote like never before.
Invest $25 in the Vote-by-Mail Outreach Initiative.
This year, getting out the vote looks a little different. With COVID-19 cases surging, the ballot box poses a major threat to voters’ health. And the GOP has blocked every effort to extend no-fault voting by mail to the general election.
That’s why I’m standing behind the Indiana Democratic Party’s Vote-by-Mail Outreach Program, an initiative dedicated to educating Hoosiers on voting by mail and sending applications to eligible voters.
Chip in $15 to the NUMBER ONE GOTV program in the state.
In 2018, I watched our Party lead a historic vote-by-mail campaign, sending out tens of thousands of vote-by-mail applications in the general election.
This year, we need to expand our reach.
But it’s going to take resources to get this done. And this program is 100% grassroots-funded; it’s on us to make sure Hoosiers can vote safely in 2020. That’s why I’m hoping you’ll join me in backing the 2020 Vote-by-Mail Outreach Program.
Friend, believe me when I tell you, this is the ONLY way we can minimize the risk at the ballot box this year.
Will you chip in $7 to help build a record-breaking vote-by-mail program?
Thank you,
André Carson

"A one-of-a-kind debate night experience: the INDems x Stonewall Virtual Debate Watch Party
Hoosiers lived through 16 years of Mike Pence's leadership. No one knows him like us. That’s why we’re bringing you a one-of-a-kind debate night experience: the INDems x Stonewall Virtual Debate Watch Party.
Tune in to our debate live stream to watch Hoosier Dems fact check him and share their experiences with the infamous VP Pence.
Plus, we’re raffling off our famous Fire Mike Pence merch to THREE lucky debate night donors ($30 value each). Chip in any amount to our Fire Mike Pence Fund from now until the debate ends to enter to win! All of the proceeds go to INDems x Stonewall’s efforts to #FireMikePence.
We’ll announce the winners during our debate live stream!
Here’s how YOU can watch:
When: 9 PM EDT on October 7.
Where: You can find our live stream on our Facebook or Fire Mike Pence page.
How: the event is free to attend. Donations are suggested.
BONUS: tune in to the Stonewall Democrats’ pre-debate live stream to hear from Hoosier leaders like Dr. Woody Myers, Rep. Linda Lawson, Mayor Hogsett, and many more! Tickets are $25 each. More information here.
Will you chip into our Fire Mike Pence fundraiser with the Stonewall Dems? Every dollar goes toward making sure his home state votes him out.

"Friend,
While we face the most deadly pandemic our country has ever seen, Republican administrations are fighting tooth and nail against every effort to vote safely.
Sadly, as the number of COVID-19 cases skyrockets, the ballot box has become increasingly dangerous for Hoosier voters. And now, we’re left with the tension between protecting our health and voting out the very administrations that created this turmoil.
Please chip in $24 to help build the 2020 Vote-by-Mail Outreach Program.
The GOP knows that when every Hoosier can vote, they could lose power. That’s why they’ve rejected our efforts to extend no-fault vote by mail to the general election.
But, Hoosier Dems don’t wait for the GOP to tell us what we can do. We take action.
That’s why I’m asking you to support the Indiana Democratic Party’s Vote-by-Mail Outreach Program.
Please invest $16 in keeping voters safe.
The Vote-by-Mail Outreach Program is Indiana's number one initiative dedicated to getting eligible Hoosiers the tools they need to vote by mail.
But this initiative isn’t funded by dark money or special interests; it’s backed by real Hoosiers. We’re relying on donors like you to make sure eligible Hoosiers can vote safely in the 2020 election.
Will you give $7, or whatever you can, to help minimize the risk at the ballot box this year?
Friend, your party is counting on you.
-Pete

"-October 16, 2020-
-October 22: Deadline to apply to vote by mail-
This Thursday, October 22 is the deadline to apply to vote by mail!
There are 3 ways to return your vote-by-mail application in time:
1. Fill it out online at [[URL REDACTED]] by 11:59 PM local time
2. Download, print, and fill out the form to hand-deliver, email, or fax it to your county clerk before their office closes on Oct. 22
3. Fill out the form at your clerk's office and give it back to them
***Any application received after October 22 – even if it’s postmarked before the deadline – cannot be processed.
Once you’ve applied to vote by mail, you will need to make sure your registration has been accepted. You can check your status here by clicking “Check Voting Status” and scrolling down to “Absentee Ballot Information.”
Check out our Vote By Mail page to learn more about eligibility and the next steps!
-61,000 votes are on the line.
During the primary, 61,000 Hoosiers that applied to vote by mail didn't vote at all. This tells us that they didn't have the tools to return their materials on time.
61,000 votes could make or break this election. It's proof that getting these applications returned is critical to winning big in November. That's why we're hoping to spend the next six days making calls, sending texts, and running ads to ensure that Democrats return their applications in time.
But we're $7,950 short of the funds we need to run this 100%-grassroots-backed project. If we don't raise enough, we can't get it done.
Can we count on you to chip in to the 2020 Safe Voting Initiative to help us reach our goal?

-The woman replacing Pence-
It’s official: Kamala Harris is the next Vice President of the U.S.A.
Harris has spent a career shattering glass ceilings and fighting for working people. Now, she’s continuing this legacy as the first-ever Black woman VP candidate for a major political party.
In stark contrast to the progress that Harris has championed throughout her career, her opponent, the ultraconservative Mike Pence, has spent his time in office spewing racist rhetoric, discriminating against the LGBTQ+ community, and working to rob Americans of their reproductive rights.
No Hoosier needs reminding of the damage Mike Pence did as our governor, so after Harris wipes the floor with him in the October 7 debate – let’s make sure his home state votes him out on November 3.
Will you give $7 to our Fire Mike Pence Fund to help us make it happen?
Every dollar goes toward making calls, sending texts, and getting out the vote to Fire Mike Pence in 2020.
-The Young Professionals Virtual Event-
You're invited to a virtual fireside chat featuring young Hoosier Democrats leading the way!
Join Pete for America Campaign Manager Mike Schmuhl; Evansville City Council President Alex Burton; and candidate for State Senate District 36 Ashley Eason as they discuss their journeys, where they see the Party heading, and how young Hoosier Democrats can continue to lead in our state.
Grab your virtual ticket today and reserve your spot at the early bird rate. Tickets are just $15, and audience members will be able to join the discussion and ask questions!
When: August 27th at 6:30 PM EDT

-Holcomb’s careless school reopening-
Thousands of Hoosier students have officially returned to the classroom in what parents, teachers, and epidemiologists have deemed a reckless attempt at reopening.
The Holcomb administration has not issued a shred of mandated guidance for schools beyond mask-wearing. Instead, he left Indiana’s 291 school districts to fend for themselves.
Even worse, Holcomb is repeating his dangerous pattern of withholding COVID-19 data, this time, refusing to share data on outbreaks within schools.
Bottom line: Holcomb made no effort to protect Hoosier students and educators. Now, he’s dead set on keeping Hoosier families from making their own health care decisions.
-Republicans continue to drag their feet on safe voting-
On Thursday, Indiana exceeded 1,000 new COVID-19 cases for the fifth time in the last eight days. During this time, the state reached its fourth-highest one-day total at 1,046 new cases.
On Friday, Republicans on the Election Commission voted down an effort to expand vote by mail to every Hoosier who chooses to use it.
They’ve made it clear that they'd rather force us to risk our health than let us vote by mail.
But we aren’t going to let them get away with this without a fight.
Sign our petition to extend no-fault, mail-in voting to the general election.
-We want to hear from you-
Health care is on the line for thousands of Hoosiers in 2020. We're fighting hard to make sure no one has to wonder how they're going to afford necessary treatment.
And that starts with understanding the importance of health care in every community.
Will you fill out this brief survey to tell us what health care means to you?
-The 2020 Candidate Toolbox-

"874 Hoosiers have taken the pledge to fire Curtis Hill. We need to reach 1,000 by MIDNIGHT.
Will you chip in $3 to take the pledge and help us reach our goal?
Curtis Hill is the worst Attorney General in Indiana's history. He has spent the last four years denigrating the AG's office, destroying the progress we've made, and misusing taxpayer dollars.
And he told his GOP cronies that we can't vote him out. So, we're sending him a boxful of pledges to show him Hoosiers want him out.
But, friend, this is more than just a pledge to get rid of Curtis Hill, it's your chance to show the GOP that we're done with bigotry, blatant attacks on our rights, and a lack of concern for Hoosiers' health.
Give $3 to help us reach our goal and show the GOP where YOU stand.
Every dollar goes directly into our Fire Curtis Hill Fund, helping us make calls, run ads, and get Dems voting in November. Will you consider chipping in more to make sure we #FireCurtisHill in 2020?

""and a severe lack of oversight...""
No oversight. No rules. No problem for Indiana Republicans. This is the result of years of pushing an education agenda that siphons money out of our traditional public schools and into shady, for-profit schemes. Two virtual charter schools were able to steal tens of millions of taxpayer dollars by inflating their enrollment and funneling their revenue to other entities, including seven companies owned by the schools’ founder.
The GOP refuses to hold for-profit schools accountable. Just last month, Gov. Holcomb spoke at an event boosting for-profit schools.
It has to end. This year nearly two dozen teachers have filed to run for office as Democrats. We’re committed to restoring funding to our public schools and making sure the wealthy and well-connected don't dictate education policy in our state. If you're ready to put an end to for-profit schools and shady schemes, help us elect more Hoosier Democrats to the legislature in 2020.

"Holcomb's deep-pocketed political donors were fast-tracked to a multi-million dollar COVID-19 testing contract with the state.
Chip in $20.20 to elect a governor that puts Hoosiers before political allies.
Weeks ago, Holcomb rejected testing kit donations from an Indiana lab as testing lagged behind all neighboring states.
Then, the Holcomb administration inked a hefty $17.9 million contract to conduct COVID-19 testing. Apparently, the Holcomb administration only engaged with one company.
The catch? Less than two months prior, a high-ranking executive at the comapny made a $50,000 donation to Holcomb's re-election campaign.
Give $12 to help us vote him out!
Holcomb rejected donated tests, then made a multi-million dollar deal with a political donor. That doesn't sound like a coincidence to us.
This isn't the first time Holcomb has put his pockets before Hoosiers' best interest. But it can be the last time we let him get away with it.
It's going to take all hands on deck to vote Holcomb out. So, we created our One-Term Governor Fund to build a digital campaign to make sure every Hoosier Dem casts a ballot to vote him out in November.
Will you give $5 to help us build the campaign to make him a one-term Governor?

The formula for a better Indiana is simple. When more Hoosiers vote, more Democrats get elected. And when more Democrats are in office, we see better schools, affordable health care, and fairer elections.
Friend, just an hour or two of your time over the next 11 days could make the difference in this election. You have the power to get more Hoosiers voting this year.
Don’t wake up on Nov. 4 and wonder what you could’ve done.
Pick a shift to call voters with us this weekend, and we’ll send you everything you need to get started. All times in EDT.

-The gubernatorial debate-
On Tuesday, the 2020 gubernatorial candidates took the debate stage.
Dr. Woody Myers showed once and for all that he is the right choice to lead Hoosiers during this unprecedented time.
He was the only candidate on the stage focused on taking actionable steps toward containing a pandemic that’s tragically claimed more than 4,000 Hoosiers’ lives and devastated our economy.
Under Eric Holcomb’s leadership, the pandemic and its economic effects are getting worse, not better. This week, daily COVID-19 cases reached their highest level since this pandemic began. Hospitals are nearing capacity. The labor force is shrinking, and more than 200,000 Hoosiers are looking for work.
Holcomb failed us. He's shown he can't meet the moment.
Dr. Woody Myers is ready to lead our state toward a better future.

"it inspired me to stand up for Hoosiers
Friend,
As a former intern, I know the power of our Internship Program. It gave me the practical tools to pursue a career in politics and catapulted me into my current position as Digital Communications Specialist. But most importantly, it inspired me to stand up for Hoosiers.
Contribute $10 to fund our Internship Program.
Here’s what other interns had to say:
“My time with the Indiana Democrats was great! I got to see how campaigns are run, and everyone I worked with pitched in to help me find my next job. Because of my time there, I've worked on a presidential campaign and can see myself having a career in politics. ” - Nick B.
“I used to think that Indiana was a red state, but as an intern, I had the opportunity to meet countless Hoosier Democrats and inspire them to get involved. Now, I know change is possible, and I want to push for change in my state.” - Hannah K.
This year, we’ve had a record number of young people apply to our Internship Program. 24 people have given to the Program, but we’re $4,000 short of our goal.
Help us inspire young Democrats to flip our state blue and keep it that way.
Contribute $25 to our interns today.
Thank you for your support,
Zoe King
Digital Communications Specialist

"-September 4, 2020-
-Young Voters Project-
We've partnered with the College Dems of Indiana to build an integral part of our 2020 Safe Voting Initiative: the Young Voters Project. This is our plan to register a record number of first-time voters, facilitate comprehensive voter education, and mobilize young Dems to cast ballots this year.
Last month, we built a network of student-led voter registration teams at college campuses across the state. Now, we've got to get them the tools to register voters safely.
We're sending our teams pandemic-approved voter registration kits. Each kit includes masks, clipboards, hand sanitizer, pens, and stickers and flyers with a QR code that takes you to the online form for socially-distanced registration.
With the deadline to register to vote just over a month away, we need to build 100 kits by Monday. At $12/kit we need all hands on deck to make sure we can get this done!
How many voter registration kits can the College Dems count on you for?
-Everything you need to know to vote in 2020-
Ready to make your voting plan? We've got you covered.
Read our blog post on everything you need to know to vote in 2020 and we'll connect you with how to register, find your candidates, and the four ways to vote this year!
Check it out here and make sure to share it!
-Get connected with your candidates-
We've created a tool to help you find your candidates online and get connected with them!
Check out our Find my Candidates tool here.
Not sure which district you're in? Find out here.
-Young Professionals Virtual Event-
You're invited to a virtual fireside chat featuring young Democrats leading the way!
This month's event will include Muthoni Wambu Kraal, National Political and Organizing Director, DNC & Kevin Lima, Youth Political Director, DNC. The event will be moderated by President of College Democrats of Indiana, Alessia Modjarrad.

-Trump promotes a Class D felony-
This week, Trump told supporters to attempt to vote twice — first by mail then in person.
In Indiana, knowingly applying for or receiving a ballot in a precinct other than the precinct in which the person is entitled to vote is a Class D felony.
Indiana Democratic Party Chairman John Zody called on Governor Eric Holcomb – Trump's Indiana Campaign Chairman and top in-state Trump surrogate – to answer whether Indiana Trump supporters should heed the President's advice and vote twice.
""Does Eric Holcomb agree with the President about voting twice?"" said Zody. ""If Holcomb believes in the rule of law, he must forcefully and publicly push back against the President. Otherwise, he's aiding and abetting mass voter fraud.""

"Last month, we sent tens of thousands of vote-by-mail applications. Now, we need to make sure Hoosiers are ready to return their applications in time. That's why we're dedicated to getting out our first round of follow-up by THIS FRIDAY.
We've got to raise $2,775 by MIDNIGHT on Tuesday to call and text eligible Hoosiers. Can you chip in $25 to help out?
Let's not mince words. When our state government refused to send eligible Hoosiers vote-by-mail applications, they put vulnerable people in danger. But we stepped up.
Now, we're running the largest statewide, vote-by-mail initiative in Indiana. For some Hoosiers, this program is the ONLY way they'll get the tools they need to vote by mail.
This is a 100%-grassroots effort. We're counting on you to help keep Hoosiers safe. Can you chip in $15, or whatever you can, to help us raise $2,775 in time?
The importance of our record-breaking vote-by-mail campaign cannot be overstated. The more Hoosiers you help vote by mail, the lower the health risk at the ballot box this year.
How many Hoosiers can count on you?

If you’re hand-delivering a ballot that’s not yours, you may be asked to complete an affidavit at the time of delivery.
You can check if your ballot was received and counted by visiting “My Voter Portal” on [[URL REDACTED]]
If you were one of the thousands of Democrats that applied to vote by mail, we want to hear from you! Tell us about your experience here.

Rep. Trey Hollingsworth is willing to trade in American lives to boost his investment portfolio.
Contribute $20.20 to make this his last term.
At the height of the coronavirus outbreak, an Indiana Congressman thinks needlessly sacrificing lives is a trade-off worth making. And while Hollingsworth knows this would result in the death of countless Americans, he has made it abundantly clear he just doesn’t care.
Chip in $13 to vote him out this year.
Let’s not mince words, Hollingsworth is an out-of-touch millionaire with more concern for shareholders’ pocketbooks than Hoosiers' lives.
But here’s the good news: we can vote him out in November.
He represents one of the most competitive congressional districts in the state. And we’re building the infrastructure to make sure you never have another representative that puts money before you and your family.
Will you give $5 to help build the campaign to vote Hollingsworth out?
100% of your contribution goes toward mobilizing voters, building campaigns, and electing Democrats that care about Hoosiers in November.

"We need 10 more donors from Alexandria
We need 10 more donors from Alexandria
Tonight marks a critical deadline in this election cycle. We've got until MIDNIGHT to raise $4,180.
According to our records, if ten more donors from Alexandria make a contribution, we'll be on track to meet our end-of-quarter fundraising goal in time. Will you step up and make your first $7 donation to the 2020 Safe Voting Initiative to keep our momentum from fading?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
With every passing day, the window of time, we have to promote safe voting gets smaller and smaller. This program is absolutely crucial to turning out Democratic voters, minimizing the health risk at the ballot box, and thwarting the GOP's attempts at voter suppression.
If we slow down now, we'll risk coming up short of everything that we've been working toward.
We're in the final 34 days of this election, and we absolutely need you in our corner to win this one. There has never been a better time to make your very first donation to our GOTV program, so I'm asking:
Friend, will you be one of 10 more people from Alexandria to donate $7 to the 2020 Safe Voting Initiative before Wednesday's deadline? Even a small contribution would make a big difference in helping our party reach this goal before we're out of time.
We can't do this without you,

In June, Governor Holcomb and Indiana Republicans agreed no school would lose funding if they chose to conduct lessons virtually. Now, hardline Republicans are reversing course, telling schools they could see their funding slashed by 15%.
Governor Holcomb? He's missing in action, refusing to comment after committing in June to fully funding every school, no caveats.
\- ""Doctor"" Todd Rokita knows better than the CDC -
Todd Rokita knows better than the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. After he was called out for failing to wear a mask or maintain six feet of social distance, Todd Rokita said he has his own approach, and – the kicker — it’s safer.
While Governor Eric Holcomb continues to implore Hoosiers to wear a mask, Todd Rokita is implying he won’t.
Talking out of both sides of his mouth isn’t new for Todd Rokita, in fact it’s like a personal rule. Rokita decried public spending in Congress after wasting $3 million in taxpayer dollars promoting himself. Rokita boasts of cracking down on law breakers while he racked up ethics violations for fundraising in his state-funded office.
\- We're hiring -
We’re staffing up our statewide voter outreach effort and we want you to help us elect Hoosier Democrats up and down the ballot in 2020.

-LaPorte Dems honor Kernan, Lewis-
The LaPorte County Commissioners honored former Governor Joe Kernan and Civil Rights icon Congressman John Lewis with resolutions during their meeting earlier this month.
-Holcomb drags his feet on voting by mail-
Former Lt. Govs from both sides of the aisle have called for expanded vote by mail.
Yet, Eric Holcomb and his GOP cronies have done nothing but lie about its efficacy and drag their feet on instituting no-fault voting by mail in the general election.
Republicans have made it clear: they won't do anything to help Hoosiers vote by mail in the general election.
But we aren't waiting for them to move forward. We're getting eligible the tools to vote by mail now so we can minimize the health risk at the ballot box later.
That's why we created our Vote-by-Mail Outreach Program, an initiative focused on building educational tools, reaching out to eligible voters, and getting Hoosiers vote-by-mail applications.
The Vote-by-Mail Outreach Program is a 100%-grassroots-backed effort. We can't do this without your support.
Will you give $8 to help us build the Vote-by-Mail Outreach Program?
-We want to hear from you-
Health care is on the line for thousands of Hoosiers in 2020. We're fighting hard to make sure no one has to wonder how they're going to afford necessary treatment.
And that starts with understanding the importance of health care in every community.
Will you fill out this brief survey to tell us what health care means to you?

"He enabled the worst HIV outbreak in Indiana's history. Now he's in charge of our nation's response to the coronavirus?
Mike Pence has spent his entire career discrediting science. His extremist beliefs wreaked havoc on Hoosiers' health, infamously enabling the worst HIV outbreak in Indiana's history.
Contribute $25 to fire Mike Pence.
Now, our country’s response to the coronavirus is in his hands.
Hoosiers know what happens when a science-denying, extremist makes decisions about our health. That's why we're not going to allow another four years of Vice President Pence.
When you give to the Indiana Democratic Party, you're helping us register voters, find volunteers, and share our message so that we can make Pence a one-term VP.

"$85 million stolen from public schools.
-February 14, 2020-
-Virtual charter schools defraud the state of millions-
Two virtual charter schools, shut down in August, inflated their enrollment to receive extra funds over the past few years.
Even worse, $85 million of the schools’ taxpayer-funded revenue were funneled to other entities, including several companies owned by people affiliated with the school.
While public schools have seen their funding stagnate, $85 million was stolen from our school budget and pumped into wealthy business owners’ pockets.
Governor Holcomb and his cronies in the General Assembly have continually supported unaccountable for-profit schools. Just last month, he spoke at an event boosting for-profit education and has historically diverted millions of dollars to similar schools.
-Holcomb remains silent on Medicaid-
A bipartisan group of governors have spoken out against Trump’s proposal to revise Medicaid. His proposal is likely to reduce health care access for low-income Hoosiers. However, one U.S. Governor has been notably quiet on the issue: Eric Holcomb.
He hasn't always been so shy. In 2017, he endorsed a GOP effort to end Medicaid as we know it.
It’s more than likely that Holcomb’s silence comes from the fact that he supports Trump’s cuts to Medicaid but doesn’t want to cut care to hundreds of thousands of Hoosiers while he faces re-election.
-Nearly two dozen teachers running for office-
After years of budget cuts, low pay, and unfair testing requirements, teachers have had enough of the GOP refusing to support public schools.
This year over 20 teachers have decided to step up and run for office as Democrats.
“I’ve been a public school teacher for 22 years, and I’ve done it all,” said Julie Snider, a teacher running for House District 33, “Nothing else was kind of getting through to the General Assembly. I want to be part of the decision making.”
-Bosma resists accommodations for pregnant workers-
Last week, Senate Republicans voted against providing reasonable accommodations to pregnant workers, things like assistance with manual labor and unpaid time off work to recover from childbirth.
Now, the GOP-led House has the opportunity to restore these accommodations in the bill, but it looks unlikely.
House Speaker Brian Bosma seemed to reject the provisions, echoing other Republicans by citing the pushback from businesses.
The GOP seems to think that anything that would reduce our staggering maternal and infant mortality rates is simply too much to ask.

"Republicans have done everything in their power to thwart our votes. They refused to send eligible Hoosiers vote-by-mail applications. Then, they rejected all of our efforts to make voting by mail easier and more convenient.
But we stepped up, mailing thousands of Hoosiers applications and building the largest statewide, vote-by-mail initiative in Indiana.
Now, we’re just two days away from the deadline to apply to vote by mail, and we need to raise another $5,000 to send out our final round of outreach. Can you chip in your first $7, or whatever you can today, to back this program? Every contribution matters.
Let’s not mince words; if we don’t raise the funds to get this done, we will have to drastically cut from the vote by mail program. This could leave vulnerable Hoosiers without the tools to vote safely and cost us more than 60k votes.
The GOP is banking on us falling short. They’re hoping our grassroots support tapers off and causes us to forefeit this critical element of our get-out-the-vote program.
We’re counting on you to help prove them wrong. Can you make your first donation to save the vote by mail program before it’s too late?

"-July 31, 2020-
-Rest in peace, Gov. Joe Kernan-
Indiana Democratic Party Chairman and former Kernan staffer John Zody issued the following statement upon former Indiana Governor Joe Kernan's passing.
""Joe Kernan was a genuine public servant who understood, better than many, what service meant.
""Governor Kernan was someone who could set politics aside to move our state forward. He understood and brought great perspective to what was truly important – a skill fading from today's discourse and something that impressed everyone around him – including me and others who worked with the governor. In everything he did, he brought an authenticity, attention to what truly matters, quick wit and sense of humor.
""There are countless Hoosiers who benefited from everything he contributed to us in his life, which has been cut too short. But he measured success in his life through love for his wonderful wife, Maggie, and his family and friends, who Indiana Democrats mourn within his passing.
""I have spent the morning talking to Democrats from around the state, remembering Joe Kernan, and I will treasure the memories we have with him and what I have learned from him for the rest of my life. Rest in peace, Governor.""
Those wishing to remember and learn more about Governor Kernan can visit [[URL REDACTED]] for information about his life and public service.
-Launching the Young Voters Project-
This year, young people make up one of the largest voting blocs in the U.S., with one in ten eligible voters being 18-23 years old.
We're partnering with the College Dems of Indiana to launch an unprecedented voter outreach program: the Young Voters Project.
The YVP is a three-pronged plan to provide voter registration trainings for the College Dems, register young Hoosier voters, and carry out a voter outreach program to get college-aged Dems voting in November.
It's going to take resources to get this done at universities across the state. And we've just got to raise $3k more to reach our monthly goal by MIDNIGHT tonight.
Will you chip in $7 to our Young Voters Project?
-Dems push for voting by mail-
On Friday, nine Hoosier Democrats – one from each Congressional district – signed onto a letter petitioning Governor Holcomb to request a meeting of the Indiana Election Commission to make no-fault absentee voting available to every voter. The petition came as former Lt. Governors Kathy Davis and John Mutz called on Eric Holcomb to expand vote by mail to every Hoosier voter this fall.
-#MaskUpTodd-
This week, Attorney General candidate Todd Rokita repeatedly appeared without a mask at an event.
We're tired of the GOP's lack of concern for Hoosiers' health. So, we shipped the Rokita campaign surgical masks and an update to the former Congressman's eight-page staffing memo.
If we can't count on Todd Rokita to do something as simple as wearing a mask, how can we trust him to protect the health care of 2.7 million Hoosiers with pre-existing conditions?
-Indiana undercounts COVID-19 cases-
New data shows that Indiana has long been undercounting the state's coronavirus cases and deaths in long term care facilities. The data indicates that 22% of COVID-19 deaths linked to long-term care facilities were not reported in the state's total numbers until recent days.
The Holcomb administration resisted persistent calls to release the data, and when they finally did, it was clear why they didn't want to share their severely underreported numbers.
Democratic nominee for Indiana governor Dr. Woody Myers said, ""Gov. Holcomb has failed to put our most vulnerable Hoosiers first, Hoosiers need the long-term care task force that nursing care experts have recommended.""
The lackluster pandemic response and administration is a sign Indiana needs true leadership where Hoosiers' lives are a priority. Check out Dr. Woody Myers' plan to control the virus and get Hoosiers the response they deserve.

"Holcomb and Bosma took their money.
The same virtual charter schools that stole millions of dollars from Hoosier taxpayers made over $100,000 in campaign contributions to the GOP.
Yep. Gov. Holcomb, House Speaker Brian Bosma, and a swarm of other Republican lawmakers raked in a whole lot of campaign cash.
Donate $5 to show them they won’t get away with it.
The GOP’s fingerprints are all over this scandal, and yet they think they can get away with it. Republican Senator Travis Holdman was paid a monthly retainer by one of the schools for legal and business consulting for eight years. Bosma, who received $10,000 in campaign donations, deemed the schools’ conduct 'criminal,' without even batting an eye at his hypocrisy.
Give $25 to help us vote these crooks out.
The GOP think they can pump money into unaccountable charter schools, then act surprised when their political campaigns are flush with what appears to be crooked cash. They can’t. But it’s our job to hold them accountable.
Contribute $10 to help us elect Democrats that put public schools above their own greed.

"We have to make the most of these final, critical hours. That means (1)
We’re just ONE DAY away from the most important election of our lives.
If we’re going to win big, we have to make the most of these final, critical hours. That means (1) running a massive voter protection project, (2) turning out voters, and (3) making sure every Hoosier has the tools to cast a ballot.
Here are three things you can do to help:
Build the Voter Protection Team
A critical part of the 2020 Safe Voting is protecting voters from the GOP’s shady attempts at thwarting our ballots.
We’re assembling a statewide team of lawyers to help Hoosiers push back on voter suppression on and after election day. But it’s going to take resources to get this done.
Can you chip in your first $7, or whatever you can, to help us carry out this final component of the 2020 Safe Voting Initiative?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
CHIP IN $7 CHIP IN $25
CHIP IN $50 OR, GIVE ANOTHER AMOUNT.
Join the Get-Out-the-Vote Team
If we’re going to turn red districts blue, we need to turn out Hoosiers that didn’t vote in 2016. These last two days are VITAL to getting this done.
But we need help making the calls.
Friend, aside from voting, this is the most important thing you can do to ensure that we get out the vote.
Don’t wake up on November 4 and wonder if you did enough.
Sign up for a shift of virtual phone banking, and we’ll send you everything you need to join the fight.

"Friend,
The last four years under Trump, Holcomb, and the Statehouse’s GOP supermajority have been detrimental to our livelihood and our democracy.
Michelle Obama was right. We’ve got to vote in numbers that can’t be ignored.
Become a founding member of the 2020 Safe Voting Initiative.
But in 2020, it's not enough for us to run a record-breaking get-out-the-vote campaign, we’ve got to make sure Hoosiers can vote safely. That’s why I’m launching the 2020 Safe Voting Initiative. Here’s the plan:
1. Run a comprehensive voter protection project designed to educate Democrats on their options to vote safely and what to do in instances of possible voter suppression. Maintain a voter protection hotline to help voters in need.
2. Organize the largest vote-by-mail campaign in the history of our Party. Create educational tools to help Hoosiers with the process. Reach out to eligible voters. Send thousands of vote-by-mail applications.
3. Train candidates in safe GOTV practices. Double the size of our staff to help build winning campaigns.
4. Register a record number of young Democrats. Partner with the College Dems. Provide them with protective equipment. Fund a texting program to get their registrants to the polls.
5. Launch a texting and phone banking program to make sure Hoosiers know when and where they can vote early.
This is a $50,000 initiative. But that pales in comparison to the cost of another four years under GOP leadership.
The next five days are critical to getting started. So, we’ve set a goal to raise $12,000 by August 31st.
Will you become a founding member of the 2020 Safe Voting Initiative?

"The 2020 Indiana Democratic Party State Convention will be held virtually this year. We want to bring Hoosier Democrats from around the state together – safely. So, we’re holding the Convention online, and delegates are casting their votes by mail to nominate our next Attorney General and Lieutenant Governor.
What does that mean? Well, for one, we’re not letting the virus slow down or stop our nominating process. There’s just too much at stake in 2020 for that.
Two, it means state delegates can still vote on our Party’s nominee for Attorney General, Lieutenant Governor, and delegates to the DNC National Convention. Voting by mail is safe, secure, and convenient, and we are working to ensure that any voting done online is equally secure – and that accommodations are made for those who need them. A virtual convention gives us the flexibility to ensure delegates in contested races can participate in the convention.
Three, Hoosier Democrats will still be able to hear from our candidates, as we intend to provide those opportunities to Democrats across the state.
Look, we know Hoosiers are adapting all over the state. So are we. We can’t wait for June 13, we’ll be announcing more details in the coming weeks, and we can’t thank you enough for your flexibility and understanding.
Stay safe,
Team IDP

"Friend,
We believe that when you help us invest in Indiana’s future, you deserve to know what we're doing to win big in 2020. That's why we're making an effort to share our initiatives with you.
So I’ll be honest, we’re up against a major fundraising deadline, and we need to raise 10k by MIDNIGHT on July 31.
Chip in $20.20 to our Grassroots Fund to help us reach our goal.
Unlike the GOP, our initiatives are 100% grassroots-backed. We aren’t relying on dark money or deep-pocketed special interests; we’re counting on real Hoosiers to help us win.
That's why I want to make sure we’re investing in what matters to you. So, we’re sharing our big projects with Hoosier Dems.
Pick the initiative that matters to you and help us invest in the future of our state.

"Hoosier Democrat --
It is my pleasure to inform you that it’s official: Dr. Woody Myers is Hoosier Democrats' endorsed candidate for Governor. This is a move that I wholeheartedly approve and am ecstatic to report. I hope that you too will support Woody as he works to win back not only the governor’s office but also key Statehouse races; bringing positive change and ushering in the shared values that you and I hold dear.
After 16 years of Republican control, it’s time to weed the garden. We are called to serve during this time in which we have seen the privatization of our school systems, health care costs skyrocket out of control, and a series of corrupt administrations blunder through the actions of inept appointed and elected officials.
We must have hope in ourselves and our neighbors and come together for the same purpose. This feat is going to take more than me and you working together, but rather an army of Hoosiers who want to see an administration take serious issues seriously. A Governor Myers will make healthcare the number one priority for his administration so that it will be affordable and accessible for every Hoosier family, compile a strong team to combat the climate crisis and fully fund education to set up every Hoosier for success.
I pledge to you that I will work with every fiber of my being to help Woody win the highest office in our state. Indiana is counting on you to join this movement and help all Democrats work toward victory this November.
Democratically Yours,
Cordelia Lewis Burks
Vice-Chair, Indiana Democratic Party

"Statehouse Republicans took every opportunity to cut deals for special interests that dumped cash into their campaign accounts.
As the legislative session comes to a close, one thing is undeniable: special interests were crowned the big winner. The GOP's loyalty lies with campaign donors, not Hoosiers.
Chip in $15 to fight corruption at the Statehouse.
Statehouse Republicans took every opportunity to cut deals for special interests who dumped cash into their campaign accounts. They did nothing to demonstrably lower health care costs, gutted proposals to address maternal mortality, and failed to give Hoosier educators a much-deserved raise.
The message is clear: if you line their pockets with campaign cash, then you have a friend in the GOP. But if you're like the majority of working Hoosiers, then don't expect a bigger paycheck or smaller health care bills.
Want to get rid of special interests in politics? Contribute $5 to elect Dems that will fight for you.
The good news is we don't have to put up with this much longer. In 2020, we can get rid of the GOP supermajority for good.
But we can't do that without your help. Friend, would you donate $10 to our grassroots fund? Every dollar you give goes toward building the bench, knocking doors, and mobilizing voters so that we can win big in 2020.
Let's make 2020, the year we elected officials that work for us.

"The 2020 Vote-by-Mail Outreach Program is officially underway.
Chip in $25 to become a founding member of our 2020 Vote-by-Mail Outreach Program.
Right now, COVID-19 cases are surging, and the GOP still hasn’t agreed to an expanded vote-by-mail general election. However, we aren’t wasting any time getting every eligible Hoosier the tools to vote by mail in the 2020 general election.
Give $15 to help keep Hoosiers safe!
We’re launching an outreach program to minimize the number of Dems at the ballot box this year by making sure eligible Hoosiers know they can vote by mail. This means:
1. Running a texting and phonebanking program to let every single eligible Hoosier know they can vote by mail
2. Sending eligible Hoosiers vote-by-mail applications
3. Providing ongoing support for Hoosiers voting by mail
But it takes resources to make calls, send texts, and mail applications. We need to raise $10,000 by Midnight on Friday to begin our first round of outreach.
Will you give $10 to help start the 2020 Vote-by-Mail Outreach Program?
Our Vote-by-Mail Outreach Program is 100% grassroots funded. We’re counting on donors like you to keep Hoosiers safe during this election.

"We've set a goal to raise $30,000 for our Vote by Mail Fund by midnight so that we can get Hoosiers the tools they need to vote safely in the 2020 primary before it's too late. We're $10,000 away.
Chip in $20.20 to help us reach our goal.
Republicans voted down, sending every Hoosier a ballot application. Then they blocked us from extending the date ballots could be accepted. If they had their way, Hoosiers would have to choose between risking their health at the polls and exercising their right to vote.
Will you give $15.50 to help us step up for Hoosiers?
But we aren’t going to let that happen. We built our Vote-by-Mail Outreach Initiative to make sure every Hoosier can vote safely by mail.
We’ve created tools like how-to videos and detailed instructions to make sure every voter knows how to vote by mail. Now, we just need to get them to voters. This means we need to make calls, send texts, and mail Hoosiers the information they need to vote safely.
Contribute $7.70 to help us reach more Hoosiers.

"Our GOTV program is grassroots-backed. Your support in the next few hours will determine our success on November 3rd.
Tonight, we are facing our most crucial deadline to date: The final FEC quarterly fundraising deadline before Election Day. We’re still more than $3k away from our goal.
Our GOTV program is grassroots-backed. Your support in the next few hours will determine our success on November 3rd. Can you rush your first $3 to our GOTV program to help make sure we reach our goal in time? Even a small contribution will make a huge difference.
This month, we made huge strides in our 2020 Safe Voting Initiative, giving Hoosiers the tools to vote safely and moving Dems up in the polls.
But the work isn’t done. And if we don’t reach our goal, we risk losing the momentum we’ve built together.
Friend, this is what the GOP wants. They’re banking on us tiring out and giving up. Right now, they’re calling on special interests to pump money into their campaigns and running fabricated attack ads so that they can out-run us. We need to build a GOTV program, no amount of dark-money, lies, or shady tactics can defeat. Can you contribute your first $3, or whatever you can, to help get this done?

"Hey friend --
Zoe here. This is literally a first of its kind opportunity. For the first time, every single voter can cast a ballot by mail.
So, we want to get the word out to as many Hoosier Democrats as possible. That's why we created the 2020 Vote by Mail Fund. We're fundraising to support voter outreach like texting and digital campaigns to teach Hoosier Democrats how to vote by mail. But that isn't free.
We're just under halfway to goal and need to raise just under $10,000. Every single donor that gives their first donation of the year to our Vote by Mail Fund will have their contribution TRIPLE MATCHED. Yep. Your first donation will count 3X.
Will you make your first donation of the year so we can reach $10,000 in time to make sure every potential voter knows Hoosiers won't have to risk their health to cast their vote in June?

-The Down-Ballot Victory Program-
This week, we launched our Down-Ballot Victory Program! The Program is focused on investing in down-ballot races early and giving local and county-level candidates the tools to run and win.
We've already started strong. Last Saturday, we held our first event of the Down-Ballot Victory Program, a Virtual Candidate Bootcamp, where we trained candidates from all over the state on how to run digital campaigns and get out the vote in 2020.
Right now, we're just $1,000 from our 5K startup goal!
Will you give $12 to help us hit the ground running?
The Down-Ballot Victory Program is a 100%-grassroots-backed initiative. We're relying on donors to help us train down-ballot Dems, build campaigns, and give every candidate the tools they need to win big in 2020.
-Holcomb's political moves hurt Hoosiers-
COVID-19 testing has been steadily dropping since mid-June, as cases continue to surge. OptumServe, Holcomb's handpicked testing company, reached a daily average of 2,489 tests two weeks ago, less than half of the 6,600 tests/day they promised in early April. And Indiana, which previously had 50 free testing sites open through contracts with OptumServe, now has only 34.
Contact tracing isn't faring any better.
County public health officials from around the state blasted Holcomb's private contact tracing program with Virginia-based outsourcing firm, Maximus. The firm rushed to mark cases complete and failed to collect vital information on as many as half of new cases, with up to one in five cases being lost in contact.
So why are Hoosiers stuck with companies that consistently underperform despite guzzling millions upon millions of taxpayer dollars?
Both OptumServe and Maximus are home to deep-pocketed donors of Holcomb's re-election campaign. In March, an OptumServe exec dumped $50,000 into Holcomb's lap. And Maximus donated to Holcomb's campaign just days before signing the $43 million contract to become Indiana's contact tracing center.
It's clear Holcomb put political gain before the health and safety of Hoosiers.
-The Myers/Lawson Long-Term Care Plan-
For months, Governor Holcomb refused to release the names of long-term care facilities that have infected patients and staff, leaving Hoosiers and their families in the dark.
Holcomb's failures have made it clear; transparency, widespread testing, and supporting staff in long-term care facilities is vital.
Luckily, this is Indiana's future under the Myers/Lawson administration. The Myers/Lawson Long-Term Care Plan includes five sections: residents, oversight, testing, staff, and advocacy. It's designed to prioritize people over politics by:
1. Expanding telemedicine capabilities
2. Creating a task force for COVID-19 long-term care preparedness
3. Increasing testing and decreasing result wait times
4. Developing a plan for COVID-only nursing facilities for elderly patients
5. Increasing funding for Indiana's CHOICE program
This is the future Hoosiers deserve. Check out the plan here.
-Racial injustice in the Statehouse-
This week, Sen. Eddie Melton was confronted by a police officer for entering the Statehouse.
Sen. Melton was taking part in a rally sponsored by the Indiana Racial Justice Alliance when he entered the Statehouse to escape a thunderstorm. A Capitol Police officer immediately set his sights on Melton, reaching for his handgun as he ignored Melton and Sen. JD Ford's attempts at explaining the situation.
Melton's experience is just one example of the systemic racism that creeps into every aspect of life for Black Hoosiers. It comes just barely two weeks after the attempted lynching of another Black man, Vauhxx Booker, a Bloomington civil rights activist.
Right now, Hoosier Dems are fighting for a a more equitable future. The Indiana Black Legislative Caucus is fighting for criminal justice reform and equitable approaches to police. The Indianapolis City Council has started a commission to address the challenges faced by Black males.
But the GOP has done nothing but make excuses, ignore Black Hoosiers' demands, and leave systemic racism untouched. Sadly, without the Holcomb administration and the GOP supermajority committing to fight for equality, many Hoosiers will continue to bear the burden of systemic racism.
This is why we must fight hard and remember where they stood when we reach the ballot box.
-We want to hear from you-
Health care is on the line for thousands of Hoosiers in 2020. We're fighting hard to make sure no one has to wonder how they're going to afford necessary treatment.
And that starts with understanding the importance of health care in every community.
Will you fill out this brief survey to tell us what health care means to you?
-The 2020 Candidate Toolbox-
We're launching our 2020 Candidate Toolbox, a collection of campaign tips, Indiana stats, and digital content for Hoosier Dems running for office in 2020!
Candidates can email Zoe King, at [[URL REDACTED]] for access!

-It's official, we can vote by mail-
On Wednesday, the Election Commission met to discuss moving the primary election to June and voting by mail for every Hoosier.
In a historic expansion of voting rights, any Hoosier who wants will be able to vote by mail for the first time in the June 2 primary election.
If you are wondering how to do it, we've created a video to show you how to apply!
You can apply using the ABS-Mail: Application for Absentee Ballot. Don't forget to get it to your county clerk by May 21.
-Democrats push Holcomb to protect tenants-
Just a few weeks ago, the GOP pushed a special interests-backed bill through the General Assembly designed to remove protections for tenants. Yesterday, it crossed Holcomb's desk.
While Democrats fought the bill tirelessly during session, they knew that passing it during a global pandemic and economic crisis would have catastrophic effects on Hoosiers. So, Democratic Representatives, Senators, and local officials called on Gov. Holcomb to veto the bill.
As a result of their unrelenting efforts, Holcomb rejected the bill.
However, Republicans in the General Assembly have the numbers to override his veto. This is why we have to break their supermajority in November.
-Dr. Myers fights for Hoosiers in wake of COVID-19-
Democratic gubernatorial candidate, Dr. Woody Myers, continues to fight for Hoosiers during the COVID-19 pandemic.
After releasing his 11-point plan to address the health and economic impacts of the coronavirus last week, Dr. Myers has continued to push for action.
On Thursday, Dr. Myers held a virtual town hall on medical manufacturing during the pandemic. He shared his plan to increase testing and get protective equipment to health providers to stop the spread. He also advocated for addressing the shortage of ICU beds as the number of hospitalized Hoosiers increases.
Most importantly, Dr. Myers believes we still have time to stop the spread, but we need to get it right now to have a fighting chance.
-Holcomb remains unclear on protections for workers-
On Monday, Holcomb announced his Stay-At-Home Order, asking Hoosiers to stay at home except for necessary activities and restricting onsite work to essential businesses only.
Gov. Holcomb went on to say that in situations where an employer is staying open but isn't an essential business, people and their employers should ""work it out the Indiana way.""
In contrast, his Ohio counterpart, Gov. DeWine, has asked residents to inform law enforcement of any nonessential business violating the state's pandemic rules.
Democratic Representative Dvorak called on Holcomb to clarify penalties for violations of his order.
""We have thousands of scared people who need clarity and direction right now,"" said Dvorak. ""People don't want to get themselves or their family sick, but they also don't want to face reprisals from employers for staying home during this emergency.""
Holcomb should step up to the plate and enforce the rules he put in place.
-Here's to Hoosiers-
The past few weeks have come with unprecedented levels of stress, uncertainty, and fear. But Hoosiers have met the moment with unparalleled bravery and a deep sense of community.
In every corner of our state, Hoosiers are taking care of one another. We've created a running list of how you can give or receive a hand during this time.
Take a look here.

-The 2020 Hoosier Hospitality Dinner-
We're taking our Hoosier Hospitality Dinner online and we want you to come with us!
This year, Democrats can take back the Oval Office, keep the majority in the U.S. House, elect a Democratic governor, flip the attorney general's seat, break the supermajority in the Indiana General Assembly and win local elections across the state.
But first, we need to come together and get to work. That's why we're hoping you'll join us at the 2020 Hoosier Hospitality Dinner. This is an exclusive offer to hear from Democrats across the country.
Plus, this year's speaker will be DCCC chair, Illinois Congresswoman Cheri Bustos! Cheri made history as the first woman elected to Congress in her district. Now, she's joining us in the fight to take back our nation in 2020.
You won't want to miss this!

-Hoosiers continue to wait on unemployment benefits-
In the wake of COVID-19, hundreds of thousands of Hoosiers have filed for unemployment but they still haven't received the assistance they need.
Hoosiers calling the Department of Workforce Development have had to deal with being on hold for hours only to have their calls dropped or sent to an already-full mailbox. Many have waited for over a month with no promise of how they're going to put food on the table or pay their rent.
Hoosiers need financial protection now more than ever and the Holcomb administration is letting them down.
-The Holcomb administration fails nursing home residents-
Nursing home deaths make up a staggering 41 percent of COVID-19 related deaths in our state. As a result, the federal government has stressed the need for more robust testing efforts in long-term care facilities.
As more and more governors step up for nursing home residents, Holcomb continues to drag his feet.
Several other states have implemented universal testing at nursing homes. Yet, Holcomb has failed to provide widespread testing for the staff and residents of nursing homes. He also does not require nursing homes to report which facilities are experiencing outbreaks.
His lack of concern for long-term care facilities has rendered the spread of COVID-19 far more difficult to track among one of our most vulnerable communities. Not to mention, nursing home residents and their families are kept in the dark on the status of their facility.
-Trump puts politics over public health-
Last week, President Trump threatened to withhold federal funding from states expanding mail-in and absentee voting during the pandemic.
In the last few days, the coronavirus death toll passed 100,000 in the U.S. Voting by mail is the only way we can protect people from COVID-19 while maintaining their right to vote.
Trump votes by mail, so why is he so vehemently against it for the American people?
In Indiana, the number of people requesting vote-by-mail applications in 2020 was more than 10x the number of Hoosiers voting by mail in 2016. Three in every five applications were for Democratic ballots. When voting is accessible, turnout is high. And when turnout is high, Republicans lose out.
President Trump would rather put Americans' health at risk than give even the perception of expanded voting rights. And it's all so he can keep us from voting him out.

"Team,
I know you’ve heard a lot from me this week; so, I’ll be brief.
We’re just four days out from one of the most critical deadlines of the year, and we’re still over $9k away from raising the funds we need.
Will you chip in $25 to build the 2020 Safe Voting Initiative in time?
This year, we’re up against a Party willing to put our health on the line, impede the USPS, and violate our rights to stop us from voting.
They know they can’t win fair and square, so we’ve got to vote in numbers that no shady tactics or dark money can obscure.
That’s why we launched our 2020 Safe Voting Initiative. Not only is this our largest GOTV effort to date, it’s also the ONLY program designed to minimize the health risk at the ballot box and combat the GOP’s rampant attempts at voter suppression.
Contribute $15 to become a founding member of the 2020 Safe Voting Initiative.
We aren’t going to stoop to our opponents’ level to secure our wins. We won’t call on deep-pocketed donors or allow ourselves to become beholden to special interests.
Instead, we’re asking Hoosiers like you to make sure we get this initiative off the ground before it’s too late.
Can we count on you to give $10 to get out the vote?
We’ve spent the last eight months beating the GOP. We can’t let them catch up now.
-John Zody

"TOMORROW is the MOST IMPORTANT election of lives!
Voter Guide
Where and when to vote:
Polls are open from 6:00 AM – 6:00 PM TOMORROW (LOCAL TIME).
***IF YOU’RE IN LINE TO VOTE BEFORE 6 PM, STAY IN LINE. YOU CAN STILL VOTE.
Find your polling location here.
Not sure where you're registered? Find out by visiting [[URL REDACTED]] and clicking “Check Voting Status.”
Who is on your ballot:
Build your ballot here.
What to bring to vote:
PHOTO ID that displays (1) your name, (2) an expiration date (can be current or expired sometime after November 6, 2018), and (3) is issued by the State of Indiana or the US government. You can find the acceptable forms of ID here.
***Don’t have an ID? You can ask for a provisional ballot. Then you will have until NOON, November 13, to bring the required ID into your county clerk’s office OR sign an affidavit at the clerk’s office that you are indigent or have a qualifying religious exemption to not have an ID.
***If you’re a first-time voter who registered by mail, you will also need to provide proof of residence to vote. This can be a state-issued ID where the address matches their registration, but can also be a bank statement, utility bill, etc.
Rides to the polls:
Get in touch with your county party. Find their information here.
Did you apply to vote by mail?
Have you returned your ballot? If not, we suggest hand-delivering it to your county clerk to make sure it arrives by NOON on 11/3. Find their information here.
If your ballot is lost, defective, or spoiled, OR if you can’t make the noon deadline on 11/3 to return it, YOU CAN STILL VOTE. Visit our troubleshooting page to find out how you can vote in FOUR steps or less.
Don't forget you can call our Voter Protection hotline @ 317-261-3820 or e-mail us general voting questions at [[URL REDACTED]]
Help get out the vote

Can you help us mobilize the 5% by calling Hoosiers that haven't yet cast their ballot?
Don’t wake up on November 4 and wonder if you did enough.
Sign up for a shift of virtual phone banking, and we’ll send you everything you need to join the fight.
All times in EDT.
Tuesday, Nov. 3

You can join us on Facebook Live or YouTube @ 7 PM EDT Tomorrow, 11/3.
Build the Voter Protection Team
A critical part of the 2020 Safe Voting Initiative is protecting voters from the GOP’s shady attempts at thwarting our ballots.
We’re assembling a statewide team of lawyers to help Hoosiers push back on voter suppression on and after election day. But it’s going to take resources to get this done.
Can you chip in $7, or whatever you can, to help us carry out this final component of the 2020 Safe Voting Initiative?

"Let’s not mince words; we need to go into September ready to get out the vote like never before. That’s why we set a goal to raise $12,000 by August 31.
Honestly? We’re still over $10,000 short of that goal.
Chip in $25 to become a founding member of the 2020 Safe Voting Initiative.
Friend, you’ve been fighting with us to elect Dems up and down the ballot because you know there are races we can’t afford to lose this year. Your hard work is why we’re winning.
But winning doesn’t mean we’ve won. The other side is banking on us tiring out and giving up. Right now, they’re calling on special interests to pump money into their campaigns so that they can out-run us.
The next few days are vital to maintaining the momentum we’ve built together.
Contribute $15 to make sure they don't out-run us.
That’s why we launched our largest get-out-the-vote effort to date, the 2020 Safe Voting Initiative. This program calls for doubling the size of our staff, maintaining a voter protection hotline, running a massive digital campaign, and registering more first-time voters than ever before.
The Initiative is extensive, but if we’re going to thwart the GOP’s rampant attempts at voter suppression, we’ve got to vote in numbers they can’t obscure.
Friend, will you give $10 to help us reach our startup goal?
We’re counting on you to keep our momentum going.

"In a shameless display of putting politics before people, the GOP has voted down giving every Hoosier the chance to vote by mail.
Chip in $25 to the #1 vote-by-mail program in the state.
So far, 37,100 Hoosiers have requested vote-by-mail ballots; that’s 371 TIMES the number of people that had requested them by this point in 2016.
It couldn’t be more obvious: Hoosiers want to vote by mail.
Yet, the GOP won’t even agree to make voting by mail more accessible for eligible Hoosiers. They would rather put our health on the line than give even the slightest perception of expanded voting rights.
Contribute to $12 to help get Hoosiers the tools they need to vote safely.
We aren’t waiting for Republicans to give us the green light. We’re building our Vote-by-Mail Outreach Program NOW to make sure eligible Hoosiers have the tools to vote by mail.
In 2018, we sent out hundreds of thousands of applications in the general election. This year, we’re counting on you to help us break that record.
How many Hoosiers can count on you?

-The 2020 Safe Voting Initiative-
This week, we launched our largest get-out-the-vote effort to date, the 2020 Safe Voting Initiative. This is the ONLY GOTV program in the state designed to minimize the health risk at the ballot box and combat the GOP's rampant attempts at voter suppression.
The 2020 Safe Voting Initiative is our greatest undertaking yet. It calls for doubling the size of our staff, maintaining a voter protection hotline, running a massive digital campaign, and registering more first-time voters than ever before.
Read the full plan.
It's also 100% grassroots-backed. Unlike our opponents, we don't broker shady deals with special interests to fund our initiatives. We build our programs with Hoosiers like you. That means we're counting on you to help us reach our startup goal by August 31.
Friend, this is one of the most critical points in the election. We need to go into September, ready to get out the vote like never before. Right now, we're more than $8k short of raising the funds we need.
Will you chip in $15 to become a founding member of the 2020 Safe Voting Initiative?
-Democrats fight for mail-in voting-
This week, Indiana became one of six states rejecting the expansion of mail-in voting this year. Since the GOP refuses to expand to no-excuse voting by mail, a coalition of Democratic mayors called on them to permit Hoosier voters who fear contracting COVID-19 to vote by mail under the current law.
In a letter mailed Friday, the mayors requested Holcomb and election officials publicly clarify who and which ""excuse"" high-risk voters could select when applying to vote by mail.
Indiana Democratic Party Chairman John Zody joined the mayors in calling for what is a commonsense next step.
Join us in calling them to expand voting by mail by signing our petition.
Help us build our 2020 Vote-by-Mail Program to mail eligible Hoosiers vote by mail applications here.
-The RNC-
The Republican National Convention made it clear: Trump and Pence know they can't win fair and square. They're relying on pure, unadulterated lies to power their campaign.
Between blatantly falsifying COVID-19 data, denigrating science and belittling calls for racial justice, the Trump/Pence recipe for success looks more like a one-way ticket out of office.
Meanwhile, Democrats continue to build momentum up and down the ballot. This week's polls kept Biden ahead of Trump in battleground states and put Hoosiers like Christina Hale 5 points above her opponent.
But can't stop here; if Trump and his cronies are going to keep their shady tactics up, we've got to vote in numbers they can't obscure.
Take the pledge to vote in Indiana. Share it with your friends. And we'll send you our 2020 voter guide.
-Dr. Woody Myers' Virtual Event-
Come join some of Indiana's most prominent leaders, Dr. Woody Myers, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, and Mayor Joe Hogsett, for a virtual fundraiser!

"MIDNIGHT tonight marks our final FEC deadline before the election. Right now, we’re still $3k short of our goal.
The importance of this deadline cannot be overstated. It will dictate our ability to get out the vote and determine the narrative of the final days of this election. This deadline has the power to erase the progress we’ve made and tip the results in the GOP’s favor.
On our last FEC deadline, they outraised us by just $1k and they spun a story about us falling behind. The truth is we're up in the polls and well within the margin of hustle. We just have to reach this goal so that we can continue to get out the vote like never before. Friend, this campaign is 100%-grassroots-backed. So, I'm asking for your help. Can you give your first $7, or whatever you can, to reclaim this election for Hoosier Democrats?

"Greetings, fellow Hoosier Democrats.
This is a painful and challenging time across America and here in Indiana. The nation is in upheaval as the anguish over institutional racism and police violence cries out for action, while we continue to see our daily lives radically transformed by the spread of a deadly pandemic.
If one thing has become clearer than ever in these recent days, it’s that leadership matters.
The issues we are grappling with go even beyond politics. But we have seen why it is deeply important who sits in the Oval Office, who legislates on Capitol Hill, and it is so extremely important who is in local and state offices.
On Friday, Hoosier Democrats from around the state will come together for the virtual Hoosier Hospitality Dinner and will pledge to delivering change in 2020.
Right here in Indiana, we have nationally recognized battleground races and opportunities to take back key state and local offices. I hope you can join Hoosier Democrats to hear from keynote speaker Congresswoman Cheri Bustos, and I hope you'll join us as we fight to move Indiana forward.
Stay well, stay involved and stay safe,
Pete Buttigieg

"The U.S. is short on ventilators by nearly 800,000. Health care providers are using trash bags as protective equipment. And Americans are dying of COVID-19 before they can even get tested.
In 2018, Trump disbanded a National Security Council focused pandemic preparedness.
Now, the U.S. is short on ventilators by nearly 800,000. Health care providers are using trash bags as protective equipment. And Americans are dying of COVID-19 before they can even get tested.
Contribute $10 for a president that will protect Americans in a public health crisis.
Trump has taken every opportunity to relieve himself of the blame. He accused hospitals of hoarding medical supplies and even denied that we needed ventilators.
Let’s not mince words, we have to defeat Trump to prevent this from happening again. But we’re going to need all hands on deck to do it.
Will you contribute $20 to help us build the campaign to vote out Donald Trump?
Every donation goes toward making calls, creating digital campaigns, and getting vote-by-mail ballots to voters so that we can vote Trump out.

"-May 22, 2020-
-Indiana's first vote-by-mail election-
Yesterday was the deadline to apply to vote by mail in Indiana's first-ever opportunity to let all registered voters vote by mail, regardless of reason. We continue to believe it is the safest thing for voters and poll workers.
Hundreds of thousands of Hoosiers applied to vote by mail. Hoosier Dems stepped up to protect each other and make their voices heard.
This is more than just a response to the pandemic. It is a step toward making Indiana's elections more convenient and inclusive.
Thank you for making history and proving that voting by mail works.
If you were one of the thousands of Democrats that applied to vote by mail, we want to hear from you! Tell us about your experience here.
-INDems' virtual Hoosier Hospitality Dinner-
Join us for our virtual Hoosier Hospitality Dinner on June 12!
This is your chance to hear from Democrats across the country and be a part of the Party's work in 2020. You won't want to miss it!
Watch for the announcement of our keynote speaker on Tuesday, May 26.
Visit our 2020 HH Dinner page for more information.
-Holcomb's mega-donor gets multi-million dollar state contract-
In March, Grant Verstandig, the Chief Digital Officer at Optum Health, dumped $50,000 into Holcomb's re-election campaign.
Then, late last month Optum Health received a $17.9 million contract from the state to conduct COVID-19 testing. They were the only testing company that the Holcomb administration asked for a quote.
Yep. Holcomb's deep-pocketed political donors were fast-tracked to a multi-million dollar state contract.
-Todd Rokita: the GOP's 11th-hour Attorney General candidate-
This week, former congressman Todd Rokita entered the Republican race for Attorney General. His eleventh-hour entrance comes after the Indiana Supreme Court suspended Curtis Hill's law license for 30 days due to allegations of sexual misconduct from four women.
Rokita, who infamously lost the GOP's primary for the U.S. Senate to Mike Braun in 2018, is gasoline on the housefire that is the Republican's forlorn race to keep the AG's seat.
His candidacy is a clear indicator of the GOP's lack of confidence in Curtis Hill. But with Hill refusing to drop out, Rokita will all but ensure that the GOP Attorney General's race will go from an embarrassing effort to a bare-knuckled brawl.
-Nursing homes aren't receiving the care they need-
In New York, where nursing home residents account for about 25 percent of deaths, the governor is mandating twice-weekly testing of staff. In Indiana, where nursing home deaths make up a staggering 41 percent of total COVID19-related fatalities, the Holcomb administration has only offered excuses.
Even as Holcomb continues to lift safety regulations, the state has failed to provide widespread testing to nursing homes. The White House recommends that all residents and staff members of nursing homes be tested.
Unlike other states, the Holcomb administration has not required nursing homes to report which facilities are experiencing outbreaks, leaving many Hoosiers to wonder about the safety of their loved ones.
The Holcomb administration's inadequate response not only puts our loved ones' lives at risk but also leaves us in the dark. Hoosiers deserve better.

"Hey friend--
MIDNIGHT tonight marks the end of the second quarter, and we are just $7,500 short of our quarterly goal.
Chip in $20.20 to help us reach our goal!
Let’s not mince words. We’re in the middle of the most important election of our lives. Health care, teacher pay, voting rights, and equality are all on the ballot.
But while we’ve been operating on grassroots contributions and holding inclusive events, the GOP has thrown expensive fundraisers with the wealthy and well-connected.
That’s why I wanted to reach out to you personally to see if you'd help us reach our goal before it’s too late.
Friend, will you give $10 to help turn Indiana blue?
It’s going to take time and resources to make sure more Hoosiers vote blue than ever before. We’re putting in the work now so we can fight hard and win big in November.
If every person reading this gave just $5, we’d be able to reach our quarterly goal and build the campaign to turn Indiana blue in November.
Give $5 today to make sure we reach our goal before it’s too late!
I'm counting on you.
Thanks,
John Zody
Chairman of the Indiana Democratic Party

"On January 25th, we held our most successful candidate training yet. Hoosier Democrats from around the state are fired up to run in 2020. Don’t take my word, hear from the candidates themselves, friend.
Nearly 200 teachers, parents, health care providers, and community advocates trained to run as Democrats. They’re real Hoosiers who’ve stepped up to make change in their communities.
Training candidates is the first step in taking back our state.
Now, it’s time to help these candidates win. Every dollar you chip in goes toward candidate services, connecting volunteers with opportunities, and mobilizing voters so we can elect more Democrats.

"-June 26, 2020-
-Myers' and Lawson's plan to REFORM-
Dr. Woody Myers and Linda Lawson introduced their Criminal Justice R.E.F.O.R.M. Plan, a six-tenet plan designed to combat racial disparities in Indiana's criminal justice system.
Here's the plan:
R- Repair the criminal justice system by expanding intervention efforts to keep people out of traditional courts and prisons
E- End police brutality with new training procedures to eliminate excessive force
F- Funding an intersectional approach to public safety by reprioritizing taxpayers dollars
O- Oversight through no-tolerance accountability policies and procedures
R- Rebuild our communities by investing in sustainable community development
M- Marijuana decriminalization
In Indiana, Black adults are 5 times more likely to be sent to prison than white adults. This plan introduces a holistic, more equitable approach to criminal justice designed to eradicate the disproportionate effects of the system on Black and Brown Hoosiers.
You can read Dr. Myers' full plan here: Criminal Justice R.E.F.O.R.M.
-Weinzapfel defends the ACA-
This week, Democratic AG Candidate, Jonathan Weinzapfel, spoke at the Democratic Attorneys General Association's ""On The Trail: Candidate Health Care Forum.""
""It really is up to us as Democratic candidates for Attorney General to really be there on the front lines and support these families, make sure they have opportunities to succeed, and I really think that starts with preserving the Affordable Care Act."" - Weinzapfel
As Weinzapfel continues to underscore the importance of affordable health care for all Hoosiers, every single one of his Republican counterparts has vowed to terminate the ACA as soon they take office.
The good news is: the Cook Political Report moved the Indiana Attorney General's race from ""leans Republican"" to toss-up!
This year, we can put a Democrat in the AG's office and ensure that Hoosiers keep their health care.
-Holcomb's scrawny plan to address unemployment-
Last Friday, the Holcomb administration confirmed an estimated 408,000 Hoosiers are out of work.
More than 3 out of 4 Hoosiers working in manufacturing who lost their job in February are still out of work. It's almost as bad for Hoosiers who worked in the leisure and hospitality industry, where 93,000 or 72% are still without work.
And Indiana's unemployment numbers are getting worse, not better. This week marked the second straight week of an increase in unemployment claims with 32% more people filing for unemployment week-over-week.
So what's Governor Holcomb's plan to combat what was the worst unemployment rate in Indiana since the Great Depression? Allocate just enough CARES Act dollars to put somewhere around 35,000 Hoosiers back to work.
At best, Holcomb's plan will help put about 9% of 400,000+ Hoosiers back to work. What about the other 365,000 Hoosiers in need of work?
The house is burning down, and Eric Holcomb is trying to put it out with a squirt gun.
-Curtis Hill's Latest Attack on LGBTQ+ Families-
On June 15th, Hill made his second attempt at attacking Hoosier families with LGBTQ+ parents.
The disgraced AG candidate asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review the ruling that same-sex couples should have the same rights as parents on birth certificates without going through the expense of an adoption process.
Federal courts have ruled that this is a matter of marriage, allowing same-sex couples the same parental rights as heterosexual parents. But that hasn't stopped Hill from trying to repeal the ruling and rob LBGTQ+ parents of their rights.
Bottom line: Nothing will stop Hill from attacking members of the LGBTQ+ community. We can't let him serve another term.
-Trump puts political gain before American lives-
At his rally last weekend, Trump told supporters that he asked his administration to slow down COVID-19 testing.
Time and time again, health care officials have warned us: widespread testing is the key to stopping the spread. So why did the President ask his administration to slow down testing?
Less testing = less documented cases of COVID-19. He's playing Russian Roulette with our lives so he can forge a successful coronavirus response.
More than 123,000 Americans have died from COVID-19. Hundreds of thousands of people have lost their loved ones. And Trump wants to cut the one thing that could prevent this from happening again.
We established a One-Term President Fund to make sure we don't have to endure another four years of this.
Will you give $5 to help us run ads, make calls, and get Dems to the polls in November?
This is how we are going to elect a president that puts American lives before cheap political scams.

"-March 20, 2020-
-Democrats take action on COVID-19-
As COVID-19 hits Indiana, Democratic officials across the state have sprung into action to protect Hoosiers.
Hoosier Democratic mayors around the state are urging small businesses in their communities to apply for disaster assistance loans through the US Small Business Administration.
Indianapolis Mayor Hogsett and the Indianapolis City Council have taken unprecedented steps to provide the option to vote by mail to all Indianapolis residents. They plan to mail every registered voter an absentee ballot application with instructions on how they can request to vote by mail.
New Albany Mayor Gahan has contacted the local health department, the state health department, and the governor’s office to demand information regarding Indiana’s capacity to test for COVID-19; he also met with several local businesses to help them transition and maintain communication with them.
House Democratic Leader Phil GiaQuinta was pleased Governor Eric Holcomb embraced ideas from House Democrats to support Hoosiers during the COVID-19 pandemic like making it easier to apply for unemployment benefits and ensuring Hoosiers don't lose their health care.
Representative Gregory Porter called on Gov. Holcomb to use the state’s $291 million budget surplus to support the economic security, food security, and health security of Hoosiers, resulting in Holcomb adopting these measures.
-Dr. Woody Myers has a plan to tackle the virus-
Democratic gubernatorial candidate, Dr. Woody Myers, has devised an 11-point plan to control the spread of the coronavirus. His proposal includes actions like appointing a coronavirus task force, calling a special session of the General Assembly, establishing testing centers, and providing resources to businesses.
Myers is a former Indiana State Health Commissioner, an emergency room physician, and a nationally recognized leader in public health. In the midst of a public health crisis, Myers’ expertise and preparedness could quite literally save Hoosiers’ lives.
He is showing us what real leadership looks like in a crisis.
-We’re fighting for the primary-
The Indiana primary election is moving from May 5 to June 2. We believe that no Hoosier should have to risk their health to vote. For the first time, every Hoosier who wants to vote by mail will be able to for the June 2 primary. Apply to vote by mail here.
Hoosier Democrats believe that holding the election on May 5 and expanding the right to vote through mail-in options was the appropriate decision. However, it has become clear the window for that to happen is quickly closing, and we must first be concerned about the health and safety of the public.
We reached an agreement with our Republican counterparts to move the May 5 primary to June 2. Republicans have agreed to join a bipartisan petition to the Election Commission for an unprecedented expansion of vote by mail for the primary election.
These efforts include petitioning the Indiana Election Commission to: move to no-fault absentee voting; develop an email option to submit an application to vote by mail; allow any ballots already in motion for the May primary to be counted in June; expand options for how ballots are transported and who may serve on a traveling board; and keep the absentee window open now through the June election.

"Last week, President Trump threatened to withhold federal funding from states expanding mail-in and absentee voting during the pandemic.
Chip in $25 to help us build the campaign to vote him out.
Trump himself votes by mail. So, why doesn't he think Americans deserve the same?
He's worried about what mail-in elections mean for Republicans. Because when everyone can vote, the GOP loses out.
Contribute $12 to elect a leader that puts our health above their political gain.
President Trump would rather put Americans' health at risk than give even the perception of expanded voting rights. And it's all so he can keep us from voting him out.
We believe Hoosiers deserve a leader that puts our safety above their own political gain. That's why we can't let him get another four years in office.
We created our One-Term President Fund so that we can build the campaign to vote Trump out. Every contribution goes toward making calls, sending texts, and making sure Hoosier Democrats vote in November. Because we believe Hoosiers deserve a leader that puts our safety above their own political gain.
Will you give $5 to help us make Trump a one-term president?

"I know you’ve seen politicians manipulate deadlines and fundraising numbers to garner your support. That’s not what’s happening here.
We’re up against a REAL make-it-or-break-it deadline, and we’ve got three days to raise $8k.
Chip in $25 to the 2020 Safe Voting Initiative.
Here’s the difference between our grassroots campaign and the GOP’s dark-money-backed schemes: when we need to fund an initiative, we come to you; they call up deep-pocketed donors and promise to put special interests before Hoosiers.
They buy their support. We earn ours.
Right now, we’re out-polling our opponents in countless races. But we’ve been here before only to have them broker shady deals and throw money at their campaigns in the 11th hour.
We’ve got to break the cycle of electing career politicians beholden to special interests. We’ve got to make sure our grassroots dollars go further than their dark money. Will you chip in $17 to make it happen?
This is going to take real work. That’s why we created the 2020 Safe Voting Initiative, the ONLY GOTV program in the state designed to keep voters safe and combat voter suppression.
I know our goals are lofty. But if we can back a record-breaking GOTV campaign, we’ve got a real chance of winning big and getting rid of politicians bought and sold by special interests.
Give $10 to become a founding member of the 2020 Safe Voting Initiative.
We’re counting on you to help us break the cycle.

"We’re partnering with the College Dems of Indiana to launch an unprecedented voter outreach program: the Young Voters Project.
This year, young people make up one of the largest voting blocs in the U.S., with one in ten eligible voters being 18-23 years old.
Will you chip in $30 to help build the Young Voters Project?
We’re partnering with the College Dems of Indiana to launch an unprecedented voter outreach program: the Young Voters Project.
The YVP is a three-pronged plan to provide voter registration trainings for the College Dems, register young Hoosier voters, and carry out a voter outreach program to get college-aged Dems voting in November.
Invest $15 in the Young Voters Project.
It’s going to take resources to get this done at universities across the state. So, we’ve set a goal to raise $30,000 by the end of the week.
Unlike our dark-money-backed counterparts, our initiatives are 100% grassroots-funded. That means we’re relying on donors like you to help us make sure young Dems have the tools to vote this year.
Help us invest in young Hoosiers. Give $8 to the Young Voters Project.

"We won’t be able to get it done.
Friend,
I just finished running the numbers one last time before our MIDNIGHT deadline. Right now, we’re only $1,598 short of our goal!
WEEK GOAL RAISED REMAINING
10/4-10/10 $8,000 $8,055 GOAL HIT
10/11-10/17 $6,700 $5,450 $1,250
10/18-10/21 $7,950 $6,352 $1,598
There's no way around it; this is one of the most critical points in our 2020 Safe Voting Initiative. Today is the last day we can garner the resources to get out our FINAL round of vote-by-mail application outreach.
Unlike our opponents, we aren't going call on special interests to pump money into our campaign. Our Vote-by-Mail Program is grassroots-backed. That means if we don’t raise the funds we need to reach voters, we won’t be able to get it done.
If we have to scale back our Vote-by-Mail Program, we risk losing more than 60,000 votes and significantly increasing the health threat at the ballot box.
Friend, if everyone reading this gave just $5, we'd be able to help thousands of Hoosiers vote safely by mail. That's a small price to pay when it comes to our health and our voting rights. So, I'm asking, will you chip in $5, or whatever you can, to save the Vote-by-Mail Program?

-INDems Launch Progress Tracker-
The 2020 Safe Voting Initiative is our 100%-grassroots-backed plan to get out the vote safely. We're counting on you to help us build this groundbreaking project and we're dedicated to keeping you in the loop.
That's why we launched our 2020 Safe Voting Initiative Progress Tracker. This is where we'll update you on what we've been doing to get out the vote and where we're planning to go.
We've got just 46 days to win this election. Meeting our September fundraising goal is critical to getting it done.
Right now, we're more than $13k shy of raising the funds we need to get out the vote like never before.
Will you help us build the next steps of the 2020 Safe Voting Initiative? We can't do this without you.

-Republican Superintendent of Public Instruction continues to endorse Dems-
The Superintendent of Public Instruction, Jennifer McCormick, has officially endorsed four Democrats in the 2020 election: attorney general candidate Jonathan Weinzapfel, Aimee Rivera Cole HD-37, Melanie Wright HD-35, and Fady Qaddoura SD-30.
Her endorsements should come as no surprise to the Republican Party as they have spent the last decade slashing through school funding, triggering an unprecedented teacher shortage and making money off for-profit charter school scams.
""I've chosen to endorse those candidates who I feel will support public education and not be owned by their donors,"" said McCormick.
-Dr. Myers picks up Biden endorsement-
This week, Dr. Woody Myers earned Joe Biden's endorsement.
""Dr. Myers has served under both Democratic and Republican administrations to make life better for working families,"" said Biden.
""I am proud to endorse Dr. Myers and look forward to working with him to continue the fight to expand access to health care, improve Indiana's public schools and create good-paying jobs for all Hoosiers.""
-Young Professionals Virtual Event-
You're invited to a virtual fireside chat featuring young Democrats leading the way!
This month's event will include Muthoni Wambu Kraal, National Political and Organizing Director, DNC & Kevin Lima, Youth Political Director, DNC. The event will be moderated by President of College Democrats of Indiana, Alessia Modjarrad.
Don't miss your chance to ask our speakers about their path to the DNC and how to get your foot in the door.
When: September 30 6:00pm EDT

"-June 5, 2020-
-BLACK LIVES MATTER-
The murder of George Floyd is undoubtedly on all of our hearts and minds. Sadly, George Floyd is just one example in the long list of unarmed Black Americans killed by law enforcement officers.
Hoosiers and Americans are rightfully angry. Angry because the cycle of injustice lurches on and voices who have over and over called for change have gone unheard. Angry because righteous protests have been expropriated by forces that seek to divide us and destroy the livelihoods of our neighbors.
We cannot allow people of color to be marginalized and erased if we truly seek to achieve a more perfect union. That responsibility is with all of us. It starts with speaking up.
The time for silence has passed.
Sign on to our petition to fight for justice for Black Americans.
-The 2020 Primary Election-
On Tuesday, Hoosiers cast their ballots in the 2020 primary election! We're going into the 2020 election with a diverse bench ready to fight for Hoosiers. In every corner of the state, Dems are running to bring positive change to their communities.
Fight out who is running in your area here.
The historic election was Indiana's first-ever opportunity to let all registered voters vote by mail, regardless of reason. Hundreds of thousands of Hoosiers voted by mail. Three in every five vote-by-mail applications were for Democratic ballots.
To Democrats, this election was more than just a response to the pandemic; it was a step toward making Indiana's elections more convenient and inclusive. And we're fighting to bring the success of voting by mail to the 2020 general election.
We've called on the election commission to extend no-fault absentee voting to the general election because every Hoosier deserves to vote safely and conveniently.
-The 2020 Virtual State Convention-
Tomorrow, Saturday, June 6, we are officially gaveling our 2020 Virtual State Convention to order to discuss Convention logistics and make announcements. Join us on Facebook Live to watch!
Stay tuned all next week for Virtual State Convention activities coming to you, and check out our 2020 Convention Program for dates and times!
The 2020 State Convention is where we'll vote on the party platform and nominate our Lieutenant Governor and Attorney General candidates as well as our national delegates! It's an essential step in the biggest election of our lives and we're hoping you'll join us, virtually!
-The 2020 Hoosier Hospitality Dinner-
We're taking our Hoosier Hospitality Dinner online and we want you to come with us!
2020 is the most important election of our lives. Health care, teacher pay, voting rights, and equality are all on the ballot.
It's time to come together and get to work. That's why we're hoping you'll join us at the 2020 Hoosier Hospitality Dinner. This is an exclusive offer to hear from Democrats across the country.
Plus, this year's speaker will be DCCC chair, Illinois Congresswoman Cheri Bustos! Cheri made history as the first woman elected to Congress in her district. Now, she's joining us in the fight to take back our nation in 2020.
You won't want to miss this!
More info and tickets here.
-The 2020 State Convention Preview-
Yesterday, we held kicked off our 2020 Virtual State Convention with the WISH-TV Convention Preview Broadcast. The broadcast signified the first time in Indiana's history that a political convention was broadcast on TV.
The broadcast is just one way we're working to keep our 2020 State Convention open, inclusive, and safe.
Candidates for Attorney General, Lieutenant Governor, and Governor shared their vision for a better Indiana. And Hoosiers leaders like Congressman André Carson, Mayor Joe Hogsett, Christina Hale, and former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg reminded us of the importance of the 2020 Election.
One thing is clear: Hoosier Democrats are ready to fight harder than ever before.
You can watch The 2020 State Convention Preview in its entirety here.

"We’re gearing up to go into September, ready to get out the vote like never before. That’s why we set a goal to raise $12k for our 2020 Safe Voting Initiative by MIDNIGHT tonight.
When we launched our initiative last week, no one thought we’d be able to raise the money in time. Now, thanks to Hoosiers like you, we’re just $1,000 away from reaching our goal.
But that doesn’t mean we’re there yet. Will you chip in $25 to help us reach our goal in time?
Friend, I can’t stress the importance of this deadline enough. Every dollar you give expands our capacity to thwart voter suppression and educate Hoosiers on their options to vote safely before the election day hustle begins.
In other words, the funds we raise today will go even further than they would two months from now.
The GOP doesn’t want us to reach our goal. They’re hoping we throw in the towel before we can build a GOTV program capable of pushing back on their shady tactics. They’re banking on us losing the progress we’ve made.
That’s why we need Hoosiers to show up now. We need Hoosiers ready to show them that their dark-money-backed campaigns won’t outlast our grassroots movement.
Friend, this moment is critical to the rest of our campaign. Can we count on you to step up?
Chip in $10 to become a founding member of the 2020 Safe Voting Initiative.

"While Senate Democrats push for a fair impeachment trial, photos of Senator Mike Braun schmoozing with Rudy Guiliani and Lev Parnas have surfaced.
Chip in $20 to show Mike Braun you believe in a fair and honest trial.
With friends like that, we’re willing to bet Braun won’t call for more witnesses to testify or put a fair trial before appeasing his wealthy and well-connected friends.
Here’s the hitch, friend. Mike Braun isn’t up for election until 2024. To beat him then, we need to invest in building the political infrastructure here NOW.
Back politicians with integrity and want to beat Braun in 2024? Chip in $10 to fund our Grassroots operation in 2020.

"-July 10, 2020-
-It's official-
It's official: Todd Rokita is the GOP's AG candidate.
The bad news? Rokita has spent his political career stripping Americans of their health care and jacking up premiums. His 2020 candidacy puts over 560,000 Hoosiers' health care at risk.
This is a race we can't afford to lose.
The good news? Rokita is an infamous loser. He lost the race to replace Mike Pence in 2016 and got outgunned in the 2018 Senate primary. The GOP even drew him out of his own legislative district to keep him from running. His unprecedented losing streak explains why the AG's race moved from ""leans Republican"" to ""toss-up.""
This is a race we can win as long as we have the resources to do it.
We launched our Take Down Todd Fund to make sure we protect our health care and restore integrity to the AG's office.
Will you chip in $5 to help us take down Todd and save our care?
-Once again, testing dwindles while cases surge-
Indiana logged its highest COVID-19 weekly testing total the week of June 14. That Saturday in Tulsa, President Donald Trump implored his people to “slow the testing down, please.”
It appears Gov. Holcomb was listening.
Since then, Indiana’s weekly testing total has fallen for two consecutive weeks. Last week’s test totals fell by more than 16% from June 14 weekly totals.
At a time when cases are surging, and the governor himself has slowed his reopening plan as a result of rising concern, we have less surveillance as to where the virus is than two weeks ago.
-Justice for Vauhxx Booker-
This week, Indiana made national headlines when Vauhxx Booker was assaulted at Lake Monroe on the 4th of July. His case is a clear representation of the racism that pervades every aspect of life for Black Hoosiers.
In a video of the incident, Booker can be seen surrounded by men pinning him against a tree and threatening him.
Officers from the Department of Natural Resources, who had jurisdiction over the area, arrived at the scene after but neglected to make any arrests, leaving what Booker called a “clear and present danger” out in the community.
Since then, the GOP has remained notably silent on the issue. That is until Gov. Holcomb spoke out in support of the DNR’s response.
Yep. The GOP has done nothing but support the lack of concern for Black Hoosiers.
We must do better in November.
-The GOP [[URL REDACTED]] mail?-
This week wrapped up the Republican State Convention. Here’s the problem: every single GOP delegate had the option to vote by mail at their convention. Not only did the GOP trust that voting by mail works, but they also made an effort to protect their delegates from COVID-19.
Yet, they still haven’t agreed to institute no-fault voting by mail in the 2020 general election.
COVID-19 case numbers are higher than they were during the primary election. So why hasn’t the GOP committed to voting by mail in the general? Perhaps it’s because when more Hoosiers can vote, Republicans lose out. In the primary, three out of every five vote-by-mail applications were for Democratic ballots.
Apparently, the GOP's 2020 campaign consists of putting Hoosiers' health at risk and playing games about the efficacy of voting by mail – starting at the top with President Trump’s continued uninformed comments about it. Disgraceful.
Sign the petition to join us in calling on the GOP to institute no-fault voting by mail in the 2020 general election here.

"January 3, 2020
-Our record-breaking inaugurations-
In the last few weeks we watched countless historical inaugurations. Miles Nelson was sworn in as Carmel’s first Democratic councilor. And Robert Pope became Avon’s first Democratic councilor. Emily Styron became Zionsville’s first Democratic mayor.
Now, nearly 750,000 more Hoosiers live under Democratic mayoral leadership than Republican leadership. And we added a council majority in Columbus and Elkhart and strengthened council majorities in Evansville and Portage.
But our record-breaking wins don’t stop with flipping seats and building majorities, we also elected a historically diverse group of officials. A record number of LGBTQ Hoosier Democrats were elected to the Indianapolis City County Council. We elected Indiana’s first transgender official. Elkhart has its first African American mayor, Rod Roberson. And we elected a record number of Democratic women mayors.
Let’s build on that progress and win up and down the ballot in 2020.
-Child care failures affect Hoosiers-
Child care in Indiana is looking worse and worse. Over 320,000 children are in need of childcare but there are fewer than 50,000 high-quality early childhood education seats. And the state is losing about $1.1 billion due to missed work because of lacking childcare and employee attrition.
Holcomb claims he wants to take action on childcare, but he’s spent the last three years with a supermajority in the General Assembly and we’ve seen no improvements. In fact, he’s failed to fund pre-k for every four year old and we rank dead last in the U.S. for resources going toward early education.
Unfortunately, these failures have a real effect on Hoosiers. A recent study demonstrated that early childhood education is a predictor of public health. So, failing to provide child care is failing Hoosiers in every sense.
-Holcomb still denying the Amazon scandal-
Governor Holcomb insists that officials did everything right in an investigation into a worker’s death at an Amazon warehouse. Reminder: this is after a state safety inspector said he investigated the death and found they had not properly trained the worker. He also claims to have recorded a conversation between his boss and Amazon officials in which his supervisor allegedly says she’ll need to shift blame onto the worker, away from Amazon and instructs the inspector to “manipulate” his citations.
Chairman Zody issued a public records request for details and called on Governor Holcomb to make his administration’s investigation – including his schedule – public.

"We asked Hoosiers about their vote-by-mail experience in the 2020 primary. Countless people told us that they relied on the tools we created to navigate voting by mail for the first time.
Invest $20.20 in our Vote-by-Mail Outreach Program.
When the GOP voted down all of our initiatives to make voting by mail safer and more convenient during the primary, we knew we had to step up. Now, they’re back to their old ways.
Republicans have made it clear: they won’t do anything to help Hoosiers vote by mail in the general election.
We didn’t wait on them for vote-by-mail outreach in the spring. And we sure as hell aren’t waiting on them now.
Chip in $15 to help us build the 2020 Vote-by-Mail Outreach Program.
Our Vote-by-Mail Outreach Program is the ONLY way Hoosiers can get the tools they need to vote by mail. And it's a 100%-grassroots effort. We’re relying on Hoosiers like you to build this program.
Friend, will you give $7 to help back the ONLY party trying to keep Hoosiers safe during this election?
We can’t do this without you.

"-September 25, 2020-
-Thank you, RBG-
The passing of RBG is a tremendous loss for our nation.
Justice Ginsburg threw open doors for every American. She was an architect in the legal fight for American equality, championing marginalized voices and breaking down every barrier that stood in her way. She fought fiercely for women, LGBTQ rights, communities of color, and reproductive freedom.
Her decisions will be woven in the fabric of American history forever, and for that, we are better.
Sign on here to join us in thanking the Notorious RBG for her relentless dedication to this country.
-The final voter registration push-
Let’s not mince words; with just 10 days left to register to vote, we no longer have the luxury of time. Your grassroots support in the next few days will determine our success on November 3rd.
The GOP has already started running attack ads on our candidates and doing everything in their power to suppress our votes. It's clear that we’ve got to get a record-breaking number of Hoosier Dems voting this year. That means registering thousands of first-time voters.
We already have a plan to make sure that happens; we just need the resources to see it through. To get this done, it’s absolutely necessary that we reach our quarterly fundraising goal by MIDNIGHT on 9/30. But we’re $5,539 short right now.
This effort is 100%-grassroots-backed. We can’t get there without you.
Can you rush an emergency donation to our GOTV program before it's too late?

-Todd Young flips on SCOTUS position-
This week, Senator Todd Young reversed his 2016 position to hold off on filling a Supreme Court vacancy in a Presidential election year.
In 2016, we were 270 days away from the election when Senate Republicans blocked a vote on Obama's SCOTUS nominee. Now, with just 39 days, they're moving swiftly to fill RBG's spot.
They may have lost all of their integrity, but we can't stop fighting. Reproductive freedom, LGBTQ+ rights, health care, voting rights, and the safety of black and brown Hoosiers are all on the line.
Can you take 90 seconds to call Senator Mike Braun and Senator Todd Young and tell them where you stand? Here's how:
1. Call Sen. Braun's office at (317) 822-8240 and Sen. Young's office at (317) 226-6700.
2. Tell them you DO NOT want them to confirm another SCOTUS justice until after the inauguration.
3. Share your experience on Facebook and Twitter and be sure to tag us.

"For the first time in history, every single Hoosier voter can vote by mail. If you’re wondering how you can do it, we’ve got you covered. Here’s everything you need to know about voting by mail in the 2020 primary:
-Apply to vote by mail by May 21-
Your county clerk must have your application by May 21. If they receive your application after May 21, even if it is postmarked before, it will not be counted. So, we suggest applying online or hand-delivering your form to your county clerk’s office.
There are three ways to apply to vote by mail:
1. Fill out your application online at [[URL REDACTED]]
2. Download the form to mail it in here.
3. Call the Election Division to request an application: (317) 232-3939
You can check the status of your application by visiting “My Voter Portal” on [[URL REDACTED]]
Looking for step-by-step instructions on applying to vote by mail? Check out our 30-second video on how to fill out a mail-in application here. Or watch our video on how to fill out the online application here.
-Apply to vote by mail by noon on June 2-
Your county clerk must have your ballot by June 2 at noon. Anything postmarked before June 2, but received after June 2 at noon will not be counted.
To have your ballot counted, you must sign the outer security envelope in the space provided.
-Additional Resources-
For deadlines, instructions, and troubleshooting on registering to vote, applying to vote by mail, and mailing in your ballot take a look at our vote-by-mail flowchart.

"For the first time in history, every single Hoosier voter can vote by mail. This is a historic expansion of voting rights.
Chip in $20.20 to help build our Vote by Mail Outreach Initiative.
The GOP has fought many efforts to make voting easier. And they don’t want no-fault voting by mail to outlast the pandemic.
Will you contribute $17 to help us build an initiative that will prove them wrong?
Giving Hoosiers the option to vote by mail in the 2020 primary isn’t just a response to the pandemic. It’s a chance to show the GOP Indiana can be a no-fault vote by mail state.
Friend, nearly 300 Hoosiers have joined the movement to expand voting rights.
Will you chip in $8 to join them?

"-Holcomb Misses Again on Teacher Pay-
[[URL REDACTED]]
Teachers are not backing down in their fight for fair pay. They're are asking lawmakers to take $75 million from the state’s budget surplus and put it toward raising the base salary of all teachers this year.
Meanwhile, Governor Holcomb refuses to address the issue until 2021. But it doesn’t stop there. Holcomb claimed in an interview that “his gut” told him he had made a lot of progress with teacher pay.
Yep. Our do-nothing Governor somehow trusts his intuition over the 20,000 educators that rallied at the Statehouse and continue to fight for fair pay.
-Hoosiers Honor Mayor Hatcher-
[[URL REDACTED]]
Former Mayor of Gary, Richard Hatcher passed away on December 13th. Elected in 1967, he was one of the first African American mayors of a major U.S. city. He served as Mayor for 20 years, and in that time he not only embodied Democratic values, he helped define them. He fought for civil rights and moved our party, and our state, toward justice. We strive to honor his legacy every day. Thank you, Mayor Hatcher, for your service and your commitment to Hoosiers.
Mayor Hatcher’s visitation is scheduled for noon to 8 p.m. CST on Friday, December 20th at the downtown Gary convention center. His funeral will begin at 1 p.m. on Saturday at the convention center, with doors opening at noon.
-Rising Healthcare Costs Demonstrate GOP Legislative Failure-
Another study confirms Hoosiers are struggling with high health care costs. Over the last decade, insulin saw a near 300% increase, rising from under $100 to virtually $300. And the average cost of prescription drugs increased by almost 60% from 2012 to 2017.
This week, Republicans are one step closer to eliminating protections for Hoosiers with pre-existing conditions. More than 2.7 million Hoosiers live with a pre-existing condition. If Republicans are victorious, they’ll drag us back to a time when it was legal to charge more or deny coverage for Hoosiers living with pre-existing conditions.
-IN Senate Dems target redistricting, LGBTQ protections-
[[URL REDACTED]]
Senate Leader, Tim Lanane, once again filed a bill to add sexual orientation and gender identity to our state’s civil rights status. According to Lanane, “no Hoosier should be fired from a job or denied housing solely because of whom they love or whom they choose to marry.”
The Senator also filed a bill to establish an independent redistricting commission. The bill would stop the Republican’s corrupt practice of choosing their voters. It is an essential step in ensuring future elections are fair.
Thank you, Senator Lanane for fighting for Democratic values and pushing for justice!
-Councilor Miles Nelson Makes Historic Entrance into Carmel City Council-
[[URL REDACTED]]
On Wednesday, December 18th, Miles Nelson was sworn in as the first-ever Democratic City Councilor in Carmel. It’s one of a number of historic victories Democrats scored in November 2019 and proof the party is building the bench and expanding the battleground.

"-January 31, 2020-
-House Republicans vote against Hoosiers’ health-
Indiana House Republicans callously voted down a proposal to lower the costs of prescription drugs on Thursday.
Between 2012 and 2017, the average annual cost of prescription medication rose by almost 58%. In 2017, Hoosiers bore the highest health care costs burden of any of the surrounding states.
But these are more than just statistics. Across the state, Hoosiers have had to ration their prescription drugs. And in some cases, people have lost their lives because they couldn’t afford the medication they needed.
The GOP readily permits drug companies to turn big profits at the expense of Hoosiers’ health.
-Holcomb snubs teachers. Again-
For months, Holcomb told teachers he wouldn’t address teacher pay in 2020 because it was a non-budgetary year.
On Thursday, he signed off on spending $291 million in unexpected state tax revenue on several building projects. It looks like he’s happy to make budgetary decisions in 2020, just as long as they don’t help our educators.
To add insult to injury, Holcomb spoke at an event to boost for-profit/voucher schools. Yep. He was notably absent when 20,000 public school teachers rallied at the Statehouse in November, but he was vocally supportive of for-profit schools.
Once again, he’s shown us the only way we will pay teachers fairly is by voting him out.
-Republicans retaliate on local marijuana prosecution-
Last year, Marion County Prosecutor Ryan Mears decided not to prosecute simple marijuana possession.
This week, Republicans retaliated by voting for legislation that would allow the Attorney General to supersede your local elected prosecutor and to continue to criminalize small amounts of marijuana. And they did this even though more than 80% of Hoosiers favor reforming marijuana laws.
Sadly their political retaliation will disproportionately affect Hoosiers of color, as Black Hoosiers are 3.4X more likely to be arrested for possession.
-Maternal mortality: Democrats take action-
Last week, 100% of Senate Republicans voted against improving our maternal mortality rate, even though it is nearly 3x the national rate.
Representative Vanessa Summers is fighting back by establishing a maternal health caucus to raise awareness, collect data, and create legislation that would combat Indiana’s shameful maternal mortality rate. Hoosier mothers are nearly 10 times more likely to die giving birth than mothers in California.
Democrats are fighting for mothers and babies, even if the GOP refuses to act quickly.
-INDems train a record number of candidates-
Last weekend, we held our most successful candidate training yet. Not only did we train nearly 200 Democrats, but we also took the first step in building a diverse and representative bench for 2020 and beyond.
Training new and diverse candidates is part of a multi-year plan to expand the battleground and ensure that Democrats win up and down the ballot across our state.
-Petition deadline approaching-
In 2020, we have a real shot at winning the Governor’s office, and petitions are the key to getting your candidate on the ballot. All three candidates to be our nominee for Governor in the fall need to gather 4,500 petition signatures of registered voters to get on the ballot.
1. Contact the campaigns and get looped in on how to collect signatures
1. Dr. Woody Myers – contact: Aaron Schaler - [[URL REDACTED]]
2. Josh Owens – contact: Claire Griffith - [[URL REDACTED]]
2. Print the petitions and hit the pavement
It's going to take a grassroots effort to win big in 2020. That effort starts today, and it starts with you, friend.

"Former Mayor of Gary, Richard Hatcher passed away on December 13th. Elected in 1967, he was one of the first African American mayors of a major U.S. city. He served as Mayor for 20 years, and in that time he not only embodied Democratic values, he helped define them. He fought for civil rights and moved our party, and our state, toward justice. We strive to honor his legacy everyday. Thank you, Mayor Hatcher, for your service and your commitment to Hoosiers.
Mayor Hatcher’s visitation is scheduled for noon to 8 p.m. CST on Friday, December 20th at the downtown Gary convention center. His funeral will begin at 1 p.m. on Saturday at the convention center, with doors opening at noon.

"Election forecasters have spoken: a handful of votes will determine major Indiana races.
But unlike our opponents, we aren't just focused on raking in votes. We're dedicated to keeping Hoosiers safe in the process.
That's why the Vote by Mail Progam is an essential part of our winning strategy. Helping eligible Hoosiers vote by mail not only drives up turnout, it also lowers the health risk at the ballot box.
Make your first $7 donation to the 2020 Safe Voting Initiative to back vote by mail outreach.
The problem? During the primary, 61,000 Hoosiers that applied to vote by mail didn't vote at all. This tells us that they didn't have the tools to return their materials on time.
With the deadline to return vote-by-mail applications coming up on Thursday, we've only got a few days to make sure eligible Hoosiers are ready.
Team, I'll be honest. We need to raise $7,750 by Wednesday to get out our FINAL round of outreach. As you know, this is a 100%-grassroots-backed initiative. If we don't raise the funds to run ads, make calls, and send texts, we won't get this done.
61,000 is an election-determining number. Can we count on you to help to save these votes?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:

"-Holcomb Gives a Do-Nothing Agenda-
On Tuesday, Holcomb gave his 2020 agenda, but instead of a glimpse at the bright future ahead, it felt a lot more like a recap of his last three, ineffective years as governor. In true Holcomb fashion, the agenda was a stark depiction of his unwillingness to address the most salient issues Hoosiers face and a clear indication he intends to lay low ahead of his reelection.
Holcomb’s agenda featured a series of mistruths, exaggerations, and stolen credit.
-Holcomb Ignores Teacher’s Demands, Again-
While it once seemed like Holcomb wasn’t listening to teachers, his agenda made it clear that he simply doesn’t care. He has consistently made budgetary excuses for leaving teacher pay and school funding untouched, but on Tuesday, he announced that he would be cash-funding capital projects.
So while Indiana is hemorrhaging teachers and opportunities for students, Holcomb will be spending $300 million on other “projects,” with little concern for the generation of students he’s letting slip through the cracks. It’s tough to see how a $50 million ‘swine barn’ is more relevant than addressing the slowest-growing teacher salaries in the country.
Democrats like Senate Leader Tim Lanane and Senator JD Ford have criticized Holcomb’s inability to address education. Fortunately, they’ve already started moving on bills that will actually address teacher’s concerns.
-Hogsett takes action to assist Celadon employees-
Celadon Group Inc., an Indianapolis trucking company, went out of business after its COO and CFO were arrested in connection to a fraud scheme. This leaves 4,000 Hoosiers out of work right before the holidays. Indianapolis Mayor Hogsett immediately sprung into action, connecting former Celadon employees with resources such as unemployment insurance benefits and career services.
-Hoosiers Democrats Are Doing Big Things-
Marion County Prosecutor Ryan Mears, is launching The Good Faith Initiative to help parents struggling to pay child support gain back their licenses, a huge step in reducing the economic burden on low income parents.
Indiana State Representative and Chair of the Indiana Black Legislative Caucus, Rep. Robin Shackleford, received the National Black Caucus of State Legislator’s Legislator of the Year Award. She has championed Hoosiers throughout her time as a State Rep and we can’t think of a better person for the award. Congratulations, Representative Shackleford!

Ready to run for office in 2020 but unsure where to begin? The Indiana Democratic Party, in partnership with the National Democratic Training Committee, is hosting a candidate training on Jan. 25 in Indianapolis.

"Black Lives Matter
Indiana Green Party's Statement on George Floyd's Murder
And Ongoing Protests Across the Country
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
May 31, 2020
INDIANAPOLIS, IN - The Indiana Green Party is outraged by the murder of George Floyd. We all heard George Floyd say he could not breathe. We all heard the pleas from bystanders to halt the execution of George Floyd. We all watched George Floyd lose his life as a person who is supposed to protect him kneeled on his neck until he died. With sicking sadness and outrage at the brutal and mindless murder of yet another black American at the hands of the very people we pay to serve and protect the public, the Indiana Green Party condemns the ongoing police brutality and stands in solidarity with protesters across the country.
Anger and the frustration of not being heard or respected have sparked protests across this nation and even into our own state of Indiana. The feelings of despair have merit, and we note the recent murder of George Floyd is part of a larger, systemic problem stemming from the legacy of slavery and the ongoing devaluing of Black and Brown people and communities.
The Indiana Green Party believes that a deep and broad embrace of nonviolence is the only effective way to stop the cycles of violence. Only through solidarity can we breach what divides us and together forge a better future. Peace is only achievable through a willingness to resolve conflict in a civilized manner. We have every right to protest, and we should. But we should protest peacefully. Violence is not found on the path to peace. As Gandhi said, “Nonviolence is the greatest force at the disposal of mankind. It is mightier than the mightiest weapon of destruction devised by the ingenuity of humanity.”
We must break the cycle of violence and use alternative methods to achieve peace. We must remember that language is the purest weapon in the hand of freedom. We must use our voices and unite to bring forth change. To those who are protesting, do so with peace, empathy, and love. Since some of these protests have turned violent, those going should not bring their children. Go with friends and family, and don’t get separated. Beware of people inciting violence as well as undercover officers within the crowds.
Furthermore, the Indiana Green Party favors strong measures to combat racism in the form of police brutality directed against people of color. We support civilian review boards with subpoena power to investigate complaints relating to police behavior. We support the creation of public forums to air concerns on policy matters and to ensure public oversight and accountability of local police departments. And finally, we support the restriction of deadly restraining techniques like kneeling on the necks of Black and Brown individuals.

"Write-in Randy Paul as Monroe County Commissioner
Volunteers Needed!
Calling upon all who want to do something about
the sickly status quo & not just talk about it.
We need volunteers to go to Monroe County to watch the counting of votes on Election Day, November 3rd.
Indiana Green Party member, Randy Paul is running as a write-in candiate for Monroe County Commissioner. We are calling upon all individuals who are sick of the status quo and actually want to do something about it instead of just talk about the change that is needed. We need your help now!
The Green Party is allowed to have poll watchers so we can watch the counting of votes to ensure all write-in votes for Randy Paul are counted. If you are a doer and can help watch the polls and the vote count, reply to this email asap! Talkers need not apply.
Volunteering to watch the counting of votes is so important, and here is why: The Indiana Green Party has ran write-in candidates in the past, and believe it or not, many votes were not counted.
To be a paid poll worker in Indiana, you must be a democrat or a republican. This results in our political competition counting votes. It is so important for us to have eyes on the people counting the votes. We must hold the vote counters accountable for every single vote for Randy Paul. Ensure democracy exists by volunteering today.
Simply reply to this email if you are interested in volunteering.
