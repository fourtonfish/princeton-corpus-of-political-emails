"Republican Friends,
Due the COVID situation, this election cycle has been unusual to say the least. We've been receiving a lot of questions from voters who are concerned about the integrity of the election. How is absentee voting different from mail-in voting? Is my absentee ballot secure? Is my polling place safe?
That's why we've partnered with Secretary of State John Merrill to offer a virtual Town Hall on Election Integrity. This free event will take place on Wednesday, September 30th at 7:00 p.m. via Zoom, but you must RSVP at the link below in order to participate.
Secretary Merrill will go through a presentation about all his office is doing to ensure our election is safe and secure and then take questions.
I hope you'll be able to join us.
Best,
Reed Phillips
ALGOP Political Director
[[URL REDACTED]]
SIGN ME UP FOR THE VIRTUAL TOWN HALL WITH SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN MERRILL
Please note – Zoom link will be emailed out the day of the event

"Tickets on sale to General Public NOW!
The Alabama Republican Party is excited to announce the special guest speaker for our upcoming Winter Dinner. Sean Spicer will be joining the ALGOP on February 21, 2020 at the Montgomery Marriott Prattville Hotel & Conference Center.
Sean Spicer’s political career began long before the former White House Press Secretary made his mark as one of the most recognized staffers in the Trump administration. Sean built a decades-long career in Republican politics, witnessing and shaping the inner workings of Washington, DC, from every vantage point – as a House of Representatives communicator, heading up incumbent retention at the National Republican Senatorial Committee, in George W. Bush’s White House as Assistant U.S. Trade Representative, as the Chief Strategist and Director of Communications at the Republican National Committee, top advisor to presidential campaigns, and of course, White House Press Secretary. Sean made his way up through the ranks and has experience at every level in Washington. Few are as well-equipped as Sean to pull back the curtain and dissect what’s really happening in the nation’s capital.
This will be a sold out event. Tickets are now on sale to the general public and can be purchased by following the link below.

Dear Republican Friend:

Buy Your Ticket TODAY
This is an exciting time in the Republican Party. We are deeply honored that Chairwoman McDaniel is able to join us with so many other commitments that she has as we all move into election overdrive.
Chairwoman McDaniel was specifically chosen by President Trump to be the RNC Chair as she was instrumental in flipping Michigan, by 10,000 votes, for Donald Trump in 2016. She was an absolute rock star at the RNC Convention and has shattered fundraising records with the president.
Please purchase your ticket no later than Wednesday, September 2, to ensure your name is added to the guest list. The Email Invitation with Zoom call link will be sent out the day of the event.
Chairwoman McDaniel's willingness to help us fill in for our summer fundraiser is a testament to her passion and love of our Party. She is also excited about helping us flip the U.S. Senate seat by raising these funds.

"> Dear Alabama Republican,
> The Democrat-led U.S. House of Representatives is now on record impeaching our President. They can't stop him in elections so they have weaponized their power. Their total hate for President Trump is now on full display. They are doing everything they can to erase the historic election of Donald Trump in 2016.
> Alabamians voted and we overwhelmingly elected Donald Trump President of the United States three years ago, and we're going to do it again on November 3, 2020! !
> Stand with the Alabama Republican Party and show your support of President Trump! With your donation today of $15, we will send you a Donald Trump bumper sticker so that you can proudly let the Alabama know that you support OUR President!
> We must stand with president Trump and against the unfounded impeachment charades from the Democrats. It's outrageous!
> Thank you for your support. Every dollar counts towards our work to #KeepAmericaGreat and know that we are working today on our 2020 plans. We are motivated now more than ever!

"Did you hear what NY Rep. Jerry Nadler said a few days ago?
“Antifa violence is a myth!”
Has he not seen the destruction of a lot of our cities across the country!?
﻿
If they are a myth, how is it possible they endorsed Joe Biden for president in Seattle???
President Trump declared Antifa a terrorist organization and we the people  need to condemn them too.
We are looking for 1000 Alabama patriots to sign our “Condemn Antifa” petition by 9:00 PM EST tonight.
If we don’t display our commitment to law and order in our country and state, we can kiss our Republic goodbye!
Please take 1 minute to sign the petition. We have to show real strength here.

"Last night was huge.
The Vice Presidential debate is over. Mike Pence is one of America's finest Vice Presidents and was put up against an extreme liberal, Kamala Harris, who was called more liberal than Bernie Sanders by Newsweek.
We want to show Vice President Pence and the Trump team that the Alabama GOP is still running strong. They have been impressed with our performance as a state party as we earned the first state GOP to hit The President's Circle (hitting all of our 2020 election goals). Let's pour it on heading into November 3!
Will you donate just $5 or maybe more to show Alabama's support for the VP after his debate? Donate $5 now- we are working, working, working for you and Team GOP!
Every Republican running for office helps turn out voters for President Trump and Tommy Tuberville!
We have less than four weeks to go! I hope you're able to chip in at least $5. President Trump, Tommy Tuberville and your entire GOP team needs to know we are with them every step of the way \- the arena of public service needs them all.
Thank you for being part of this family to KAG,

"""Here's the story... of an angry lady..."" You know the theme song.
On Wednesday, Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats voted to transmit the articles of impeachment to the Senate after delaying for over a month.
The vote to transmit the articles came over a month after Democrats proclaimed their ""sense of urgency"" in the need to impeach the President, underscoring that this has been purely about politics from the beginning.
While Democrats continue to focus on their bogus impeachment FLIM FLAM SHAM, President Donald Trump is adding to his long list of accomplishments and delivering results for the American people. The signing of Wednesday's phase one trade agreement once again shows that the President's policies toward China are paying off in a big way. This is a historic deal with China and President Trump has now laid the ground work for more fair and equitable deals with China that will benefit Alabama's workers and job creators for decades to come.
Help support President Trump and the conservative leaders that are doing the good work of the people. The Shady Bunch needs to stop the games and allow President Trump to continue to Keep America Great!
Alabama is also watching Doug Jones- will he vote with the Shady Bunch or the majority of the will of Alabamians? Help us with our plans this year to end his tenure.

"Join ALGOP in the fight
It’s happening!
Our movement is strong - stronger than anything I’ve ever seen in recent politics. These next 75 days will be historic, but only if we have the resources to continue leading the BIGGEST and most POWERFUL movement in the Country.
While the radical left is ATTACKING President Trump during their ‘gloom, despair and agony on me’ Democrat Convention, the President needs you on his team to help FIGHT BACK. This November, voters will have a clear choice: continue our Great American Comeback or go down the Democrat’s road of radical left policies- have you heard their plans? Probably not- they won’t talk about them!
WE NEED YOUR HELP! Donate to the ALGOP today to help us fight for Alabama CONSERVATIVE values. We are budgeting right now to help our president and elect Tommy Tuberville to the US Senate.
Join ALGOP in the fight
Alabama, it's time.... you are needed.

"Senator Kamala Harris and Senator Doug Jones are two peas in a pod. Recently spending time in Alabama, Kamala Harris said she loves working with Senator Jones. ""We need his Alabama perspective,"" she said. ""Please send him back, Alabama.""
Have you seen this article on [[URL REDACTED]]
“[Jones] and I are always cuttin’ up and sending each other notes,"" Harris said. ""We were cuttin’ up in the impeachment hearings. Some of those words would not be spoken in church.”
Senator Jones is ""cuttin' up"" instead of representing the majority of Alabamians. This charade has got to stop.

"Can you believe it? After nearly 200 days of a partisan political charade, the impeachment hoax orchestrated by Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff has come to an end.
While Democrats have been focused on this ""let's get him!"" sham, President Trump has been delivering results for the American people. As we saw in the State of the Union address this week, President Trump is keeping us safe here at home, fighting for fairer trade agreements, combatting the opioid epidemic, securing our borders, providing massive tax breaks to working parents, implementing meaningful criminal justice reform, and much, much more- AMERICA FIRST!
Alabamians have been fed up with the impeachment sham from the day it started and have loudly urged Doug Jones to stop the madness and get back to work for the Yellowhammer State. You can support ALGOP today as we fight to #KAG and support our President! Our team is focused on November 3 today and we can't wait!

“Democrats know they can’t beat President Trump, which is why they had to impeach him. Nancy Pelosi, Adam Schiff, Chuck Schumer and Doug Jones tried to invalidate the results of the 2016 election, and they will be remembered for their reckless actions. President Trump’s campaign only got stronger as this impeachment sham went on and Alabamians will remember the partisan tactics of the do-nothing Democrats on Election Day.” -RNC Spokesperson Kevin Knoth

"President Trump and the RNC just announced a $20 million budget to fight the Democrats’ lawsuits as they try to remove all safeguards against voter fraud. From California, Nevada, South Carolina and Pennsylvania we are starting to see the stories and lawsuits we are having to file just to have an honest election. In Alabama, we have trained poll watchers in EVERY election in the challenging precincts on election [[URL REDACTED]] are there for 14 hours – 6am-8pm! They are monitoring the procedures, calling our headquarters for assistance if needed and just making sure everything is legit. They only speak up if needed.
With the presidential election and our U.S. Senate race on the line in November, we are focused on fair elections NOW.
Here’s what the Democrats, once again, are going after:
ALL MAIL-IN BALLOTS mandated by the federal government,
forget a state's rights!
NO signature matching for mail-in ballots
NO voter identification
NO ballot deadlines
We are joining the fight to protect the integrity of our 2020 elections. Have we stopped a lot of voting fraud in Alabama? YOU BET WE HAVE – but only because we have folks in the precincts and watching absentee ballots being opened in the courthouses.
Please make a contribution to our Election Security Fund to sponsor a Poll Watcher and their training. We will budget our watchers through your support.
Every dollar that comes into this fund goes directly towards statewide ballot security and training Poll Watchers for our at risk precincts, including training time, manuals and expenses related to their 14 hour day on November 3, 2020.
These 14 hour election day warriors are your eyes to watch for a simple request - one legal vote per each qualified voter.
YES, I'd like to do my part and help! I can sponsor training and poll watchers in Alabama by:
I'LL SPONSOR 1 TRAINING MANUAL $25
I'LL SPONSOR 2 TRAINING MANUALS $50
I'LL SPONSOR 3 TRAINING MANUALS $75
I'LL SPONSOR A TRAINING MANUAL AND HALF A DAY WATCHER $100
I'LL SPONSOR A TRAINING MANUAL AND A FULL DAY WATCHER $200

Democrats now even want to automatically mail ballots to “inactive voters” – including those who have moved or even PASSED AWAY.

"A Message from the Chairman
Republican Friend,
A lot has happened since the last issue of our newsletter. Under normal circumstances, I would be writing a column about the Republican primary and the run-off election (which has now been moved to July 14th).
However, the Coronavirus has dramatically changed our world in a short span of time.
We've learned a new term – ""social distancing"" – and how important it is to apply it to our daily lives. Curbside service is now a necessity and the norm. We're learning to ration what we have – and do without what we don't need – as grocery store shelves are emptied almost as quickly as workers are able to restock them.
Children now have to stay home from school and while parents find innovative ways to teach and entertain them as work to contain the virus continues. Old-school board games are being taken out and dusted off as families bring back the tradition of ""game night"" (remember those?). Another item from my childhood – sidewalk chalk – has also made a comeback. One of our ALGOP staffers snapped these pictures (below). They put a smile on my face, and I hope they will put one on yours as well. It amazes me how perceptive and resilient our children are during these uncertain times.
Sidewalk chalk ""artists"" sharing inspirational messages
As we continue through this uncharted territory, the Alabama Republican Party will be here to answer your questions or assist you in any way we are able. All ALGOP staffers are taking the proper precautions and following the guidelines laid out by Governor Ivey's administration and the President's COVID-19 taskforce to help reduce transmission of the virus to others.
As ongoing testing and diagnoses continue we lift up so many – doctors, nurses, health care workers, first responders, truckers, the military, the travel industry, supermarket employees, restaurant workers and others who remain on the job so we can purchase food and supplies – in prayer.
Wishing you, your family and loved ones continued health as our elected officials and the public health experts navigate our great state and nation through this crisis. Please be in focused prayers for those making important decisions. We are confident America will come through better and stronger than ever.
There's just something about America,
Mrs. Terry Lathan
Chairman, Alabama Republican Party
“For those worried and afraid, please know: As long as I am your president, you can feel confident that you have a leader who will always fight for you, and I will not stop until we win. This will be a great victory,” he said Sunday, adding, “This is going to be a victory. And it's going to be a victory that, in my opinion, will happen much sooner than originally expected.”
– President Donald J. Trump

Congressman Mo Brooks is working to encourage the Department of Defense to enact a department-wide telework policy for all contractors regardless of a contract’s teleworking provisions while America confronts COVID-19.
Congressman Gary Palmer teamed up with Dr. Scott Harris of the Alabama Department of Public Health to host a telephone town hall to answer questions about the Coronavirus disease, social distancing and flattening the curve.
The Legislature – under the leadership of Senate Pro Tem Del Marsh and House Speaker Mac McCutcheon – passed a bill appropriating $5 million to combat Coronavirus. The measure was signed into law by Governor Ivey.

TAKE THE CENSUS BY CLICKING HERE
You do NOT need a digital code or
to wait until you hear from the Census department.
It's time to be counted. The 2020 Census is underway and it's crucial to our state for every one of us to take part. Please follow the directions on the Census form you were mailed and complete it as soon as possible. You don't need to leave home to do it. The Census can be done on-line.
Some census facts:
* The census was established by our Founding Fathers in Article 1, Section 2 of the Constitution. It is sent to every household in the U.S. every 10 years.
* Up to $13 billion in federal funding for Alabama is at stake. This is money used to improve our state's future: schools, roads, job opportunities, etc. We need an accurate census count to ensure these programs are able to continue.
* The census will also determine the number of congressional seats Alabama has. Unlike U.S. Senate seats – which always remain at two per state – congressional districts are reconfigured every 10 years based upon population growth and loss in each state. We need to make sure Alabama continues to have sufficient representation in Washington.
* This in turn will impact the number of electors we send to the Electoral College starting with the 2024 Presidential election. The number of electors in each state is equal to the size of its congressional delegation (U.S. Senators plus U.S. Representatives).
* The census contains only 10 simple questions and takes just 6 minutes of your time to complete.
For more information about the census, you can visit the official state website by clicking here .
ALGOP EVENTS
PLEASE NOTE: The ALGOP has asked all Republican county parties and affiliated Republican organizations to suspend all meetings, fundraisers and activities until at least April 6th due to the COVID-19 epidemic. After April 6th, we will reassess the situation.
ALGOP 2020 Winter Dinner
Sean Spicer – the keynote speaker for the 2020 ALGOP Winter Dinner on February 21st – was well received by the sold-out crowd in Prattville.
He also took questions from the audience after his remarks and many guests received his autographed book “The Briefing”.
Sean loves being with Republicans and shares our enthusiasm and focus on the 2020 races across our nation. He emphasized no matter who our voters will choose as our Senate nominee we must rally together to elect that candidate. President Trump needs that vote in the Senate. Our nominee will be a solid conservative. If our voters turnout, we will win!
He was very encouraged about the possibility of taking over the U.S. House of Representatives as well.
The ALGOP presented Sean with a quilt from the Quilts of Valor organization for his service in the U.S. Navy as a commander in the reserves.
We also honored U.S. Representative Martha Roby in her home district as this is her final year in Congress. A tribute video was shown and she was given an original charcoal drawn artwork by Barbara Davis as a thank you from our Party.
﻿Martha has been a great friend to the ALGOP and we are grateful for her service. The Young Republican Federation of Alabama and the ALGOP sponsored an after party for Martha as well.
Our sponsors and guests made this event very memorable. We are appreciative of this support which will help our Party in the 2020 elections.
ALGOP 2020 Winter Meeting
The ALGOP Winter Meeting took place on Saturday, February 22nd in Prattville.

ALGOP Chairman Issues Statement on
Senator Jones's MSNBC Appearance
Alabama Republican Party Chairman Terry Lathan issued the following statement in response to Senator Jones's appearance on MSNBC:
""During these unprecedented threatening times in our state and nation, Senator Doug Jones chose to go on MSNBC to attack Republicans for introducing a bill that would help small business owners who are negatively impacted by the Coronavirus epidemic – some who will permanently lose their entire livelihood for their families. He called the Senate bill 'a political stunt'.
""Senator Jones, this is not a 'political stunt'. This 'thing' – as you called it – is relief for our people who are suffering from the negative economic impact this crisis is having on our state and nation. They need it fast and they need it now.
""It's time for Senator Jones to join in President Trump's 'Whole of America' response to the pandemic – with everyone working together – instead of being Chuck Schumer's partisan knee jerk messenger on liberal MSNBC.
“His use of time on MSNBC instead of working on this problem is the perfect example of a 'political stunt'.”

"VISION 2020
A Message from the Chairman
The Waffle House – there’s just something about those yellow signs. Their comfort food 24/7 with their staff who are pros at dispensing southern charm to customers sweeter than the sticky syrup bottles on your table draw us in their doors. You know the lingo: scattered, smothered, covered, chunked and over easy! However, for me, it’s the ordering process that holds my attention.
How in the world does the staff yell out orders, the cooks hear it all while then delivering exactly what you ordered so quickly? What kind of super powers do they hold?
I had no idea, until recently, that there is a system other than yelling out orders to people who have echoic memories. The company uses “visual cues” with their condiments and utensils arranged on a plate to signal the cook what the order is. According to Southern Magazine, “A jelly packet at the bottom of the plate signifies scrambled eggs. Raisin toast is signified by a packet of apple butter. A mustard packet facing up means a pork chop. Even a pat of butter is used as intel for kitchen staff: It represents a T-bone, and its placement on the plate tells the cook how well-done the customer wants their steak.”
The Waffle House ""Cheat Sheet""
That makes a lot of sense, doesn’t it? Through all of the noise, hustle and bustle behind the counters of what seems like organized chaos, the signals are firm and clear.
America has also been very loud since 2016. Donald Trump won in an electoral landslide which has caused a three year long hissy fit by the Democrats. Their fury is signaling a surreal time in our nation – anger has swept them away from putting America first so they can destroy our president at any costs. It’s shameful.
On the flip side, Americans are signaling back to liberals, the squads and the mobs fueled by anger. We are living in the best economic times of our nation smashing all records. Salaries and wages are up, consumer confidence is high, the stock market is soaring, the border wall is being built, conservative judicial appointees are being seated at a record pace, other countries are now pulling their financial weight on the world stage, our military is being strengthened, ISIS has been decimated- all in just over three years.
The “deplorables”, the “dregs of society” and the “despicables”, as Trump supporters have been called by the 'left', signal right back – we are focused, determined and will continue to make America great. We will not back down from their noise or anger.
On November 3, we plan to re-elect our president and beat Doug Jones. The signals Alabama will send will be loud and clear that will need no cues- we expect conservative policy and support for our state and nation.
The Waffle House cues are an amazing feat of success in their business plan- so are America’s signals in what is best for our nation. If we keep ordering conservative principles through our election process, our nation will continue to prosper. So, get ready to smother, scatter and cover all of the liberal noise and actions with our votes by ordering up another four year term of KAG and ending Doug Jones’ tiny tenure for Alabama.
Though I’m a bit disappointed that the cooks don’t have super powers working their magic, we know that America can unleash our strength at the ballot box. That’s an order we all look forward to in 2020.

Thank-You to Alabama's Republican Members of the U.S. House of Representatives
While the U.S. House Democrats ran a one sided impeachment sham, we'd like to thank all of Alabama's Republican members of the U.S. House of Representatives for staying strong throughout this entire process and voting NO. From the stand-off in the SCIF to the Judiciary Committee proceedings, our ALGOP U.S. Representatives did the right thing looking at a shallow and weak case for impeaching President Trump.
President Trump Qualifies for Re-Election
Governor Kay Ivey and members of #TeamTrump had the honor of qualifying President Donald Trump for re-election in the state of Alabama for the GOP primary ballot.
Governor Ivey handed in the required signatures to gain ballot access to ALGOP Chairman Terry Lathan.

Clockwise: Governor Ivey turns in President Trump's signature sheets to Chairman Lathan • Governor Ivey also held a news conference in support of President Trump • Special guests attending: (L to R) – Alabama State Representative Tim Wadsworth, Alabama State Treasurer John McMillian, Governor Ivey, Chairman Lathan, RNC Secretary and Alabama National Committeewoman Vickie Drummond, Alabama Public Service Commissioner Jeremy Oden, Alabama Committeeman Paul Reynolds, and Shelby County GOP Chairman Joan Reynolds.
President Trump Visits Alabama
The annual Alabama-LSU rivalry game was a lot more exciting with news that President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump would be among those attending the game at Bryant-Denny Stadium in Tuscaloosa on November 9, 2019.
The President and First Lady were greeted with loud cheers and a standing ovation by attendees. Alabama truly let them know this is Trump Country.
The Trumps were joined in their box by members of both states' Congressional delegations.
ALGOP Headquarters Named in Honor of
﻿Former Chairman Bill Armistead
The ALGOP kicked off the Christmas season by celebrating with an Open House Christmas Reception along with a ceremony honoring former Chairman Bill Armistead (2011-2015).
During his tenure, Chairman Armistead raised the funds to purchase the building where the ALGOP currently is located in Hoover. To thank him, the state Executive Committee voted to officially name it ""The Bill Armistead Building"".
﻿
Over 100 people turned out for the building dedication and Christmas Open House festivities including members of Chairman Armistead's family, elected officials, Party members and candidates.
Clockwise starting at top left: The big ""reveal"" • Family, friends and elected officials turned out for the ceremony • Current ALGOP Chairman Terry Lathan (right), former ALGOP Chairman Bill Armistead (center) and the man who has served as both of their Chief of Staff, Harold Sachs • The Armistead Family - Ashley Armistead, Beau Armistead, Chairman Armistead, John Allred, Bentley King, Judah Armistead, Zoe Armistead, Lindsey Allred • Chairman Lathan presenting Chairman Armistead with the gavel they have both used to preside over the ALGOP • Chairman Armistead speaking to those assembled.

ALGOP Chairman Terry Lathan to
﻿Senator Doug Jones – Do Your Job
ALGOP Chairman Terry Lathan had some strong words for Senator Doug Jones.
At a news conference on September 30th in front of ALGOP Headquarters in Hoover, Chairman Lathan called out Senator Jones for his refusal to support President Trump's nominee for the U.S. Supreme Court, Amy Coney Barrett.
""Senator Jones needs to do his job – meet with her, listen to her and then decide on Judge Barrett’s credentials. If he can find time to have campaign drive-in events, he can find time to do one of the most important jobs a U.S. Senator is tasked to do – the seating of a Supreme Court Justice,"" Chairman Lathan said.
The Chairman also reminded him his constituents – who overwhelmingly support President Trump – live in Alabama, not California and New York.
""Look, we understand he’s in a jam – with over 80% of his funding from out of state, mostly New York and California, he has to cash out with them. He’d fit in nicely in those lands of radical liberalism especially since he only votes with President Trump 35% of the time while representing the highest approval rated state for Donald Trump in the nation,"" she said, ""However, in Alabama his tone deafness to the seating of Judge Barrett will not stand.""
The news conference was attended by scores of supporters – including State Senator Jabo Waggoner and State Representative David Wheeler – and widely covered by the media.
ALGOP Congratulates the Winners
﻿of the July 14th Primary Run-Off Election
﻿ALGOP at the 2020
Republican National Convention
While the COVID-19 pandemic altered plans for holding a traditional convention, it didn't dampen the spirits of Alabama's delegation to the 2020 Republican National Convention.
Six members of the ALGOP traveled to Charlotte to take part in this year's official nominating event on August 23rd and 24th – ALGOP Chairman Terry Lathan, Delegation Chairman Andrew Sorrell, ALGOP National Committeewoman and RNC Secretary Vicki Drummond, ALGOP National Committeeman Paul Reynolds, Credentials Committee member Judge Linda Coats and Credential Committee member Greg Cook.
As RNC Secretary, Vicki Drummond was responsible for calling the Roll of the States, when each state announces how it is casting its ballots. Delegation Chairman Andrew Sorrell had that honor for the great state of Alabama, casting all 50 votes for President Trump and Vice President Pence.
The President and Vice President made a surprise visit to Charlotte and the delegates had the opportunity to hear from our nominees, who thanked them for their service to the Republican Party.

An Evening with Ronna
The Alabama Republican Party normally hosts two fundraising dinners a year. These dinners typically account for 30% of our annual budget – and COVID-19 hit us hard, like so many, forcing us to cancel our summer fundraiser. In an effort to recoup some of these fundraising deficits, RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel joined us for our first ever Virtual Fundraiser on September 3rd. Many of our faithful sponsors were able to join us to make this event happen, and it was a huge success. We are thankful for Chairwoman McDaniel and her staff for their partnership.

Coming Soon: Dr. Big Brother
By Brian Christine, MD, Jefferson County
In the United States, health-care accounts for 18% of the economy. It’s not cheap, and it’s not free; nothing of value ever is. Health-care offered in the U.S. is outstanding, with many fields of medicine being the finest in the world. The access to technological advances and diagnostic testing enjoyed by Americans saves lives. I know. I am a surgeon practicing in Alabama, and while our system is not perfect it is very, very good. It does not need to be radically dismembered, zipped in a bag, and dumped in the morgue. Read more here.
We're #1!
The Alabama Republican Party was the first state organization in the nation to make it to the RNC's coveted President's Circle as part of the Growing Republican Organizations to Win (GROW) program. Thanks to our hard working staff for putting together the strategic plan that earned ALGOP this distinction.

TAKE THE CENSUS BY CLICKING HERE
You do NOT need a digital code or
to wait until you hear from the Census department.
The 2020 Census is wrapping up and it's crucial to our state for every one of us to take part. Please follow the directions on the Census form you were mailed and complete it as soon as possible. You don't need to leave home to do it. The Census can be done on-line. You only have until October 31st to complete yours!
Some census facts:
* The census was established by our Founding Fathers in Article 1, Section 2 of the Constitution. It is sent to every household in the U.S. every 10 years.
* Up to $13 billion in federal funding for Alabama is at stake. This is money used to improve our state's future: schools, roads, job opportunities, etc. We need an accurate census count to ensure these programs are able to continue.
* The census will also determine the number of congressional seats Alabama has. Unlike U.S. Senate seats – which always remain at two per state – congressional districts are reconfigured every 10 years based upon population growth and loss in each state. We need to make sure Alabama continues to have sufficient representation in Washington.
* This in turn will impact the number of electors we send to the Electoral College starting with the 2024 Presidential election. The number of electors in each state is equal to the size of its congressional delegation (U.S. Senators plus U.S. Representatives).
* The census contains only 10 simple questions and takes just 6 minutes of your time to complete.
For more information about the census, you can visit the official state website by clicking here .

How the GOP put Alabama in such great fiscal shape
By Mary Sell, Alabama Daily News
Alabama’s gross tax revenue was up 5.3% at the end of August with one month remaining in the pandemic-affected fiscal year.
And though some of the dozens of tax revenue streams that flow into the state’s General Fund and education budgets withered when the coronavirus came to Alabama, overall, both funds’ revenues are up in 2020 compared to 2019.
Moreover, both budgets will end the fiscal year this week able to tuck money away into reserve accounts. And planned spending for fiscal 2021, which begins Thursday, is not only more than 2020’s allocations but the most ever, though not what state leaders envisioned when they started crafting the 2021 budgets earlier this year.
Looking at many other states more than six months into a global health crisis, Alabama’s budget situation is desirable, several state leaders told Alabama Daily News recently. Read more here.

ALGOP Chairman Terry Lathan Statement on
Judiciary Committee Impeachment Vote
Alabama Republican Party Chairman Terry Lathan released the following statement following the House Judiciary Committee vote on articles of impeachment against President Trump:
""While the outcome of today's vote comes as absolutely no surprise, it does not negate the malfeasance by the Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee. This entire process has been nothing more than an attempt to undo the outcome of the 2016 election voted on by the American people. The Democrats have moved forward without allowing Republicans to present witnesses and facts. Alabamians see through this partisan sham for what it is.
""We are grateful to Alabama's US Representative Martha Roby (2nd CD) who is on the Judicial Committee as she spoke the truth during this process and voted NO today.""

ALGOP Chairman Terry Lathan Statement on
House Impeachment Vote
Alabama Republican Party Chairman Terry Lathan released the following statement following today's vote by the Democrat-led U.S. House of Representatives to impeach President Trump:
""The actions taken by the Democrats voting to impeach President Trump are unconscionable. They couldn’t beat him in an election, so they have weaponized this rarely used tool to try and harm our president. The entire process was a one sided hit job. The transcript in question doesn’t say or prove their charges – it exonerates President Trump!
""The American people are saying loudly this is not what we need or want for our nation – especially when the charges are false. Their bar of impeachment has been lowered to a despicable level of dirty politics.
""The Democrats’ hatred has blinded them. They will pay dearly in the 2020 elections. America deserves better than their cheap abusive use of power. The 'swamp' is deeper than we could have imagined. We will not stop trying to drain it as we fight to take back our country.
""Thank you to our Alabama Republican members of the U.S. House of Representatives – Rep. Bradley Byrne, Rep. Martha Roby, Rep. Mike Rogers, Rep. Robert Aderholt, Rep. Mo Brooks and Rep. Gary Palmer – not only for voting NO, but also for speaking out throughout the entire sham process that led up to today. They truly represented the will of Alabama's electorate with their actions.""

5th Judicial Circuit District Attorney Switches to the Republican Party
5th Judicial Circuit District Attorney Jeremy Duerr switched from the Democrat to Republican Party at the Tallapoosa County Republican Party quarterly meeting in Alexander City.
""District Attorney Duerr contacted me several months ago expressing his interest to become a member of the Republican Party citing several changes in the values of the Democrat Party which did not align with his conservative Christian values,"" said Tallapoosa GOP Chairman Terry Martin. ""He gave a moving speech to the Executive Committee as he shared his views stating that the attacks from the Democrat Party regarding the defunding of police were in direct conflict with him being the top law enforcement official in the Fifth Judicial Circuit. Following a brief discussion, DA Duerr was voted into the party by the Tallapoosa County Republican Party per the ALGOP governing bylaws.”
Alabama Republican Party Chairman Terry Lathan welcomed DA Duerr into the Alabama Republican Party:
""We are honored to have DA Duerr as our newest member of the Grand Old Party. There’s a reason 66% of partisan elected offices in Alabama are held by Republicans. The Democrat party leaders and platform are too far out of the mainstream for Alabamians,” said Chairman Lathan. “He now joins 69% of the District Attorneys in Alabama as a Republican. We look forward to working with Mr. Duerr.”
Alabama’s 5th Judicial Circuit is comprised of Tallapoosa, Chambers, Macon and Randolph Counties.

ALGOP Chairman Praises Confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett to SCOTUS, Blasts Senator Jones for NO Vote
Alabama Republican Party Chairman Terry Lathan issued the following statement following the confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court of the United States:
""Once again, the U.S. Senate has confirmed one of President Donald Trump's eminently qualified nominees to the United States Supreme Court. Amy Coney Barrett is an excellent addition to the high court. A jurist out of the originalist model, Justice Barrett will decide each case on its merits by overlaying it with the Constitution and not legislating from the bench.
""We offer our thanks to Senator Richard Shelby who consistently listens to the majority of his constituents. Senator Shelby wisely considered Justice Barrett's sterling credentials and voted 'yes' on her confirmation.
""In stark contrast, Senator Doug Jones continued to thumb his nose at our state’s majority with his 'no' vote. He has once again put the interests of his left wing groups first while ignoring those he is supposed to represent. The 'third senator from California' has repeatedly failed to remember the majority of our state. Alabama will relieve him of his duties on November 3rd when Tommy Tuberville is elected as Alabama's new U. S. Senator. Doug Jones will be a paragraph in a history book as future political pundits study how to be a failure in the arena of public service – ignoring the majority ends your tenure.""

"Republican Friend,
Last 4th of July, I had the privilege of watching President Trump's 'Salute to America' fireworks and flyover spectacular from the banks of the Potomac with my family. It is one of those memories that is priceless. What better way to share in our love of America?
Prior to the event, so many in the media ridiculed the notion the President could pull it off. However, even the #FakeNews Washington Post had to admit in its headline ""It was one heck of a fireworks show. And the flyovers were cool, too.""
Of course, that praise was short lived.
Every day the President is the target of a constant barrage of media attacks – and he needs your help this election year to FIGHT BACK.
>>>SIGN UP NOW to be a Trump Team Leader!<<<
As a Trump Team Leader, you will be one of the most important assets President Trump and the Republicans have this election cycle. Be part of the battle against #FakeNews and the Democrat smear machine. As a volunteer, you will be critical in these efforts.
CLICK HERE AND SIGN UP NOW TO BE A TRUMP TEAM LEADER!
This Fourth of July holiday, I hope you will consider stepping up to support our President. He needs people like you who are willing to become Trump Team Leaders to help him Keep America Great!

ALGOP Chairman Terry Lathan Issues Statement on
Cancellation of Republican National Convention
Alabama Republican Party Chairman Terry Lathan issued the following statement on the cancellation of the Republican National Convention in Jacksonville, FL:
""We understand and support President Trump's decision to cancel our Party's convention celebration in Jacksonville due to the safety concerns the virus situation has created. As always, health and safety are a priority for our president and Party.
""While the event may have been cancelled, this in no way slows down our enthusiasm, or plans, for re-electing President Trump, Vice President Pence and electing Tommy Tuberville as our new U.S. Senator.
""We are deeply grateful to our delegation for their flexibility and patience these last several months. Their passion to serve and represent our Party is to be commended. I look forward to working with them in the coming months to Keep America Great and bring home a big win for President Trump, Tommy Tuberville and our Alabama candidates.
""On a personal note, I want to thank our ALGOP staff for their amazing around the clock work on all of our details as we planned for the convention celebration. Our special events director, Shannon Whitt, gallantly led our team. I also appreciate the partnership of ALGOP RNC Members Vicki Drummond and Paul Reynolds along with Delegation Chairman Andrew Sorrell.
""We will now use this time in Alabama to refocus all of our energies on November 3rd when we will re-claim the U.S. Senate seat and vote to return President Trump to the White House.""

ALGOP Chairman Terry Lathan Issues Statement on SCOTUS Nominee
Alabama Republican Party Chairman Terry Lathan issued the following statement on the announcement of President Trump's nominee, Amy Coney Barrett, for the United States Supreme Court:
""President Trump has nominated a superior candidate for our nation's highest court. Judge Amy Coney Barrett is a solid constitutional jurist who has distinguished herself both on the bench during her time on the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals, in academia as a law professor at the University Notre Dame and as a clerk for the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
""Judge Barrett's focus on following the Constitution is apparent in her opinions, in cases ranging from the 2nd Amendment to immigration. Even three Democrat Senators – Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Tim Kaine of Virginia and Joe Donnelly crossed party lines in 2017 to support her first nomination to the bench.
""A mother of seven, including two adopted children from Haiti, Supreme Court nominee Barrett has been called a 'powerhouse' constitutionalist. Her consistent rulings on applying laws to the words of our U.S. Constitution is the exact example of what the justices are tasked with in implementing their rulings.
""Based on qualifications and experience alone, Judge Barrett's nomination merits a vote by the full United States Senate.""

ALGOP Chairman Terry Lathan Statement on
Doug Jones Democrat National Convention Speech
ALGOP Chairman Terry Lathan issued the following statement following Senator Doug Jones’s remarks during the virtual Democrat National Convention:
""Senator Doug Jones embraced the ‘left of left’ at the DNC Convention by joining Bernie Sanders to endorse Joe Biden. The message from Michelle Obama was one of despair. Senator Jones lined up with his teammates who demand tax hikes, Medicare for All, ending private healthcare, taxpayers paying for abortions and illegal immigrants, defunding the police, ending border wall security and a focus on locking down gun ownership – although they purposely didn’t mention their beliefs to the nation.
""Alabama is a deep red state where the vast majority of our voters uphold traditional, conservative values. By agreeing to participate in this 'Liberals on Parade' event, Senator Jones has clearly signaled who he aligns his core values with as he also repeatedly thumbs his nose at the majority of Alabamians who reject this radical platform and policies.
“Doug Jones said, ‘It’s not about what side of the aisle we are on. It’s about whether or not we are on the side of the people.’ Yet, he walks down the aisle of ignoring the majority over and over again. Alabama is tired of being ignored by Doug Jones. Our state is anxious to vote for a true conservative who will not ignore their voices anymore. Along with President Trump and Tommy Tuberville, we will reset this seat for Alabama on November 3rd.""

ALGOP Chairman Terry Lathan Issues Statement
on Doug Jones/SCOTUS Announcement
Alabama Republican Party Chairman Terry Lathan issued the following statement concerning Senator Doug Jones's announcement on President Trump's nominee to the United States Supreme Court:
""It's disgraceful that Senator Jones is dismissing his duties when he announced he would not support the confirmation of any Supreme Court justice nominee put forth by President Trump prior to the November election.
""The Constitution of our country clearly states that the President 'shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall [[URL REDACTED]] of the Supreme Court...'
""At the very least, Senator Jones owes Alabamians the simple courtesy of meeting with the nominee regardless of what he already plans to do. It's time for him to do his job, at least until November 3rd.
""The people of our great state have spoken. The majority support President Trump and his policies which includes the conservative judges he has nominated for the federal bench. However, Doug Jones continues to ignore the wishes of the majority of his constituents and falls in line with his liberal party bosses, Hollywood supporters and New York fundraisers.
""On Election Day, Alabamians will give their advice and consent to remove Doug Jones from office. Tommy Tuberville will represent the majority’s values when he is elected as our next U.S. Senator.""

ALGOP Chairman Terry Lathan Statement Following
the U.S. Senate Vote to Acquit President Trump
Alabama Republican Party Chairman Terry Lathan released the following statement following today's vote by the U.S. Senate to acquit President Donald Trump:
""Today's vote by the U.S. Senate to acquit President Trump confirms what the majority of Alabamians have known all along – that this impeachment sham perpetrated by the Democrats was nothing more than a hyperpartisan mission for the sole purpose of undoing the 2016 election. The majority of our United States Senators saw this charade for exactly what it was and voted accordingly.
""I would like to extend our gratitude to Alabama's Republican U.S. Senator, Richard Shelby. His vote to acquit shows he is not only a man of his convictions but also respects the will of the majority of his constituents.""

ALGOP U.S. House CD-2 Primary Runoff Remarks from Chairman Lathan
Alabama Republican Party Chairman Terry Lathan issued the following statement regarding today's ALGOP Primary Runoff for the U.S. House in District 2:
""The voters of Congressional District 2 had outstanding candidates for their open House seat. I am confident their choice for nominee – Barry Moore – will go to Washington and do an exceptional job representing his district.
""Barry Moore has a proven conservative track record in the Alabama House of Representatives, one he will take to Washington and use to pass the Trump agenda. His love for the Second Congressional District, combined with his pattern of hard work, will be a great asset in Washington for our state.
""We are grateful for businessman Jeff Coleman who wanted to serve in this district. Jeff's willingness to join in this public servant position is greatly appreciated by many. His desire to help Alabama is highly commendable.
""We would be remiss in not thanking U.S. Representative Martha Roby for her strong service from the Second Congressional District of Alabama. Martha's love for the military and veterans showed in her strong focus on their needs. She has earned a great place in Alabama history placing our patriotic heroes first. We salute Representative Roby for her role in putting America First.""

ALGOP Chairman Terry Lathan Statement at the Conclusion
﻿of the Republican National Convention
Alabama Republican Party Chairman Terry Lathan issued the following statement at the conclusion of the Republican National Convention:
""Now that President Trump has officially accepted the Republican nomination for president and the convention has come to a close, we are ready to work even harder to secure his policies for our great state and nation.
""The choice is clear this November – President Trump will fight for this country and continue our Great American Comeback, while long-time bureaucrat Joe Biden continues to camp out in his basement, won't do press conferences or meet with Americans. The Democrats are out-of-touch and want to take us in the wrong direction – and they openly have declared it! Their radical left policies will destroy our freedoms and Alabama voters are not going to allow this to happen.
""In less than 70 days we will re-elect President Trump and elect our U.S. Senate nominee, Tommy Tuberville. Alabama, the highest rated approval state for Donald Trump, is ready to KAG. The contrast of what is stake is easy for all to see. We can’t wait to send President Trump a U.S. Senator who will finally listen to the majority of Alabamians – Coach Tommy Tuberville – because the best is yet to come.”

ALGOP Chairman Terry Lathan Statement on
Joe Biden VP Announcement
ALGOP Chairman Terry Lathan issued the following statement on Joe Biden's choice of Kamala Harris as his running mate in the 2020 presidential election:
""Joe Biden’s VP pick drags the Democrats’ ticket even further to the left. Kamala Harris was the first proud co-sponsor Bernie’s Medicare for All government healthcare takeover. She’s applauded efforts to defund the police and even led the charge to block meaningful police reform in the Senate. She even wants to use the federal government to ban plastic straws and to control what we eat – a move that would devastate the U.S. dairy and beef industries – all in the name of 'climate change'.
""We look forward to the clear contrast in policies in the Vice Presidential debate with Mike Pence and Senator Harris. It will be a true mirror of the obtuse plans the Democrats want for our nation.
""This ticket does not represent the values of the American people. They will see through all bogus attempts by the Democrats who will pretend to move to the center. They will fail, as their policies have, and America will vote to re-elect President Trump on November 3rd.""

"Hillary Clinton … Barack Obama … John Kerry … Al Gore … Bill Clinton … Mike Dukakis … Walter Mondale.
This rogue gallery of liberal Democrats was rejected by Alabamians by large margins when each of them sought the presidency, but interim U.S. Senator Doug Jones proudly voted for each of them when they appeared on the ballot. His support and his personal votes tell us exactly the principles he champions.
Jones accepted a presidential appointment from Bill Clinton during his scandal-ridden administration, welcomed the endorsement of Barack Obama while running for the Senate, and loudly proclaims his current support for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, perhaps the most liberal pairing to ever appear on a major party ticket. In fact, during President Trump’s impeachment trial in the Senate, Kamala Harris was quoted as saying she and Jones were “cuttin’ up” with each other, showing a deep disrespect for the seriousness of the situation.
Those simple facts alone offer positive proof that Jones sits on the far-left fringe of the political prism and remains outside the mainstream of the citizens he claims to represent, but allow me to offer even more evidence.
When Obama was elected president in 2008, he earned only 38% of the vote in Alabama, yet Jones told the Associated Press, “We need to be dancing in the streets rejoicing about his election.” Following Jones’s victory dance, Obama delivered us a stagnant economy, millions more Americans on food stamps, open-border immigration policies, the disaster known as Obamacare, and other liberal policies.
After 60% of voters ratified a 2018 state constitutional amendment that declares Alabama a pro-life state and positions us to take immediate action when Roe v. Wade is overturned, Jones, once again, ignored the majority’s vote. He opposed a federal ban on partial-birth abortions and voted to use our dollars to fund abortion procedures.
Even though the Alabama Legislature passed the nation’s strongest state law to combat illegal immigration, Jones has compared Donald Trump’s border wall to the Berlin Wall, opposed the president’s effort to declare a national emergency along the Mexico border, and voted in favor of sanctuary cities that refuse to enforce federal immigration laws – he is complicit in wanting to break the laws of our nation.
Despite Alabama’s strong pro-Second Amendment tradition, Jones told [[URL REDACTED]] in 2018 that “Alabamians are ready for restrictions on guns,” and used his maiden speech in the U.S. Senate to attack the National Rifle Association and demand universal background checks. His guy, Joe Biden, told Beto O’Rourke, “You’re going to take care of the gun problem with me.” Believe them on this.
Though similar efforts swiftly died in the Alabama Legislature, Jones told a tele-townhall in July that he supports a federal government study on paying economic reparations for slavery and called it something “we’ve got to do.”
And while Donald Trump carried Alabama with more than 60% of the vote in 2016, Jones has repeatedly attacked the president by telling Newsweek he has given some “a green light to commit hate crimes” and accused him of using “outright bigotry justified as straight talk.”
Of course, he also famously voted twice to remove President Trump from office following the impeachment sham created by Nancy Pelosi and Jones’s other liberal allies. It appears without a doubt that Jones has made it his mission on the Senate floor to support everything that Alabamians oppose and oppose everything that Alabamians support – again ignoring the majority. All of these examples, and hundreds more like them, explain why President Trump recently tweeted, “Doug Jones is a terrible Senator who is just a Super Liberal puppet for Schumer and Pelosi. Represents Alabama poorly.”
The good news is that Alabama voters can soon recall their interim senator by supporting Republican coach Tommy Tuberville in his bid for the U.S. Senate. Coach Tuberville will represent our conservative Alabama values, not the liberal California and New York values that Doug Jones promotes – the two states he gets most of his funding from … that’s not an accident. That’s a signal to us.
Coach Tuberville will make Alabama proud by fighting to protect the Trump tax cuts, the unborn, the Second Amendment, conservative federal judges, plug the holes in our porous border while standing strong with President Trump to drain the swamp and combat liberal and Socialist policies.
It is time for us to end the cancellation of our two U.S. Senate votes and stand united for the cause of conservatism. I will proudly cast my vote for Coach Tommy Tuberville on November 3, and we strongly encourage each of you to do the same. It’s time for you to cancel Doug Jones in the U.S. Senate. It’s time to cancel his ignoring of the majority. It’s time to reset this seat for Sweet Home Alabama. Show the nation Alabama will not be ignored or disrespected anymore – now that’s sweet!

ALGOP Chairman Terry Lathan, Trump Victory Call on
Doug Jones to Support Judge Barrett's Supreme Court Nomination
Alabama Republican Party Chairman Terry Lathan and Trump Victory hosted a press call on Monday, October 12th following the first day of hearings for Supreme Court Nominee Amy Coney Barrett. Chairman Lathan was joined by U.S. Senators Marco Rubio (FL), Rand Paul (KY) and Ron Johnson (WI), along with RNC Co-Chairman Tommy Hicks (TX) in their respective states. The following are her remarks during the ALGOP call:
""Thank you all for joining us today.
""Alabama has a unique situation with the Judge Amy Coney Barrett nomination. Our state is repeatedly the highest rated approval state for President Trump. We are one of the reddest conservative states in the nation with 65% of all partisan elected officials being Republicans.
""So, one would think our U.S. Senators would listen and vote with what the will of the majority of Alabamians want.
""While Senator Shelby has clearly and repeatedly voted for the majority, that has not been the case with Senator Doug Jones. He has been tone deaf to that majority and there will be a heavy price for him to pay on November 3rd.
""Today, Doug Jones continues to thumb his nose at our state’s majority. If we know one think about Alabamians, ignoring us will be met with firm actions by ending his short tenure in the U.S. Senate. As of today, he has embarrassed our state and shirked one of his most important duties as a Senator – represent our state in this nomination process. Senator Jones immediately knee jerked on not meeting with Judge Coney Barrett – he would not even give her the courtesy or decent respect to meet with this highly accomplished mother of seven who drives a minivan.
""Our state has been sidelined by his absence. Funny how he said the American people need a 'full, fair and complete trial' when it came to President Trump’s impeachment proceedings. He promised Alabama he would be an “independent” voice. On Judge Coney Barrett’s proceedings, he has failed on all of his own promises to Alabama. His slogan is 'One Alabama' – it should be changed to 'Ignoring Alabama'.
""Judge Coney Barrett is the epitome of female empowerment in all aspects of her life – in her family, her academics, her law life and her consistent stance on one thing when sitting on any bench in our nation: reading and interpreting the U.S. Constitution not legislating from the bench. The Democrats love invoking the same constitution, but only when they want the situations to be seen through their lens. This nomination is one of these examples.
""Doug Jones blames the November 3rd election as a reason for him to withhold a meeting and his vote for seating Judge Coney Barrett. Yet, there have been two general elections held that lead us to follow the voters’ wishes – in 2016 with the election of President Trump and in 2018 when the Senate added two Republican members. The compass of those decisions of statewide elections points in a balanced, conservative direction. Yet Senator Jones continues to tell Alabama to 'talk to the hand' with his flagrant disregard for the majority of Alabamians. He will forfeit his seat on November 3rd for leaving our seat at the table empty.
""We agree with Senator Jones and Joe Biden on one thing – this is a battle for the heart and soul of the Senate and America. When then-Senator Joe Biden was chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, he asked that questions not be posed to the nominee on topics that may come before them on the bench. The Honorable Justice Ginsberg agreed the Constitution clearly gives a president the right to appoint a nominee. Yet, Doug Jones is once again failing to acknowledge the Constitution’s clear directives for Amy Coney Barrett.
""As America is hearing and seeing the calm demeanor of their most highly qualified nominee, we look forward to our fellow citizens seeing for themselves the truth that has been filtered while the hysterics of the Democrats are on display.
""Amy Coney Barrett stands solid on the most important attribute a Supreme Court Justice is charges with – applying and overlaying the words of the United States Constitution to the cases that will be before her. She has stood on these principles and application through her entire legal journey.
""It’s a shame Doug Jones has once again put our majority last and his left wing groups first. His repeated failure to remember the majority of our state is who will be on full display in three weeks from Tuesday when his term ends.
""Senator Jones once told CNN when asked about voting against the will of the Alabama majority that it wasn’t the 'be all to end all'. On November 3rd, we look forward to making his short 'one and done' term the true 'be all to end all' when we seat Tommy Tuberville and keep the majority in the U.S. Senate and the White House. The world is watching Alabama with the power of the U.S. Senate at stake, and we plan to show the world what Alabamians do with our votes by vanquishing Doug Jones to a blip in the history books.
""We look forward to showcasing Alabama’s majority strength and also seating Amy Coney Barrett as the new Supreme Court Justice.
""In the meantime, we challenge Joe Biden to release his Supreme Court list that he said he had in June, as well as answer the simple yes or no question – would he and Senator Harris push to add extra seats to the Supreme Court? If they do not, their silence tell us that’s a yes!""

ALGOP Chairman Issues Statement on Rescheduling Run-Off Election
Alabama Republican Party Chairman Terry Lathan issued the following statement concerning the rescheduling of the March 31st Run-Off Election:
""This morning Governor Kay Ivey, Attorney General Steve Marshall and Secretary of State John Merrill announced that the Alabama primary runoff elections will be held on Tuesday, July 14, 2020. With the uncertainty surrounding the Coronavirus as it moves across our nation and confirmed cases in Alabama continue to increase, we support the administration’s prudent measures and decisions to protect Alabamians. While these are concerning and unknown times, we appreciate our leaders implementing a safe atmosphere for our probate and election officials, poll workers, campaigns, candidates and voters. The old saying ‘better safe than sorry’ is truly applicable in these unknown circumstances.
""We ask all to be in deep prayer for our president, state leaders, candidates, their families and our fellow citizens. We also lift up our health care workers, first responders and those who keep our nation and state safe. This opportunity of working together will showcase our great state’s resilience with a focus on our fellow Alabamians’ safety and health.
""Americans are tenacious and tough people who have risen to many trying times and we have no doubt that we will all rise together again in this chapter of our nation's and state’s history.""

ALGOP Chairman Terry Lathan Statement on
the State of the State Address
Alabama Republican Party Chairman Terry Lathan released the following statement following this evening's State of the State address by Governor Kay Ivey:
""This evening Governor Ivey demonstrated why she is ranked one of the top-10 approval rated governors in the nation. The state of our state is strong, thanks to her focused leadership. The results are solid.
""With an unemployment rate of 2.7% – the lowest in our state's 200 year history and among the lowest in the nation – and 77,000 new jobs created in last year alone, Alabama's economy shows no signs of slowing down. This has enabled the Ivey administration to add much needed services and personnel to help our citizens, including a 17% increase in State Troopers on our roadways, job training programs and increasing rural broadband access.
""Governor Ivey will continue to move our great state forward in the new year, creating a brighter tomorrow for Alabamians and their children. Not only did she pledge to build on her past successes – with pay raises for our educators and public employees – but is also introducing new initiatives including the one billion dollar public school and college authority, a major investment in our schools. This is in addition to our education budget, the largest in state history, and will help enhance and expand our number one rated pre-k program, among others. Heralding another record breaking year of adoptions is something for all of us to celebrate.
“We are reminded there has been no proration since the Republicans took over the legislature in 2010.
""Alabama is starting off our next 100 years in incredible shape and with Governor Ivey steadying our state, it will only keep getting better. Alabama does not back away from high steps.""

ALGOP Reaches Prestigious 'President's Circle' in RNC GROW Program
The Alabama Republican Party has been named the first state Republican organization in the nation to reach the prestigious RNC 'President's Circle' – the final level of the Republican National Committee's 2019-2020 Election Cycle GROW (Growing Republican Organizations to Win) Program.
The announcement was made by RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel in a video release (below).
ALGOP Reaches RNC President's Circle for GROW Program
Republican parties representing all 50 states are participating in GROW to build deep infrastructure for the 2020 general elections. There are five rigorous levels that the ALGOP met to become the first state GOP party in the nation to be in the RNC President’s Circle.
In her announcement, Chairwoman McDaniel singled out the ALGOP for the way it focused the GROW program throughout the state of Alabama. ""Chairwoman Lathan was the first state party chair to also implement the GROW plan at the local level with all county GOP Chairs and teams,"" Chairwoman McDaniel said.
ALGOP Chairman Terry Lathan issued the following statement in response to the announcement:
""I would like to thank Chairwoman McDaniel and her team at the RNC for recognizing our hard work and determination to help build deeper foundations for our Party. Her vision to support the state parties with strategic plans will have national effects, state by state. This is truly an honor to be the first! We recognize that our work of 18 months is not just about the present, but will secure long lasting support in the future – for our voters, candidates, volunteers, Party members and our conservative policies.
I am truly blessed to work with one of the most talented Republican staffs in the country on a daily basis: Chief of Staff Harold Sachs, Business Administrator Rudy Scott, Political Director Reed Phillips, Finance Director Shannon Whitt and Communications Director Jeannie Faherty. Our political, finance and communications departments put together an amazing election year plan. We now have the deepest ALGOP infrastructure ever in our state Party’s history. Because our team worked together to implement our GROW plans, I am confident we will bring home a big win for President Trump and defeat Doug Jones on November 3rd.""

ALGOP Chairman Terry Lathan Statement on
Senator Doug Jones Impeachment Vote Announcement
Alabama Republican Party Chairman Terry Lathan released the following statement following today's announcement by Senator Doug Jones on impeachment:
""Alabama Democrat Senator Doug Jones has announced he will vote to convict President Trump on both impeachment charges. He continues to take his marching orders from Chuck Schumer and his liberal California campaign donors. By voting to convict, Senator Jones once again is demonstrating his contempt for the majority of Alabamians who are opposed to impeachment. This comes as no surprise when you consider his past voting record including his votes against Justice Kavanaugh and many of President Trump's other nominees, his refusal to back border wall funding and his continued support of abortion on demand. The voters of Alabama will keenly remember this day on November 3rd and replace Senator Jones with someone who will truly represent Alabama's values.""

ALGOP Chairman Terry Lathan to Senator Doug Jones – Do Your Job
Alabama Republican Party Chairman Terry Lathan held a news conference at ALGOP Headquarters in Hoover on Wednesday, September 30th and made the following remarks regarding Senator Doug Jones:
""Today is the day we are challenging Doug Jones to do something he rarely does – listen to the majority of Alabamians. He has ignored the majority over and over on major issues.
* On voting to remove the [[URL REDACTED]]
* When he voted no to seat now Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. He still owes Justice Kavanaugh an apology for going along with the circus the Democrats orchestrated against a nominee that Alabamians supported.
* On voting to withhold funding from the southern border wall being built.
* On declaring he will vote to take away Alabama tax cuts courtesy of President [[URL REDACTED]] other words take away your money that you work for – he’s telling you, Alabama, it’s his to take and not yours to keep. He wants your family income back.
""And now he has said he will not vote to confirm a deeply qualified and highly respected judge, Amy Coney Barrett for the Supreme Court. He said it’s because it’s too close to an election.
""Well, there was an election held in 2016 and 2018 – Alabama said we highly support President Trump in the White House and America added 2 more Republican U.S. Senate seats. With the Republican Party now the majority in the Senate and in the White House, Senator Jones needs to do his job – meet with her, listen to her and then decide on Judge Barrett’s credentials.
""If he can find time to have campaign drive-in events, he can find time to do one of the most important jobs a U.S. Senator is tasked to do – the seating of a Supreme Court Justice, authored by the Founding Fathers through the United States Constitution.
""Look, we understand he’s in a jam – with over 80% of his funding from out of state, mostly New York and California, he has to cash out with them. He’d fit in nicely in those lands of radical liberalism especially since he only votes with President Trump 35% of the time while representing the highest approval rated state for Donald Trump in the nation.
""However, in Alabama his tone deafness to the seating of Judge Barrett will not stand. There is no reason not to meet with this mother of 7 who drives a minivan, is highly regarded by her students, professors and those who have worked with her in the judicial system. Why is he afraid? He looks weak. Alabama does not like that look at all.
""Do your job, Senator Jones. Use your own words that you pride yourself on of being fair. Meet with Judge Barrett on behalf of Alabama.
""Doug Jones was asked on CNN about voting against the will of the majority of Alabamians during the Kavanaugh hearing. His answer was smug, arrogant and a true snapshot of how out of step he is with our state – he replied, 'That may be true but it’s not the be all to end all.' That’s code for 'I don’t care'.
""So again, we find Doug Jones being Doug Jones – thumbing his liberal left-wing nose at one of the most conservative states in the nation.
""OK – go ahead Senator Jones. You do you and we are going to do us. On November 3rd when Alabamians have all of the power, we will prove that your one hit wonder term was really a one hit blunder term. We will thumb our noses at you with the stoke of our pens.
""You will have no one to blame but yourself. In 34 days, your millions of dollars and appeasement of the left will not save you.
Alabamians don’t take kindly to being ignored and on November 3rd they will not be ignored by you any longer.
""In 34 days, Alabama will again add a new page in our history books when we will show Doug Jones that the voters are the be all to end all. We will end his placeholder status and elect Tommy Tuberville to replace Doug Jones.
“Coach Tuberville will support our president and, as important, not ignore the wishes of the people of sweet home Alabama.”

ALGOP Chairman Terry Lathan Issues Statement on
Doug Jones's NO Vote on COVID Relief
Alabama Republican Party Chairman Terry Lathan issued the following statement on Senator Doug Jones's NO vote on the U.S. Senate's COVID Relief package today:
""Once again, Senator Jones has shown just how tone deaf he is to the needs of Alabamians. This COVID Relief legislation would have provided much needed support for our school systems that are trying to open safely for our students. It would have also provided the resources needed to continue to develop and distribute a vaccine as well as improve testing. While President Trump is leading on his 'Warp Speed' vaccine solutions, Doug Jones is failing Alabama – again.
""On Tuesday, Senator Jones claimed not to know what was in the bill. On Wednesday, he said he had 'mixed emotions' about it. Now, on Thursday, he said it was 'inadequate'. He's all over the place. Instead of supporting Alabamians, he lined up behind his liberal buddies Kamala Harris and Bernie Sanders to support the $3.5 trillion ‘wish list’ passed by House Democrats back in May –- a list to bail out bankrupt cities that have nothing to do with the pandemic. He wants Alabama to bail out incompetently run liberal cities with our taxes. That’s a hard pass!
""It's time for Alabama to have a Senator who listens to the majority – Tommy Tuberville will be elected as our next U.S. Senator this November 3rd and will follow the majority of our people’s directions.""

ALGOP U.S. Senate Primary Runoff Remarks from Chairman Lathan
Alabama Republican Party Chairman Terry Lathan issued the following statement regarding today's ALGOP Primary Runoff for the U.S. Senate:
""It's great to be an Alabama Republican! Our voters have spoken and they have chosen an outstanding U.S. Senate nominee for the November 3rd General Election, Coach Tommy Tuberville. Even under difficult circumstances with the COVID-19 situation, Alabamians were deeply engaged and determined to participate in our voting process.
""Tommy Tuberville is a true Washington outsider and has gained the trust of Alabama Republican Party voters to represent them and help President Trump 'Drain the Swamp'. He will fight for the will of the majority who have been ignored since 2017. His conservative positions on the issues and support of our president will be welcomed when he defeats Doug Jones in November. Alabama is the highest approval rated state for President Trump. The combination of Coach Tuberville and President Trump's popularity in our state puts us in a very strong position to flip this seat back to the GOP.
""We are greatly appreciative of Jeff Sessions and his lifetime of commitment to conservative policy and service – not just to Alabamians but to all Americans. He is a true patriot in every sense of the word and our nation is stronger because of his willingness to take a stand on the issues and fight for the will of Alabamians. Senator Sessions has earned his place in history as a true conservative warrior.
""We would also like to thank Secretary of State John Merrill and the election teams around the state who worked so diligently in providing heath care protection to the voters in today's elections.
""Together, we are unstoppable on November 3rd. Alabamians have that date circled in red and plan to end the tenure of liberal Doug Jones. While we know a battle is ahead, his voting record will be in the spotlight – voting to impeach our president and not to seat Justice Kavanaugh, voting against building our nation's security walls and tax cuts just to name a few. We look forward to doing to Doug Jones what he and his left wing buddies failed to do to President Trump – end his time in office.""

ALGOP Criminal Court of Appeals Primary Runoff Remarks
from Chairman Lathan
Alabama Republican Party Chairman Terry Lathan issued the following statement regarding today's ALGOP Primary Runoff for the Alabama Criminal Court of Appeals:
""While we had two exceptional candidates for the Criminal Court of Appeals, Alabama Republican voters have selected a highly qualified legal mind to be their nominee for the Alabama Criminal Court of Appeals.
""Beth Kellum has proven herself to a be a strong judge during her previous two terms on the bench. Combined with her extensive legal career, we are confident Judge Kellum will win re-election and return to this seat on November 3rd. We look forward to her continued service with the upmost integrity and seriousness she has shown Alabama as a judge.
""We extend our gratitude to Will Smith for his willingness to serve – not just in this position but in his previous post as a Lauderdale County Commissioner. He is a great example of a true statesman.""

"A Message from the Chairman
Republican Friend,
Resilience: (noun) The power or ability to return to the original form, position, etc., after being bent, compressed, or stretched; elasticity. Ability to recover readily from illness, depression, adversity, or the like; buoyancy.
There's no doubt that we've been through so much these last couple of months, as Alabamians and as Americans: COVID-19, economic uncertainty, civil unrest. However, as we are all going through some tumultuous times, the word 'resilience' stands tall. No matter what new challenge we've had to endure, the people of our great state – frontline healthcare workers, first responders, truckers, public officials and our neighbors – have risen to deep challenges.
Resiliency is at the core of the American spirit and is what makes our country strong. Regardless of what the nightly news shows us, we are already experiencing just how strong our country is:
* The national unemployment rate dropped from 14.7% to 13.3% in May, in what the experts called a 'surprise turnaround'.
* In Alabama, the May unemployment rate dropped from 13.8% to 9.9%, also defying expectations.
* Our legislature managed to return to Montgomery to complete their session, passing both a General Fund Budget and an Education Budget with *NO* proration and increases in funding. Both measures were signed by Governor Kay Ivey.
Within the ALGOP, our county organizations and local club chapters have discovered ways to work within the confines of this new normal, holding meetings with the assistance of conference call programs and video conferencing apps like Zoom. Our ALGOP staff continues to amaze me with their ideas on how to continue our election year work with restrictions still in place, like hosting Facebook Watch Parties and 'Calling Alabama' conference calls with the Republican U.S. Senate Candidates.
Speaking of elections, we do have a very important primary run-off coming up on July 14th. See our Election Information below if you are interested in an absentee ballot (must be received by July 9th).
As President Trump likes to say, together, we can Keep America – and Alabama – Great! There is no doubt we will continue to show the world, once again, our nation is the solid model of strength and perseverance.
KAG,
Mrs. Terry Lathan
Chairman, Alabama Republican Party

TAKE THE CENSUS BY CLICKING HERE
You do NOT need a digital code or
to wait until you hear from the Census department.
It's time to be counted. The 2020 Census is underway and it's crucial to our state for every one of us to take part. Please follow the directions on the Census form you were mailed and complete it as soon as possible. You don't need to leave home to do it. The Census can be done on-line.
Some census facts:
* The census was established by our Founding Fathers in Article 1, Section 2 of the Constitution. It is sent to every household in the U.S. every 10 years.
* Up to $13 billion in federal funding for Alabama is at stake. This is money used to improve our state's future: schools, roads, job opportunities, etc. We need an accurate census count to ensure these programs are able to continue.
* The census will also determine the number of congressional seats Alabama has. Unlike U.S. Senate seats – which always remain at two per state – congressional districts are reconfigured every 10 years based upon population growth and loss in each state. We need to make sure Alabama continues to have sufficient representation in Washington.
* This in turn will impact the number of electors we send to the Electoral College starting with the 2024 Presidential election. The number of electors in each state is equal to the size of its congressional delegation (U.S. Senators plus U.S. Representatives).
* The census contains only 10 simple questions and takes just 6 minutes of your time to complete.
For more information about the census, you can visit the official state website by clicking here .

ALGOP Chairman Lathan Statement on
Passage of 2020 Alabama State Budgets
Alabama Republican Party Chairman Terry Lathan issued the following the passage of the 2020 Alabama State Budgets:
""This has been a unprecedented session due to the COVID-19 epidemic which imposed multiple obstacles for our elected officials to overcome. Our Republican leadership and governor managed to forge through passing both the General Fund and Education budgets to see our state through the next year.
""While there was more belt tightening required than anticipated before the Coronavirus outbreak, Alabama's economic situation is much better than many other states in the nation – in large part due to the fiscally responsible practices of our Republican supermajority since we gained control of the legislature in 2010. We also are proud to highlight that no proration has occurred since the Alabama GOP takeover along with record breaking education budgets.
""In fact, the 2021 General Fund Budget is $169 million larger than the previous year and includes funding increases for the Alabama Department of Public Health ($35 million), Alabama Medicaid Agency ($94 million), Alabama Department of Mental Health ($25 million), ALEA ($3 million, specifically for the hiring of additional State Troopers) and the Department of Corrections ($23 million).
""Additionally, the Education Trust Fund is $91 million more than fiscal year 2020, and includes funding increases for our award winning early childhood education program and Alabama's public institutions of higher learning (colleges, universities, and community colleges).
""We are confident Alabama will continue to grow its economy – even beyond what we experienced prior to the pandemic – thanks to hard working, determined Alabamians combined with the sound conservative principles our Republican officials use to guide our state. In the end, we are grateful the Republican legislative body and Governor Ivey came together as a team to get the record breaking budgets up and out to Alabama, even with heavy burdens and concerns lingering due to COVID-19 in these unparalleled times.""

"Fellow Republican,
Today is National Voter Registration Day. Every year millions of Americans miss out on voting because they miss the deadline to register, haven't updated their information or simply don't know how to begin the process.
We need your help. Please ask five people in your circle – friends, family members, co-workers – if they are registered to vote and if they've checked to make sure their information is up-to-date. If they haven't done either of these things:
* Encourage them to go to [[URL REDACTED]] – the official website of the Alabama Secretary of State
* Click on the ""Voter Registration"" button
* Follow the directions to register or check your registration status on-line
* Traditional paper applications are also available to download for anyone who would prefer to mail in their form
It's that easy! OR you can download the ""Vote For Alabama"" app, and with a valid Alabama driver's license, register to vote on your phone.
There are only 42 days until Election Day and every vote does count! Please help the ALGOP as we work to ensure everyone who is eligible to vote is able to do so... and then make it your personal quest to make sure they go vote on November 3rd to help Team GOP!
Counting down to KAG!

ALGOP Chairman Terry Lathan Statement on
Republican National Convention Week, Day One
ALGOP Chairman Terry Lathan issued the following statement at the close of day one of the Republican National Convention:
""What an incredible day to be an American and an Alabamian! Alabama’s delegation played a key role in helping President Trump and Vice President Pence easily secure re-nomination – with ALGOP National Committeewoman and RNC Secretary Vicki Dummond leading the roll call vote, ALGOP Delegation Chairman Andrew Sorrell passionately casting all 50 ALGOP votes for the President and Vice President, ALGOP National Committeeman Paul Reynolds serving on the Contest Committee, Greg Cook and Linda Coats serving on the Credentials Committee and myself being tapped as a Deputy Permanent Co-Chair of the Convention.
""President Trump and Vice President Pence’s surprise appearance in Charlotte to accept their nominations in-person thrilled the delegates and demonstrated just how committed they both are to continuing the 'Great American Story'. They laid out the success stories of their administration – the promises made and promises kept such as lowering taxes, strengthening our military and growing the economy – while painting a vision for our county that is full of promise and exceptionalism.
""Unlike the Democrat National Convention – which was full of doom and gloom with speeches from the far left, like Doug Jones, Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez – the Republican National Convention was truly a clear contrast of policy and enthusiasm. We are looking forward to beating Joe Biden and his socialist agenda this November 3rd so America can have four more years of winning as we Keep America Great.""

ALGOP Chairman Terry Lathan Statement on
the State of the Union Address
Alabama Republican Party Chairman Terry Lathan released the following statement following tonight's State of the Union address by President Donald Trump:
""On the day he entered the 2016 race, President Trump laid out a vision to make America great again. Tonight, three years into his presidency, the President presented to the American people the accomplishments of his administration which far exceeded the promises he made.
""With seven million jobs since he took office – five million more than the experts projected – the lowest unemployment rate in over half a century, the lowest unemployment rates in history for all minority groups, and women filling 72% of all new jobs added, the state of our Union is stronger than ever before. Wages continue to rise and the media household income is at its highest level in history. Once again, America is respected on the world stage because of a president who does not blink and puts America first.
“However, this address was more than just facts and figures. It was a showcase of America's finest people and stories. From Brigadier General Charles McGee – the last surviving member of the Tuskegee Airmen – and his great-grandson Iain Lanphier, who hopes to join the Space Force, to Montgomery's own Paul Morrow, who was among the President's guests, tonight's address was about celebrating American exceptionalism.
""Along with our country's great successes we witnessed a stunning and clear contrast as the Democrats sat in silence not supporting these incredible Americans, their stories and the land that stands above all. We cannot look away from that contrast. We must fight for our nation's future to keep America great.""

ALGOP Chairman Terry Lathan Statement on Passing of Rep. John Lewis
Alabama Republican Party Chairman Terry Lathan issued the following statement on the passing of civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis:
""As history continues to write about John Lewis, it will highlight a warrior who used a bridge as a simple but powerful reminder that all men and women are created equal. His quiet demeanor was overshadowed by his larger than life boldness. His courageous footsteps were heard around the world.
""I had the honor of meeting Rep. Lewis at the 50th Anniversary of Selma to Montgomery March. We shared that while we differed in parties, as Americans we stood together as brother and sister recognizing that our freedoms are colorblind. No one has control of the color of their skin, but we all have control of our actions. His actions without violence are etched in history as role modeling equality through peace.
""Rep. Lewis now lovingly marches in God’s army while we are tasked with loving and working together to end racism through our hearts- to listen, learn and love. May we all continue to peacefully change the world with our own steps as we honor the life of John Lewis.""

ALGOP Chairman Issues Statement on Senator Doug Jones's
Vote Against Coronavirus Funding Measure
Alabama Republican Party Chairman Terry Lathan issued the following statement following Senator Doug Jones's vote against the Phase 3 Coronavirus funding measure:
""This is not the time for politics. Senator Doug Jones needs to follow the example of Democrat New York Governor Andrew Cuomo – who has put his political differences aside and is working across the aisle with President Trump during this crisis – instead of being Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer's partisan puppet. His NO vote Sunday night has had serious ramifications on the people of Alabama and our country. The Democrats helped craft this emergency unprecedented legislation and then, like Charlie Brown and the football, yanked away desperately needed help for America.
“Doug Jones has let the majority of our state down in an uncertain time. We needed him – and he ignored us AGAIN.
“Thank you to President Trump and Senator Richard Shelby for putting America and Alabama first. We continue to lift our leaders up in prayer as their burdens and decisions weigh heavy.”
Terry Lathan

ALGOP U.S. House Primary Runoff Remarks from Chairman Lathan
Alabama Republican Party Chairman Terry Lathan issued the following statement regarding today's ALGOP Primary Runoff for the U.S. House in District 1:
""The voters of Congressional District 1 had two exceptional candidates to chose from in this runoff.
""Jerry Carl has worked hard for the people of Mobile County as a county commissioner. That background, combined with his business experience, will be a major asset to his constituents as he takes on Capitol Hill. Jerry has a strong reputation for listening to his constituents. His willingness to hear the voices of the people in his district will be a great asset for himself and south Alabama.
""We are grateful for the service of Senator Bill Hightower. His strong conservative voting record has helped our state. We honor his service and
recognize his dedication to Alabama. He is to be highly commended for running for this position.

ALGOP Chairman Terry Lathan Issues Statement
on Absentee Voting Procedures
Starting today, voters in Alabama can request absentee ballots if they are unable to vote in person.
""We are excited the Alabama election process is now open. We expect a record breaking year for voter turnout with President Trump and Tommy Tuberville leading our ticket,"" said Alabama Republican Party Chairman Terry Lathan.
""However, it has come to our attention – through calls we've fielded from voters – that third party organizations are sending texts and emails soliciting people to vote absentee and providing unofficial information about the process. We are encouraging all voters to please be wary of these requests from outside sources. The only official source for voting information is Secretary of State John Merrill's website: [[URL REDACTED]],"" Chairman Terry Lathan cautioned.
Absentee ballots can be obtained either:
* By mail – Only voters may request and handle their own absentee applications and ballots. Voters can submit an absentee ballot application (available here) along with a copy of their photo ID. The application and ID must be mailed to the voter's county Absentee Elections Manager (complete list available here) by Thursday, October 29, 2020. The completed absentee ballot must be postmarked by Monday, November 2, 2020, or turned in by hand no later than the close of business on Monday, November 2, 2020.
* In-person – Voters can request an absentee ballot in-person at their county courthouse from the office of the Absentee Elections Manager (complete list available here). A photo ID is required. The last day to request an absentee ballot in-person is Thursday, October 29, 2020. The last day to return your ballot in-person is close of business on Monday, November 2, 2020. In-person absentee voting is available in all 67 counties.
Per Secretary of State John Merrill, if you are requesting an absentee ballot due to the COVID-19 pandemic, please select ""I have a physical illness or infirmity which prevents my attendance at the polls. [ID Required]"" as your reason for needing one.
The Alabama Secretary of State's office has a toll-free hotline set up to answer any questions or report problems or suspicious activity. That number is 1-800-274-8683.

ALGOP Chairman Terry Lathan Issues Statement
on First Presidential Debate
Alabama Republican Party Chairman Terry Lathan issued the following statement on the First Presidential Debate:
""President Trump swiftly demonstrated that his 'Promises Made, Promises Kept' record will continue for four more years. The comparison between the two agendas couldn't be starker. The President’s record in 47 months compared to Joe Biden’s 47 years in office is monumental. President Trump highlighted many of his policies. Joe Biden shared none of his.
""The topic of Obamacare was clear on the differences in the debate. President Trump removed the individual mandated healthcare tax, implemented price lists for medical procedures and medicines and has cut drug prices. Joe Biden wants to expand government healthcare as he admitted in the debate. Americans are opposed to more government in their healthcare decisions.
""The wide difference of opening up states to grow our economy was day and night. President Trump wants to open up our economy, as it is already strongly rebounding, while Joe Biden wants to keep it closed by his own words.
""Joe Biden said he was against defunding the police, however he earlier said he was for defunding them and wanted to use the money in the community instead. He also couldn't name any first responder groups who have endorsed him while President Trump has a large number of endorsements across the nation. Clearly, this shows where the law enforcement communities stand as the President has stood with them.
""The President moved quickly with a massive response to the COVID pandemic. He shut down travel with China early on over Democrat objections, including Joe Biden, and instituted 'Operation Warp Speed' that is now producing rapid testing and vaccines. Joe Biden said he would do what has already been done by President Trump when pushed on his plan.
""President Trump made a strong case why he and the U.S. Senate should move swiftly to fill the U.S. Supreme Court vacancy with highly qualified jurist Amy Coney Barrett. Joe Biden continues to hide his list of potential Supreme Court nominees and would not agree to address 'packing' the Supreme Court when directly asked.
""President Trump rejected the radical environmental 'New Green Deal' while Joe Biden said he did too, however Mr. Biden is on record embracing it – multiple times. He is all over the place on this left-wing AOC agenda.
""Joe Biden wants to count votes days after they come in past November 3rd as he admitted in the debate. Laws of states prohibit this chaos and courts are stopping it on a daily basis.
""Americans want someone who will fight for them to keep our country safe and great. President Trump showed tonight he's a heavyweight fighter who has been putting America first. That's why President Trump will win re-election on November 3rd.""

"December 10, 2019
Dear Republican Friends,
I wanted to share with you a statement from the Republican National Committee (below) concerning this morning's actions by House Democrats who filed two articles of impeachment against President Trump. RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel is correct when she says this is just another attempt to overthrow a duly-elected President.
From day one, this has been their battle cry. Through national hissy fits layered in anger, they are doing exactly what many Democrats have pushed for since the beginning of President Trump’s presidency. We do not hear one word about the incredible economy our citizens are experiencing. It is shameful behavior on the Democrats’ part. Hopefully, America will have the last say in the 2020 elections and remove those who have participated in this sham.
It's great to be a Republican.

"Fellow Republicans,
Attorney General Steve Marshall and Secretary of State John Merrill have provided guidance on the question of masks being worn at polling places on Election Day. Secretary Merrill's full release is included below.
In summary, the state law does not prohibit a voter from casting a vote if they aren’t wearing a mask. No voter can be denied voting if they aren’t wearing a mask. If this arises in a voting precinct please call the Secretary of State’s office at 1-800-274-VOTE (8683).
Please feel free to share this information with your county parties and on your social media outlets.
As always, following CDC guidelines is highly recommended.﻿

"It's GAME ON! The Alabama Primary Runoff has been decide and Coach Tommy Tuberville will be on the ballot for the U.S. Senate in November.
WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT! Beating Doug Jones is our PRIORITY.
Tommy Tuberville is a true Washington outsider and has gained the trust of Alabama Republican Party voters to represent them and help President Trump 'Drain the Swamp'. He will fight for the will of the majority who have been ignored since 2017. His conservative positions on the issues and support of our president will be welcomed when he defeats Doug Jones in November. Alabama is the highest approval rated state for President Trump. The combination of Coach Tuberville and President Trump's popularity in our state puts us in a very strong position to flip this seat back to the GOP.
Together, we are unstoppable on November 3rd. Alabamians have that date circled in red and plan to end the tenure of liberal Doug Jones. While we know a battle is ahead, his voting record will be in the spotlight – voting to impeach our president and not to seat Justice Kavanaugh, voting against building our nation's security walls and tax cuts just to name a few. We look forward to doing to Doug Jones what he and his left wing buddies failed to do to President Trump – end his time in office.""

"Republican Friend:
We received the following advisory from Secretary of State John Merrill. Please be alert this election cycle. If you spot anything suspicious, please contact his office at (334) 242-7200 and report it. We STRONGLY recommend you only use the Alabama Secretary of State's website and office to gather or clarify election information, be cautious with unknown mailings, phone calls and anyone who reaches out to you on social media. The official website is at: [[URL REDACTED]]
KAG,
Mrs. Terry M. Lathan
Chairman, ALGOP
The Secretary of State’s Office has been made aware of another third-party organization contacting voters with outdated and inaccurate information to encourage voter registration and voter participation.
The letter, which is sent by the Election Mail Service out of Austin, Texas, encourages voters to visit [[URL REDACTED]] – a site that is not associated whatsoever with the Office of the Secretary of State. The letter notifies voters that they are not registered to vote and includes an unofficial voter registration application.
“After being notified by numerous voters who have received information in the mail addressed to people who have passed away or no longer reside in our state, our office immediately contacted the Election Mail Service to stop spreading the false information, which has in turn only confused and misled voters,” announced Secretary of State John H. Merrill.
Voters across the state have been targeted using misspelled, misinformed, and misleading data.
“Alabamians should once again be reminded to use [[URL REDACTED]] as their trusted source for election information. Questions about the election should be answered directly by our Office at (334) 242-7200.”
Voters can check their voter registration status online using our registration portal.

Republicans look to use convention as election test bed
Republicans look to use convention as election test bed
Associated Press
Zeke Miler
August 23, 2020
""Republicans are aiming to use this week’s national convention as a test bed for their efforts to reelect President Donald Trump, just weeks before the start of early voting.
The Republican National Committee plans to hold more than 7,500 events across the country — the majority of them in person — as part of a “dry run” of their get-out-the-vote efforts. The party is putting its hope in its 2,000 field staffers and 1.9 million volunteers as it seeks to help Trump recover from a coronavirus-induced polling slump and edge out Democratic nominee Joe Biden on Nov. 3.
“This is a great opportunity to activate and energize our volunteers and our base,” said RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel. The GOP, she said, knocked on more than 1 million doors during last week’s Democratic convention, and aims to do even more during the Republican convention.
McDaniel is set to play a prominent role during the convention, including delivering remarks Monday night and leading a Wednesday celebration of the centennial of the adoption of the 19th Amendment, which guaranteed women the vote.
The field events this week include volunteer training, as the GOP looks to surpass the 2.2 million volunteers that helped reelect President Barack Obama in 2012, and “MAGA-meetup watch parties,” in which supporters will gather to watch the convention proceedings. Gatherings are planned in all 50 states for Thursday night, when Trump is set to deliver his acceptance speech from the South Lawn of the White House.
“We’re knocking on a million doors a week and the Democrats aren’t knocking on any,” said RNC chief of staff Richard Walters. Republicans, like Democrats, moved to virtual get-out-the-vote efforts earlier this year because of the pandemic, but the GOP steadily resumed in-person activities while Democrats largely held off.
McDaniel said the GOP’s field efforts will be even more vital this year, as more voters embrace absentee and mail balloting because of the coronavirus. “This is a year where this ground game is going to be critical as we’re going to be pushing people to return their ballots,” McDaniel said.""

"January 29, 2020
Dear ALGOP friend:
The last several days have been a whirlwind at the ALGOP.
We held three “Support Our President” rallies around the state outside Senator Jones's district offices, per the request of the RNC. We started last Friday in Huntsville, moved to Birmingham on Monday and took on Mobile yesterday (Tuesday). All three events were a YUGE success and received major media coverage. Thanks to all who came out and helped spread the word. Special thanks to our county parties, auxiliary groups and the Trump Girls of Alabama.
I am including pictures from the rallies below.
The RNC and Trump Campaign were thrilled and said Alabama’s efforts were second to none!
Huntsville Rally
Friday, January 24th
Birmingham Rally
Monday, January 27th
Mobile Rally
Tuesday, January 28th
The Trump campaign has requested Alabama hold State of the Union Watch Parties around the state.
The SOTU is on Tuesday, February 4, 2020 at 8:00 p.m. CST. Just like we did for President Trump's campaign kick-off during the summer, we have asked our county parties and auxiliary groups to organize watch parties in their areas.
MAGA Meetups can be held in a restaurant or someone’s home. Please reach out to your county party chairman or local auxiliary group to see if they'll be able to hold one in your area and make plans to attend. Please post the events on your social media as well.
Send ALGOP Communications Director Jeannie Faherty pictures of your event. She'll be sharing them with the Trump campaign and posting them on our social media. ([[URL REDACTED]])
Earlier this week, we had the ""big reveal"" for who will be the keynote speaker for the 2020 ALGOP Winter Dinner: Sean Spicer, former White House Press Secretary for President Trump! Since the announcement, tickets have been going fast. Make sure you purchase yours soon as this will be a sell-out event. The link is below. Our host hotel is already booked solid, but there are several hotels located in close proximity.
Marriott Courtyard 334-290-1270

"Senator Jones is right about one thing – the people of Alabama are GREAT. He is wrong about the rest. He voted against President Trump's Supreme Court Justice, Brett Cavanaugh, to convict President Trump in the impeachment sham, won't fund the building of a wall, and recently agreed to allow abortions past 20 weeks gestation. These votes do NOT represent the great people of Alabama. He's ignoring the majority over and over!
The Alabama Republican Party is ready to vote for a new senator in just 244 days. Please support us as we work to make Senator Jones #OneAndDoneDoug. Your donation will help us to take back the senate seat and give President Trump the support he needs in Washington, DC.
We work now to win in November – and it will be well worth it!

"DOUG JONES IS NOT ON YOUR TEAM!
Give TODAY - Send Senator Jones PACKING!
> Senator Doug Jones embraced the ‘left of left’ at the DNC Convention last night by joining Bernie Sanders to endorse Joe Biden. The message from Michelle Obama was one of despair. Senator Jones lined up with his teammates who demand tax hikes, Medicare for All, ending private healthcare, taxpayers paying for abortions and illegal immigrants, defunding the police, ending border wall security and a focus on locking down gun ownership – although they purposely didn’t mention their beliefs to the nation.
Help ALGOP Defeat Doug Jones TODAY
WE NEED YOUR HELP! The far-left is full of career politicians who want big government and progressive ideals. That is not what the people of Alabama want. Doug Jones is one of THEM\-- not one of US! Help us KAG as we are budgeting TODAY to end Doug Jones's tenure- NOT Alabama!

"March 17, 2020
Dear Friend of the Alabama Republican Party:
At this time, the March 31st run-off election is still scheduled to take place. The Code of Alabama does not give a governor or body the authority to change the date of the election. An opinion is being sought from Attorney General Steve Marshall to see if the the emergency powers the governor is granted are applicable to an election (click here for statement from Secretary of State John Merrill). Once that opinion has been received, we will proceed accordingly.
Unless notified differently, carry on as usual for the March 31st run-off election. Voting absentee is encouraged due to the circumstances. You are required to submit a copy of your photo ID with your absentee ballot application. Absentee ballot applications can be found by clicking here. The deadline to apply for an absentee ballot is March 26th.
Best,

"🚨 🚨 🚨 The D.C. Democrats are pouring MILLIONS into Alabama!
Friend,
This is a huge year for our Party and the drive to Election Day is on.
Our U.S. Senate race is one of the most high-profile and consequential in the entire nation, and we have TWO open seats to defend to help take back the House and FIRE Nancy Pelosi!
The good news is we have truly outstanding MAGA conservatives running in these three top priority races. Coach Tommy Tuberville, Jerry Carl, and Barry Moore are born leaders. I know they’ll deliver results and make us proud.
Although we are a ""red"" state, the CA/NY Democrats are pouring MILLIONS into our state – I’m sure you’ve seen some of the ads.
We are working right through Election Day!
Today, we want to rush emergency support to Jerry Carl in the AL First Congressional District.
🚨 Make a $25, $50, $100, or $250 contribution over the next 24 hours,
and we’ll send 50 percent of it directly to Jerry’s campaign!
** The other 50 percent of your contribution will support the ALGOP grassroots ground game work across Alabama we are implementing now.
This is a great way to deliver a big win for President Trump, help protect our U.S. Senate majority, and keep the First District “RED” on November 3rd.
The DCCC and Nancy Pelosi would LOVE to gain ground in south Alabama... and Jerry’s Democrat opponent is far more extreme than he portrays himself.
Let’s DEFEAT Doug Jones. Let’s send Coach, Jerry, and Barry to Washington.
Let’s ensure we don’t lose an INCH of ground here in Trump country to Joe Biden, Chuck Schumer, or Nancy Pelosi!
Excited to KAG,
Mrs. Terry Lathan
Chairman, Alabama Republican Party
P.S. Every contribution will be a huge help to Jerry’s team and our team here at the Alabama Republican Party – we‘ve got our hands full over the next several days! Please chip in what you can today. IT MATTERS!
🚨 Donate $25 🚨
🚨 Donate $50 🚨

"Meet ‘Michael’.
Michael and his family are originally from Romania, but this July 4th he is celebrating as a proud American, just like all of us.
Michael came to our country from Romania as a skilled professional at the top of his field. For twenty years, he worked to support his family while rarely seeing them. His goal was to become an American citizen. Michael had seen firsthand the greatness of our nation and the opportunities given to those who were willing to work to be a part of our country. He did it legally and made it happen.
When he earned his citizenship, my husband and I attended his ceremony. We walked into a packed room of anxious candidates about to be new Americans as they waited to take their oath and to pledge their allegiance to our flag for the first time as residents of our nation.
Michael did not have his family with him to witness his citizenship ceremony since they were in Romania. Knowing his excitement and extraordinary diligence to become an American, we drove from Mobile to Montgomery to stand with him. When Michael saw us, his smile must have been the brightest in the room. He was beaming with pride and it was contagious. America was welcoming him with open arms because he had earned citizenship at a deep personal sacrifice over the many years.
I had never attended a new citizenship ceremony. I had seen pictures of the ceremonies, but never appreciated the journeys that each new citizen had taken to join our blessed nation. Growing up as an American is just our life. It’s all we know.
This ceremony gave me the opportunity to reflect on many things and reminded me not to take my birth citizenship for granted. To have complete strangers remind me of the joy and honor to be an American was a gentle nudge to always be grateful and never forget the countless opportunities our nation grants us.
I spent most of the ceremony watching Michael with tears in my eyes. It was very emotional for many. I scanned the room to watch the other new citizens. They spoke many languages, had different accents but they all proudly pledged allegiance to our flag in English – the same words that we all repeat. I love those words, but on this day as we repeated them with Michael, they seemed more powerful.
There were tears, hugs and cheers as they were presented their citizenship certificates. The ceremony with Michael and our new American brothers and sisters was a quiet reminder to myself on how blessed we are to live in this great nation. I did nothing to be a citizen but to be born here. Now it is my responsibility to appreciate this blessing and do my part to add to our country.
These new citizens sought out America. They did what they had to do to join us. They left their families. They followed the rules. They financially struggled. They set their sights on the four words that so many in the world long to say – I am an American.
Michael’s update: He has moved his family from Romania and walked away from his homeland. If you ask Michael where he’s from, he will say in his Romanian accent, “America”. He recently returned to Romania one last time to sell his house. He is closing out his life there and beyond thrilled to make a new one in his new country.
If you ask Michael if he would ever go back and visit his homeland he will quickly correct you by saying, “America is my home. I love America. I am proud to be an American.”
May Michael’s story uplift us all everyday – through our current struggles, the culture wars, and all the noise we are hearing on policy differences, race, gender, class, religion, etc. On this July 4th, may we just step back and take in the quiet greatness of America through the eyes of Michael.
If you have never been to a new citizenship ceremony, you should. You will leave with a renewed pride, honor and appreciation to be an American. You’ll never think about being a United States citizen in the same way. I know I cannot – and I’m am glad that my focus was re-energized with a group of strangers that are now united as one as our fellow Americans.
Wishing you and your family a blessed Independence Day weekend in the land of the free and the home of the brave,

"Dear Republican friends,
We are super excited to welcome Super Tuesday, March 3 – the day we are proud to showcase our amazing Alabama conservative candidates. While the Alabama Republican Party takes a neutral position in our primaries and runoffs, we will come together for our end goal – re-elect Donald Trump and end the tenure of Doug Jones. Participating in the Founding Fathers’ timeless vision of allowing the people to vote and choose their own leaders will be on full display on Tuesday in our great state.
We are grateful for our candidates who have stepped into the arena of public service offering up their services to run for office. It is not an easy task. They spend countless hours campaigning while missing time with their families, businesses and putting their lives on hold.
When the voters make the final decisions, we need to come together for the larger picture of November 3. I am confident we will rise to this goal. The 2016 election of Donald Trump is a true example of how uniting together can literally change a nation and state.
Join us on Tuesday, March 3 to begin our 2020 journey together so we can Keep America and Alabama great.
All election information (sample ballots, polling places, etc.) can be found at [[URL REDACTED]] and our candidate information is at [[URL REDACTED]]
Live elections results after 7:00 pm will be found at [[URL REDACTED]]

"Stand with President Trump
It's official! President Trump has accepted our party's nomination and the RNC Convention has come to a close, but now we will work even harder. Americans see the clear choice they will have to make this November. Standing in stark contrast, President Trump will fight for this country and continue our Great American Comeback, while bureaucrat of 45 years Joe Biden continues to camp out in the basement, won't do press conferences or meet with Americans. The Democrats are out-of-touch and want to take us in the wrong direction – they openly have declared it!
The finish line is close. We are less than 70 days away from the biggest Election Day in recent history. Can you help us in this fight? It is literally a fight and ANY amount helps! We will do the big everyday work preparing to support our President and our U.S. Senate nominee, Tommy Tuberville.
GIVE $250
GIVE $100
GIVE $50

We're in it to WIN- Help TODAY!
This November, voters will have a clear choice: continue our Great American Comeback or go down the Democrats' road of radical left policies -- socialism -- that can destroy our freedoms. Help us as we work daily to stop them!

Dear Republican Friend:
I wanted to pass along a great opportunity being offered by the Trump Campaign. They will be hosting a virtual Keep America Great briefing for the Southeastern states tomorrow afternoon (Tuesday, May 12th) at 3 p.m. CDT with special guests Donald Trump, Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle.
You can be part of this event by making a small ($100) donation to the campaign. The president is crushing fundraising records with small donor contributions. This is a way to help him as well be a part of a great conversation with Don, Jr. and Kimberly.
If you would like more details about the event or are interested in registering, click here. Information will be sent to your email.

"This is it, Republican Friend. Are you one of the 278 we need?
This is the LAST big deadline before the election.
We're short on time and to help all of our candidates. It's happening now\- door knocking, phone calls, signs being printed, mail, ballot security plans... If 278 of you chip in $20 today, we hit our third quarter goals for NOV 3!
Our objective as a Party is to turn out MORE Republicans & Independents to vote for our ticket than ever before to re-elect PRESIDENT TRUMP and send him a conservative U.S. Senator- Tommy Tuberville. We absolutely have to be united in this fight.
So I have a personal ask of you. Will you contribute $20 to chip away at this deficit? I am a volunteer who fundraises for our Party every week- for going on six years... we need you more than ever.
-> If you can help, please donate with this link >>
[[URL REDACTED]]
-> Regardless, will you follow us on Facebook to stay updated? >>
[[URL REDACTED]]
Our FEC fundraising deadline closes at midnight on Tuesday- DEBATE NIGHT! So there's not much time. If just 278 Republicans donated only $20 each \- we would hit our goal FAST!
Thank you for continuing to support our team, our candidates, and our mission. Our state needs us now and we will not give up until all votes are counted. Make history with us on November 3 by helping us today.
Help chip away at our goal
Keep America Great,

Dear Republican Friend:
If you're like me, you're tired of all the #FakeNews about President Trump and his administration. Just this Sunday, NBC's Meet the Press was forced to APOLOGIZE for doing a hatchet job on Attorney General Barr – editing a clip of him so BADLY that it took him completely OUT OF CONTEXT. It's time to stand up FOR President Trump and set the record straight to the American people.
Will you join us this weekend in supporting the President as part of his National Weekend of Action? It’s EASY but a huge help! From May 15th to 17th, volunteers will be making calls on behalf of the President, right from the comfort of their own homes. The campaign has put together an easy-to-follow tutorial – and you only need to do as many days as you are able. Just click here to sign up.
Let's KAG and show President Trump how much Alabama supports him. Sign up TODAY so we can make a difference this weekend. You matter – Alabama matters – America matters.

"Dear Friend of the Alabama Republican Party,
I am hoping this email finds you and your family in good health.
As you are aware, due to the COVID-19 pandemic the ALGOP primary run-off elections have been rescheduled for July 14th. Our candidates are focused on finding alternative ways to campaign while practicing social distancing and following the guidelines from our president and governor.
In order to help them, we are bringing back the ""Calling Alabama"" conference calls with myself and the candidates and with YOUR questions. This allows you to hear from our candidates – and the opportunity to hear them answer your questions – right from the comfort and safety of your home.
We will be hosting the U.S. Senate candidates the last week of April:
* Tuesday, April 28th at 5:30 to 6:30 p.m. – Senator Jeff Sessions
* Thursday, April 30th at 5:30 to 6:30 p.m. – Coach Tommy Tuberville
You can reserve your telephone spot and/or submit your questions now by clicking on the button with the link below. We will email you the secure call-in number the day before each call.
Please share this information with your friends and family.
I am looking forward to hosting these events for both campaigns. One of these two men WILL be the next U.S. Senator from the great state of Alabama.
It's Great to be a Republican!

Dear Republican Friend:
It's time to be counted. The 2020 Census is underway and it's crucial to our state for every one of us to take part. Starting today, invitations to fill out the on-line census questionnaire are being mailed out to every Alabama household. Please look for it in your mailbox and complete it as soon as possible. We are providing some important census facts below:
* The census was established by our Founding Fathers in Article 1, Section 2 of the Constitution. It is sent to every household in the U.S. every 10 years.
* Up to $13 billion in federal funding for Alabama is at stake. This is money used to improve our state's future: schools, roads, job opportunities, etc. We need an accurate census count to ensure these programs are able to continue.
* The census will also determine the number of congressional seats Alabama has. Unlike U.S. Senate seats – which always remain at two per state – congressional districts are reconfigured every 10 years based upon population growth and loss in each state. We need to make sure Alabama continues to have sufficient representation in Washington.
* This in turn will impact the number of electors we send to the Electoral College starting with the 2024 Presidential election. The number of electors in each state is equal to the size of its congressional delegation (U.S. Senators plus U.S. Representatives).
* The census contains only 10 simple questions and takes just 6 minutes of your time to complete.
For more information about the census, you can visit the official state website by clicking here.
We hope you'll do your part and participate in this year's census. Please ask your family and friends to do the same. Remember, Alabama is counting on you!

"May 5, 2020
Dear Republican Friend:
I wanted to share with you an Op-Ed that I wrote that was published in Yellowhammer News this morning. The Democrats are once again attempting to mandate national mail-in voting for all elections as part of the fourth COVID-19 bill being written in Congress. This would be disastrous for the reasons I outline in the article. I am hoping you will share it with your family and friends to let them know not to be fooled by this scheme. The article is directly below my signature block or you can read it on Yellowhammer's website by clicking here.
It’s Great to be a Republican,
Mrs. Terry M. Lathan
Chairman, Alabama Republican Party
Not Signed, Sealed and Delivered
Chairman Terry Lathan
Alabama Republican Party
Here they come…again — the Democrats rallying cry for a nationally imposed all mail-in ballot system. While their push to force every possible voter to receive a ballot in any election is not new, they have been reinvigorated for trying to implement this very dangerous scheme due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This viral threat is not a reason for the federal government to mandate national voting laws — especially seriously flawed ones.
Democrat Senators Elizabeth Warren, Amy Klobuchar and Ron Wyden have proposed the Natural Disaster and Emergency Ballot Act of 2020. This bill would allow all vote by mail elections while undoing state voter ID laws. The American Civil Liberties Union is suing states to remove an eyewitness signature. Courts are being asked to allow votes to be counted AFTER the election.
The Democrats are on a mission to destroy our time-tested system of voting in person by most Americans. They have apparently forgotten that our nation is a republic with the states making the decisions on their election laws and procedures.
There is overwhelming evidence that an all-mail voting election dictated from Washington, DC is not to be trusted. The headlines tell the story —the one that the Democrats always fail to share with us: 28 Million Mail-In Ballots Went Missing in Last Four Elections (RealClear Politics); Error and Fraud at Issue as Absentee Voting Rises (The New York Times); Brokers’ Exploit Absentee Voters; Elderly Are Top Targets for Fraud (The Wall Street Journal); Five States Face Federal Lawsuit Over Inaccurate Voter Registrations (RealClear Politics).
Multitudes of studies have warned of ballot harvesting (letting anyone handle, mark or take your ballot), voter mail fraud and inaccurate voter registration mailing lists. Anyone who says that this is not an issue and it doesn’t happen is simply ignoring the facts or doesn’t want to hear them. According to research by Judicial Watch’s Election Integrity Project in 2017, “Some 3.5 million more people are registered to vote in the U.S. than are alive among America’s adult citizens,” (Source: The National Review). The U.S. Election Assistance Commission and the Election Administration and Voting Surveys report roughly 16.4 million ballots mailed to registered voters went missing between the 2016-2018 elections – including the Trump-Clinton presidential matchup.
As noted in RealClear Politics, there have been 28 million mail in votes that vanished between 2012-2018. That’s 28 million Americans who were disenfranchised as their constitutional rights were denied. How is this the best practice for our democracy? It opens up a clear path to fraud and easily can question the integrity of elections.
Following the contentious Bush-Gore election in 2000, the bipartisan Carter Baker Commission on Federal Election Reform, chaired by former President Jimmy Carter and former Secretary of State James Baker, concluded that “Absentee ballots remain the largest source of potential voter fraud.” Rarely is it that I have agreed with Jimmy Carter on a policy, but here’s one where he is absolutely correct.
In the third April 2020 stimulus package for the COVID-19 crisis, what did the Democrats in the U.S. House do while Americans are losing their jobs and truly fearful for their families’ futures? Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats tried to insert their national mail-in scheme into the package. It was utterly outrageous and clearly showed us what their end game is — no ID, no accountability, no eyes on the ballots, no deadlines and no way to see who has what. One needs to ask — why are Democrats aggressively trying to water down safeguards of our democracy?
Democrats are not addressing the problems of fraud, missing ballots or a lack of accountability in our elections. They are trying to wrestle away the states’ rights on elections. They have no answers to these repeated issues, nor do they offer solutions for real problems.
If a state chooses to do all mail-in ballot elections, it is taking a great risk for all engaged citizens to be dutifully counted. History and data clearly validate these concerns — however, it is not Washington, DC’s place or responsibility to force states into an “one size fits all” voting mechanism.
There is a joy to voting in person with your fellow citizens. Watching your ballot being counted and walking out of your precinct secure in the knowledge that your vote matters is truly an American moment. It is the most powerful tool in a democracy and to verify it in real time is the fundamental foundation of our elections.
Any national all mail-in election ideas should be simply marked ‘Return to Sender’ to the Democrats and placed in a pile of junk mail.

"Republican Friend,
The ALGOP has partnered with the Alabama Federation of Republican Women to host U.S. Senator Marsha Blackburn (R-Tennessee) this Monday, September 14th at 5 p.m. This is a free Zoom event, but you must RSVP at the following link: [[URL REDACTED]] The Zoom link will be sent out to all confirmed guests on Monday morning prior to the event.
Senator Blackburn is the author of a new book, 'The Mind of a Conservative Woman: Seeking the Best for Family and Country'. In it, she challenges women to improve their place in life and open doors for themselves and the next generation through the courage of their convictions. Senator Blackburn expounds upon why beliefs labeled as ""traditional"" have common ground and can improve all of society, such as:
* Protecting the next generation, the family, and the freedom of faith and values,
* Supporting a free market that rewards women who apply their talents and rise to great heights,
* Respecting the institutions in our nation to make change from the inside,
* Securing an effective government that will not overreach, and Honoring and respecting those who hold differing opinions.
Senator Blackburn is the first woman ever elected to the United States Senate from Tennessee. Before ascending to that role, she represented Tennessee's Seventh District in the United States Congress for sixteen years and served as a state senator for four years. She is known for her mastery of the political process, her fiery defense of her principles, and her wit. Senator Blackburn is a mother to two, a grandmother to two, and wife to her husband, Chuck, to whom she has been married for more than forty years.
I hope you'll be able to join us for Celebrating Conservative Women – A Conversation with U.S. Senator Marsha Blackburn.

"Republican Friend:
The Alabama Republican Party was highlighted by the Republican National Committee for our efforts to 'Fill the Seat' with SCOTUS Nominee Amy Coney Barrett with a live press conference asking Doug Jones to ""Do Your Job!"" and stop, once again, ignoring the majority of our state. See the RNC release below. We are grateful to the supporters who joined the press conference.
The Senate begins confirmation hearings on Monday and we must keep up the pressure on Senator Doug Jones to hear the voices of the majority of Alabamians. I encourage you to call his office and let him know you support President Trump's nominee. His Washington, DC office number is 202-224-4124. Please share this number on your social media and ask others to call as well.

RNC & Trump Campaign Take Supreme Court Fight Outside the Beltway with Nationwide
“Fill the Seat” Protests
As part of a multi-pronged operation to promote President Trump’s highly qualified Supreme Court nominee Judge Barrett and hold Democrats accountable for their hypocrisy on her confirmation, the RNC and Trump campaign are taking the fight directly to voters. In target states across the country, Trump Victory is holding dozens of “Fill the Seat” protests to demand that Democrat Senators do their jobs and fulfill their duty to the American people by meeting with Judge Barrett and evaluating her qualifications through a formal confirmation process. As support for Judge Barrett surges among independents and Democrats, the RNC and Trump campaign are placing pressure on Senate Democrats to answer to their constituents and vote to confirm President Trump’s nominee without delay.
From Nevada to Michigan to Wisconsin and more, Trump Victory is ensuring that Judge Barrett receives the evaluation she deserves and that President Trump’s exceptional nominee gets confirmed to the Supreme Court of the United States. With a full-throttled effort from now until Judge Barrett’s confirmation, Trump Victory will continue to expose Democrats’ partisanship, aggressively promote the qualifications of Judge Barrett, and use this issue to galvanize voters to the polls in November.

The Alabama Policy Institute has put together its comparison of the Democratic and Republican Party platforms. It's a fascinating factual comparison and a great reminder of the very substantial differences in policies principles. I've included an excerpt below with a link to the full report. I hope you will share it with like minded people to highlight the very clear differences between our parties that will be the battleground for our state and nation on November 3rd. Thank you to API Director of Policy Strategy, Phil Williams, for bringing this project to our attention.

To help voters this election year, the Alabama Policy Institute has put together a side-by-side comparison of the party platforms on issues ranging from abortion to gay marriage, taxes to immigration, gun control to the environment. We’ve organized it and put it together in one package that is easy to navigate and will, hopefully, help each reader decide how to vote on November 3rd (click here to find your polling place).
In all, our comparison includes 26 of the most important issues our nation faces. As a preview, two are shown below.

"Republican Friends,
As the hearings of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to fill the vacant seat on the Supreme Court begin, it is important to remind Senator Doug Jones of what Democrats have previously described as their “duty” and consider the nomination of Justice Amy Coney Barrett. Doug Jones wouldn't even meet with her and knee jerked announced he wouldn't vote for her either- the mother of 7 who drives a mini van with impeccable credentials. Sad- and embarrassing for our state as he sidelines Alabama.
Democrats are on record about the importance of moving forward with a Supreme Court nominee being confirmed. In 2016, Joe Biden stated: “This is not healthy and the Constitution, clearly by implication and I believe as a matter of fact, requires the Senate to do its duty. Vote.” Senate Minority Leader, Chuck Schumer, also agreed with Biden’s sentiment stating back in 2007: “To leave the Supreme Court vacant…in a divided time. This kind of obstructionism isn’t going to last.”
What's changed???
Bottom Line: Senate Democrats must be held accountable and consider President Trump’s nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett without delay.
Contact Doug Jones today: (202) 224-4124

"To our ALGOP friends,
I have a quick update to share with you.
As Chair, I have a responsibility to be honest with you. The COVID-19 crisis has interrupted some of our election activities and has critically slowed our fundraising. Without those critical funds, we have had to make some tough decisions to halt parts of our operation. Despite these unprecedented challenges, I’m proud of our staff’s ability to adapt by non stop working at home and remain focused as November 3 is still on the horizon.
Elections are still happening, and we still have an important job to do – beat Doug Jones and make sure President Trump is re-elected! As we recently saw, Doug Jones voted NO on a procedural vote to help our small business and unemployed Americans due to the virus situation-- a straight up Chuck Schumer move.
The elections are a little over 6 months away! We won't quit working to help Republicans win big in November, but we need your help to do it. With times being tough, I am asking 250 dedicated Alabama Republicans to chip in $20 or more, right now, to help provide us with critically needed resources.
>>>>>Are you able to help us today? Every dollar makes a difference -- and if you chip in $20 or more right now, we’ll throw in 2 FREE Trump stickers for you to display on your car.<<<<<<
CHIP IN $20 NOW
We’ve received donations of $2, $3 or $5 in the mail with sweet messages from dedicated Republicans who still want to help – no matter how small the contribution. What a blessing it is to have your support!
Now, more than ever, Alabama and the nation need strong Republican leadership. President Trump is leading us through this crisis, and we must have his back. He needs our support now-- we are not going to let him down. We are going to use everything we have to beat Doug Jones who keeps ignoring the majority of our state.
CHIP IN $20 NOW
It's Great to be a Republican, and KAG,

"Republican Friend,
The Alabama Policy Institute has put together its comparison of the Democratic and Republican Party platforms. It's a fascinating factual comparison and a great reminder of the very substantial differences in policies principles. I've included an excerpt below with a link to the full report. I hope you will share it with like minded people to highlight the very clear differences between our parties that will be the battleground for our state and nation on November 3rd. Thank you to API Director of Policy Strategy, Phil Williams, for bringing this project to our attention.
Focused to KAG,
Mrs. Terry M. Lathan
Chairman, ALGOP
To help voters this election year, the Alabama Policy Institute has put together a side-by-side comparison of the party platforms on issues ranging from abortion to gay marriage, taxes to immigration, gun control to the environment. We’ve organized it and put it together in one package that is easy to navigate and will, hopefully, help each reader decide how to vote on November 3rd (click here to find your polling place).
In all, our comparison includes 26 of the most important issues our nation faces. As a preview, two are shown below.
To compare these issues and more, click the button below.

"Republican Friend,
It's crunch time. With only days to go until the end of counting, Alabama's Census participation rate is below 80%. We need it to be above that threshold. If we don't get an accurate count, we stand to lose:
* Members of our Congressional Delegation – The number of U.S. Representatives for each state is re-calculated based on our population every 10 years. We could lose as many as two House seats if everyone isn't accounted for. Less voices on Capitol Hill for Alabama is not in our best interest.
* Electoral College Votes – The number of Presidential Electors is equal to the total number of members in our Congressional Delegation (number of U.S. Representatives + 2 U.S. Senators). If we lose House seats, we will also lose Electors which will effect future Presidential Elections. Again, less clout for Alabama.
* Federal Funding – Much of our federal aid is directly determined based on our state population. Without maximum participation, we stand to loose money – BILLIONS of our own Alabama tax payer dollars – for our communities, educational systems, healthcare and infrastructure.
I encourage all Alabamians who have not already completed the 10-question Census to do so either online at [[URL REDACTED]], by phone at 1-844-330-2020 or by traditional paper form before the counting ends on Wednesday, September 30th.
Please ask and encourage your family members, friends and associates to do the same. It only takes six minutes and will make a world of difference for Alabama's future.
Let’s speak up for Sweet Home Alabama by Wednesday, September 30th.

"Republican friends-
Last night we heard President Trump weave the beautiful story of America in one of the strongest State of the Union speeches ever delivered to our nation. America First is not just a slogan- it is action in motion. The results confirm that President Trump and Republican policies have catapulted our country into historic heights across all categories.
While the world watched Nancy Pelosi rip up the president’s speech, they also saw her mean spirited hatred. As she and the Democrats, including Senator Doug Jones, sat down pouting in anger at the great successes we heard, America cheered.
I urge you to look past her pettiness. Put your outrage in to action. Honor those who she ripped up by helping us help President Trump by beating Doug Jones.
