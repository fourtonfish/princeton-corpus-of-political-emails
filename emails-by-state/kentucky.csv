Dear Friend,
I’ve been involved with Kentucky politics for a long time, and I have to say that the job Gov. Andy Beshear is doing right now during a worldwide pandemic and the resulting economic fallout is remarkable. He’s doing everything he can to protect the lives and livelihoods of all Kentuckians.
And yet, Frankfort Republicans continue to politicize every move like it’s business as usual. Mind you, they aren’t offering their own solutions -- but they are happy to sue the governor and threaten to reduce his powers, while pursuing legislation ranging from the ridiculous to outright dangerous. It reminds me a lot of how Mitch McConnell runs the U.S. Senate.
That’s not what we need here in Kentucky. We have a Governor, a true leader, who cares about us and is trying his best to keep us safe. We don’t need a legislature intent on dividing us and distracting Kentuckians from the real challenges facing our Commonwealth. We need people going to Frankfort to work with Gov. Beshear.
So, if you are able, can you give $25 today to help elect people willing to go to Frankfort who want to work together and that will put our Commonwealth above partisanship?
If we can elect even a handful of fresh faces in Frankfort, I know we can change the tone. We need people who want to work across the aisle, people who will do what’s right for the people they represent and people who do not act out to try and impress party bosses in D.C.
Your donation will help the Kentucky Democratic Party elect people at the state representative and state senate level that will work with Gov. Beshear, not against him.
Can you donate today?

Dear Friend,
It’s truly unbelievable. In the middle of a state of emergency that has upended our commonwealth there are people out there trying to sue Governor Andy Beshear.
As Gov. Beshear reveals thoughtful, safe plans to slowly reopen Kentucky, Republicans are threatening to sue. As they have shown for weeks, Republicans would rather score political points with a small minority than work with the governor to help Kentuckians.
As the governor says, this should be a time when we’re all united as Americans against the coronavirus. But sadly, there are many Republican elected officials in Kentucky who don’t believe that. For the last several weeks they have shown repeatedly that they don’t know how to lead.
All of this bad behavior has made one thing clear -- Governor Beshear needs more help in Frankfort. He needs people willing to work with him, not engaging in partisan attacks for their own political purposes.
So, if you are able, can you give $25 today to help us elect people willing to go to Frankfort and support Gov. Beshear?
Things are hard right now for many of us, we know that, but there is an election in November, and we need to fight back.
We know not everything is perfect. But Governor Beshear is trying his best to keep Kentuckians safe, making sure they have financial support if unemployed and generally making our state the best it can be during this time.
We can’t say the same about the Republicans currently in Frankfort.
That’s why we need to make sure we elect people who are going to help Governor Beshear and help Kentuckians hit hardest by the pandemic. Andy needs your help.

Dear Friend,
We’ve got the perfect item for you to make a statement in 2020! Just Say Nyet to Moscow Mitch and Defeat Mitch face masks.
We know here in Kentucky, our response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been pretty good thanks to the leadership of Gov. Andy Beshear.
But the federal government’s response to this pandemic hasn’t been as good. And this November, we have the opportunity to send someone to Washington D.C. that will have a sole focus of helping Kentucky as we recover from the public health and economic fallout of this pandemic.
We need a leader in Washington that truly advocates for their home state rather than someone like Mitch McConnell who said Kentucky should be left to go bankrupt.
Your purchase of face masks or other merch helps fund our efforts to beat “Moscow Mitch” in November.
Can you help us continue our efforts and get a nice cloth face mask (or two) in return?

Dear Friend,
The news is overwhelming right now, but I wanted to take a moment to make sure you are aware of what happened in Frankfort last night.
While all of us are worried about our jobs, our communities and our businesses, Kentucky Republicans refused to pass legislation that would help Kentuckians during this COVID-19 crisis. SB 150 would help small businesses during this difficult time. The bill was a Republican bill with bipartisan support. It passed the State House unanimously.
Let me say this again: Republicans in the State Senate refused last night to pass an emergency COVID-19 bill that is desperately needed to help our small businesses. And now they are leaving Frankfort for a week.
It’s shameful and unacceptable.
As the governor says, we’re going to get through this pandemic. But only if we all do the right thing. Republicans would rather play politics than do the right thing, and they need to be held accountable.
I know this is a difficult and anxious time, but we have to keep fighting. So if you have the ability, please donate and help us remind voters this November what Kentucky Republicans are really about.
Can you give $25 today to send a message rejecting the Republican “priorities” in our time of need?
Right now Republicans are too busy passing Voter ID bills and other pet projects (despite driver’s license offices being closed). They are busy unveiling budgets that cut Medicaid and play games with teacher’s retirement.
It’s the type of Matt Bevin-style Republican “leadership” our commonwealth has rejected. Help us send the rest of these Bevin Republicans home in November.

Dear Friend,
Five months into a global pandemic and it’s at least one thing very clear: We need a lot more people like Andy Beshear in Frankfort.
Sadly, cloning technology isn’t available yet, so we’ll have to settle for Plan B: sending as many people willing to work with the governor as possible to both the State House and State Senate.
And, if you haven’t been following the news, that means kicking out the Republicans already there. Their behavior during this pandemic has been shameful, and it’s [[URL REDACTED]] can’t be trusted to lead.
Despite an indoor mask mandate, Frankfort Republicans are still without masks in committee meetings. Even after a GOP state senator tested positive last week, they still refused to wear masks. On top of that, Republican Attorney General Daniel Cameron is suing the governor for requiring masks -- despite more than 20 other states requiring them too.
All of this bad behavior has made one thing clear -- Governor Beshear needs more help in Frankfort. He needs people willing to work with him, not engaging in partisan attacks for their own political purposes.
So, if you are able, can you give $25 today to help us elect people willing to go to Frankfort and support Gov. Beshear?

Dear Friend,
When I ran for governor, one of the things I told the people of Kentucky was that we needed to all be on Team Kentucky together. It’s something I still say in some form or fashion nearly everyday when we hold our press conferences relating to COVID-19.
Whether it’s being on Team Kentucky or saying we’re going to get through this together -- the idea is the same. Regardless of political party, we need to work together to help each other.
That’s the exact mindset I took into conversations with Republican Secretary of State Michael Adams in discussing voting plans for both the primary and general elections. Now for the second time, we have a great plan that will allow people to vote safely.
Sadly, some office holders are unwilling to prioritize the people of Kentucky over politics. The Republican Attorney General and Agriculture Commissioner are actively suing me even though it will make all of us less safe. And Republican leaders in the legislature are using interim committee hearings to launch political attacks against me and my administration
I said in 2019 we needed a change in tone in Frankfort. Apparently that’s going to require sending new leaders there to work together and get things done.
So, if you are able, can you give $25 today to help elect people willing to go to Frankfort that will put our commonwealth over partisanship?
If we can put even a handful of fresh faces in Frankfort, I know we can change the tone. We need people who want to work across the aisle, people who will do what’s right for the people they represent and people who do not act out to try and impress party bosses in D.C.

Dear Friend,
I know you’re getting a lot of email regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. But I wanted to make sure you hear from me about how it’s affecting our party operations.
Our biggest announcement is that the Kentucky Democratic Party is suspending its planned 2020 reorganization efforts until further notice due to recommendations from Gov. Andy Beshear and the CDC.
The reorganization effort, which typically takes place every four years during a presidential election, was set to start this Saturday, March 21 with Precinct Conventions. Both the precinct conventions and the county/legislative district conventions on April 18 are suspended.
The reorganization process helps build infrastructure in all 120 Kentucky counties and elects members to the governing body of the party, the State Central Executive Committee.
The suspension was approved unanimously by the party’s State Central Executive Committee on Saturday. It does not currently affect the process to elect delegates to the Democratic National Convention, scheduled to be held this summer.
We know many of you were looking forward to becoming a precinct or county level member of our party structure. If you want specific updates about the restarting of our reorganization, whenever that is, you can sign up here to receive them.
Also, we’re following the governor’s guidance by having employees work from home and limiting access to our building. But you can still reach us via phone (502) 695-4828 or email.
We know this is going to be a tough time, but we will all get through it.

In case you haven’t heard, the deadline to request an absentee ballot by mail is TODAY. Request your ballot here.
The portal to request a ballot will close tonight at 11:59 p.m. eastern. After today, you’ll only be able to vote in-person wherever your county has set up early voting or on November 3, Election Day.
This is the first time we have had widespread voting by mail in a general election. Let’s take advantage of it. Request your ballot now.

Dear Friend,
For the first time in 10 years, a Kentucky Democrat flipped a strong GOP seat. Dr. Karen Berg won the Louisville suburbs and deeply red Oldham County easily -- a seat that favored Donald Trump by 10 points in 2016!
It shows that Kentuckians in urban, suburban and rural areas are tired of the divisiveness of the Kentucky Republican Party. They want people who are focused on real solutions to our problems.
They want people who WORK WITH Gov. Andy Beshear to help our commonwealth.
That means we need to flip many more seats in November. We have the energy and momentum. Now we need your help to have the resources to break the Republican hold on the state legislature.
If you are able, can you give $25 today to help us break the GOP majorities in November?
This pandemic has presented new challenges our state couldn’t have imagined. It needs strong leaders who want to work together to solve those challenges.

Dear Friend,
After seeing record turnout in our primary, it’s clear Kentucky Democrats are fired up and ready to retire Mitch McConnell in November.
Thanks to Gov. Andy Beshear’s push for absentee voting by mail due to the pandemic, Kentucky Democrats voted in higher than expected numbers all over the state. And while we are still waiting for confirmation on our nominee, Mitch McConnell has the luxury of being the Republican nominee already.
Democrats have outraised McConnell for the last few cycles. But we can’t sit on our hands and let him take advantage.
If you are able, can you give $25 today to continue to support our efforts to defeat Mitch McConnell?
Mitch has never faced a race in which he’s being outraised and his lies are being exposed to Kentucky voters on a weekly basis.
Your support so far has helped us accomplish these goals. But if we let up now, we’ll lose momentum. New polling shows Kentucky is ready for a new Democratic senator. Will you help us make that a reality?

Dear Friend,
It’s official!
After four long years, a Kentucky Democrat is back in the governor’s office, and ready to restore decency and civility to the Governor’s Mansion.
Congratulations to our new Governor, Andy Beshear!
No more name-calling. No more bullying. The people’s house is once again open to everyone. It was a beautiful sight to see.
As 2019 comes to a close, Kentuckians can be proud to have a new governor in Andy Beshear who truly cares about his constituents and treats them with respect.
There is much work to be done in 2020 to make sure the people of Kentucky are represented in the statehouse and in Washington DC by the kind of leaders who will step up and fight for us. But for now, I think we can all take a moment to enjoy, and be proud of, the homecoming for Kentucky Democrats.

Dear Friend,
If you’ve paid attention to the news, the last few months have shown just how terrible Matt Bevin was as a governor.
We always knew he was bad -- but the Kentucky GOP not only let him get away with it, they supported him every step of the way. And now, the Republicans in the state legislature -- the Bevin Republicans -- want to continue his agenda even though voters rejected it in 2019. It’s time to hold them accountable.
We have to make sure to send as many Bevin Republicans home in November as possible.
Can you give $25 today to help us beat the remaining Bevin Republicans?
These Bevin Republicans in the state legislature stood side by side with Bevin his entire four years. They endorsed him and supported his agenda.
They can’t change those facts now that everyone sees just how terrible Bevin is. Help us hold the Bevin Republicans accountable.

Dear Friend,
Are you mad that schools across the country are having to start virtually again, while schools in other countries safely re-open to in-person instruction?
Are you mad that your favorite college football team may not play this year?
Are you mad that your favorite concert, festival and nearly every major and minor outdoor event is canceled?
Blame Mitch McConnell.
There are a litany of reasons why McConnell is to blame. He’s been slow to act. He’s too fearful of Trump to seem out of step with him. He’s not personally affected, since he’s still getting paid and the stock market is doing well.
But most importantly, it’s just the latest example that Mitch McConnell isn’t interested in helping Kentuckians or Americans at all. He’s in it for himself.
If you are able, can you give $25 today to continue to support our efforts to defeat Mitch McConnell?
If McConnell did his job, America might be in a position for in-person instruction. He has refused to continue federal assistance for working families, and let’s not forget he wanted to let states go bankrupt. He’s delayed every single relief bill to date and continues to delay even more legislation right now.
We have to make sure he doesn’t get another six years in the Senate.

Dear Friend,
I have to admit, campaigning in 2020 has looked much different than I imagined.
I knew trying to beat Mitch McConnell this November would be hard -- I just couldn’t imagine a worldwide pandemic throwing everything into question. So instead of big public voter registration drives, Kentucky Democrats had to come up with something else.
We’ve identified nearly 80,000 Democratic voters who had outdated information or have moved from other states and not registered in Kentucky yet. We’ve built an interactive map of all 120 counties and with your support we can contact them with information on registering to vote in Kentucky.
For $5, we can register 2 of these voters.
For $25 we can register 10 new voters.
For $50, we can register 20 voters.
In fact, with our interactive map, you can dig all the way down to your specific precinct to help us register your own neighbors!
For the last few election cycles, we’ve had several close races. In 2019, Gov. Beshear won by roughly 5,000 votes. In 2018, we had several state legislative candidates win by 20 votes or less. This November, Democratic candidates' victory could literally hinge on 1 vote.
Help us register that one voter who could mean the difference between victory and defeat.

Dear Friend,
When I became governor last year, I had a lot of ideas of what I wanted to accomplish. I wanted to invest in our schools and our teachers, I wanted to change the tone for the better in Frankfort and I wanted to make sure we protected health care for hundreds of thousands of Kentuckians.
These are still some of my goals and we’re still working to accomplish them. We recently restarted the Kynect marketplace to help people get insurance coverage they need to be healthy. I’ve worked with the Republican Secretary of State to make voting easy and safe. And we’re working hard with our teachers and our schools to make sure learning can still occur during a worldwide pandemic.
We may be adapting our lives due to COVID-19, but I believe we can continue to build a better commonwealth for ourselves and our communities.
Sadly, not everyone in Frankfort shares those same goals. They want to sue me so that we have no protections against COVID-19 at all. They don’t want to honor our constitution and the separation of powers in our government; they just want to hoard power for themselves. And they definitely don’t want to be accountable to people of Kentucky.
I said in 2019 we needed a change in tone in Frankfort. Apparently that’s going to require sending new leaders there to work together and get things done.
So, if you are able, can you give $25 today to help elect people willing to go to Frankfort that will put our commonwealth over partisanship?
With your help, we can put people in Frankfort who share our goals and are willing to work to build our commonwealth into something even better than it is today.

Dear Friend,
Recently, Moscow Mitch finally admitted that the U.S. House is running laps around him when it comes to passing legislation. In fact, more than 300 bipartisan bills are wasting away in the Senate while McConnell sits and twiddles his thumbs.
Rather than doing his job and putting these bills through the legislative process in the Senate, Mitch wants to act as if he’s blocking partisan legislation.
Only Moscow Mitch would try to say the ideas of equal pay for equal work, securing our elections from foreign interference and lowering prescription drug pricing are partisan. And don’t even start on how re-authorization of the Violence Against Women Act can even be remotely viewed as anything but common sense.
In fact, they’re bipartisan pieces of legislation -- and the only reason Mitch won’t pass them is for his own selfish, partisan reasons.
It’s time to get the Senate back up and working again.
Can you give $25 today to defeat Moscow Mitch so the U.S. Senate can function again?
There’s always debate over legislation -- but to completely bring the Senate to a halt is inexcusable.

Let’s be honest. Kentucky’s senators have been especially embarrassing lately. Seriously, it’s so bad, the chief justice won’t even read Paul’s pitiful questions during the impeachment trial.
And Moscow Mitch is earning his nickname more with each passing day.
Their relationship may have started off rocky, but make no mistake, Moscow Mitch and Rand Paul are on the same page now -- it’s just not one focused on Kentuckians. In honor of their newfound partnership, we decided to poke a little fun at them, while providing a way for you to help us fight back against our terrible senators.

Dear Friend,
Just this week, Gov. Andy Beshear sounded a pretty big alarm about COVID-19 and our fight to keep Kentuckians safe.
Gov. Beshear warned that we have to recommit our urgency to defeat this virus to combat an escalation in cases. The Republican legislature’s response was to recommit to stripping responsibility from the governor and giving it to themselves.
The same group of people who hold indoor fundraisers with no masks and doubt the COVID-19 numbers from the Department of Public Health want to control our COVID-19 response. Seriously.
It’s the type of partisan power grab we’ve seen in places like North Carolina and Wisconsin. Even in a pandemic, Republican legislative leaders are only focused on their own power, not the lives and safety of Kentuckians.
So, if you are able, can you give $25 today to help elect people willing to go to Frankfort that will put our commonwealth over partisanship?
If the legislature can’t even accept the settled science, how can we trust them to make the right decisions when it comes to public safety? If they don’t trust the respected doctors and epidemiologists at the Department of Public Health, who will they trust to make decisions about COVID-19.
This is the same legislature that passes important bills to fund our schools and roads late at night when everyone’s asleep and stuff bills full of terrible proposals at the last minute with no public input.
We can’t trust them to do the right thing for our commonwealth. We can’t let them try and strip power from Gov. Beshear. With your help, we will send people to Frankfort that believe in science and want to work with Gov. Beshear and our public health experts.

If you’re getting this email, it’s because you signed our card thanking Gov. Andy Beshear for his leadership during this COVID-19 pandemic.
As the governor says, this should be a time when we’re all united as Americans against the coronavirus. But sadly, there are many Republican elected officials in Kentucky who don’t believe that.
Instead of lending support to the governor and our medical professionals, they’ve treated this week as an opportunity to score political points, trying to trash Governor Andy Beshear while boosting themselves.
They’ve been dishonest with the public, and are putting all of us at risk. Republican legislators in Frankfort even went so far this week as to try to limit Governor Beshear’s ability to respond to the COVID-19 public health emergency.
All of this bad behavior has made one thing clear -- Governor Beshear needs more help in Frankfort. He needs people willing to work with him, not engage in partisan attacks for their own political purposes.

Things are hard right now for many of us, we know that, but there is an election in November and we need to fight back.

Dear Friend,
Moscow Mitch has done it again-- turned his back on the American people in order to protect his own personal power. It’s disgusting, and we must hold him accountable.
Friday night, Mitch succeeded in his grand plan to end the impeachment trial with no witnesses for the first time in history. Mitch wants the voters to decide the fate of the Republican Party this November, but he doesn’t want the public to know the truth when they make that decision.
We’ve seen this playbook before -- 4 years ago -- and now that we know what it looks like, it’s time to make our voices heard LOUD AND CLEAR.
Donate $20.20 NOW to send a message to Moscow Mitch -- your time is up.
It’s time to send these Republicans packing -- especially Mitch McConnell. 75% of the American public indicated they wanted to hear from witnesses in the Senate but Moscow Mitch made sure that didn’t happen.
We can’t let him return to the Senate -- he’s too compromised.

Dear Friend,
I wanted to take a minute and tell you about something shocking that happened today in Frankfort. Our new Republican Secretary of State, Michael Adams (a McConnell minion) revealed his true reason for pushing a restrictive Voter ID Bill this year:
Moscow Mitch is up for re-election.
That’s right. When asked why the bill was necessary for November 2020 instead of implementing in 2021, Adams revealed the true reason for the bill. He told the committee specifically that the reason for wanting the bill this year is “a very competitive Senate seat.”
It’s the “break glass in case of emergency” Moscow Mitch protection plan. They know he’s unpopular. They know he’s in trouble. So they want to make voting harder.
We need your help to fight back.
There is no line Mitch McConnell won’t cross in pursuit of his own crass political power. He will lie, he will twist, he will break every rule to get his way. We’ve seen it happen week after week in DC and now we’re seeing it happen when it comes to legislation in Frankfort too.
We have no other option but to organize like never before to hold Moscow Mitch accountable.
Can you give $25 today to defeat Moscow Mitch?
It’s funny. After four years of complete control of state government, Republicans never thought to seriously push a new law to restrict voting. But now, after Bevin’s loss and with Moscow Mitch in serious trouble, it’s a “priority bill.”

Dear Friend,
First off, I want to thank you for your support.
It has been a challenging year, one that none of us could have expected. But by and large, Kentuckians have been strong and resilient. I wish I could say the same about all of our leaders in Frankfort.
I’ve been stunned by some of the behavior I’ve seen from some of our elected leaders in Frankfort. As recently as last week, they were still trying to find ways to attack and divide our commonwealth. It’s just overt, petty politics and it does nothing to move our commonwealth forward during a worldwide pandemic.
With your help, we rejected that type of divisiveness last year. But I’m emailing you to tell you we have more work to do. We need new leaders in Frankfort that will work together and get things done.
So, if you are able, can you give $25 today to help elect people willing to go to Frankfort that will put our commonwealth over partisanship?
There are good people all over our commonwealth who want to come to Frankfort and serve. They are educators, community leaders, veterans, and more. They represent everything we need to move Kentucky forward.
But the same people who sit in Frankfort and attack me and try to divide us have been attacking these people too. We don’t have much time to respond, but with your help we can set the record straight before it’s too late.
I’m counting on you -- will you donate today to help send some good people to Frankfort this November to work with me as we continue to fight the greatest challenge of our lifetime?

Dear Friend,
If you thought the attacks on teachers ended when Gov. Andy Beshear defeated Matt Bevin, guess again.
This week, the official social media accounts for the entire Republican Party of Kentucky made a gross attack on our Kentucky teachers, accusing them of promoting “anti-American greatness” and politicizing school districts choosing to start with virtual learning during a worldwide pandemic.
It’s clear -- Matt Bevin wasn’t an outlier. He represented everything that Kentucky Republicans stand for and they let him be the mouthpiece while he was in office. We don’t need this in Frankfort.
We need the change in tone and the caring that Gov. Andy Beshear has brought to the governor’s office to come to the General Assembly as well.
So, if you are able, can you give $25 today to help elect people willing to go to Frankfort that want to work together and that will put our commonwealth over partisanship?
Our teachers have been working hard. They are adapting lessons on the fly, making sure their students are fed everyday and that families are staying safe. Attacking them right now is disgusting.
And yet, the KY GOP still did it. Let’s send a message that these types of attacks are unacceptable.

Dear Friend,
Normally, the staff here at the Kentucky Democratic Party would be heading towards Fancy Farm, Kentucky for the annual political speaking there right about now. Of course, these aren’t normal times.
We’re less than 100 days away from the November 3 election, but honestly, it doesn’t quite feel that way like it usually does. So we got to thinking… What can we do to spark some excitement for people during these tough times? Our answer: new merch!
So we’ve released new merch every single day this week. Are you riding with Joe Biden this November? We’ve got a shirt for you.
Since 2007, Congressman John Yarmuth has been doing an awesome job representing Kentucky’s 3rd Congressional District. We’re so excited for him to be re-elected, once again, that we launched a whole bunch of merch for “Congressman Awesome.”
Gov. Andy Beshear has made one thing clear -- he cares about us. And he’s going to put politics aside to protect Kentuckians, even if the Kentucky GOP won’t. Throughout this pandemic, Gov. Beshear has been a steady hand for us to rely on during what he calls a war against coronavirus. So let’s remind our fellow Kentuckians to “Keep Calm and Trust Beshear.”
Amy McGrath has stepped up and taken on our biggest challenge here in Kentucky -- ending the 34-plus-year reign of terror Moscow Mitch has put us through. We know Kentuckians are ready for new leadership with Amy and we’re rocking our new merch to prove it.
Your purchases of merch will help us fund the infrastructure it requires to win in November. And you have the added benefit of letting the world know that you support our great Democratic candidates.
ORDER NOW
Sincerely,
