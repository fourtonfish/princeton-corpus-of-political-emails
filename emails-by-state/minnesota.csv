Alex,
If you're watching tonight's debate, you're seeing Trump do what he always does: Whine, lie, and try to sow fear and division between Americans to distract us from his failures.
But you're also witnessing hope. We're seeing what it would be like to restore dignity and decency to the White House by electing Joe Biden as our next President.
The choice before us truly couldn't be more clear, but our work is far from over. A new poll released this week shows that Minnesota's Presidential race has narrowed to just FIVE POINTS.
If you don't want four more years of President Trump, please rush a contribution to help us finish strong. Your support tonight will directly fund the organizers, activists, advertisements, and get-out-the-vote efforts it will take to bring this thing home.

Let’s push hard in these final days to defend our Minnesota values, together.

Alex,
We know that Trump and Republicans are out of touch with Minnesotans, so they can't talk about the issues. That's why they're willing to attack the integrity of our elections in order to win. We've seen them file dozens of lawsuits here in Minnesota and across the country in an attempt to make it as difficult as possible for voters to cast their ballot.
Luckily, the DFL Voter Protection team is fighting back by building one of the largest programs in Minnesota history. But we need your help. Our Voter Protection team still needs hundreds of volunteers for our Election Day program to ensure every eligible Minnesotan can cast their ballot and their ballot counts. This work matters.
Click here to help the DFL protect the vote >>>
Once you sign up, the DFL Voter Protection team will contact you to tell you about a number of trainings scheduled between now and Election Day, and we will provide you with all the resources you need to protect the vote.
If you've done this work in the past, the DFL needs you again this year. If you've never done this work, there's no better time to start than an election administered during a global pandemic against somebody like Donald Trump.
Please sign-up TODAY to help ensure that every voice counts on November 3.

Alex,
We can be 100% sure the Trump campaign will pull every trick in the book to flip Minnesota red this year. They know that Democrats will have almost no chance of taking back the White House if they do.
The pressure is on. And with just over one week to go until Democrats from across the country come together to make our Presidential ticket official, it’s never been more critical to make sure our priorities are aligned.
To ensure we’re on the right track in the home stretch of this election, we’re reaching out once more to get your input. Will you take our FINAL 2020 Strategy Survey today? Your responses will be confidential.
START SURVEY »
We only have one shot at getting this right, and Minnesota is a must-win state for Democrats this November.
Your input is invaluable to our organizers who are having hundreds of conversations every week, training volunteers, setting up virtual phone backs, reaching out to Minnesotans online, and more.
Please, take a moment to complete our FINAL 2020 Strategy Survey today so we can put our best foot forward in the closing months of this campaign.

Thank you,

Alex,
I’m making phone calls to get out the vote and I want you to join me.
I never considered myself “political” until one day when I was volunteering at my kids’ school. I looked down at my phone and across the country in Washington State there had been a school shooting. I thought, “That could have been me, that could have been us.” I knew I had to make a difference, so I started getting involved with gun violence prevention groups. Learning about the Republican politicians who were afraid to stand up for our families got me fired up about other issues, and pretty soon I was writing letters, going to rallies, and posting about politics on social media all the time.
Fast forward a few years, and my kids are now in college. My 18-year-old daughter just mailed her ballot for the first time. I was so proud to walk her through the process and to know that she could vote for leaders who will lead with compassion and integrity like Tina Smith, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. I want that for all our kids.
That’s why for the first time I’m making calls to DFL voters making sure they cast their votes by Election Day. I’ve never been involved this way before, but I know we have to do everything we can to ensure our children have a future filled with possibilities and progress instead of the divisiveness and hate that we’ve seen these past four years. Will you join me?
We only have 6 more days until the polls close on Election Day. If you’re like me and you’ve never called voters before, now is the time to start. The DFL has trainings all this week and they’ll set us up with everything we need to get started. Let’s do this together!
Hope to see you there!

"Alex, Will you help us contact other DFLers to make sure they get out to vote? I still remember the feeling of my first election night. It was 2006.

Alex,
Will you help us contact other DFLers to make sure they get out to vote?
I still remember the feeling of my first election night. It was 2006. I was a field organizer in our Rochester office and we had just elected Amy Klobuchar to her first term in the Senate and (now Governor) Tim Walz to Congress. I was so full of joy, not only because we had elected great leaders who would represent Minnesota with integrity and compassion but because I knew that my efforts and those of our fantastic volunteers had resulted in real, meaningful change. It was the most empowering feeling in the world.
I want that feeling again, this November 3rd and I want you to have it too. Can we count on you to help us get out the vote during these critical last 13 days?
Studies show that conversations with voters within 10 days of an election can increase turnout by up to 5% -- and in so many races in Minnesota, 5% is the ballgame. In 2016 Hillary Clinton narrowly carried our state by less than 2%. This election can be won or lost by the number of conversations we have with voters, that’s why we need your help.
I remember another election night too - November 8th 2016. We were heartbroken and scared and we wondered what more we could have done. I never want to feel that way again. From now through election day, I’m committed to talking to as many voters as possible to defeat Donald Trump and elect DFL candidates up and down the ballot. Will you join me?
We have phonebanks running every single day and other ways to get involved too! Sign up now.
Thank you for everything you’re doing to bring us over the finish line.
I can’t wait to see you there!

Alex,
On this Sunday, July 26th, we will be exactly 100 days out from the most important election of our lives.
The home stretch of this campaign will be unlike any other in Minnesota history. The Trump campaign has booked $14.1 million in ads here through Election Day – the fifth largest advertising investment in any state in the entire country.
It’s clear they intend to follow through on their pledge to pour $30 million into our state by Election Day, and that doesn’t even include the astronomical sums of money Trump’s right-wing super PAC allies will dump in on top of it.
Thankfully, we’ve been building for this moment since the day he was sworn into office. We have the team. We have the plan. And we know our state better than Trump ever will. We just need to keep our budget on track to bring it home.
To make up for the ground we lost earlier this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we are launching a goal of raising $100,000 by the 100 days out mark on Sunday night. It’s an ambitious target, but with so much at stake in November, we can’t settle for anything less.
Will you take advantage of your PCR and make a REFUNDABLE $50 DONATION to help us keep Minnesota blue and make Donald Trump a one-term President?

Hi Alex,
There’s a lot going on this week, but I wanted to take a minute to reach out and introduce myself. My name is Abby Medberry, and I’m the DFL’s finance intern for this fall, helping with fundraising for the 2020 elections.
I’m a sophomore at the University of Minnesota, and I’m studying many different subjects that I love. But I’ve been truly passionate about politics ever since I was in high school. I’m so excited to have this opportunity to learn more about how our party works and to help elect DFLers who reflect my values in Minnesota.
I don’t know what I want to do when I graduate yet, but I do know what kind of future I want to live in, and it’s not the kind of future that Donald Trump and Minnesota Republicans have in mind.
I’ve only been in this position for a few weeks, but Donald Trump is already coming back to Minnesota again this Friday. Since August, that’s his second visit, not to mention recent visits from Mike Pence, Ivanka Trump, and Donald Trump Jr.
One of the things I’ve learned already as a finance intern is just how essential our grassroots supporter network is to fund the organizing operation that it will take to win up and down the ballot this fall.
Tyler just walked me through the data from the last few days, and we’re still way behind on our donor goal for this week. That’s why, even with all the work going on to prepare for Trump’s visit this Friday, I wanted to do my part to reach out to you personally today.
We’re trying to reach 500 new contributions through Minnesota’s Political Contribution Refund (PCR) program by tomorrow. With it, you can donate up to $50 (or $100 per couple), and you get a full refund from the state of Minnesota.
To hit our target, we still need 271 more Minnesotans to step up. If you’re able, please make a FULLY REFUNDABLE contribution of $50 before Trump comes back to Minnesota tomorrow.

Hi Alex,
I hope you’re staying safe and healthy. I wanted to take a moment to check-in. I haven’t reached out personally since we dramatically reorganized our operation and I wanted to say thank you.
We’ve seen a surge of support online over the past several weeks, and I can’t even begin to tell you how much it’s meant to our entire team. This is a challenging, unpredictable time, but the kind words, contributions, and messages of encouragement have reminded all of us how strong this DFL family truly is.
It’s also clear that Democrats everywhere know exactly how important Minnesota is this fall, and how essential it is that we’re able to persevere through these difficult circumstances. We’re monitoring our budget extra closely, and halfway through the month, I wanted to give you an update. If we raise $3,100 online by tomorrow night, we’ll be on pace to hit our revised goal for April.
With Minnesota’s Political Contribution Refund (PCR) program, you can donate $50 (or $100 per couple) to support the Minnesota DFL through this critical time, and you will receive a FULL REFUND from the State of Minnesota.

If we’re going to take back the White House in November, Minnesota is a must-win state for Democrats. It’s that simple. And we have a fresh example every day of why it’s so important that we’re successful.
Things are tough, but we remain hopeful. As long as we stick together, we will end the chaos of the Trump administration. We will take back our majority in the Minnesota Senate and increase our majority in the Minnesota House to support Governor Tim Walz. We will re-elect Senator Tina Smith and send a full Congressional delegation to Washington.
If you’re able, please make a contribution that works for you so we can keep Minnesota blue this November, no matter what comes our way.

However, if you are able, please consider making a contribution that works for you today. Our first end-of-quarter deadline of the year is coming up at midnight and we could use your help.

Alex,
We’ve revised our budget as best we can to adjust to the losses we’re projecting in the coming months. I won’t sugar coat it, it’s not going to be easy. Our biggest fundraiser of the year has been postponed – an event that typically makes up the lion’s share of our operating budget.
There’s no doubt in my mind that we’ll make up the shortfall once we come through this, but the reality is we’re going to need to dig deep in the meantime to keep the lights on.
Our first end-of-quarter deadline of the year is coming up at midnight tomorrow and we still need to raise $5,200 by then to meet our immediate budget obligations.
Remember, you can donate $50 (or $100 per couple) to support the Minnesota DFL during this critical time and receive a FULL REFUND thanks to Minnesota’s Political Contribution Refund (PCR) program.

Whether we’re ready for it or not, there's still going to be an election this November and Minnesota is still going to be a must-win state for Democrats.
Our entire team is working harder than ever to adapt because we all know exactly what’s at stake. But at the end of the day, the fact is we can’t do this alone.
Please, make a contribution that works for you by MIDNIGHT TOMORROW to help us protect our Minnesota House DFL Majority, take back the Minnesota Senate, send a full DFL congressional delegation to Washington, re-elect Senator Tina Smith, and keep Minnesota blue in November.
Thank you,

Alex,
It’s hard to believe, but we’re exactly TWO WEEKS out from Election Day.
One of the most challenging parts of campaigning this year has been overhauling our spending to account for early voting. Over 1 million (!) Minnesotans have already cast their ballots, and even more will be making their voices heard over the next 14 days.
GOTV is happening right now. We can’t afford to push back any of our spending this year, and weekly recurring contributions have been vital to our cash flow, which is why I’m asking one more time this year. Your $5, $10, $25 or more today and on Election Day will help us get more of our folks to the polls (or voting by mail!).
Will you start a weekly recurring contribution to chip in today AND on Election Day so we can be firing on all cylinders until the polls close?

"Alex, Tomorrow, we’ll be exactly 100 days out from the most important election of our lifetime and Minnesota is one of the key battleground states.

Alex,
Tomorrow, we’ll be exactly 100 days out from the most important election of our lifetime and Minnesota is one of the key battleground states.
The Trump campaign has booked $14.1 million in ads here already and it’s clear they intend to follow through on their plan to spend $30 million by Election Day.
Donald Trump knows that if he succeeds in flipping our state red, he will almost certainly get re-elected. Minnesota Republicans up and down the ballot realize it too and they’re counting on riding his coattails to victory.
The Minnesota DFL is leading the statewide effort to make sure that doesn’t happen. But we need to make sure they hit their $100,000 target by tomorrow night so they can get the job done -- and they still have a lot of ground to make up.
If you’re able, please join me in supporting the DFL today. Make a contribution of $10, $25, $50 or more so they can close the gap and keep Minnesota blue this November.

Alex,
At Trump’s failed rally on Saturday, we gained some insight into the Senate Republicans’ decision to abandon Minnesotans during the special session last week.
It’s clear that even with his sinking poll numbers, Trump is confident he can win Minnesota and the Senate Republicans believe him. They think they can sit back, relax, and ride his coattails to victory.
They couldn't be more wrong. Help us hit our $10,000 goal by midnight so we can prove it and expand our legislative organizing program

Alex,
As the state with the only divided legislature in the nation, we had the opportunity to prove that Minnesotans can rise above partisanship and do what’s right for George Floyd, the Black community, and communities of color across our state.
Unfortunately, Paul Gazelka and Senate Republicans have abandoned their responsibility to fix our broken policing system and refused to work with DFL Party lawmakers to enact real and meaningful change.
Early this morning, they left town before the job was done, shutting out the cries for reform emanating from across Minnesota and demonstrating a complete unwillingness to make divided government work.
It’s not enough anymore for Republicans to just be the party that says no to every proposal that comes before them. They had the opportunity to rise to the occasion, and with the world watching, they failed, proving to Minnesotans once again that they are unfit to lead.
We cannot leave anything to chance. To ensure that we take back the Minnesota Senate this November, we are immediately expanding our legislative organizing program.
To cover the additional staffing and digital organizing costs we need to raise $10,000 by midnight on Monday.
With Minnesota’s Political Contribution Refund (PCR) program, you can donate $50 (or $100 per couple) to help us get there, and you will receive a full refund from the State of Minnesota.

FIVETHIRTYEIGHT: Minnesota “could be the next midwestern state to go red”
POLITICO: “Minnesota, which once looked like a vanity project for Donald Trump, is suddenly emerging as a critical test of his effort to turn his campaign around.”
Alex,
A BREAKING polling analysis from FiveThirtyEight now shows Minnesota as one of the “likeliest states to be the Electoral College tipping point — the state that delivers the next president his decisive 270th electoral vote.”
We’ve been saying this for YEARS, and the national press is finally catching on. Minnesota will be the deciding factor this November. If we don’t hold the line here, Trump gets re-elected. It’s that simple. And now that the secret is out, the Trump campaign is going to be targeting us even more relentlessly than they already were.
With less than 63 days to go to Election Day, we have no time to waste. We are expanding our ENTIRE statewide program immediately. Our best estimate says we need to raise at least $35,000 by the end of the week to keep our budget intact.
If you can, please make a contribution of $10, $25, $50 or more right away to help us fight back and keep Minnesota blue!

Alex,
I wanted to check in before tonight’s debate, which will be kicking off in just a few minutes here.
No matter who ends up at the top of the ticket, I want to underscore that Minnesota is a must-win state for Democrats this November. The fact is, we simply cannot wait until there is a nominee to begin building the infrastructure necessary to win back the White House - especially given what a head start Trump has on us in this state. We have to start now.
On top of that, we are fighting to defend our House DFL Majority, re-elect Senator Smith, send a full DFL congressional delegation to Washington, and take back the Minnesota State Senate.
DFLers have a tremendous responsibility this year, and our entire team is working incredibly hard to deliver. But as the designated “numbers person” in the organization, I can tell you first-hand we can’t keep it up without your support.
For instance, we’re halfway through the month right now and we’re trailing our budget targets by $3,822. So, before we kick off tonight’s debate, I’m asking for your help to close the gap in the name of unity:
Will you pitch in $10, $20, $50 (or whatever works for you tonight) so we can keep Minnesota blue this November, no matter who ends up at the top of the ticket?
Remember, Minnesota’s Political Contribution (PCR) program reset on the 1st of the year, which means you can have your first contribution of 2020 FULLY REFUNDED. Please take advantage of this opportunity today.

"Alex, Minnesota is a critical tipping point state in this election. If Trump flips us red on November 3rd, he’ll almost certainly win re-election. That fact alone is bad enough, and on top of it, a Trump victory would be a disaster for our candidates down the ballot and the future of our state. Minnesota DFL
Alex,
Minnesota is a critical tipping point state in this election. If Trump flips us red on November 3rd, he’ll almost certainly win re-election. That fact alone is bad enough, and on top of it, a Trump victory would be a disaster for our candidates down the ballot and the future of our state.
Our field organizers are reaching out to thousands of voters every day. Based on what they’re hearing, it's clear the MNGOP has adopted Trump’s playbook of spreading misinformation and division at all costs.
Alex, we cannot let Trumpism gain a permanent foothold in Minnesota. We need to do everything we can to end this non-stop assault on science, truth, and decency once and for all.
You can imagine these conversations take a lot of time, especially as we grapple with the reality of working through a global pandemic. That’s why every dollar we raise between now and Election Day is going towards building out our capacity.
For example, we just did the math. If we raise an additional $15,000 by the end of the weekend, we can increase our output by 10% starting NEXT WEEK.
If you’re able, will you make a contribution of $10, $25, $50 or more to help us reach even more voters down the home stretch of this campaign?

Hi Alex,
The New York Times has described Donald Trump’s recent campaign blitz as an “onslaught.” And this week, Trump is once again training his fire on Minnesota with less than 50 days to go to Election Day.
Trump’s rally on Friday will make FIVE visits to Minnesota from the Trump campaign since July. Polling shows Minnesota is now at least as competitive as Michigan and Wisconsin.
Trump is 100% convinced he will win Minnesota, and he’s doing everything he can to put that theory to the test. If he is successful, he will be re-elected. And if Minnesota turns red, it will be a disaster for DFLers up and down the ballot -- from the Minnesota Legislature to the U.S. Senate.
The good news is our organizing team is firing on all cylinders, leading impactful organizing efforts across the state. We just need to hit our 500 new contributions goal by Trump’s visit on Friday to ensure they have the resources to fight through Election Day.
Remember, with Minnesota’s Political Contribution Refund (PCR) program, you can donate up to $50 (or $100 per couple) and receive a FULL REFUND from the State of Minnesota.
Alex, will you be one of the 324 donors we need to make a REFUNDABLE $50 contribution by Friday, so we have the resources we need to fight back and keep Minnesota blue?

Alex,
Trump is making a surprise campaign stop in Minnesota on Monday -- the opening day of the Democratic National Convention.

It’s official, Alex! Joe Biden has selected Kamala Harris as his running mate. This is a historic announcement, and we couldn’t be more fired up to keep Minnesota blue for this ticket.
To prove that DFLers are more than ready to get the job done for Joe and Kamala, we’re setting a 2,000 individual contributions goal before the Democratic National Convention convenes next week.
If you can, please make a contribution that works for you by Sunday night to help us get there and welcome Kamala Harris to the ticket. Anything helps -- even $1!

The next two months will be the fight of our lives, but I believe in our Democratic ticket, our team, and most importantly, I believe in you. We just can’t take ANYTHING for granted.
I just ran the numbers, and we still need to raise at least $27,800 by Sunday night to follow through on our plan to expand our statewide organizing program.
If you’re able, please make a contribution of $10, $25, $50 or more to help us make up the difference so we can keep Minnesota blue!

FIVETHIRTYEIGHT: Minnesota “could be the next midwestern state to go red”
POLITICO: “Minnesota, which once looked like a vanity project for Donald Trump, is suddenly emerging as a critical test of his effort to turn his campaign around.”
Alex,
A BREAKING polling analysis from FiveThirtyEight now shows Minnesota as one of the “likeliest states to be the Electoral College tipping point — the state that delivers the next president his decisive 270th electoral vote.”
We’ve been saying this for YEARS, and the national press is finally catching on. Minnesota will be the deciding factor this November. If we don’t hold the line here, Trump gets re-elected. It’s that simple. And now that the secret is out, the Trump campaign is going to be targeting us even more relentlessly than they already were.
With less than 63 days to go to Election Day, we have no time to waste. We are expanding our ENTIRE statewide program immediately. Our best estimate says we need to raise at least $35,000 by the end of the week to keep our budget intact.
If you can, please make a contribution of $10, $25, $50 or more right away to help us fight back and keep Minnesota blue!

Alex,
I had a blast campaigning in Minnesota yesterday for Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Tina Smith, and DFLers up and down the ballot. I always love visiting the home state of so many legendary progressive leaders, including my dear friend Paul Wellstone.
Now, all eyes will be on Minnesota over the next 15 days. If Donald Trump wins there, he’ll almost certainly be re-elected.
We can’t let that happen. Americans can’t afford four more years of Trump’s ignorance, incompetence, and miserable failures. We must do everything we can to support the Minnesota DFL down the home stretch of this election.
If you’re able to, please make a contribution of $10, $25, $50 or more to help make sure the DFL has the resources they need to get out the vote and win Minnesota.

We know what’s at stake in this election: Hundreds of thousands of Americans have died. More than 8 million Americans have slid into poverty in the wake of this administration’s disastrous response to the COVID-19 pandemic. And this time of crisis has fallen especially hard on communities of color as the fight against racial injustice has reached a new threshold.
The challenges we face are enormous. But we are not without hope: Joe Biden will be a President who will lead with empathy, trust science, and help working Americans build back better.
Minnesota is a critical tipping point state. The work the Minnesota DFL does between now and Election Day will echo for generations to come. They have the team and plan to get the job done, so all they need now is our support.
Please make a contribution to the Minnesota DFL if you can today to help finish strong and hold the line in this critical state.
Let’s dream big, fight hard, and win.
Thanks for being a part of this,
Elizabeth

I’ll be 100% honest with you. When I took this job, I never would have guessed I’d be tasked with figuring out how to run a virtual field program during a global pandemic.

So, as we shift our operations online and forge ahead to keep Minnesota blue this November, I wanted to remind you that joining our DFL Victory Club is one awesome way you can help us keep the lights on.
The DFL Victory Club is our monthly recurring contribution program. We launched it to honor our Party’s legacy of grassroots organizing and allow every DFLer to make a significant financial impact in a way that works for their monthly budget.

Alex,
Donald Trump and his MN GOP allies are doing everything they can to stir up hate, fear, and division because they know they can’t win this election with their ideas.
They don’t care how much damage they do, spreading their lies and misinformation. They just want to win at all costs.
The Minnesota DFL is leading an incredible statewide effort to fight back, but with Mike Pence making a surprise campaign stop in Minnesota tomorrow night, they need all the help they can get to hold the line.
With just eight days to go, will you make a quick contribution to the Minnesota DFL so they can finish strong? We can’t afford to take anything for granted.
The COVID-19 pandemic has made it more clear than ever that we need to elect leaders who trust science, believe in making health care more affordable, and who will fight for a strong economy for all of us, not just billionaires.
The Minnesota DFL is leading the statewide Get Out The Vote operation to get the job done, and we all need them operating at full capacity down the home stretch.
Join me and rush a contribution to the Minnesota DFL so they finish strong and re-elect Tina Smith, protect and expand our DFL House Majority, flip the Minnesota Senate, and keep Minnesota blue.

We are working around the clock to hold the line for Joe in Minnesota against a relentless onslaught from the Trump campaign. To make sure we can keep it up, we need to hit our $100,000 rapid response goal before Trump’s 2nd visit of the month tomorrow. And right now, we’re lagging behind.

"Alex, It’s hard to believe, but we’re exactly TWO WEEKS out from Election Day. One of the most challenging parts of campaigning this year has been overhauling our spending to account for early voting. Over 1 million (!) Minnesotans have already cast their ballots, and even more will be making their voices heard over the next 14 days.
Alex, Tonight is the first Vice Presidential debate of the election, and you can bet Mike Pence is very nervous as he gets ready to square off against Senator Kamala Harris. Minnesota DFL
Alex,
We just got some really bad news less than two weeks from Election Day: The U.S. Senate race in Minnesota is a dead heat. A brand new KSTP poll just released an hour ago has radical Republican Jason Lewis within 1 point of Sen. Tina Smith.
We weren't expecting this, and we need to immediately move some resources into this race. Can you help us with a quick contribution of just $10 or $25 to get us back on track and turn out as many Democrats as we can?
I know we've asked a lot this week, but without a victory in this race, Democrats have almost no chance of flipping the U.S. Senate. The good news is 12% are undecided in this race, and we still have time to reach out to them.

Immediately after a poll was released last week showing Jason Lewis within 1 point of Tina Smith, Donald Trump’s campaign made another big TV ad buy and announced a campaign stop from Mike Pence.

Alex,
Donald Trump just announced that he is coming back to Minnesota for ANOTHER campaign rally next Friday. This is Trump’s second visit since August, and Mike Pence, Ivanka Trump, and Donald Trump, Jr. have all made recent stops here on top of it.
Polls now show a closer race in Minnesota than Michigan and Wisconsin, and Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight has listed us as “one of the likeliest states to be the Electoral College tipping point.”
We cannot let this slip away from us, Alex. Your support over the next eight weeks is critical.
To keep our budget on track, we need at least 500 Minnesotans to step up by Friday for the first time this year. Remember, with Minnesota’s Political Contribution Refund (PCR) program, you can donate up to $50 (or $100 per couple) and receive a FULL REFUND from the state of Minnesota.

Alex,
As the state with the only divided legislature in the nation, we had the opportunity to prove that Minnesotans can rise above partisanship and do what’s right for George Floyd, the Black community, and communities of color across our state.
Unfortunately, Paul Gazelka and Senate Republicans have abandoned their responsibility to fix our broken policing system and refused to work with DFL Party lawmakers to enact real and meaningful change.
Early this morning, they left town before the job was done, shutting out the cries for reform emanating from across Minnesota and demonstrating a complete unwillingness to make divided government work.
It’s not enough anymore for Republicans to just be the party that says no to every proposal that comes before them. They had the opportunity to rise to the occasion, and with the world watching, they failed, proving to Minnesotans once again that they are unfit to lead.
We cannot leave anything to chance. To ensure that we take back the Minnesota Senate this November, we are immediately expanding our legislative organizing program.
To cover the additional staffing and digital organizing costs we need to raise $10,000 by midnight on Monday.
With Minnesota’s Political Contribution Refund (PCR) program, you can donate $50 (or $100 per couple) to help us get there, and you will receive a full refund from the State of Minnesota.
There’s no better time to take advantage of it. Help us take back the Minnesota Senate and make a REFUNDABLE $50 CONTRIBUTION today.

It’s official, Alex! Joe Biden has selected Kamala Harris as his running mate. This is a historic announcement, and we couldn’t be more fired up to keep Minnesota blue for this ticket.
To prove that DFLers are more than ready to get the job done for Joe and Kamala, we’re setting a 2,000 individual contributions goal before the Democratic National Convention convenes next week.
If you can, please make a contribution that works for you by Sunday night to help us get there and welcome Kamala Harris to the ticket. Anything helps -- even $1!

"Alex, I’ve been through a lot of elections, and none of them have been more important than the one we are facing this November.

Alex,
I’ve been through a lot of elections, and none of them have been more important than the one we are facing this November.
Instead of bringing Americans together during these difficult times, we have a president who has doubled-down on spreading division, fear, and chaos, all with the Republican Party enabling him every step of the way. It’s detestable, and we must put an end to it.
On Sunday, we will be exactly 100 days out from the election, and Minnesota will be a top battleground down the home stretch. President Trump will do everything he can to flip us red because he knows that if he does, he will be re-elected.
Our Minnesota DFL Party is working incredibly hard to hold the line, and it’s up to all of us to make sure they are successful, including making certain they hit their $100,000 target by the 100 days out mark on Sunday night.
Alex, if you’re able, please join me in making a contribution to the Minnesota DFL today so we can finish this election strong and keep Minnesota blue. Anything helps.

Hi Alex,
I don’t want to interrupt your Labor Day Weekend, so I’ll keep this short.
In case you missed it, Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight has now listed Minnesota as one of the “likeliest states to be the Electoral College tipping point — the state that delivers the next president his decisive 270th electoral vote.”
We’re driving to hit a $35,000 budget target so we can expand our entire statewide organizing program immediately after Labor Day. I just ran the numbers, and we still need to raise more than $9,100 by MIDNIGHT to get there.

Alex,
With Vice President Mike Pence making another campaign stop in Minnesota today, there is nothing more important than making sure the Minnesota DFL has the resources they need to finish strong.
This election will shape the future of our state and country for generations to come. For our children and grandchildren, we must make every minute of these last eight days count.
If you’re able, will you join me in making a donation to the DFL so they can hit their final budget target and turn out voters for our One Minnesota allies up and down the ballot?
The MN Senate Republicans will do all they can to latch onto the Vice President’s visit today. They see President Trump’s focus on flipping Minnesota red as an opportunity, and they’ve done their best to emulate his divisive brand of politics at every turn.
Just like President Trump, the MN Senate GOP Majority continues to deny the seriousness of this deadly virus and put political games before the health and economic security of Minnesotans. They would rather fight me than fight COVID-19.
We only need to flip two seats to take back the Minnesota Senate. The Minnesota DFL is critical to getting the job done, in addition to everything else they’re doing to keep Minnesota blue.
Please, make a contribution of $10, $15, $25, or whatever works for you to the Minnesota DFL by tomorrow night so they can turn out as many voters as possible down the home stretch.

KSTP POLL: Minnesota COVID-19 Response
Walz: 82% Approve
Trump: 34% Approve
Alex,
A new KSTP/SurveyUSA poll shows that Minnesotans overwhelmingly approve of Governor Walz’s urgent and thoughtful response to COVID-19 and overwhelmingly disapprove of President Trump’s botched response.
We’re so lucky to have Governor Walz leading the way, and with the MN House GOP blocking his Local Jobs and Projects Plan, we need to have his back more than ever.
We’re aiming to expand our digital organizing operation so we can keep up the pressure for our local communities and workers when they need this critical funding the most. But our budget is tight and we need your help to pull it off.
With Minnesota’s Political Contribution Refund (PCR) program, you can donate up to $50 (or $100 per couple) to support us and receive a FULL REFUND from the state of Minnesota. This is an easy way to help support the DFL and all of our candidates for FREE.
If we raise an additional $4,200 by tomorrow, we’ll be in the clear. Will you take advantage of your PCR and make a REFUNDABLE CONTRIBUTION to help us get there?

Alex,
One of the most jaw-dropping things Trump said during his failed rally this past weekend was his admission that he ordered his team to “slow down” COVID-19 testing to protect his image. Here’s the full quote:
“When you do testing to that extent, you’re going to find more people. You’re going to find more cases. So I said to my people, ‘Slow the testing down please!’”
This is among the most damning statements of Trump’s entire disastrous Presidency (and that’s saying a lot!). Unsurprisingly, he’s already trying to walk his statement back, and we can’t let him get away with it, especially not with the Senate GOP hoping to ride his coattails to victory.
Our communications team is planning to launch a media blitz around this shocking statement to make sure Minnesotans know the truth about how dangerous this Republican Party is up and down the ballot. But we need to make sure our budget is stable first.
If we raise at least $8,500 by Sunday night, we have the OK to move forward. Remember, with Minnesota’s Political Contribution Refund (PCR) program, you can donate $50 (or $100 per couple) right now, and you will receive a full refund from the State of Minnesota.
Will you take advantage of your PCR and make a $50 contribution by Sunday so we can hit this goal and get this critical message out?

Think about this, Alex. Democrats could win back Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin but still fail to take back the White House if Trump succeeds in flipping Minnesota red.
The future of our state and entire county is truly in our hands, and this new poll confirms we’re going to have to fight with everything we have to hold the line.
Please help us hit this emergency goal so we can protect our Minnesota House DFL Majority, take back the Minnesota Senate, re-elect Senator Tina Smith, stop Trumpism, and keep Minnesota this November.

In these uncertain times, we’re grateful for everyone who has stepped up to take care of their neighbors and serve their communities – from health care workers to public officials, teachers, business and community leaders, to our friends and family members. We will continue to do everything we can to support those who are on the front lines of this crisis.
As our candidates up and down the ballot navigate uncharted waters in an election year that couldn’t be more critical, the need for our DFL grassroots organizing power has never been greater.
We’re working around the clock to make sure essential party activities can continue throughout the state without putting anyone at risk (see Chairman Ken Martin’s update on that here). And the fact is, because we’ve had to cancel all in-person fundraisers for the foreseeable future, we need your support now more than ever.
Here's the reality: Given how this crisis will impact our economy, we are expecting a significant loss of revenue in the coming months that will impact our ability to win crucial elections up and down the ballot this fall. That’s just the honest truth.
Our entire budget – from our staff, field offices, and voter identification program to the immediate changes we need to make to enhance our digital organizing capabilities across the board – depends on the resources we can raise right now.
Through the Minnesota Political Campaign Refund (PCR) program, you can donate $50 (or $100 per couple) to support the Minnesota DFL through this critical time, and you will receive a full refund from the state of Minnesota.
If everyone reading this makes their refundable PCR contribution today, we are confident we can make it through these tough times together and put our DFL Party in a position to win this fall.

Minnesota is still a must-win state for Democrats this November. We cannot afford to wait. In every way possible, we need to focus on where our actions can make a positive impact.
Together, we can end the chaos of the Trump administration. We can regain the majority in the Minnesota Senate and increase our House majority to support Governor Tim Walz. We can re-elect Senator Tina Smith, Congresswoman Angie Craig, and Congressman Dean Phillips; and we can win back the First and Eighth Congressional Districts to build on our majority in Congress.
Now more than ever, our state and entire country need leadership we can depend on. Please make a contribution that works for you today so we can keep pushing through.
Thank you,
Minnesota DFL
P.S.: November is coming whether we are ready for it or not. There's no time to lose – please help us rise to the challenge by sending in your $50 ($100 per couple) PCR contribution now.

Alex,
It’s been clear since the day he was sworn in that President Trump is personally obsessed with flipping Minnesota red this November. Here’s why: If he is successful, Democrats will have almost no chance at taking back the White House.
The Trump campaign is sparing no expense to do it either. They’ve reserved $14 million in ads here already and appear set to follow through on their pledge to pour $30 million into our state by Election Day.
We know exactly what their message will be too. They will do everything they can to try to divide us, scare us, and make us question our common sense.
But we know our state better than Trump ever will. And as long as we continue building on the Minnesota DFL’s proud legacy of grassroots organizing, we will prevail. We just need to give it everything we have.
Alex, we cannot afford to let the DFL miss their 100 days out budget target tonight. If you’re able, please make a contribution that works for you by midnight.

"Hi Alex,
Did you see Brian’s email? These new pro-Trump Super PAC ads are going to be running any day now. We need to move quickly.
I just ran the numbers, and we still need to raise more than $7,000 by midnight to fund the media plan Brian put together. I haven’t seen your name come through yet so I thought I’d follow up.
If you’re able, pitch in $10, $25, $50 or more to help us make up the difference so we can hold the line against these last-minute right-wing super PAC attacks.
Thank you,

BREAKING: Pro-Trump Super PAC puts down $250,000 closing TV ad buy in MN
Alex,
We just learned that a pro-Trump Super PAC is dumping a quarter of a million dollars into Minnesota to smear Joe Biden and Kamala Harris on TV down the closing stretch.
We knew this was a possibility, but the truth is the non-stop visits from the Trump campaign over the past two months have already put a significant strain on our media budget.
Like Trump, these Super PAC ads try to stoke fear and division by spreading lies and misinformation. We know the only way to fight back and set the record straight is to get our message out to Minnesotans. Our communications team is planning a media blitz to counteract this new ad buy immediately, but first, we need to lock in our budget.
I just met with the fundraising team. After moving a few things around, we’re confident we can move forward if we raise an additional $12,500 by tomorrow night. Will you help us get there so we can fight back?
It’s now or never. Please, chip in 15, $25, $50, or whatever you can do today, so we can fund our media blitz and beat back this last push from Trump’s right-wing super PAC allies.

Hi Alex,
My name is Jonathan Sperber, and I just started as the Minnesota DFL’s Coordinated Campaign Field Director. I wanted to reach out to introduce myself and give you a quick update on our organizing program.
As we all do our part to slow the spread of COVID-19, we’re excited to announce plans to make it possible for you to volunteer and help us keep Minnesota blue from home! Some “non-contact” voter contact if you will.
To kick things off, we’re holding three virtual volunteer training sessions next week on 3/31, 4/1, and 4/4.
I’d love for you to join us. Would you RSVP for a time that works for you to talk about how we’re going to be reaching out to voters and community members during the next few weeks?
RSVP NOW »
My favorite thing about organizing and working on campaigns is bringing people together. And even though we’re maintaining physical distance from each other to keep our neighbors and loved ones safe, we can still forge meaningful and powerful connections throughout our community.
We’re all in this together so let’s have a conversation about fun and easy ways to stay connected and put us in the best position to take back the White House in 2020.
Sign up for one of our virtual volunteer training sessions here. I’m excited to work with you!
Thank you for all that you do,

Alex,
The most important election of our lives is less than eight weeks away, and just like we always expected, DFLers are at the very center of it.
Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight has named Minnesota as “one of the likeliest states to be the Electoral College tipping point.” Just yesterday, POLITICO listed Minnesota as one of “the 8 states where 2020 will be won or lost.”
Donald Trump Jr. was in town yesterday. Mike Pence was in town last week. Donald Trump was in town the week before that. And Ivanka Trump was in town in July.
Our entire team is working 24-7 to hold the line, but I’m not going to sugar coat it: This is the most challenging test we’ve ever faced. They’re coming at us with everything they have.
Trump is desperate to win Minnesota. He knows that if he does, Democrats will have no chance at taking back the White House. There is no line he won’t cross, and no amount of money he and his right-wing allies won’t spend to flip us red.
Every one of us needs to dig deep down the home stretch, Alex, so I’m reaching out today to ask:
Will you super-charge your support and commit to a weekly recurring donation every Thursday between now and Election Day so we can do what it takes to keep Minnesota blue?

I know we are unstoppable as long as we stick together. We just can’t take anything for granted.

Alex - I wanted to make sure you saw this.
A KSTP poll has Jason Lewis within one point of Senator Tina Smith less than two weeks before election day.
This critical Senate race is tightening, and just this morning Mitch McConnell’s super PAC dumped $92 million into Senate races. This last-minute investment shows that Senate Republicans only care about one thing: controlling the Senate so they can force conservative justices onto the Court.
Can you help us with a quick contribution of just $10 or $25 so we can adjust our targets and turn out voters for Senator Tina Smith and Democrats up and down the ballot?

Alex,
We just got some really bad news less than two weeks from Election Day: The U.S. Senate race in Minnesota is a dead heat. A brand new KSTP poll just released an hour ago has radical Republican Jason Lewis within 1 point of Sen. Tina Smith.
We weren't expecting this, and we need to immediately move some resources into this race. Can you help us with a quick contribution of just $10 or $25 to get us back on track and turn out as many Democrats as we can?
I know we've asked a lot this week, but without a victory in this race, Democrats have almost no chance of flipping the U.S. Senate. The good news is 12% are undecided in this race, and we still have time to reach out to them.
Pitch in any amount you can below:

We’ve revised our budget as best we can to adjust to the losses we’re projecting in the coming months. I won’t sugar coat it, it’s not going to be easy. Our biggest fundraiser of the year has been postponed indefinitely – an event that typically makes up the lion’s share of our operating budget.

Our first end-of-quarter deadline of the year is coming up at midnight tomorrow and we still need to raise $5,200 by then to meet our immediate budget obligations.

Our entire team is working harder than ever to adapt because we all know exactly what’s at stake. But at the end of the day, the fact is we can’t do this alone.
Please, make a contribution that works for you by MIDNIGHT TOMORROW to help us protect our Minnesota House DFL Majority, take back the Minnesota Senate, send a full DFL congressional delegation to Washington, re-elect Senator Tina Smith, and keep Minnesota blue in November.

Alex,
By now, I’m sure you’ve noticed that Minnesota is a central battleground state in the campaign for the White House. Yesterday, Mike Pence and Ivanka Trump were here to campaign for the election, less than a week after Trump himself held a campaign rally in Minnesota last Friday.
It’s easy to see why Trump is obsessed with Minnesota — he lost by just 1.5 points here in 2016, and if he can make up the difference this year, he will almost certainly win re-election.
But the Presidential campaign isn’t the only reason Minnesota is so central in this year’s election. When we elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in November, we must also ensure we deliver them a Democratic Senate who will work with them to undo the damage of Donald Trump’s disastrous four years in office, especially as the Senate Republicans try to steal another seat on the Supreme Court and dismantle Obamacare.
That is why it is so essential that we return Tina Smith to the United States Senate. Tina has been a target for national Republicans since 2018 when I was her Deputy Campaign Manager. Now, just two years later, she’s back on the ballot, and the race is way too close — recent polls put her lead within the margin-of-error, and poll watchers are calling this race a toss-up.
Alex, we need to pull together to return Tina Smith to Washington D.C. to continue fighting for all Minnesotans. Can you chip in $10, $25, or $50 to help defend this critical Senate seat?
Jason Lewis is about as bad as they come. He has a long history of racist, sexist, classist, and homophobic remarks, and when he was in Congress, he was one of Trump’s most loyal henchmen. He even earned the nickname “mini-Trump.”
Lewis’s entire campaign is about one thing: Serving Donald Trump and the right-wing agenda. He will stop at nothing to continue his attack on reproductive rights, health care, workers, and our democracy.
Jason Lewis would be a disaster for Minnesotan families, and we must stop him.
Please, make a contribution that works for you so we can keep fighting to do our part to return Tina Smith to the U.S. Senate and retire Jason Lewis from Minnesota politics once and for all.

Alex,
In case you hadn’t heard, the Minnesota House GOP blocked Governor Walz’s Local Jobs and Projects Plan in the final hours of the 2020 legislative session late Sunday night.
Even though Minnesotans overwhelmingly approve of Governor Walz’s thoughtful response to COVID-19 and overwhelmingly disapprove of President Trump’s horrendous response, the House GOP is refusing to come to the table until Minnesota ends the governor’s peacetime state of emergency.
Alex, all 50 states are currently under a peacetime emergency. To prematurely end ours is to put Minnesotans in danger, and we will not allow the House GOP to block desperately needed jobs across the state simply because they want to use our health as a political bargaining chip.
We’ll have another chance to get this jobs bill done in a special session, likely next month, but we’re going to have to take the fight to the House Republicans’ doorstep.
We’ve already gotten approval on an aggressive communications plan to keep the pressure on as long as we pull together the budget for it. I worked out the math with our fundraising team and as long as we raise at least $5,000 by tomorrow night, we’ll have what we need to execute it.
If you didn’t know, through Minnesota’s Political Contribution Refund (PCR) program, you can donate up to $50 (or $100 per couple) to help fund this plan and receive a FULL REFUND from the State of Minnesota.
Help us fight back so we can provide relief to local communities and workers when they need it most. Take advantage of your PCR and make a REFUNDABLE CONTRIBUTION by tomorrow night.

Alex,
After blocking Democrats’ efforts to allow Wisconsinites to vote by mail during the pandemic, Republicans forced voters to choose between their health and their fundamental democratic rights.
Hundreds of polling places shut down due to a lack of available workers. Thousands of voters stood in line for hours together. And many, many more stayed home.
We can’t let this happen again, especially not in November. Thankfully, Senators Amy Klobuchar and Ron Wyden have introduced a bill to expand vote-by-mail to every state. We need to support them now.
This is an emergency, Alex. Will you sign our petition and tell Congress to pass Senator Klobuchar and Wyden's bill immediately?
Pass the Klobuchar-Wyden bill

That is why the Minnesota DFL is excited to host its second event in a series of grassroots fundraising events to ensure we have the resources to win up and down the ballot this November. Please join us on Tuesday July 7th at 5:00 pm for our virtual panel featuring subject matter experts and policymakers.
Where we go from here: Charting a Policy Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic.
Joining us to discuss federal policy responses will be:
* Andy Slavitt, who served in the Obama administration as the Acting Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). His work on the Ebola crisis and fierce defense of the Affordable Care Act has led to his reputation as one of the foremost public health officials.
* Dan Feehan, the DFL endorsed Congressional Candidate and former DOD official, will speak to event attendees about his experiences in the Ebola response team and what role Congress can have in responding to the coronavirus.
* Rep. Rena Moran, the Chair of the House Health and Human Services Policy Committee, will be joining the panel to address the House response to the crisis.
* Erin Murphy, State Senate Candidate and Nurse, will address legislation and policy we could implement at the state level if the DFL were in the Senate majority.
To reserve your spot for this event please RSVP here. All ticket purchases will benefit the DFL in this crucial time. Your support will go a long way as the DFL prepared to take back the White House, protect Senator Smith, and take back the State Senate.
If you haven't yet sent in your refundable Political Contribution Refund (PCR) contribution of $50 ($100 per couple) for 2020, now is the PERFECT time to make the most of it. You can use it towards the purchase of your ticket.
Thank you,
Minnesota DFL

Did you see this, Alex?
Yesterday, GOP State Senator Scott Jensen was caught golfing during an important healthcare committee hearing while his colleagues were discussing measures related to COVID-19.
Watch the ABSURD video here:
Jensen has been one of the leading voices attempting to downplay the threat of COVID-19 for his own political gain. He even made two appearances on Fox News that helped fuel a rash of anti-science conspiracy theories across the internet.
This pandemic has both asked and taken much from Minnesotans across our state. The least Senator Jensen can do is stop golfing during work, stop spreading disinformation, and start helping the people he's supposed to represent.
Enough is enough. We must persevere through this crisis and hold the MN Senate GOP and Republicans up and down the ballot accountable this November.
Thankfully, with Minnesota’s Political Contribution Refund (PCR) program, you can donate $50 (or $100 per couple) to help us get the job done and receive a FULL REFUND from the State of Minnesota.

"Alex, When Minnesotans rise above fear-mongering and focus instead on our shared strength in unity, we are unstoppable. This is why we say One Minnesota.

Alex,
When Minnesotans rise above fear-mongering and focus instead on our shared strength in unity, we are unstoppable.
This is why we say One Minnesota. And as we face the most consequential election of our lives, it’s never been more important for us to remember what we’re capable of when we come together.
If we’re going to break free from the cynicism gripping so much of our politics, we must elect allies up and down the ballot who will reject fear and division and join us as we work to build a brighter future for our state.
The Minnesota DFL is central to this mission, and in order to make sure they have the resources they need to get the job done, they need to raise $100,000 by the 100 days out mark this Sunday.
Alex, it’s impossible to overstate how important it is for the DFL to be firing on all cylinders down the final stretch of this election, which is why I was compelled to reach out personally today.
Will you take advantage of your Political Contribution Refund (PCR) and make REFUNDABLE $50 DONATION to the Minnesota DFL to help them hit their 100-day out goal by Sunday night?

Alex,
A new poll from the Trafalgar Group now shows Donald Trump dead even with Joe Biden in Minnesota. This is bad news less than two weeks after a separate Minnesota poll showed Trump gaining on Biden.
The Trump campaign has been pouring money into TV ads, and it looks to be paying off. And we know that between the $30 million they plan to spend in Minnesota this year and Trump’s right-wing super PAC allies, there’s A LOT more where that came from.
Here’s the thing: We know we can win back any ground Trump has made up if we act quickly. Because even though we won’t be able to outspend them, we will out-organize them as long as we have resources to respond.
If you’re able, please rush a contribution of $10, $25, $50, or whatever works for you today so we can fight back and hold the line!

Alex,
One of the memories that will forever be seared into my brain is the day I stood at the steps of the United States Supreme Court and heard the news that my future marriage would finally be recognized in every state in the union.
We’ve made so much progress for LGBTQ rights over the last few decades, but we also clearly have more work to do—especially when it comes to the safety of trans people and queer people of color.
That’s why the Minnesota DFL’s annual LGBTQ Leadership Event on Tuesday, July 21 is so meaningful to me personally, and I hope you’ll take time to join us by attending and/or joining our cohost list today.
Because this is a virtual event, we get the chance to hear from LGBTQ leaders across the country, including Chasten Buttigieg, Danica Roem, Reggie Greer, and Angie Craig.
Every contribution toward this event will go directly into the DFL’s organizing efforts on the ground here in Minnesota to ensure we flip the State Senate, re-elect Senator Tina Smith, and make Donald Trump a one-term president. Tickets are limited, so please act quickly, I wouldn’t want you to miss out on this unique opportunity.
GET YOUR TICKETS HERE
Don’t forget: If you’re an eligible Minnesota voter, you can attend this event for free by using your Political Contribution Refund Program (PCR). If you haven’t used your 2020 PCR, you can use it toward the purchase of your ticket.
Thank you, as always, for your steadfast support of the DFL, and I look forward to seeing you soon.

Whether we’re ready for it or not, there will be an election this November, and Minnesota will still be a must-win state for Democrats if we’re going to take back the White House.
On top of that, we must defend our majority in the Minnesota House, retake our majority in the Minnesota Senate, re-elect Senator Tina Smith, and send a full DFL Congressional delegation to Washington.
We’re counting on you, Alex. Please take advantage of your PCR and make a REFUNDABLE CONTRIBUTION by midnight.

We have adjusted our priorities. We have transitioned to a digital organizing model. And Governor Walz and our DFL leaders are making us proud every day by fighting with integrity for our values, even in the most difficult circumstances.
But with so much uncertainty looking ahead to the fall, the only thing we can do is prepare as aggressively as we can right now. We still have a budget shortfall, and we don't know when we'll be able to host events again.
The good news is we have a big opportunity to catch up this week. A group of generous donors has agreed to match all grassroots contributions through our mid-quarter goal on Friday, May 15.

Please make a MATCHED CONTRIBUTION by Friday to help us close our budget shortfall and get the job done.

With Trump spending $400,000 on TV ads in Minnesota last week, it’s clear that his campaign intends to follow through on their pledge to pour $30 million into our state by Election Day.
Trump knows that if he flips Minnesota red, he’ll be re-elected. The MN Senate GOP and the MN House GOP know it too and they’re counting on the Trump campaign to bring them along for the ride.
We can’t give them any room to run. That’s why, with your help (hopefully), we’re going to be launching a new media blitz this week to make sure voters understand what’s at stake here this November. We just need to raise more than $2,600 by midnight to fund it.

Alex,
If there is any doubt in your mind that Trump still believes he can win here in November, consider this: The Trump campaign spent more than $400,000 on TV ads in Minnesota this week.
$400,000 is about 40x more than they spent here in all of 2016, and Trump still came within 1.5 points of flipping us red that year.
We remain a top target for the Trump campaign because they know that Democrats could win back Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, and still fail to take back the White House if we lose Minnesota.
Trump is confident he can buy our state, and the MN House and MN Senate Republicans think they’ll be able to ride his coattails to victory. I think we need to show them exactly how wrong they are.
I know Brian, our communications director, reached out yesterday with his plans to hold them accountable next week, and I wanted to follow up personally. Will you help us hit our $8,500 goal by Sunday night so we can launch our media blitz?

Alex,
Today marks three weeks until Election Day. Thanks to your support so far, we’ve been able to hold strong against an absolutely relentless onslaught by the Trump campaign.
We’ve organized thousands of volunteers throughout the state who are calling and texting their neighbors every day. We’ve put up countless lawn signs. And we’ve pulled off historic paid and earned media campaigns.
But even with all of our work, Trump still managed to gain ground in Minnesota since September, according to a recent poll from KSTP/SurveyUSA.
This is a stark reminder that we’re not out of the woods yet. Not even CLOSE. We need to keep fighting with everything we have until Election Day.
Alex, will you help us dig deep down the home stretch and commit to a weekly recurring contribution every Tuesday between now and November 3rd? We’re counting on you.

Trump knows that Minnesota is a critical state in 2020. If he wins here, he’ll win reelection and sweep far-right-wing MN Republicans up and down the ballot into power with him.
As Trump and his GOP allies continue to blanket our state with lies, fear-mongering, and misinformation, we need to work twice as hard reaching out directly to voters in every part of the state.
Please, click here to start a weekly contribution between now and Election Day to help us keep Minnesota blue and elect Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and Democrats up and down the ballot this November!

Huge news, Alex.
Heading into the weekend, we’re almost halfway to our goal of raising $100,000 by the 100 days out mark this Sunday!
Goal Update
We are surging right now. And we need to keep it up because the Trump campaign is getting more desperate to flip Minnesota red every single day.
Our fundraising team thinks that if we crack $50,000 by the end of the day, we’ll be in a strong position to hit our target by Sunday night. This is an ambitious goal. But we have no choice but to give the home stretch of this campaign everything we’ve got.
Alex, help us keep up the momentum and make a contribution of $10, $25, $50 or more by the end of the day to help us keep up the momentum!
Every dollar we raise will feed directly into our field team, who hopes to make over 100,000 calls to voters this weekend.

Alex,
I love campaigning. It's not always easy, but it's a chance to connect with people throughout the state. Even though this year has been less face-to-face and more screen-to-screen, the excitement and the opportunity of this moment is still there for me.
We've never faced a more important election. We can't afford to continue going down a path led by elected officials who reject science and play politics with people's lives, but they won't leave without a fight.
The polls in Minnesota are tightening, and the Trump campaign is convinced they can flip us red. They just made another massive TV ad buy, and Mike Pence was back in town again yesterday to try to seal the deal.
The Minnesota DFL is doing everything they can to accelerate their Get Out The Vote operation in response, and they need our support more than ever to hit their one week out GOTV budget target by midnight, which is why I'm reaching out directly today to ask:
If you’re able, will you join me in making a contribution to the Minnesota DFL that works for you to help them hold the line over the next 7 days and keep Minnesota blue?

Alex,
Hopefully, you’ve had a chance to cast your vote already. (If you haven’t yet, visit [[URL REDACTED]] to make your plan.)
Minnesotans have been voting in record numbers already this election. But this week, a federal court made a last-minute ruling that mail-in ballots must be received by Election Day. Now, we have thousands of extra calls to make to ensure Minnesotans know how to get their vote counted by tomorrow, and we’re way behind where we need to be.
Alex, will you sign up for at least one phone banking shift right now to help get voters to the polls by Tuesday?
You can join one of our phone banks to make calls from anywhere. We’ll be telling Minnesotans about the three ways left to vote — where to drop off a ballot, vote early, or vote in-person on Election Day. Your efforts could help make the difference in whether we’re able to keep Minnesota blue and elect DFLers up and down the ballot this year.
Don’t wake up on Wednesday wishing you would’ve done more. Can you commit to at least one shift of phone calls? We need all the help we can get!
Thank you,
DFL HQ
P.S. Find out where to vote early at [[URL REDACTED]], and call our voter hotline at 833-DFL-VOTE (833-335-8683) with any voting questions.

Alex,
With Vice President Mike Pence making another campaign stop in Minnesota today, there is nothing more important than making sure the Minnesota DFL has the resources they need to finish strong.
This election will shape the future of our state and country for generations to come. For our children and grandchildren, we must make every minute of these last eight days count.
If you’re able, will you join me in making a donation to the DFL so they can hit their final budget target and turn out voters for our One Minnesota allies up and down the ballot?
The MN Senate Republicans will do all they can to latch onto the Vice President’s visit today. They see President Trump’s focus on flipping Minnesota red as an opportunity, and they’ve done their best to emulate his divisive brand of politics at every turn.
Just like President Trump, the MN Senate GOP Majority continues to deny the seriousness of this deadly virus and put political games before the health and economic security of Minnesotans. They would rather fight me than fight COVID-19.
We only need to flip two seats to take back the Minnesota Senate. The Minnesota DFL is critical to getting the job done, in addition to everything else they’re doing to keep Minnesota blue.
Please, make a contribution of $10, $15, $25, or whatever works for you to the Minnesota DFL by tomorrow night so they can turn out as many voters as possible down the home stretch.

Alex,
Tonight is the first Vice Presidential debate of the election, and you can bet Mike Pence is very nervous as he gets ready to square off against Senator Kamala Harris.
The stakes of this election couldn’t be higher. Just when we thought Trump couldn’t sink any lower, he announced yesterday that he ended all negotiations on the COVID-19 economic relief bill. And Pence went right along with him, just like he always does.
Tonight, Senator Kamala Harris will have a chance to stand up and fight back on behalf of all of us. And we couldn’t be more excited to watch her take Mike Pence to task.
When Senator Harris provided the keynote address for our 2020 Humphrey-Mondale Dinner last week, she stressed how important it is for us to hold the line on November 3 and keep Minnesota blue.
Alex, let’s show her that we heard her loud and clear. Help us hit our 500 individual contributions goal before midnight to prove that we are fired up and ready to do what it takes to win.
Be counted and show Kamala Harris that you have her back before she takes the debate stage tonight. If you can, chip in $15, $25, or $50 -- or however much works for you -- before MIDNIGHT.

Alex,
There are hundreds of thousands of absentee ballots still out in Minnesota. Thanks to a last-minute court ruling, we need to reach every one of these voters and make sure they know it's too late to mail them back. Ballots received after Election Day could now be rejected, even if they were postmarked on or before Election Day.
This is a huge lift we weren't anticipating, and we need all the help we can get. We're falling behind, and every minute counts.
This is your chance to make a difference in this unbelievably critical election. Will you sign up for at least one Get Out The Vote shift before the polls close at 8:00 pm tomorrow? You can make calls from home!
Hopefully, you've had a chance to vote already. If not, you can hand deliver your absentee ballot to your local drop off location or an official drop box by 3:00 pm on Election Day. You can also vote early in-person today or vote in-person at your polling location tomorrow. Head to [[URL REDACTED]] for everything you need to know.
The momentum is on our side. We can't let a last-minute court ruling stand in our way.
Let's finish the last stretch of this campaign strong. Sign up for at least one Get Out The Vote shift and help us get your neighbors to the polls by 8:00 pm tomorrow.

Alex,
Republicans are acting like everything hinges on Minnesota because, frankly, it does. While the GOP is losing its grip on other swing states, the polls have tightened here. They’re more convinced than ever they can flip this state red, and they know doing so would deliver Donald Trump another term.
That’s why Mike Pence was in Minnesota again yesterday and why the Trump campaign is making a huge, last-minute TV ad buy across our state.
Alex, we have seven days left to prove them wrong. Let’s make them pay at the polls and regret spending a single penny in Minnesota. And that starts with hitting our one week out GOTV budget target tonight.
I just got off a zoom with our DFL fundraising team, and they let me know we’re still more than $10,000 short. We need to act fast to make up the difference.
If you’re able, please chip in a quick $10, $25, $50, or whatever works for you before MIDNIGHT to help make up the difference so we can overwhelm the GOP over these next seven days.

Alex,
The Trump campaign just announced they’ll be sending Mike Pence back to Minnesota on Monday AND making a “major” new TV ad buy.
This is bad news. Multiple statewide polls this week have shown the race tightening in Minnesota, including one that had Jason Lewis less than one point behind Senator Tina Smith.
If Trump realizes his dream of flipping Minnesota red, Democrats will have almost no chance at taking back the White House OR the Senate.
We have no choice but to accelerate our Get Out the Vote plan immediately. I just worked out the math with our finance team and we need to raise $75,000 by the day of Pence’s visit to pull it off.

From: DFL HQ
Alex,
After blocking Democrats’ efforts to allow Wisconsinites to vote by mail during the pandemic, Republicans forced voters to choose between their health and their fundamental democratic rights.
Hundreds of polling places shut down due to a lack of available workers. Thousands of voters stood in line for hours together. And many, many more stayed home.
We can’t let this happen again, especially not in November. Thankfully, Senators Amy Klobuchar and Ron Wyden have introduced a bill to expand vote-by-mail to every state. We need to support them now.
This is an emergency, Alex. Will you sign our petition and tell Congress to pass Senator Klobuchar and Wyden's bill immediately?

Alex,
Trump's trainwreck Republican National Convention is over. And if there's one takeaway of the week, the Trump campaign is now 100% convinced they can win Minnesota.
Several recent polls have shown Trump gaining on Biden in Minnesota, and one poll last week even showed them in a dead heat. The Trump campaign sees an opportunity, and they're going all in.
This month alone, Trump has personally visited Minnesota, the Trump campaign has spent hundreds of thousands in TV ads, and Mike Pence will be coming here TODAY to make his first post-convention campaign stop. They are trying to overwhelm us, and we cannot let it happen.
Alex, we’ve never seen anything like this. The pressure is intense, but we can't give them an inch. We’re launching a media blitz to counter the lies and hate Pence will bring to our state today. We just need to raise at least $7,500 by tomorrow night to fund it.
If you’re able, please make a contribution of $10, $25, $50 or more to help us hit this budget target so we can fight back and keep Minnesota blue!

Alex,
When Minnesotans rise above fear-mongering and focus instead on our shared strength in unity, we are unstoppable.
This is why we say One Minnesota. And as we face the most consequential election of our lives, it’s never been more important for us to remember what we’re capable of when we come together.
If we’re going to break free from the cynicism gripping so much of our politics, we must elect allies up and down the ballot who will reject fear and division and join us as we work to build a brighter future for our state.
The Minnesota DFL is central to this mission, and in order to make sure they have the resources they need to get the job done, they need to raise $100,000 by the 100 days out mark this Sunday.
Alex, it’s impossible to overstate how important it is for the DFL to be firing on all cylinders down the final stretch of this election, which is why I was compelled to reach out personally today.

Donald Trump’s debate performance last night was shameful and dangerous, even by his standards. If it wasn’t clear already, we cannot afford to take anything for granted over the next 34 days.
Trump will be landing in Minnesota around 1:00 pm this afternoon, and if he has the nerve to campaign in our state after such a disgraceful night, we have no choice but to make it 100% clear that his hate and fear-mongering is not welcome here.
We are racing to hit our $100,000 rapid response by midnight, but it’s going to take a huge push to make up the last $18,417 before midnight.
If you’re able, will you make a contribution of $10 (more if you can, less if you can’t) by MIDNIGHT to help us make up the difference so we can keep Minnesota and seal Trump’s fate as a one-term President?

We’ve never been more proud to stand with Vice President Joe Biden. The entire DFL team is ready to do anything it will take to make sure he defeats Donald Trump this November.
We just need to make sure we have the resources to get the job done. Alex, if you’re able, please help us finish strong.
Make a contribution that works for you by midnight so we can kick Donald Trump out of the White House.

Alex,
We have less than 72 hours left to contact Minnesotans to get out the vote before polls close on Tuesday.
Because of a federal court ruling last week, it’s now too late for ballots to be sent in the mail. That means we have even more calls to make to Minnesotans to make sure voters know their options to cast their vote in these final days.
Will you sign up right now for at least one phone banking shift before Tuesday? We have thousands of calls left to make, and we need all hands on deck.
There are still three ways for Minnesotans to vote — drop off your absentee ballot in person, vote early in-person, or vote in-person on Election Day. But with everything going on, we know Minnesotans have questions. That’s why our Voter Protection Team is working double-time to get Minnesotans the answers they need.
Will you help us make the calls we need to, so every Minnesotan knows how to safely vote before Tuesday?
Thank you for your support,
DFL HQ

Update, Alex. Both Donald Trump AND Joe Biden will now be campaigning in Minnesota today.
We’re so grateful to have VP Biden in town to counter whatever hateful lies Trump brings with him today, but even with the reinforcements, we still need your help.
A federal district court ruled yesterday that all Minnesota absentee ballots must now be in by Election Day, or they could be rejected. Now, as we kick off GOTV weekend, we need to put together an entire voter education campaign on top of it.
We wish we didn’t have to ask again, but the fact is we need your support more than ever. Please, make a contribution that works for you to help us power through these last four days.

Bad news, Alex.
Just as Trump confirmed he is coming back to Minnesota TOMORROW, a new poll from KSTP/SurveyUSA shows that our lead has all but evaporated.
I know we’ve been asking a lot lately, but I wouldn’t be reaching out again today if this wasn’t an emergency. It’s on us to hold the line, and we’re losing ground fast.
If you’re able, please rush a contribution before Trump’s rally tomorrow to help us fight back against this last blitz, turn out the vote, and keep Minnesota blue!

Alex,
Donald Trump’s presidency has been a disgrace from the moment he was sworn into office. Yet every single day, he finds a way to sink even lower.
He is collapsing in on himself, and he’s becoming more and more desperate. And as he looks for targets to lash out against, Minnesota is at the top of his list. Here’s why:
Trump knows that even if Democrats win back Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, we could still fail to take back the White House if we lose Minnesota in November.
Alex, the work we do between now and Election Day will literally decide the future of our entire country for decades to come.
As Vice President Biden said when he launched his campaign, “This election is about the soul of our nation — and Donald Trump is poison to our soul.”
This is the fight of a lifetime and we need you all in if we’re going to prevail. Will you make a contribution of $10, $25, $50 or more to help us keep Minnesota blue this November?

If Trump wins Minnesota, he is re-elected. It’s that simple.
His campaign has already pledged $30 million here to try to bury us (not to mention what their right-wing super PAC allies will pile on top of that), and it will only go up from here.
We can’t hold the line without you. Please, make a contribution that works for you today to help us keep Minnesota blue and elect Vice President Joe Biden this November.

Having gone to college in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, I often had the pleasure of visiting my neighbors to the west in Minnesota. So I’m excited to once again see so many friendly faces when I join the Minnesota DFL for its annual LGBTQ Leadership Event on Tuesday, July 21st at 5:00pm.
The truth is we’ve come a long way in our quest for LGBTQ rights, but we still have so much further to go. This past year on the campaign trail with Pete has given me a lot of time to reflect on the state of our country, especially as a gay man living in the Midwest. What grounds me every day is doing the work and moving forward.
I am honored to be invited to spend the evening with a few trailblazers in the movement—Danica Roem, Angie Craig, and Reggie Greer—and I’d love for you to be there too! You can register here and submit questions to me and other panelists.
Talk soon,

Subj: You’re Invited: DFL’s Annual LGBTQ Leadership Event
Hi Alex,
Today we are launching our largest virtual event yet: Our LGBTQ Leadership Panel with U.S. Congresswoman Angie Craig, Chasten Buttigieg, Danica Roem, and Reggie Greer.
In 2018, Minnesota Congresswoman Angie Craig made history as the first lesbian mom elected to Congress. On July 21st she will be moderating a virtual panel with national leaders:
* Chasten Buttigieg spent the past year on the Presidential Campaign trail with his husband, Pete.
* Danica Roem made history as the first transgender person to serve in any state legislature in the country.
* Reggie Greer serves as Joe Biden’s LGBTQ Vote Director and will speak to DFLers about the commitments and efforts of the Biden campaign this election cycle.
We can’t wait to hear from each of these trailblazers as we celebrate the progress we have made for LGBTQ liberation and discuss the work that remains to be done. Please join us on Tuesday July 21st at 5:00 pm CT to hear from these leaders, ask them your questions, and support the DFL ahead of the critical 2020 elections.

Alex,
Every day brings us a new example of how far Donald Trump has steered us from our fundamental American values.
This presidency isn’t just dangerous. It’s exhausting. For the sake of our future, we must give this last stretch of the campaign season everything we’ve got, because America cannot endure another four years.
Over the next several months, Minnesota will be one of Donald Trump’s top targets. He came within 1.5 points of winning the state in 2016, and he knows that if he succeeds in making up the difference this year, Democrats will have almost no chance of taking back the White House.
The Minnesota DFL is leading the statewide effort to hold the line against the Trump campaign, and they’re aiming to raise $100,000 by the 100 days-to-go mark, which is tomorrow!
Will you join me in making sure the hardworking DFL staff on the front lines of this election have the resources they need to succeed?
If you’re able, please donate $10, $25, $50, or whatever makes sense for you, to help the Minnesota DFL keep Minnesota blue and seal Trump’s fate as a one-term President.

Alex,
Donald Trump is back in Minnesota today, his second visit since August. Trump has also sent Mike Pence, Ivanka Trump, and Donald Trump Jr. to Minnesota in the last few months.
I don’t like to raise the alarm bell, but I have to be direct. I’ve never seen Republicans make Minnesota a target like they are right now. It’s no exaggeration to say this election will be the toughest fight we’ve ever faced.
Fortunately, we've got the right team to take on the challenge. From our incredible DFL candidate to our dedicated organizers and staff to our passionate volunteers and supporters like you.
We can keep Minnesota blue. But it’s going to take all of us working together if we’re going to win. That’s why I’m reaching out to you today.
Last week, when we heard Trump was coming to town, we launched a goal of 500 new contributions through Minnesota’s Political Contribution Refund (PCR) program by 11:59 pm tonight. And with just hours to go until Trump touches down we’re still more than 220 short.
Alex, please — we’re counting on you in this critical moment. Will you make a FULLY REFUNDABLE contribution of $50 before midnight?

Let’s keep fighting together, and this November, let’s end the chaos of the Trump administration. Let’s take back our majority in the Minnesota Senate and increase our majority in the Minnesota House to support Governor Tim Walz. Let’s re-elect Senator Tina Smith and send a full Congressional delegation to Washington.
Take advantage of Minnesota’s PCR program and make a REFUNDABLE CONTRIBUTION today.

From: Minnesota DFL
Alex,
In these uncertain times, we’re grateful for everyone who has stepped up to take care of their neighbors and serve their communities – from health care workers to public officials, teachers, business and community leaders, to our friends and family members. We will continue to do everything we can to support those who are on the front lines of this crisis.
As our candidates up and down the ballot navigate uncharted waters in an election year that couldn’t be more critical, the need for our DFL grassroots organizing power has never been greater.
We’re working around the clock to make sure essential party activities can continue throughout the state without putting anyone at risk (see Chairman Ken Martin’s update on that here). And the fact is, because we’ve had to cancel all in-person fundraisers for the foreseeable future, we need your support now more than ever.
Here's the reality: Given how this crisis will impact our economy, we are expecting a significant loss of revenue in the coming months that will impact our ability to win crucial elections up and down the ballot this fall. That’s just the honest truth.
Our entire budget – from our staff, field offices, and voter identification program to the immediate changes we need to make to enhance our digital organizing capabilities across the board – depends on the resources we can raise right now.
Through the Minnesota Political Contribution Refund (PCR) program, you can donate $50 (or $100 per couple) to support the Minnesota DFL through this critical time, and you will receive a full refund from the state of Minnesota.
If everyone reading this makes their refundable PCR contribution today, we are confident we can make it through these tough times together and put our DFL Party in a position to win this fall.
According to our records, you have yet to contribute in 2020. Alex, now is the time. Use your PCR and make a REFUNDABLE DONATION today.

Minnesota is still a must-win state for Democrats this November. We cannot afford to wait. In every way possible, we need to focus on where our actions can make a positive impact.
Together, we can end the chaos of the Trump administration. We can regain the majority in the Minnesota Senate and increase our House majority to support Governor Tim Walz. We can re-elect Senator Tina Smith, Congresswoman Angie Craig, and Congressman Dean Phillips; and we can win back the First and Eighth Congressional Districts to build on our majority in Congress.
Now more than ever, our state and entire country need leadership we can depend on. Please make a contribution that works for you today so we can keep pushing through.
Thank you,
Minnesota DFL
P.S.: November is coming whether we are ready for it or not. There's no time to lose – please help us rise to the challenge by sending in your $50 ($100 per couple) PCR contribution now.

"Alex, It seems like an eternity has gone by since we had a leader in the White House who cared about our country more than he cared about himself. Minnesota DFL
Alex,
It seems like an eternity has gone by since we had a leader in the White House who cared about our country more than he cared about himself.
The last three and a half years under Donald Trump have tested our country in the worst possible ways. His utter contempt for civility and decency has torn us apart at the seams and emboldened the worst among us.
Things have seemed bleak at times. But after hearing from so many incredible leaders at this week’s Democratic National Convention, I have never felt more hopeful about our future.
Last night, Joe Biden accepted the nomination and reminded us that even though these next 74 days won’t be easy, as long as we keep the faith in the American promise, we cannot lose. And I couldn’t agree more.
With a new poll showing Trump TIED with Biden in Minnesota, we must come together and fight back immediately. Right now, we’re still $4,836 short of replenishing our rapid response fund, but I know we can make up the difference if we dig deep.
Alex, if you’re able, make a contribution of $10, $25, $50 or more by MIDNIGHT to help us do what it takes to elect Joe Biden and win the battle for the soul of this nation.

Hi Alex,
Join us today at 2pm for a virtual roundtable event with Senator Kamala Harris, Minnesota leaders, and parents to discuss navigating the challenges of returning to school during the pandemic. (Click here to RSVP)
Today marks just 62 days until the general election! In addition to doing everything I can to make sure we elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, re-elect Tina Smith, and flip the Minnesota State Senate, I’ve got something else on my mind: my daughter going back to school.
As a mom and an indigenous woman, I see every day how Trump’s failed leadership has disproportionately impacted our communities, created barriers to education and made our families less safe.
Luckily we have leaders who get it. Please join Senator Kamala Harris, Senator Tina Smith, Lieutenant Governor Peggy Flanagan, State Senator Bobby Joe Champion, State Representative Rena Moran, and parents from around our state for a virtual roundtable event to discuss how families like ours are dealing with the COVID-19 crisis and what we can do to keep our communities safe.
This is an excellent opportunity to connect with elected officials who lead with empathy, believe in science, and put our communities first. Will you join us?
I hope to see you there!

Alex,
It’s no secret that President Trump is going to do all he can to flip Minnesota red this November. He knows that if he does, it will be nearly impossible for the Democrats to take back the White House, US Senate, and Minnesota Senate.
Every election matters, but it’s no exaggeration to say the outcome on November 3rd will decide the future of our state and country for generations.
The future is in our hands, and I know Minnesotans will rise to the occasion. But with the Trump campaign preparing to spend $30 million here by Election Day, we can’t leave anything to chance.
We must make sure the Minnesota DFL can fight until the polls close, which is why I’m asking you to join me in helping them hit their $100,000 goal by the 100 days out mark on Sunday.
If you’re able, please make a donation that works for you by the end of the weekend so we can keep Minnesota blue and bring home wins for DFLers up and down the ballot.

Alex,
It’s easy to get discouraged by the politics coming out of Washington, especially with the challenges we’ve faced this year. But through it all, I am here to say that I have never been more hopeful for our future.
I am hopeful because of you, and the millions of others like you who have rejected every one of Trump’s desperate attempts to divide us, and instead reached out to forge stronger bonds with your neighbors than ever before.
I am also hopeful because I know that if we stick together, this November, we will kick Donald Trump out of office and elect allies up and down the ballot who will help us deliver the progress we deserve.
To ensure we get the job done, the Minnesota DFL is leading impactful organizing efforts across the state, and we need to make sure they have the resources to fight through Election Day. To lock in their budget, they’re aiming to raise $100,000 by the 100 days out mark this Sunday night, and they need our help to get there.

Make no mistake, Alex. This is a coordinated effort by the Trump campaign and Republicans at all levels of government to suppress the vote. They know they can’t win on their ideas alone, so they’re trying to cheat voters out of their fundamental democratic right.
There are hundreds of thousands of mail-in ballots still outstanding in Minnesota that haven’t been returned yet, and now we need to quickly put together an education program to tell our voters to drop off their ballots immediately. If you can, rush a contribution that works for you to help us get the word out.

Friend \--WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. Postal Service has warned 46 states and the District of Columbia it cannot guarantee all ballots cast by mail for the November election will arrive in time to be counted, the Washington Post reported
May 29 it was reported: MINNEAPOLIS (WCCO) — Out of an abundance of caution, the United States Postal Service announced Thursday that it’s temporarily suspending services at select Minneapolis and St. Paul locations and that there would be no mail delivered Friday to the ZIP codes 55104, 55114, 55406, 55407 and 55408.
On August 14th Minnesota Monthly Reported: Perhaps one of the most shocking developments in the USPS debacle is the rise in apparent crimes. Reports from Minneapolis have detailed stolen mailboxes. While a connection to the 2020 election has not been proven, the thefts have made some people concerned as the number of mail-in ballots is seven times greater than the number cast in the 2018 primaries in the city.
Concerns over Voter Fraud in the 2020 MN Primaries
Ballot harvesting allows up to 3 ballots per agent of a campaign Minnesota statue 203b.08 The voter may designate an agent to deliver in person the sealed absentee ballot return envelope to the county auditor or municipal clerk or to deposit the return envelope in the mail. An agent may deliver or mail the return envelopes of not more than three voters in any election. Concerns over MN Voter irregularities
This is a very important election and every voter that wants to vote should have a chance to. The Green Parties Green New Deal calls for a Voters Bill of Rights which reads as follows:
Green Party Green New Deal Voter Bill of Rights
* guarantee us a voter-marked paper ballot for all voting;
* require that all votes are counted before election results are released;
* replace partisan oversight of elections with non-partisan election commissions;
* celebrate our democratic aspirations by making Election Day a national holiday;
* bring simplified, safe same-day voter registration to the nation so that no qualified voter is barred from the polls;
* do away with so-called “winner take all” elections in which the “winner” does not have the support of most of the voters, and replace that system with instant runoff voting and proportional representation, systems most advanced countries now use to good effect;
* replace big money control of election campaigns with full public financing and free and equal access to the airwaves;
* guarantee equal access to the ballot and to the debates to all qualified candidates;
* abolish the Electoral College and implement direct election of the President;
* restore the vote to ex-offenders who’ve paid their debt to society; and,
* enact Statehood for the District of Columbia so that those Americans have representation in Congress and full rights to self-rule like the rest of us.
This Years Presidential Election is November 3rd, 2020 Vote by mail
1. Request your mail-in ballot with a mail ballot application.
2. Fill out the application completely.
3. Submit the request to your local election office. You should request your ballot as far in advance of the election as possible. The deadline to request a ballot by mail is (received by) Monday, November 2, 2020.
4. When your ballot arrives, read it carefully and follow the instructions to complete it and return it.

Dear Green Party of Minnesota Member:
We have yet to reach at least 2,000 signatures for Howie Hawkins and Angela Walker, Greens for President and Vice President, to appear on the MN ballot. So, the deadline to sign the online petition is extended through Sunday, August 16. If you are an eligible MN voter (not necessarily registered), at least 18 years old by November 3, and have not already signed then visit this link to complete the electronic petition: [[URL REDACTED]]
We must collect these signatures and file for office by Tuesday, August 18 for Howie and Angela to appear on the MN General Election ballot. Doing so is critical to maintaining and building the Green Party of Minnesota. The Green Party of Minnesota is currently a minor party, and we must run statewide candidates in 2020 (this year there are only 2 statewide races) to at least maintain our minor party status. Getting Howie and Angela on the MN ballot is crucial to running and supporting down ballot Green candidates in 2020 and beyond.
When viewing the petition you may notice the oath has some weird and outdated language about not voting in the primary. Though, if you voted in the MN Presidential Primary on March 3 and/or if you voted in the MN Primary on August 11, you are permitted to sign. The information you provide is not kept or used for any purpose other than to submit to the MN Secretary of State for Howie, Angela, and the Green Party of Minnesota to get on the 2020 November ballot.
So, if you haven't already done so, sign now (but definitely by 11:59 on Sunday, August 16) at: [[URL REDACTED]]
Additionally, we will be collecting in-person signatures and making phone calls through Monday, August 17. If you would like to assist with in-person collection or phone calling please contact MN Ballot Access Coordinator, Seth Kuhl-Stennes, at 612.219.5581.

Friend \-- Last night Presidential debate let us know that America needs new leadership and more choices at the ballot box. Neither Trump nor Biden gave concrete answers on how to confront Covid 19. Both Trump and Biden will keep America in endless wars. Biden & Trump didn't have good answers on addressing police reform and mass incarceration. The Green Party has the correct policies for the COVID 19 Era. We believe healthcare is a right not a privelage so we support healthcare for all. We believe in Universal Basic Income and Shelter for all in a time when many Minnesotans are facing evictions and homelessness. The Greens also advocate for stopping endless wars and want to reduce military spending. Help us continue to fight the status quo in MN politics by making a donation today DONATE

Friend \--
#####  Souls To the Polls has been a voting tradition in the Black Community for over 60 years. According to [[URL REDACTED]] efforts picked up momentum during the years after World War II, especially during the era of the civil rights movement in the 1950s and 1960s. Most African Americans were denied the right to vote prior to the 1965 Voting Rights Act being signed into law. As a result, Black Americans were grossly underrepresented in the political system while simultaneously marginalized within the economy and social order through racial segregation laws.
In 1957, churches and civil rights organizations got together to sponsor the “Prayer Pilgrimage of Freedom” demonstration in Washington D.C. Organized to celebrate the third anniversary of the Supreme Court’s Brown v. Board of Education decision, which ruled school segregation unconstitutional, the event became a rallying cry for voting rights.
Speaking at the Lincoln Memorial, Martin Luther King Jr. framed the issue of voting, racial progress, and democracy in these terms:
> “Give us the ballot and we shall no longer have to worry the Federal government about our basic rights.
>
> ""Give us the ballot and we will by the power of our vote write the laws on…the statute books of the southern states and bring to an end the dastardly acts of the hooded perpetrators of violence.
>
> ""Give us the ballot and we will fill our legislative halls with men of goodwill.
>
> ""Give us the ballot and we will place judges on the benches of the South who will do justly and have mercy.” This traditions has continued in the Black commuity every election cycle including this one. GET OUT AND VOTE! SoulsTo The Polls
