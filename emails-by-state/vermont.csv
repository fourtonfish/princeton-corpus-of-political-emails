"Paul Dame, Recruiting & Training Coordinator",paul@vtgop.org,TWO Days Left,"Help me recruit a few more candidates before Thursday View this email in your browser
# Only TWO Days left
There are only TWO days left to recruit Republicans to get on the primary ballot - the easiest way to get on the ballot for November. Every year we fall short of the 150 House members and 30 senators we'd like to have to hold every single Democrat & Progressive accountable for the way they've spent their time and OUR money in Montpelier.
I have been putting in some longer hours and late nights (as evidence by the time of this email) because I am trying to do everything possible to have as many Republican candidates as possible. But I need your help.
While this might seem like a fundraising email - it isn't. (Although, if you'd rather give your money instead of you time and attention you can do that here) But I'm asking you to do something that might be harder.
Take just 5-10 minutes today to ask FIVE people you know if they would consider running as either a VT House Rep or VT Senator. It's easy to do and will only take a few minutes. You can call them, text them, email them or send them a message on various social media sites.
In fact we've tried to make it easier than ever for you to do that. Over the past few days I've been producing a few Facebook Live videos to promote our push to recruit more candidates - and they are starting to get some traction. I had a great conversation today with someone who filled out our candidate form BECAUSE they saw video #1. Check it out for yourself:
What could help us spread the message even more is if you clicked on any or all of these three videos and hosted a Watch Party while you viewed them, and INVITE other people YOU think should run for office to watch the video too. When you click on each video in the bottom right if you click on the ""Share"" button it will give you several options including ""Start a Watch Party"". You can also make a comment in each of the videos and tag 2-3 people in each video that you think should consider running for office.
Doing that could make the difference between someone running or not. It did with me.
I wasn't planning to run for office until someone sent me an email, and asked me to think about it. I didn't know what it meant, but since I was willing to be asked, I started talking to people. And the more I learned the more exited I got. Simply because someone asked me, I ended up unseating an incumbent Democrat and becoming the first Republican elected in my district in 14 years. That's my story - what could yours be?
We have a lot of long-time powerful Democrats who are throwing in the towel and retiring. They know what a mess this state is in with the upcoming budget challenges and they know they don't have the ability or resolve to guide us through these tough times. But you know people who DO have what it takes. Maybe you ARE one of those people who has faced hard and difficult times and come through on the other side better and stronger than before. Then you are exactly what the State of Vermont is looking for.
So please. Either take a moment to contact us through our website to learn more about becoming a candidate by going to [[URL REDACTED]] or click on the video links above and either start a Facebook Watch Party, or tag a friend or colleague that you know should run for office and help us restore balance and sanity to Montpelier.

VT Republican Party - Paul Dame,paul@vtgop.org,Your ticket to the biggest Republican Party in the County expires TOMORROW,"You could earn a ticket to the RNC Presidential Convention in Charlotte
Greetings Fellow Republicans,
Every four years Vermonters elect a number of our fellow Republicans to represent us on the National Stage. YOU could be one of the lucky 14 to earn a position in our delegation for this year's convention in Charlotte. All that is required is that you be a verified Republican (Member of a town, county or state Republican Committee, a previous national delegate, or a currently elected Republican) and a $25 entry fee, and click the link to submit your request so we can get you on the ballot
Being at the Republican National Convention is an amazing experience! To tell you more here are a few words from our current permanent members about what it's like to be around just about every well known Republican in the County:
""This IS the year to go to the Republican National Convention in Charlotte to help re-elect President Trump.
You work hard in Vermont to elect Republican, some fun but mostly hard work. The Convention is your chance to treat yourself. It runs from August 24 thru the 27. It’s a chance to see Senators, Members of Congress, Governors and of course President Trump and Vice President Pence. There are opportunities to actually talk with many of our elected officials and like-minded Republicans from all over the country.
You will even get to see all the national media talkers some you can ignore and dislike and some that you can maybe get a picture with.
I’m going and I hope you will join me. I often say that if you enjoy or are even frustrated with politics then you need to go at least once. This is the year.
I can guarantee that President Trump will make this the most exciting convention ever. It’s still scheduled to go on time. The Trump Train always runs on schedule.""
Jay Shepard
RNC Vice-Chair and RNC Committeeman for Vermont
""Greetings from Suzanne Butterfield, RNC Committeewoman. I really hope that Vermont will have a full contingent of Delegates, Alternates and guests to attend the upcoming Convention in N.C. this August. I remember my very first one; It was Philly in Y2K! Such an unforgettable and fantastic experience! This year is a very important milestone for our Country as we go forward to re-elect President Trump and Vice President Pence in November. I know it's a real commitment for us to go beyond our borders but the rewards are immeasurable! You'll meet and be with like-minded fellow Republicans from all over this great Nation and its Territories. You'll be introduced to and be in the company of RNC Members and its Leadership, Republican Members of Congress, present and past, and I know that the RNC will roll out the Red Carpet for us. This experience is truly priceless. In addition to the Convention itself, I intend to line up some options and some fun things we'll hopefully be able to do while in Charlotte! Sorry we never got to have our Nominating Convention this time around, but I want you to know the RNC is moving 'full steam ahead' with Convention plans in Charlotte at the Queen City's Spectrum Center. I look forward to seeing everyone there. Please contact me with any questions you may have.""
Suzanne Butterfield
RNC Committeewoman for Vermont
""I had heard from several people who had gone to the GOP National Convention tell me what a good time and how excited it was to be there. I just couldn’t see what the big deal was. In 2016 I had the opportunity to present the then presidential candidate Donald Trump at the Flynn theatre. As the convention approached I decided I would run as a delegate and was lucky to win a seat. This event turned out to be a most exciting trip for me. The energy and enthusiasm that was in the air for the entire event was incredible. Everyone who was there was spirited and experienced a moment you cannot get anywhere else during our political efforts. I highly recommend everyone attend at least one of these national conventions in their life.""

The Vermont Republican Party,paul@vtgop.org,Suspicious Vote-by-Mail Activity,"View this email in your browser
# Vote-by-Mail Begins Today!
Please be on the lookout and ready to report suspicious ballot activity.
#### Dear fellow Republicans,
Early voting in Vermont begins today, including the unprecedented process of sending every active, registered voter on the checklist a ""live"" ballot in the mail regardless of whether or not the voter requests one, and, in many cases, regardless of whether or not the person has died or moved away.
This means that an estimated 200,000 unclaimed and unwanted ballots will end up floating around the state, creating dangerous opportunities for honest mistakes, crimes of easy temptation, and organized vote fraud.
True North Reports has set up a public service page where citizens can report on suspicious ballot activity at:
[[URL REDACTED]]
#### Things to be on the lookout for:
* #### You or someone you know received a ballot at your/their address for someone who doesn’t live there.
* #### Someone other than immediate family (such a political activist) tried collect and return a ballot for you or someone else, a process called ""ballot harvesting.""
* #### Someone collecting unused/unclaimed ballots.
* Someone filling out a ballot for someone else (elderly parent, adult child, etc.), or using inappropriate pressure to get someone to vote a certain way.
If you see anything like this, again, please go to [[URL REDACTED]] and file a report.
The former Secretary of State from Colorado, a state that has been doing all-mail-in-voting for roughly a decade, recently reviewed Vermont's plan and determined that we are totally unprepared to operate a safe and secure vote-by-mail program. Our Secretary of State, Jim Condos, has put zero safeguards in place to ensure fraud doesn't occur and errors are avoided or corrected. It's up to us as citizens to be vigilant.

Deb Billado,deb@vtgop.org,Press Release: VTGOP Chair joins AFL-CIO President condemning regressive nature of TCI carbon tax,"The VT Republican Party a defender of the pocketbooks of the middle class workers joined up today with the president of the AFL-CIO to condemn the TCI
## VT Republican Party Joins AFL-CIO President, Condemning the TCI as a Regressive Tax That Hurts Working Commuters
Press Release
December 31st
VT Republican Party State Chair Deb Billado issued comments today in support of the assessment made by AFL-CIO President David Van Duesen in a recent op-ed citing the fairness problems the TCI would pose to Vermont workers.
""The Vermont Republican Party has long been working to help protect hard-working Vermonters from various tax and spend efforts that have come out of Montpelier in the past, and we continue to oppose this newest one which would further separate Vermonter's representation and their taxation. We agree with the assessment of AFL-CIO President David Van Duesen that this initiative would ""put more burdens on low-income and working class people"" and are willing to fight alongside the AFL-CIO to stop this terrible initiative from becoming practice.""
Billado continued, ""This is just another redistribution scheme, but this time the benefactors of affordable green technology have instead decided to pick the pockets of the men and women of Vermont who have no option but to get into their car and drive to work or their job site every day. Increasing the cost of gasoline doesn't help these workers, or get them to drive to work less - it just results in them paying more to a program they are unlikely to benefit from in the immediate future, or possibly ever.""
""Even in our most populated city, public transportation is underutilized and not as flexible as most workers need it to be to accommodate their work and daily life schedules. It makes no sense for workers in VT to pay additional taxes because they have to drive to work, only see to that money get reallocated in some nontransparent regional bureaucracy that is unaccountable to our Governor or Legislature. This problem becomes even more harmful when we consider that without the consent of a single Vermonter these funds could end up supporting things like bike lanes in Connecticut, or electric scooters in Massachusetts. Vermont tax dollars should not be spent outside of Vermont where they can provide little to no benefit to the Vermont workforce that pays them.""

Deb Billado,deb@vtgop.org,Press Release: VTGOP statement on Lt. Gov. Zuckerman entering race for Governor,"Vermont Republican Party Chair Deb Billado Responds to David Zuckerman’s Gubernatorial Candidacy
Berlin, VT -- Deb Billado, Chair of the Vermont Republican Party, released the following statement in response to Lt. Governor David Zuckerman’s intention to announce a bid for Governor of Vermont in 2020:
“David Zuckerman has been at the forefront of Vermont politics over the last two decades in all the wrong ways,” said Billado. “Throughout his time in the House, Senate, and as Lieutenant Governor, he has demonstrated that no tax is too large, no fee is too substantial, and no amount of frivolous spending is too great to satisfy his extreme far-left appetite.”
“Zuckerman’s record includes sponsoring and voting for hundreds of millions of dollars in tax increases on Vermonters, including a new 7.8% payroll tax (H.721 of 1998), income tax hikes on working Vermonters in the middle of the Great Recession (H.177 of 2009), a carbon tax, and many more.”
“As Lieutenant Governor, Zuckerman’s office budget grew by an astonishing rate of 30 percent over just two years, at a time when Vermonters paychecks barely budged. While state government struggles with persistent budget gaps, David Zuckerman expects struggling Vermonters to pick up the tab so he can live beyond his means.”
“And as Vermont’s unfunded liabilities surpass $4.5 billion, Zuckerman is insistent in his support for divesting the state’s pension funds from fossil fuels, which experts (including Democratic Treasurer Pearce) say could cost millions more, further exacerbating our delicate financial situation that has resulted in multiple recent credit rating downgrades.”
“If David Zuckerman intends to act as Governor the same way he has operated over the last two decades in politics, then Vermonters should hold onto their wallets,” added Billado. “Under his direction, regional economic inequalities would grow as rural Vermont falls further and further behind. The cost of living and doing business would skyrocket as taxes, fees, surcharges, and more would be levied without restraint. Overbearing regulations and red tape would prohibit Vermonters from navigating state government in a reasonable fashion. In short, the crisis of affordability would continue to spiral out of control.”
“Thankfully, Zuckerman’s fringe ideas are so out of the mainstream that the prospect of a Zuckerman Administration is nothing more than a delusion which will never come to fruition. Voters will see through his rhetoric and reject his calls for even higher taxes through their actions at the ballot box in November.”
“In the same way that David Zuckerman has been a completely ineffective legislator and Lieutenant Governor, his candidacy for Governor will closely follow his predictable pattern of reckless spending of our hardworking Vermonters paychecks.”

A Message From The Chair
# David Zuckerman: The Worst Choice for Vermont
####
David Zuckerman has been around for a long, long time. He’s been a part of Montpelier’s mess for more than two decades, contributing to every major policy blunder--from Peter Shumlin’s failed single-payer experiment to the disastrous implementation of Act 46. Now, he wants to take this failed experience to the governor’s office.
Let me be clear: David Zuckerman would be the most disastrous governor in Vermont history.
I did the math: David Zuckerman has voted for (or introduced) well over 500 unique tax and fee hikes during his time in the Legislature. This ranges from a brand new payroll tax on Vermont workers to an income tax hike to a carbon tax. There is no tax or fee that David Zuckerman doesn’t like and isn’t eager to implement on the backs of hardworking Vermonters.
But taxes and fees are just the tip of the iceberg for Zuckerman. As Lieutenant Governor, his office budget has grown by more than 30 percent over less than four years, at a time when Vermonters are struggling to make ends meet. David Zuckerman can’t contain his own office budget--do we really trust him to manage the entire multi-billion dollar Vermont state budget?
Indeed, when it comes to Vermont’s $4.5+ billion in unfunded liabilities, Zuckerman wants to divest the pension fund--something even Democratic Treasurer Beth Pearce and the non-partisan Joint Fiscal Office (JFO) has said will cost millions and is a non-starter.
Zuckerman has also been on the record questioning the science between common-sense public health measures--an especially concerning position given the current public health pandemic. How can he lead Vermonters when he is unable to discern credible facts from inaccurate information?
And when it comes to personal integrity, that’s perhaps where Zuckerman falters the most. While in the Legislature, Zuckerman admitted to repeatedly cheating the system by taking taxpayer money that he wasn’t entitled to. He’s been caught by his own Democratic opponents for lying and flip-flopping about his positions on key issues. And he’s even called into question the honor of our first responders in their response to the September 11th attacks. How can this man possibly be entrusted to be the Commander in Chief of the Vermont National Guard?
Meanwhile, as Zuckerman puts forth untenable policies for you, he’s perfectly happy benefiting as a six-figure earner. In 2019 alone, he made more than $190,000, including from major stock capital gains. There’s nothing wrong with that in theory--unless you spend your political career railing against “the wealthy elite,” as Zuckerman has. Ironically, Zuckerman’s 2019 income places him well within the top 10 percent of income earners in the United States. So much for standing up to the little guy.
Put simply, David Zuckerman is the worst kind of fraudster and political hack. He embodies the radical Progressive takeover of the Vermont Democratic Party. The credibility of his gubernatorial candidacy should be bestowed the same level of respect that he gives to the Vermonters that he seeks to tax into poverty: none whatsoever.
Sincerely,

Alex,
Last month, Joe Biden and his leftist allies gathered across the country to talk about their policies of an extremist socialist country.
We heard from countless national Democrats who exposed the Democrat Platform including AOC talking about how the country has not gone far left enough.
This week, in our State Capitol, the liberals put another feather in their cap as they passed a bill that will create an unachievable Green New Deal that bypasses the Governor, the legislature, and you!
The only way we can defeat these policies is by winning at the polls in November! We need to identify voters in SWING DISTRICTS on this issue.
Help us get the word out that Governor Scott and our Republican team want a clean environment - but not more lawsuits that will lead to Vermont's own job-killing ""Green New Deal""!
Stop Extremists

Contact: Deb Billado
Vermont Republican Party Submits FOIA Request to Speaker Johnson
Berlin, VT --
Yesterday on her public facebook page Rep. Cynthia Browning gave details to an incident that occurred on March 25th at the statehouse where she was inappropriately intimidated by one of her colleagues, Rep. Dan Noyes. In her comments Rep. Browning expressed frustration that the Speaker of the House, Mitzi Johnson did not only fail to condemn this kind of behavior, nor did she remain neutral, but instead has publicly supported Rep. Noyes despite his threatening behavior to their fellow colleague.
While it seems clear that Speaker Johnson did fail to reprimand the conduct of Rep. Noyes publicly, the VTGOP has submitted a FOIA request for any communications to or from either Speaker Johnson or her Chief of Staff Jill Krowinski that include the terms “Noyes” or “Browning” to determine what measures the Speaker took to address the inappropriate conduct.
We believe that every member of the legislature should feel safe serving with their colleagues, and the Speaker takes great responsibility in setting the tone for how business is conducted and what kind of conduct is acceptable. Vermonters deserve to know what kind of actions Speaker Johnson took or did not take to address this threatening behavior.
Speaker Johnson made it very clear she condemned the actions of Rep. Browning by punishing her conduct publicly and we want to ensure that the Speaker is also addressing the more physically intimidating conduct exhibited by Rep. Noyes as well.
Vermont law requires a response be sent to this request within 2 days.

"Deb Billado, State Party Chair",info@vtgop.org,Announcement from Chair Billado on scheduled Republican events,"Quarterly Meeting Postponed, Changes to Presidential Convention
Our executive committee met last night via conference call and decided to make the following adjustments to our upcoming events:
VTGOP State Committee 1st Quarter Meeting Scheduled for 3/28:
Token Session
The VT Republican Party will be asking members to stay home from our regular quarterly state committee meeting that was originally scheduled for this Saturday 3/28. Since our state party rules require a quarterly meeting, I will hold a token session where the meeting will be officially called to order, then abruptly adjourned without conducting any business in order to comply with our party rules.
Platform Convention (Originally scheduled for 5/16):
Postponed
This convention will be postponed until its regular time in the fall. We had tried to move the date up earlier in the year so that our platform would be established before the middle of election season, but under the current circumstances, we will have to tentatively plan for a September Convention. Counties can still elect their delegates when deemed safe and appropriate to do so and those elected members will be able to join the committee then. If your county has not elected a member, please contact me at [[URL REDACTED]]
Presidential Convention (Originally scheduled for 5/16):
Reformatted
We will be cancelling the in-person portion of our usual Presidential Convention. But the RNC still requires us to select delegates to the convention so the delegates elected to that convention will vote for our national delegates, but rather than doing so in-person it will all be done with a mailed in ballot. Further instructions are forthcoming, but plan to receive a ballot with all candidates on it, and return those ballots so they are RECEIVED at our office no later the May 14th.
Town Presidential Caucuses (Originally scheduled for 4/6-4/17):
Reformatted
The most difficult part of the upcoming events is completing the Town Caucus process. Our current rules require an in-person meeting to be public warned and held, and the results to be sent to the state party. Since we are unable to hold a State Committee Meeting, we are unable to change those rules under the given ""stay home"" order. Therefor we are advising Towns complete their caucuses as follows:
1) Each Town Chair should contact their current members by phone or email and come to a consensus about who would like to be delegates to the state convention. If there are fewer people interested then there are delegate slots available it should be an easy and simple process.
If there is a dispute we hope that those could be worked out either on a teleconference or webinar call so that by one way or another the Town Chair would have a ""slate"" of delegates from their town.
2) The Town Chair is still required to publicly warn a meeting (with 5 days notice). But we would advise the members not to attend the meeting, but to hold essentially a token caucus with only the Town Chair and possibly the Secretary. This meeting does not have to be in a public place, and could take place at the Chair's home.
3) The Caucus would be called to order the Chair would then formally adopt the slate of candidates previously agreed to and the results would be submitted to the State party.
We realize that this is not an ideal situation, but if anyone has any questions please feel free to reach out to myself, or Paul Dame ([[URL REDACTED]]) who is our Presidential Convention coordinator and he can guide you through the process. Thanks for your understanding and we look forward to doing as much as we can under the current circumstances. Let's continue to support our Republican President and Republican Governor as they deal with a challenge and such a weighty responsibility that few of us will ever know.
Sincerely,
Deb Billado

A Message From The Chair
# Imagine a World Without Police
#### Until recently, most of us have not thought much about police as we go about life. We take for granted our security in our homes, our business, on the street, at work or play. What would life be like if there were no police? What if there was no “Emergency 911”? Who would you call if your home were invaded or your child went missing?
Our founders recognized the importance of the police powers and as a nation of law and order, there must be those who insure it. The news daily reports on the malicious and unrelenting attack on law enforcement officers by thugs, anarchists, and left-wing radicals. Sadly, the Democrat party has allowed them to get away with it as evidenced by the massive murder and other crime increases in cities like Chicago and New York that they control.
Deterrence is essential for our safety and security that police presence brings. Reducing funding to police will mean more crime with less resources to deal with it. Each citizen will have to take a bigger role in their own protection. The Democrats have been trying for so long to take our 2nd Amendment rights to bear arms away, always saying we should rely on the police to protect us. Can you believe they are now saying defund or abolish the police but are ever increasing the call to take away our guns? How hypocritical and dangerous is that?
There is structural damage being done to our law enforcement organizations because of the assault on them. Fewer will want to become police officers and those that already are will want to get out as quickly as they can. That has proven to be true with recruiting down dramatically and early retirements for the force at a high level. We will never know but I so fear that so many bad things that would not have happened because the police were on the job, will now happen because for so many reasons they are no longer there as they were.
Take ten minutes and listen to an incredible video about police and what is required of them from Justice William W. Bedsworth, Fourth District Court of Appeals. It will change your thoughts on policing forever.
We must start right now to show our support for our police officers. We should treat them with respect, teach that to our children, tell them we care about them, pray for them and back them up when and how we can, even if it is only from time to time to tell them “thank you for your service”. That is beginning to happen. In Burlington, people are turning out to support their police department and that is happening elsewhere as well. Our VTGOP will be putting forth ways you can make your support known and you will become aware of them as time goes by. President Trump and Republicans are strong supporters of our police and we will never turn away from protecting you by ensuring the police will remain a strong and vital force for good.
Sincerely,
####

A Message From The Chair
## Democratic Lawmakers Seek 20%-37% Pay Raise
As if the tax-and-spend desires of Democrats under the Golden Dome weren’t apparent enough, now these same lawmakers have introduced two bills to raise their own pay. Yes, you heard that right. Even though we’re one of the highest taxed states in the nation. Even though many Vermonters are struggling to make ends meet. And even though we’re facing a more than $70 million budget gap--Vermont’s Democrat legislators want their own pay raised, and for you to foot the bill.
The first bill, H.614, introduced by Rep. Jim McCullough (D-Williston) would boost the pay of the Speaker, the Present Pro Temp, and committee chairs by 20 percent! At a time when Vermonters’ paychecks are barely keeping up with inflation, it is morally and economically outrageous for liberal leadership to get a 20 percent raise.
The second bill introduced by Rep. Lucy Rogers (D-Waterville) would pay all 180 legislators another $5,000 a year each--or a 37 percent raise! These proposals are insulting to everyday Vermonters struggling with the cost of living. Mind you that the pay the legislators do receive do not include the per diem payments they receive for housing, food, and mileage, amounts which are not insubstantial.
This isn’t the first time Vermont Democrats have played these games. In 2015, then-Representative (and now Senator) Allison Clarkson (D-Woodstock) proposed allowing legislators to bill the state for the amount of time they spent meeting with constituents, including answering their phone calls, emails, and letters. The name Public servants suggests that legislators should not be motivated for money, but apparently Vermont Democrats are.
There are things you can do get in touch with your legislators and tell them that you are dead-set against such increases. The next thing to do is to pass this message on to like minded people. Plan to run for office as a Republican in the House or Senate from your district and at a minimum be sure to vote for fiscally minded Republicans in November and support those candidates that do run. It really is time for a change in Montpelier. We cannot afford these big spenders any longer.
Sincerely,
Deb Billado

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Wednesday, June 2nd
Vermont Republican Party Issues Statement on Death of George Floyd
Berlin, VT -- On Monday, the Vermont Republican Party issued the following statement of the untimely death of George Floyd.
Today a man is dead and a nation is in turmoil. And while one more political organization issuing a statement might not be what we need right now - the silence of the VT Republican Party would be even more inappropriate.
No one deserves to die based on an accusation that remains - and will forever remain - unproven in a court of law. This is not ""Law & Order"" nor is this justice. No one deserves to die AFTER they've been handcuffed without a fair trial. No one deserves to die with the literal boot of government employees on their neck. This is especially grievous when we consider the accusation that George Floyd's alleged crime was counterfeiting a $20 bill in the middle of an economic and public health crisis after he was let go from his job following the government lockdown.
What happened to Floyd is exactly what our founding fathers went to great lengths to distance themselves from. We have a justice system that was designed to go to such extents to protect the innocent that in some cases those protections allow the guilty go free. But in this case our system is not working as designed. And this is exactly what was meant when our founding fathers spoke of forming ""a more perfect union"". There is little doubt that America was founded on better ideals than any nation has ever been. But what we see happening today is that we are not living up to those ideals.
We owe it to ourselves as a nation to do better. We owe it to the world, that if we want to continue to be the beacon of freedom - that city on a hill that Reagan spoke of - we need to make changes.
Large peaceful gatherings and protests are part of our American tradition as well - and the ideals that our founders sought to protect. The outrage that many feel in light of this injustice is understandable - even warranted. But let us not fall for the lie that one injustice can negate another. As our parents told every one of us - two wrongs don't make a right.
There are bad apples in the world. There are bad apples in our police forces, which should be brought to justice so that the majority of officers who truly serve the public interest can continue their good work. And there are bad apples mixed in among otherwise peaceful protesters, who seeks not to bring attention to an unjust death and promote a more just peace, but who instead are focused on destruction, anarchy and more violence - those must also be brought to justice.
While we have certainly seen what evil this world is capable of in the events that have unfolded - we also see a small glimmer of hope of what can be good. Sympathetic police forces showing solidarity and understanding besides peaceful protesters is an image America should be proud of and seek to encourage. It should remind us of what we are capable of when we all seek a better coordinated peace, rather than seeking purely to punish the ""other"" side or strike back. We can all get farther ahead if we are willing to listen first, and then speak calmly. Violence and aggression never win any arguments or curry any favor.
On both an individual and societal level, let us all come together and fight for truth, fairness, liberty and justice for all. Let us reject those individuals, or small groups that reflect the worst of what American is, and let us instead live and work towards a better and more perfect union for a very divided America.

A Message From The Chair
# Common Sense Vermont Republicans
Vermont has been the nation’s progressive petri dish, and when times and the economy were good we were able to go out farther and farther on a limb with new ideas – even if they didn’t work. But now that we are in the middle of a public health crisis, now is not the time for theoretical experimentation. What we need now is a return to common sense.
That’s why this week on stations around Vermont we launched a new set of radio ads asking Vermonters to consider voting for the “Common Sense Vermont Republicans” running for House and Senate.
The challenges ahead of us are serious – but they are not insurmountable. The field of Republican candidates we have fielded bring an immense wealth of financial knowledge and business background that can help get our economy on track.
At the top of the ticket for Governor and Lt. Governor we have well-established business owners like Phil Scott and Scott Milne who know how to manage the fluctuations of revenue, payroll and a host of other variables.
Also this year we have Former State Rep and State Senator Carolyn Branagan running for state Treasurer. Carolyn was so well-known for her common sense bipartisanship she was asked to serve as the Republican Vice Chair of the Ways & Means Committee even with a Democratically controlled committee. Her experience as a legislator, as a business owner, as a teacher and administrator gives her practical skills and experience to help her steady the ship in the wave of COVID stresses on state revenues. Did we mention she was also named VT Mother of the Year? What says “Common Sense” better than Mom of the Year?
Miriam Berry is running for U.S. House against Peter Welch. And who do you think might bring more valuable common sense experience to Washington in the midst of a pandemic – a nurse or another lawyer?
Also there are countless candidates running for Senate and House. People with Real Estate experience like Kumulia Long (Chittenden Senate) and Heidi Scheuermann (Lamoille-1), Restaurant Owners like Dean Rolland (Chittenden Senate) and Tony O’Rourke (Chittenden-2), Active and retire police officers like Mike Hall (Bennington Senate), Tom Nelson (Chittenden 8-1), Mark Donka (Windosr 4-1) and Jacob Holmes (Windsor 1). Farmers like Rodney Graham (Orange 1), Wayne Townsend (Windsor-Rutland), Dave Soulia (Rutland 6) and Peter Briggs (Addison Senate). Over 100 candidates, each one with years and sometimes decades of real-world experience.
For years Common Sense Vermont Republicans have been helping and serving Vermonters in the private sector, and now they are stepping up to help us in the public sector. Vermonters have an opportunity to fill our state and local government with Common Sense Vermont Republicans from the top to the bottom of the ballot – but we need your help to do so.
Make sure you get out and vote. And check out our state party web page to find the names of the Republicans in your district and commit to asking them how you can help them – so we can all get the help we need from Montpelier.
Sincerely,
####

I rarely ask such things, but please contact the governor and ask him to veto the bill. I will list his contact information at the end of this message. Why am I asking this? I do not want to make this too complicated. Suffice it to say that this law is bad for Vermont and Vermonters and has no redeeming value. You can read what I recently wrote about this law in my June 4th VTGOP Message.
Governor “Scott said he opposes current Global Warming Solutions Act legislation because it allows the state of Vermont to be sued for not meeting carbon reduction goals. H688, the GWSA bill, establishes a regulatory structure to require carbon emissions reductions across the Vermont economy. If the state fails to meet the steep reduction targets, the law allows not-for-profit groups to sue the state to force compliance.” This bill, which our governor and legislative Republicans are opposed to, will allow lawsuits that will cost the Vermont taxpayer dearly if the state does not meet the unreachable emission mandate deadlines in the bill. It will open the state to litigation, big fees for lawyers and big tax increases for Vermonters! By this law, the legislature will have abandoned its accountability as elected lawmakers and will subject our state to the rules made by an “army of regulators and enforcers needed to carry out ‘The Plan’”, a scheme that puts unelected bureaucrats and lawyers in charge, people who are in no way legally accountable to the citizens as required by our Vermont Constitution. .
Vermont is already facing major economic problems because of the businesses that were closed as the result of Covid-19. This law on top of that will be an absolute disaster and as a natural resources bill, it is a train wreck, neither good for the environment or our economy. Again, I say that by passing such a radical bill, the Democrats and Progressives in Montpelier have demonstrated that they are perfectly willing to sacrifice our state’s economic integrity in exchange for the hypothetical of an unmeasurable and unprovable reduction in global greenhouse gas emission effects.
It is so clear that in times like these we need fiscally sound minded Republicans at all levels of government. For now, and until those who truly represent the people of Vermont are elected, let us get behind Governor Scott and encourage him strongly to veto GWSA.
How can I do that? Simply email, call, or write the governor with the message, “Please veto GWSA”

VTGOP Calls on VT Democrats to Condemn Sanders’ Cuba Remarks
Berlin, VT--Vermont Republican Party Chair Deb Billado issued the following statement calling on the Vermont Democratic Party to join with their counterparts in Florida and the VT GOP in condemning presidential candidate Bernie Sanders’ (I-VT) remarks praising Cuban dictator Fidel Castro:
“Fidel Castro was a notorious authoritarian politician, infamous for his human rights violations, repression of basic freedoms, and the unimaginable economic hardship he caused Cubans,” said Billado. “The effects of his disastrous policies have continued even after his death, leaving Cubans impoverished and repressed by an authoritarian regime.
“Despite this catastrophic record, Candidate Sanders recently offered praise to Castro’s Cuban regime, perhaps as an attempt to polish yet another failed attempt to implement socialism. Nevertheless, these comments by candidate Sanders are inappropriate and insulting to Cuban American refugees and their descendants, which is why the Vermont Republican Party completely condemns them.
“Thankfully, Florida Democrats did the right thing by denouncing these remarks as well, with Florida Democratic members of Congress and the Florida Legislature pointing out the inherent offensiveness of these comments.
“We call on the Vermont Democratic Party to join their Florida counterparts and the Vermont Republican Party in condemning candidate Sanders’ misguided and uncalled for praise of the Cuban dictatorship.”

A Message From The Chair
Fiscally Irresponsible Legislative Leadership
##
## The Legislature has adjourned. That might bring a sigh of relief for you, but not so fast. They plan to come back in one month and spend more of your money. Watch out and do not let them get away with it.
Democrat legislative leadership has kicked the can down the road again. Instead of following the governor’s plan to cut back state spending on state government in response to COVID-19, the Democratic majority pushed through a bill to reverse these cuts and fully-fund more state spending.
This means the Democrat controlled legislature effectively has no plan to deal with the state’s mounting revenue shortfall in the hundreds of millions. Instead, they’re holding out hope that Congress will allow them to use CARES Act funds to plug structural budget holes, which is wishful thinking at best. That money was not meant for them to spend this way but was meant for hurting Vermonters.
So, once again, irresponsible legislative leadership has punted the tough fiscal decisions to another time. And let us be clear. This is not all due to COVID-19. We went into FY2020 facing a nearly $80 million budget gap thanks to unfunded pension liabilities, out-of-control Medicaid spending, and a bloated bureaucracy, all planned, approved, and passed by the current leadership in the legislature and their supermajority.
I predict that, in August, this will be a setup for another budget showdown. As the clock ticks and as the remaining CARES Act relief funds near their expiration date for spending, pressure will mount on the Democrat majority. Realizing that they should have cut state spending when Governor Scott told them to, they will panic. Instead of doing the right thing, they will resort to more tax hikes to cover for the bloated spending that they are unwilling to cut.
This is precisely why we must elect more fiscally sound Republicans to the legislature. We need more fiscally prudent legislators who understand that difficult times call for difficult measures, not the status quo or the failed policies of the past that got us into this mess. Unless we get serious about electing new voices in Montpelier, the Democratic/Progressive majority will take the easy way out as it always does and sneak in tax increases to pay for their unsustainable spending.
This should be a wakeup call to every Vermonter worried about their pocketbook. This November, we must send current super-majority Democrats packing, and elect more Republicans to restore balance under the Golden Dome.
Sincerely,
####

A Message From The Chair
The State of the Union is Strong--And About to be Even Stronger
On February 4th, President Trump delivered his State of the Union address before Congress. The important speech highlighted the truly monumental progress our nation has made over the last few years in a number of key areas.
Since 2017, the United States has created 7 million new jobs--shattering expectations, and leading to a record-number of job openings. The unemployment rate is at its lowest in decades, while unemployment rates for women, minorities, veterans, disabled Americans, and youth are among the lowest in U.S. history. Over the same period, 3.5 million people have joined the workforce--a stark contrast to the 300,000 who left it under President Obama. Meanwhile, millions of Americans have left food stamps and welfare as the number of jobs has skyrocketed. Median household income is higher than ever and the stock market is soaring as well.
In short: our American economy is red-hot.
Thanks to the tax cuts in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017; the creation of Opportunity Zones to help struggling Americans; the fresh start criminal justice reforms; major regulatory rollbacks; and a new trade deal that puts America first, we’ve been able to achieve tremendous economic prosperity for millions.
On the foreign stage, we’ve gained back the respect our nation once had. Alliances with crucial partners have been strengthened as America has sought to protect human rights in areas like Venezuela. ISIS leaders have been wiped out. And NATO participants are now contributing their fair-share toward defense around the globe.
And it’s about to get even better.
The President’s proposed FY21 budget achieves common-sense savings throughout the federal government, while investing in areas crucial to our nation’s future. Notably, it includes:
* Rolling back unsustainable spending in bloated departments;
* A path to lead us to an end to the federal deficit, with $4.4 trillion in deficit reduction efforts over the next decade;
* Reforms to Medicaid and food stamps that cut waste and fraud while protecting the truly needy;
* A major infrastructure investment plan to upgrade our nation’s crumbling roads and bridges;
* More resources going towards our veterans;
* Additional funds to restore key natural resources; and
* A rebuilding of the American military to secure our national defense.
Together, these crucial reforms will build on the success of the last several years, and make our nation even more prosperous and secure.
You can read the President’s full budget summary here.
Sincerely,
Deb Billado

Deb Billado,info@vtgop.org,Press Release: VTGOP Adopts Resolution on Racism,"VTGOP Adopts Reoslution on Racisim
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Wednesday, September 22, 2020
Media Contact: Deb Billado
South Burlington, VT - On Saturday the Vermont Republican Party, adopted a resolution addressing racism and highlighting the party’s long history of opposition to acts of racism.
The resolution honors the many Vermont Republican office holders, both state and federal, who acted on the abolition of slavery, supported civil rights, and the elimination of bias. The Republican Party was created by the abolitionist movement fielding Abraham Lincoln as its first candidate for President.
“The Vermont Republican Party has a proud heritage of civil rights support for over 160 years,"" said Chair Deb Billado. ""Our State Committee felt compelled to be very public about our stance in light of national events. Despite the accusations of Democrats like Joe Biden, Vermonters of color have a wide range of views, and the Republican Party has been, and continues to be a welcoming place for minorities. The increasing number of people of color running for office as Republicans this year gives testimony to that reality as well.""
The text of the resolution can be found below:
Resolution on the Republican Party’s history of confronting racism.
Whereas: The legacy of slavery and its aftermath are a stain on our Nation's history and contravene the words and the stated intent of our Nation's founding documents; and
Whereas: The Vermont Republican Party was created to support the abolition of slavery while preserving the Union; and
Whereas: Vermont Republicans such as Solomon Foot, Jacob Collamer, George Edmunds, Justin Morrill, Ernest Gibson, Ernest Gibson, Jr., Ralph Flanders, George Aiken and Julius Cannes, among others, have demonstrated by their leadership and by their actions the Party's long commitment to the abolition of slavery, the promise of Reconstruction in the post-Civil War South, the resistance to Jim Crow and the fight for the civil rights and economic freedom of Black Americans; and
Whereas: Despite the efforts of many, racism, a blight on our common ideals, continues even today in ways that negatively impact the lives of Vermont's People of Color; and
Whereas: Vermonters have witnessed national scenes of violence against People of Color and their businesses that shock the conscience, calling attention to the need to reinvigorate and continue the work begun by the founders of the Vermont Republican Party to ensure that every citizen is vested with, and entitled to, liberty and justice under the law; and
Whereas: Success in reaching that goal requires all of us to understand and recognize racism's corrosive effect on society, learn how to address it, and work to ensure that Vermont and America are welcoming to all.
Therefore, be it Resolved: That the Vermont Republican Party will continue to confront racism where ever it exists
That the Vermont Republican Party continues its 166 year commitment to treat all Americans as worthy, equal and welcome partners in our democracy distinguished by their unique contributions to our state and, individually, by the content of their character, not by the color of their skin, and
That the Vermont Republican Party and its candidates pledge to continue to reach out to people of color; welcome them into our midst and ally with them in the common effort to bring hope and opportunity to all Vermonters without regard to race, color, creed, national origin, gender, sexual orientation or disability.

Deb Billado,info@vtgop.org,Press Release: VTGOP Adopts Resolution Protecting Freedom of Speech,"VTGOP Adopts Reoslution Protecting Freedom of Speech
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Monday, September 27, 2020
Media Contact: Deb Billado
South Burlington, VT - Last week, the Vermont Republican Party, adopted a resolution addressing recent threats to various aspects of the 1st amendment's protection of the freedom of speech.
At the quarterly committee meeting last week VT Republican had no idea that days later protestors would be burning copies of a newspaper who ran a story they didn't like. But recently many of the previously norms surrounding the freedom of speech have been under attack and Republicans from across the state came together to signify their opposition to the recent threats and to commit to making Vermont a place where people are free to speak their mind and disagree.
""It was a unanimous vote, with almost zero discussion,"" said Deb Billado, State Party Chair. ""I think there were some people who were wondering if this was even necessary. But Democrats have been suspiciously silent in many cases, or they themselves have been cheering on the elimination of opposing viewpoints. Vermont Republicans believe that every point of view should be heard - even and especially the ones we disagree with. Freedom of speech is the basis for the diversity in thought that we need to solve the problems ahead of us. Shutting down one side of an argument is great for ideological activists - but it comes with terrible outcomes if your focus is good governance.""
The text of the resolution can be found below:
WHEREAS the proudest legacy of our Vermont and United States Constitutions is the guarantee
of every American to speak freely without fear of reprisal; and
WHEREAS, this legacy has been honored throughout our history, until now; and
WHEREAS, there has been an unprecedented assault on the right of Americans to speak freely,
in the form of public shaming, loss of jobs and positions, and even loss of life, and
WHEREAS, Vermont has not been immune from this assault on free speech; and
WHEREAS, a dissenter has been shouted down and a supporter assaulted at one of Vermont’s
premier institutions of higher learning, and
WHEREAS, a Vermont principal was suspended from her job because she dissented from her
employer’s political view; and
WHEREAS, certain Vermont media publications have refused to air dissenting opinions and
have publicly shamed authors with whom they disagree; and
WHEREAS, some government entities are not allowing speech that government officials
disagree with; and
WHEREAS, the term “hate speech” is being used in Vermont as a way to suppress dissent, and
WHEREAS, Vermonters expressing support for police at a peaceful assembly were shouted
down; and
WHEREAS, there can be no “conversation” about the issues of our day if dissent is suppressed;
THEREFORE, Be it Resolved that:
The Vermont Republican Party condemns the assault on free speech infecting our society and
our state; and
The Vermont Republican Party celebrates a diversity of opinions and advocates for all voices to
be heard, including all with whom we disagree; and
The Vermont Republican Party calls on all elected officials and candidates for office to support
our inalienable right to freedom of speech.

VT Republican Party,info@vtgop.org,ICYMI: Rallies coming up this Saturday,"A couple rallies some Republican may want to know about
Rallying For Our Cause!
As the countdown narrows to Election Day 2020, conservatives have two important opportunities to express support for their candidates (and cause!) in Vermont. I invite you to attend rallies this Saturday here in Vermont: a morning “Support the Police” event in Barre, at City Hall Park from 10-12; and a “President Trump Car Parade” which will depart from Williston at 2:00 PM.
Saturday Morning
Supporting the Constitution, and the Rule of Law, has never been more important than now. Organizing a rally to defend the police should be unnecessary. No one condones corrupt police behavior, especially police brutality. But the majority of Vermont’s police serve with integrity and courage, and must not be denigrated, devalued, or defunded.
Several efforts which have been made in Vermont to demonstrate support for law enforcement were shut down by “counter-protesters.” Citizens are surely free to criticize police, advocate for reduced police budgets, or publicize police abuse cases. But so too are citizens free to express support for competent, hard-working police officers. The liberty to express one’s opinion in public has come to be an issue -- embarrassingly, in Vermont.
Supporters of our police, veterans, corrections officers, EMTs, firefighters, and other public safety servants will gather at the gazebo in City Hall Park in Barre at 10:00 AM. There will be a brief invocation, a recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance, and a group singing of our National Anthem. A few brief remarks will be offered in support of our police, but the physical presence of supporters is what will impact our state and community!
Saturday Afternoon
Bring your car or truck to the Home Depot parking lot in Williston (Exit 12 from Interstate 89: near the outdoor sheds between Wal-Mart and Home Depot). Please arrive by 1:30 PM to allow time to decorate your vehicle: the Trump Parade will depart promptly at 2 PM.
Republicans across our great nation have been expressing support for our President by driving through this COVID crisis displaying American flags, and Donald Trump 2020 campaign messaging. This has increased since the President was himself diagnosed with COVID-19. Vermonters around the state have been doing their share to speak for the many who feel marginalized or intimidated for standing with our nation’s President, by regularly forming “President Trump Parades” like the one this Saturday in Williston.
Though these car parades appear quite annoying to certain citizens of the liberal persuasion, they are great expressions of patriotism and fellowship for participants. The Left may scream and swear, but Vermont conservatives are civil and humorous -- come find out!
Show Your Support!
Left-wing critics of our police slept in tents for weeks in Burlington. Please invest a few hours on Saturday attending one or both of these opportunities to stand with fellow Vermonters in the conservative cause! Let’s add our common-sense voices to the conversation, and let others know they are not alone!
God Bless America!!

A Message From The Chair
# Victims or Victors
Back in August each of the two major parties had an entire week to make their case as to why voters should support their candidates. It was a multi-day marathon that was neither reinterpreted, respun or selectively re-filtered by the media gatekeepers, and in so doing, each expressed from the heart of their party who they are, how they see America, and how they envision our future. And the contrast has never been clearer.
Democrats have distinctly chosen a dark and ominous narrative. They see America as a grim and nearly hopeless place where no one is treated fairly, no one has economic opportunity and no one can survive another 4 years of their political opponent. They say the America we love has been so totally destroyed that only a thin sliver of hope remains to save us from imminent peril. Fundamentally they view America and the American people as weak, unresilient victims of every circumstance that does or even could possibly challenge them.
Meanwhile the Republican Convention was a showcase of Americans who faced difficult challenges, or terrible odds - and because of their American spirit they over came them in victory. There is no challenge so big, there is no burden so heavy, and there is no situation so hopeless that Americans can not reach down within themselves to overcome it.
It comes down to whether you believe that America will have a brighter future giving power to the party that sees us all as potential victims - or as potential victors.
While this contrast was established months ago, it has come up again with President Trump's exhortation to Americans not to be ""controlled by fear"" after his recent recovery from COVID-19. The far-left Progressive media wants Americans to believe that this challenge is bigger than us, that we SHOULD let ourselves be controlled by fear, and we should all hide in our air-conditioned basements remote-working from our reliable high-speed internet connection and robbing our children of 60% of their weekly educational school days until the media tells us it's ok to come out sometime next year. That might work great for ivory tower liberals collecting 6-figure salaries from universities while they teach online classes. But that is not the reality that most Americans face. Not everyone can afford to live that life - nor does everyone want to.
Republicans recognize that we cannot hide from our problems and hope they blow away. This only leads to bigger, uglier, harder to deal with problems later - and less experience on how to deal with such problems in the future. We believe our best course of action is to meet our challenges head on, confident that thoughtful planning can help us transition away from victim, and into the role of victor.
Governor Scott has been a great example of having a healthy caution, and taking this threat incredibly seriously - but still having a mindset of victory over victimhood. Despite cries from liberal adversaries who wanted him to follow in lock-step with Governor Cuomo, Governor Scott and his Republican allies in the Legislature set their focus on ways we could start turning the spigot and getting our economy flowing again. Many cried for every school in the state to be permanently shut down for months and go to 100% remote learning until next year. But Governor Scott looked at the science, and heard the concerns of parents across Vermont and was determined to make sure that schools could open - and that they could open safely and responsibly.
The Republican approach has been one that has been willing to push back against the pessimistic doomsdayers that would rant on Twitter because in May they saw people standing in line for creemees. The world didn't end. When schools opened in September, there were extremely few cases, and they were all contained almost immediately with contact tracers dispatched to monitor the situation. And many children and families have benefited from this commitment to not take this lying down, not to let it paralyze us - but instead to roll up our sleeves, craft a thoughtful common sense plan, and move forward with humility keeping an eye out for any needed course corrections.
Vermont Republicans want to move the people and the economy of Vermont forward. Democrats have demonstrated that not only are they unable to lead on the issue of getting our economy going again in a safe way. But worse than that, when they have a brave, determined, careful leader like Governor Scott leading the way - Democrats are unwilling to follow his successful example.
The entire Democrat platform and approach falls apart if people stop seeing themselves as victims. If you aren't afraid of something, Democrats have very little to offer you.
But whether you already have that same mindset that Americans can overcome anything we put our mind to - or even if you are a little afraid of our current situation - both kinds of people can look to the battle-tested strength and courage of Republican Governors like Phil Scott as either joining them in their inevitable victory, or as someone who can blaze a trail through the jungle of uncertainty and get us back into the safety and prosperity of the future that awaits us on the other side of this. We need to keep focused and keep diligent, but this too shall pass, and Vermonters will overcome it together, not as victims - but as victors.
Sincerely,

VT Republican Party,info@vtgop.org,URGENT ACTION ALERT (by 2pm): Help sustain Gov. Scott's Veto,"Light up you legislator's phone! Tell them to sustain the Governor's Veto of the Global Warming Lawsuit Act!
# ACTION ALERT: Contact your legislator to ask them to support the Governor!
Legislators vote TODAY at 2pm
H.688 The Global Warming Solutions Act is an unpredictable economy-killing regulatory quagmire that would do nothing to impact climate change, and instead would enrich a handful of lawyers and the special interest groups that would employ them.
The Vermont Republican Party is proud to stand behind Gov. Scott's common-sense leadership to avoid rushing an empty and ideological vote in the middle of a pandemic right before an election.
Gov. Scott only needs THREE Democrats or Independents to change their mind to avoid a guaranteed override. YOUR Representative could be one of the people we need to hear form their constituents about this.
Usually this kind of vote is taken in non-election years so that Democrats won't feel the pressure from constituents, but early voting could start in a week and your Representative might be more persuadable than usual. For once, voters may have a bigger influence than Democratic leadership on their representatives.
If you don't know who your current state rep is, you can type in the name of your town into the toolbar at the top of the legislature's website ([[URL REDACTED]]) and it will give you the names of your Senators and Representatives (only State Reps are voting today). If you click on their name you will get their profile with their phone number and email.

Deb Billado,info@vtgop.org,Press Release: VTGOP & VT Women's Coaliton Host Rally on 9/12,"VT Republican Women Rally at the Statehouse
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Saturday, September 5th, 2020
Media Contact: Deb Billado
Berlin, VT--Vermont Republican Party Chair Deb Billado released the following statement:
To celebrate the 100th year of the passage of the right to vote for women the Vermont Republican Party and the VT Women's Coalition will sponsor an event at the Vermont statehouse commemorating the historic passage of the Nineteen Amendment on Saturday, September 12 at 10 am.
The Nineteenth Amendment to the US constitution was ratified by the final state to make it federal law following the passage of the amendment by both houses of congress with majority support from Republican lawmakers in June 1919. Women fought for the right to vote for decades starting in 1848. In 1878, Republican Senator Aaron A. Sargent, a friend of Susan B. Anthony, introduced what would later become the Nineteen Amendment.
The Vermont Republican Party and the VT Women's Coalition will celebrate its contributions toward women's suffrage by celebrating its women candidates for office, including two candidates for statewide election, five state senate candidates and twenty seven state house candidates. Deb Billado, State Chair of the Vermont Republican Party expressed her enthusiasm for the event. ""We have much to be proud of as a party for our history and the showing we have with women candidates in 2020, including women of color. From the very beginning the fight for women's right to vote came out of and was intertwined with the abolitionist movement.""
Republican women candidates for statewide office include Carolyn Branagan for State Treasurer, and Miriam Berry for Congress.
The event will include speakers to remark on the history and importance of women's suffrage and the importance of women's voices in government today.

A Message From The Chair
# Democrats in Desperation
The Democrats are on the run. They’re panicking. And in the process, they’re getting desperate.
David Zuckerman is lying about Governor Phil Scott’s record. Molly Gray and her Super PAC are lying about her own voting record, and trying to cover up the fact that she’s still an active, registered voter in Washington D.C. And interest groups like VPIRG are trying to pump money into the election to support their Progressive-Democrat colleagues.
Let me be clear: The Democrats are getting desperate because they can’t beat the Republicans with better ideas. Phil Scott, Scott Milne, and the entire Republican ticket--from House candidates to Senate candidates--are what we need to get Vermont back on track. But the Democrats are so afraid of losing their power in Montpelier, that they’re willing to do and say anything in order to get elected--no matter how foolish it may be.
The Democrats can’t run on their record of higher taxes, more state spending, or burdensome regulations because they know Vermonters are struggling as a result of the failed policies of the past. So, they’re resorting to garbage tactics to try to bring down Republican candidates who actually offer real solutions to bring our state forward.
Don’t fall for it. Instead, let’s help out our Republican candidates. Make a donation. Volunteer to make phone calls. Attend a sign wave. Or even just talk to your friends and family about the importance of voting. Email me at [[URL REDACTED]] if you are interested in helping out.
In short, do whatever you can to make sure that Vermont Republicans are successful. Because the future of our state depends on it.
Sincerely,

VT Republican Party,info@vtgop.org,ACTION ALERT: Stop Ballot Harvesting - Call before 10am!,"Light up you legislator's phone! Tell them to vote FOR the Beck Amendment to STOP illegal ballot harvesting here in Vermont this fall
# ACTION ALERT:
Call your House Rep to STOP illegal ballot harvesting and vote YES on the Bi-partisan Beck-Anthony Amendment being considered today at 10am!
The Vermont House is voting on a bill today that would change the way we vote in elections, without even a simple basic protection to secure the integrity of YOUR vote!
Please call your House Rep NOW. Not later today - but right now before 10am and ask them to vote FOR the Beck-Anthony Amendment.
This amendment would stop third party organizations from going around and scooping up any and all ballots, taking them into their own custody - interfering with the direct connection the voter should have with their municipality.
Would you want someone from VPIRG handling your ballot before it got to the Town Clerk?
If you don't know who your rep is, make sure to use the Legislature's search function and type in the name of your town. You can find the link here:
Search for a Legislator
You can also use the Ethan Allen Institute's extensive contact page here to look up your rep:
Ethan Allen Legislator Contact Sheet
The House will go live at 10am to vote on this legislation so make sure to CALL your legislator right now. Don't leave it for later, and don't send an email that might go to their junk mail folder, or just simply not get read before the vote.
Since the legislature is not physically in the building, you can't cal a single central number to get your message recorded and delivered. Your best bet is to look up your Rep's phone number and call them at home. Their home or cell numbers are usually listed in their Bio page.
If you are unsuccessful doing that, you can try to call the Sargent-at-arms, I just don't know by what means, or how quickly they get your messages to your legislator. Their number is (802) 828-2228.
Act NOW to help protect YOUR vote and the integrity of our entire system by supporting this amendment to punish people handling someone else's ballot ILLEGALLY!

A Message From The Chair
# United, We Prevail
####
On Tuesday Republicans across Vermont came together and chose the candidates they felt could best defend our values and policies into and beyond the November election. And the results of the elections couldn’t provide a greater contrast.
Every Republican candidate for statewide office won their contested primary with a majority. Every Democrat cobbled together a fractured plurality.
While the Democrats elected a gaggle of cookie-cutter ideologues who care more about increasing fuel taxes than helping Vermonters in the middle of a crisis. Republicans elected Phil Scott and Scott Milne, two businessmen at the top of the ticket who know how to prioritize, get things done and generate prosperity.
And in a year when our state’s treasury is going to be under the microscope, Vermont Republicans elected Carolyn Branagan as our party’s candidate for Treasurer who has a wealth of experience given several terms as a legislator on the Ways & Means committee. And Carolyn can bring common sense and the fiscal discipline Republicans are known for into the Treasurer’s office.
Around the state, Republican primary voters elected a promising batch of new candidates who won primaries, built write-in campaigns, or just got an early start on the November election.
Republicans will have several new women running for office, like Jeannine Young (Orleans-Caledonia) and Samantha Lefebvre (Orange 1) who won primaries to help their respective running mates (Vicki Strong and Rodney Graham) in 2-seat districts where we’ve already proven a Republican can win. These two ladies also were very engaged in the new training program we provided this year.
Republicans will also have a number of younger candidates under 40 like Josh Terenzini (Rutland Senate) and Ferron Wambold (House Lamoille 3) that are running to take back seats Republicans held for years, then recently lost in 2018.
Republicans will also be aiming high as we have three high quality candidates (Mike Morgan - Grand Isle-Chittenden, Zachary Lang – Orange 2, and Salley Achey – Rutland Bennington) who started working back in January to take out the Democrat's Speaker of the house Miti Johnson, their Majority Leader Sarah Copeland-Hanzas and the Progressive Caucus leader Robin Chestnut-Tangerman.
And that's not all. The dust hasn’t fully settled yet on the election, but there were a number of last-minute write-ins planned for other House and Senate candidates that will become official next week. But we are looking at contesting around 90 House Seats and 22 Senate seats, meaning even if we win only half of our races in one chamber, then we can shift the balance of power and put some strength behind Governor Scott’s veto in this next session. And if our candidates work hard, and the voters decide they want Republicans in the House & Senate to help get VT’s post-COVID economy back on track, we have enough candidates on the ballot to either win a narrow majority outright, or try to form a coalition with independents to move Montpelier back into a better balance.
I have a greater sense of hope and optimism for what lies ahead for the VT Republican Party than I have had in years past. There is still much work to do, for our candidates, for our volunteers and for you, our voters and donors. But Vermonters need a fiscally sound Republican Party now more than ever and from now through November we’ll be focused on doing everything we can, together to help get us back on track.
Sincerely,

# The Heartaches and Joys of Nominating a President
####
I wish to thank all our elected Delegates and Alternates to the Republican National Convention for competing, winning, and being recognized as worthy of representing Vermont Republicans in Florida. Some have already paid for travel that in most cases is non-refundable and have made other sacrifices to attend the Jacksonville reunion that had to be canceled due to public safety concerns.
There will be six of us who are fortunate enough to be taking part in the business component of the convention that will be held in Charlotte, North Carolina with 330 others from around the nation. Those of our group going there are Laura Benner, Suzanne Butterfield, Anya Tynio, Jay Shepard, Janssen Willhoit and myself.
While the ceremonial part of the convention will not occur, this part of the process is particularly important for the nomination of President Trump and Vice President Pence and is our priority and duty to America. While it is business we are going there to attend to, we just might be blessed with a chance to meet our leaders in person, shake their hands and thank them.
Those who were so looking forward to their sunshine state adventure, I would like them to think about how sweet it will be for all of us to attend the inauguration after President Trump destroys Joe Biden and his Democrat puppet masters at the polls.
I want to share some words from our Delegates and Alternates as well as note that there has not been a disparaging word heard and they are all glad for the part they are playing in choosing our president.
Lawrence Zupan expressively voiced that “Speaking for myself, I will miss the privilege of being part of history in helping personally to nominate the most important crossroads President of my not-so-short lifetime. While every Presidential election holds great pith and moment, I believe that the very survival of the Republic bequeathed to us by The Founders is in great peril at this very moment. I truly believe that President Donald Trump’s continuation as our President is, besides the direct intervention of Almighty God, the only thing to prevent the destruction of our Nation.”
Laura Benner who will be in Charlotte shared, “Although saddened that we will not be holding a traditional, in person convention, I believe that President Trump's team is working hard and will still make it special in some way. Looking forward to a WIN come November!”
Rachel Stringer echoed much the same thing as well as saying that her “…heart goes out to all people who have suffered loss during this pandemic. I respect President Trump’s decision to protect all those who would have traveled to Jacksonville. Our focus now is to work together to strengthen each other, build unity, and pray for the common good of our country and the world.”
Mark Candon hit it on the head with his feelings that “The real shame is the American public will not be able to note the easy contrast between free Republicans happily supporting an excellent team, versus the jaded press and cynical Dem party hiding their feeble excuse for reflooding the swamp.”
Anya Tynio wraps up those who shared with me by thankfully expressing that, “I am honored to serve as a delegate in Charlotte. To me, casting my vote for President Trump is equivalent to voting for a prosperous, secure, and bright future for America. I look forward to celebrating his victory in November.”
I too am honored and humbled by the opportunity you have given me to lead this group in Charlotte and to put into nomination the next president of the United States, Donald J. Trump.
Sincerely,

### June 19th, 2020
A Message From The Chair
## Republicans Truly C.A.R.E. for You - Democrats, Not So Much!
The CARES Act established the $150 billion Coronavirus Relief Fund and made payments from that fund, some of which, based on population went to the States, of which Vermont received $1.2 billion. The law requires the funds “only be used to cover expenses that are necessary expenditures incurred due to the public health emergency with respect to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Governor Scott put forth a proposal to help businesses and farms to continue to operate until they could recover from the shutdown effects of the virus. He said that “If we don't protect the businesses now and protect those jobs that are associated with those businesses, then a year or two from now we'll be suffering”.
Yet, while there is no authority for Vermont to use the funds for other purposes, the Democrat leadership of the House wishes to hold up appropriating some of the sorely needed funds in the hope that the federal government might change the rules and will allow Vermont to use some of those federal funds to deal with the FY21 budget impact that as of June 8th was expected to be a $332 million shortfall. The Democrat Speaker of the House Mitzi Johnson said “she doesn’t want to spend all of the Covid-19 dollars at once. She said she wants to have the flexibility to set hundreds of millions of the federal funds aside in the event that the federal government gives states the ability to use the money to fill holes in the state budget.” This self-centered approach by the Democrat/Progressives is in stark contrast to the VTGOP that says “Vermonters, This Money Is for YOU, Not Legislators.”
Simply put, the Grand Old Party really cares for you, but the liberal left, not so much, and how they use the “Cares” funds clearly shows that for all to see. These funds are intended to help businesses and farmers survive, but Democrats are willing to ignore that and to use the money instead to fix a state financial system that these unaccountable lawmakers broke with their out-of-control spending habits of the past and their desire to continue with more of the same in the future. Vermont farmers are hurting even more now than before Covid-19 and in May alone, 14 dairy farmers went out of business. So they can pursue their misguided folly, the Democrats want a watered-down relief package that cuts the aid to farmers by 40 percent, or $20 million of relief help that was expected and so needed.
There is even talk that the legislature wants to recess in July and come back in August to deal with other of their priorities that will hurt Vermont taxpayers even more. How can they have such nerve to even suggest that Vermont pass climate control legislation that will have little or no positive effect on the environment but will only impoverish many more rural Vermonters? Being so strapped for money how can they even think of funding the establishment of a cannabis control board to the tune of $2-3 million over a 3-year period with no expectation of revenue from sales to pay for it? Even Speaker Johnson has concerns; “… about setting up a new regulated marketplace at a time when the government is already extended because of Covid-19.” She went onto say that the new body, the Cannabis Control Board, that would be formed to regulate the market would cost “about $1 million per year” and noted that “setting up a legal pot market would require temporary deficit spending at a time when the state is already facing wide budget gaps”.  Shame on them then for even considering this at this time of tremendous health and economic stress!
The Democrats have no problem with the thought of robbing the very survival fund presented to Vermont so they can pay for the pension funding crisis they created and other failed policies. They must get their house in order by cutting spending and governing from a fiscally responsible posture.
A message must be sent loud and clear to the liberal left. Stop your reckless spending and do what is right to help the people. There are many ways to let them know you are watching them. Call or email them and better yet, vote Republican in November and eliminate the problem once and for all. We have suffered a lot at their hands, but the very reputation Vermont is famous for, its healthy wholesome products, is in danger of extinction if we do not act soon and responsibly.
Sincerely,

A Message From The Chair
## “The Chickens Have Come Home to Roost”
Vermont’s budgeting has been out of control for years. We are facing huge revenue shortfalls for both FY2020 and FY2021 in the hundreds of millions of dollars and while adding to the stress of it all, Covid-19 is not the cause. The basis for the problem we face today had its nexus in 2009 when the Democrat controlled legislature irresponsibly overrode Republican Governor Douglas’s budget veto so they could raise taxes and hike spending.
In his veto letter, Governor Douglas clearly warned against the veto and prophesied the effects that we are seeing today when he stated: “H441 is a budget that fails the most basic test: it is not in the best interests of Vermonters. It needlessly increases taxes, it does not adequately address our economic development needs, and, perhaps most importantly, creates a more than $200 million deficit in future years. For those reasons and others, I cannot allow H.441 to become law with or without my signature. If this veto is overridden, legislative leaders shall carry the responsibility of these bills effects squarely on their shoulders.”  This has set into motion the budget shortfalls that continue to this very day and the responsibility sets squarely on the shoulders of the big spending liberal Democrat/Progressive leadership.
Under the Shumlin Administration, spending increases were regularly more than underlying economic growth. Thankfully, some of this has been reined in by the Scott Administration, and efficiencies have been realized (e.g. by centralizing IT in state government, merging certain departments, and achieving vacancy savings).
But the wasteful spending policies of the Montpelier super-majority Democrats persists. Even as Governor Scott has insisted upon lower tax rates and lower rates of spending, the Democrats have banded with the Progressives to use their veto-proof majority to push through an unsustainable agenda. And now, the size of the budget gap is incomprehensible.
Governor Scott has proposed temporarily borrowing money from the state’s rainy-day fund (which has, surprisingly, grown over the past several years) to fill the gap, and then to replenish the fund down the road. This is a reasonable solution that could work if paired with spending cuts. But it is unlikely that Democrat/Progressive legislative leadership will agree to it. They will insist on raising taxes and finding ways to hike spending even more for their pet projects. The big spending liberals now see the Covid-19 crisis as giving them an opportunity and a cover for spending our tax money to fix something they are incapable of fixing.
Now, we are at another crossroads as we were in 2009 under another Republican Governor, whose sound fiscal policies were being ignored then by the super-majority Democrats. Will they now reject the sound leadership of our current Republican Governor and take us further down the road of unaffordability, forcing our productive citizens and our youth from this state because of it? Do we continue down this tried and failed trajectory? Or do we finally get serious at reining in the growth of state government?
The chickens have come home to roost and everyone knows why and who is responsible for that! It is time for a change in government leadership and the 2020 elections will provide us with a way to change course by electing Republicans at all levels.
Sincerely,
Deb Billado
Chairwoman, VTGOP

A Message From The Chair
A Time To Reset Our Priorities
It is difficult each week to come up with a meaningful VTGOP message for you. I desire to show leadership that promotes real difference in how we do Republican politics in Vermont so I strive to say things that will show that Republicanism is more than just winning a political office. There is no question that I want the Vermont landscape to become “Rosy Red in 2020” but more than that, I want to see us return to a time of true caring about those around us, many who are not as fortunate as we are or are forgotten by a world that is so busy with gaining power, influence, control or success and money.
Long before the “stay at home” orders that resulted from the Covid-19 pandemic, there were many lonely and neglected people out there. There can be no question now that there are so many more who are feeling scared and hopeless as they face this time alone or without resources to handle it.
Through no choice of our own, we have much more time on our hands to think, plan and do different things we lacked the time to do before. We could watch more TV, do a puzzle, read a book, bake a pie or take an extra nap or we might try doing something meaningful for someone else.
We could reset our priorities and remember that loved one, that friend we have not reached out to for a long time or the widow or widower up the street who may not even have relatives close by, who could use a little of that caring. Maybe a phone call, the offer to drop off some of your great homemade soup or an offer to pick up some groceries for them or just simply to express a feeling of caring and a willingness to be there if they need someone.
When considering what to publish today, I noticed a news feed on-line about the death this week of Bill Withers, a wonderful black artist and songwriter of the 1970s and it mentioned many of his songs that have “stood the test of time”, including “Lean On Me”. I went to the lyrics of that song and the words spoke to exactly what I have been feeling about the need people have as well as the need I, myself, will also have sometime in the future:
Sometimes in our lives we all have pain
We all have sorrow
But if we are wise
We know that there's always tomorrow
Lean on me, when you're not strong
And I'll be your friend
I'll help you carry on
For it won't be long
'Til I'm gonna need
Somebody to lean on
Republicans do really care and we want to make everyone’s life better, not by fostering big government to do the job, but by freeing people, under a limited government that protects them as it encourages them to
be fruitful, create wealth and happiness for all along the way. Reflecting on this made it clear to me that this time of crisis might just be the catalyst for action that will bring true Republicanism back to Vermont and America. When we care for the right reasons, people will notice and when they vote will see we have an “R” next to our name and will choose that.
These unprecedented times we are living in provide us with opportunity to reset our priorities. When we act to make someone else’s existence better and we show them we care, we will be blessed with the right to govern again as we once did. Not only that, when the time comes again, and it will, when we can embrace and hug once more, we may be pleasantly surprised at all who might want to hug our necks for what we chose to do for them now in their moments of greatest need.
God Bless you, stay at home, stay safe and show you care.
Sincerely,
Deb Billado

Deb Billado,info@vtgop.org,VTGOP & VT Women's Coalition Host Rally on 9/12,"VT Republican Women Rally at the Statehouse
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Berlin, VT--Vermont Republican Party Chair Deb Billado released the following statement:
To celebrate the 100th year of the passage of the right to vote for women the Vermont Republican Party and the VT Women's Coalition will sponsor an event at the Vermont statehouse commemorating the historic passage of the Nineteen Amendment on Saturday, September 12 at 10 am.
The Nineteenth Amendment to the US constitution was ratified by the final state to make it federal law following the passage of the amendment by both houses of congress with majority support from Republican lawmakers in June 1919. Women fought for the right to vote for decades starting in 1848. In 1878, Republican Senator Aaron A. Sargent, a friend of Susan B. Anthony, introduced what would later become the Nineteen Amendment.
The Vermont Republican Party and the VT Women's Coalition will celebrate its contributions toward women's suffrage by celebrating its women candidates for office, including two candidates for statewide election, five state senate candidates and twenty seven state house candidates. Deb Billado, State Chair of the Vermont Republican Party expressed her enthusiasm for the event. ""We have much to be proud of as a party for our history and the showing we have with women candidates in 2020, including women of color. From the very beginning the fight for women's right to vote came out of and was intertwined with the abolitionist movement.""
Some of the Republican women featured there will include State Party Chair Deb Billado (the only female chair of a major party in VT) as well as House Republican Leader Patty McCoy and our Republican Congressional Candidate, Miriam Berry.
The event will include remarks on the history and importance of women's suffrage and the importance of women's voices in government today.

A Message From The Chair
“MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN” AFTER COVID-19!
I have been asked what will life be like in Vermont after the Covid-19 lockdown restrictions are completely lifted, the economy is restarted and people attempt to return to what they once considered normal living? I doubt that anyone and that includes me would know but I have some hopes and some concerns. I use the word concerns instead of fears, for fear is what is driving our reactions now and fear can only lead to bad endings.
Few could have imagined the impact that this unseen thing, the Covid-19 virus, could have on our state, our nation and indeed, the entire world! Just two months ago the nation’s prosperity seemed to be unstoppable with unemployment of all, including minorities, at all-time lows, job creation, wages and opportunity at all-time highs that included a stock market breaking record high levels on a regular basis.
During past difficult times, I have seen things that were severe and tested the will of the people, but I knew we would get through it and that our government was there to protect us as we picked ourselves up and went on with our lives. That included wars, diseases and economic downturns. I am an optimist by nature so I would say that such an attitude should be what I am feeling now but it is not. I see the possibility that all the challenges that were there before the crisis will remain and will be deepened in the wake of the pandemic. I cannot, having lived in Vermont and being very involved in daily politics, help but view what is happening through a filter of twenty years of misguided Democrat controlled government. Yet as a Republican and knowing what we stand for, I remain hopeful that we can get the train of good governance back on the tracks.
What we should do when the emergency has ended must be not to allow worshipping, schooling, legislative voting, meetings, being with our loved ones when they are old or sick to occur only on-line. If we are to use that online tool, we should do so because it is best for us and we should control that instead of it controlling us. The First Amendment free exercise of religion is restricted when the people cannot meet and corporately worship in the house of God that they built. We learn better in school with hands on teaching techniques. Our elected representatives are more accountable when, as the Constitution requires, they meet at the statehouse and allow personal interaction with the voters. We accomplish things better when we meet in person, look into a person’s eyes and read their body language. We must be able to touch and care for our loved ones. That is what humans are about. That is our strength! Dealing on-line alone with these things is so impersonal and will not bear the fruits we expect from our human experience.
My hope is that we will defeat this unseen enemy or at least control it so we can get back to meeting, greeting, hugging, shaking hands, not worrying about every move we make. The sound hygiene habits we have learned are good things that came from this and will keep us safe from other pathogens that are out there.
The recent shock coming from Jeb Spaulding’s announcement regarding possible closing of VSC schools is an example of the poor foundation the programs controlled by the Democrat/Progressives were built on. It is as if they built it on sand and when the winds and rain came, the structure could not stand. The Covid-19 pandemic was a head-wind that showed the weakness of the system that these liberals have created. It didn’t take long for the Chancellor, blaming the virus, to announce the closing of these campuses. The fiasco of the VSC system should be a wakeup to people to see the ineptness of the left. What will we see next that will require a bail out? Pensions, K-12 education and more await the dire outcome predictions from those who made the problems in the first place.
We must look out for our own. We are 30,000 students short and that number increases each year. We abort our babies; we encourage our seniors to use physician assisted suicide, drug overdose deaths are truly epidemic and we wonder why we have too few people and that our state is failing as a result. We create no opportunities for our youth and we close their schools. How can we expect to have the young stay and become productive citizens filling needed jobs when we do this?
What I would love to see is a transformational event to occur that will reshape the direction that Vermont will go in the future. We must get the economy rolling again. Vermont is a wonderful place to raise a family. It is a healthful environment and not crowded. We naturally social distance here. We must be mindful of disease, of our health, of our hygiene. I think this crisis has brought that to the forefront in people’s minds and doings. That is good. But we cannot live in a bubble. We must take some chances. Now more than ever we must be protective of our liberties and must stay true to them as we wisely move back into the societal contacts, caring and production that made America great.
The statement coined by President Trump is needed more now than ever. We must and will with Republican leadership “Make America Great Again”.
Sincerely,
Deb Billado

A Message From The Chair

From Distinguished to Disgusted
The world changed 19 years ago today.
Nothing had really prepared us for this kind of attack on American soil.
But just because we hadn't prepared for it - didn't mean we didn't respond.
Just minutes after the first plane hit New York's first responders went in to action.
Police, Firefighters, EMTs raced to the scene.
Those courageous men and women ran IN to a burning building, while hundreds were trying to get OUT.
Many of them left their families that morning having no idea of what they would encounter, and what they would have to sacrifice.
Thousands died that day. Many were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time - they just didn't know it. But others KNEW it was the most dangerous place to be at the time - and they went in anyway, because it was their job. Not just a job, but their duty, for some - even their calling.
Many died in the collapse. But many lived. And we wrung out our hearts to those whose bravery few of us will ever encounter, let alone summon within ourselves. They were heroes. True, unequivocal, undeniable heroes. And they were honored and distinguished in a way that they hadn't been before, not because they didn't deserve it before - but simply because we didn't know what a treasure we had, until it was put to the test.
For a time shortly thereafter, when people went to NYC they didn't want a Yankees hat, or a Mets hat. They wanted to support even greater heroes with four simple standard-issue letters: NYPD or NYFD.
Many of those kids who sat on the shoulders of their parents at annual ceremonies honoring such bravery in the face of danger determined that they too would one day prepare themselves to make the commitment to a life of service to protect and serve people the way these giants had. And we all joined together saying ""We will never forget.""
Nearly twenty years later these young men put on the same uniform. They wear the same badge. They walk the same streets. But they don't get the same honor.
In their young lifetimes, police officers have gone from distinguished to disgusted. They remember the days when their Mayor and their Governor honored and supported them as the ones keeping New Yorkers safe. Today they have been abandoned.
When the men and women of 2001 made their sacrifices, they may have not known exactly what they were signing up for - how bad it could potentially be. But every police officer today knows what could be required of them - and they signed up anyway.
Instead of being valued and appreciated for doing a tough, grueling, physically and emotionally demanding job that literally puts your life in danger for modest pay, today law enforcement officers are always assumed to be wrong, hot-headed, vindictive, racist, or have any other number of negative character traits. We all assumed the best, and now many assumed the worst.
Many who are old enough have had enough. Nearly the entire leadership of the Rochester City Police Dept have retired or resigned over constant attacks. Same for officers in Buffalo, Dallas and Atlanta. Even in little old Burlington, VT the interim Police Chief is stepping down because the elected officials in power are unwilling to stand up and support the very people who help keep everyone safe.
Frankly they've been disgusted at what has happened to our attitude towards the most basic and necessary function of government. If we don't have personal safety we don't have personal freedom.
Surely, as in any profession, there are some bad eggs. An in those cases where police officers, who have an incredible privilege of power and authority granted to them, are found to have abused that power and authority they should be dealt with severely. But America was built on the grounds that being dealt with justly is more important than being dealt with severely.
Just because they wear a badge doesn't mean that they give up the right to due process. The media and opinion machine get so cranked up that they deliver a verdict before half of the facts come in. And when it comes to police officers the verdict always seems ""Guilty - even if proven innocent"". This is unfair to the men and women who have made such a sacrifice. They deserve at least equal treatment under the law.
Losing the protection and safety that the police provide to us will be a great danger but there is an even greater danger as well. If liberal partisans can gang up and tear down the once honorable and laudable role of police officers, even working to get them fired from their job - then they can just as easily go after you.
We're not going to go back to the days before 9/11, when the world was innocent. But I think that we must commit ourselves to moving forward to a better balance in society than where we find ourselves today. Bad police officers who usurp due process on suspected criminals need to be held accountable. But that's because we value due process. And because we value it, we must extend it to the same men and women in uniform who we ask to defend that standard for us. Is there any greater injustice than asking police to ensure due process for potential criminals - and then to turn around and deny the same due process for them?
Due process matters for Black Americans. Due process matters for police. Due process matters for any American that holds the Constitution in high regard. And if we are going to unite our country and survive our current crisis we have to take the same values we cherish, and extending them to one another. We must do it every day. And we must never forget.
Sincerely,

Deb Billado,info@vtgop.org,Press Release: VTGOP calls on Sen. Sanders to release tax and medical records - as promised,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Tuesday, February 24
Vermont GOP Chair Calls on Sanders to Release Health and Tax Records
Berlin, VT--Vermont Republican Party Chair Deb Billado issued the following statement calling on presidential candidate Bernie Sanders (I-VT) to release his health and tax records:
“Americans deserve to know the well-being of their leaders,” said Chair Billado. “At 78 years of age, Bernie Sanders would be the oldest president to be elected in the history of the United States. Yet, despite his past promises, Sanders refuses to release his comprehensive medical records. This is especially troubling considering the candidate’s heart attack within the last year.
“The stress of the presidency cannot be understated, and all voters deserve a leader who is physically up to the challenges of the job. The refusal by candidate Sanders to release his medical records should be concerning in the minds of all Americans. Potential voters are rightly asking themselves: ‘What is he hiding?’ Sanders should release these records to fully inform both primary and general election voters.
“In the spirit of transparency, Sanders should also release his full 2019 tax returns (as soon as they are finalized). Given Sanders’ recent attacks on billionaire Mike Bloomberg, voters have a right to know the income of potential Democratic nominee for President, and a frequent critic of high-net worth individuals.
“It is notable that Sanders’ previous attacks on ‘millionaires’ have been replaced by his emphasis on ‘billionaires’--perhaps due to the immense wealth he has successfully accumulated in the capitalist economy he is all-too eager to disparage. Few Americans are fortunate to have three homes, including two just miles from one another (one in Burlington, VT and one in Grand Isle, VT).
“Additionally, in a 2016 filing, Sanders indicated that 100 percent of the proceeds of his 2011 book went to charity. Sanders should release the names of the charities which received the funders in order to verify the validity of this claim.
“As this campaign progresses, candidate Sanders will surely continue to condemn the successes of those who have profited from our free market system, just as he has. While Sanders is free to do so, he owes it to voters to be honest and transparent about his own financial and health situations. Candidate Sanders should release his health records, 2019 tax return, and 2011 charitable contributions as soon as possible.”
""With Vermonters set to vote in next week's Presidential Primary, Sen. Sanders owes it to the people of his own state to make good on the promise he himself made to release these records ""before the first votes are cast"". He has only one week left to keep his promise to Vermonters.""

VT Republican Party,info@vtgop.org,"Op-Ed: Zuckerman is the problem, not the solution","Zuckerman's latest email shows why he is a poor choice for Vermont
Zuckerman Is the Problem, Not the Solution
David Zuckerman’s latest fundraising letter seeking to capitalize on the minimum wage veto fight is jaw dropping in its deception.
He opens lamenting the high cost of living in Vermont, high rents, and a lack of good paying local jobs — every one of which can be traced back to Progressive policies Zuckerman has supported. High rents? Thank Progressive “green” policies that make it difficult to build new housing stock at all, and when you are allowed to build, make it more expensive to do so. As we speak, Zuckerman and his Progressive colleagues in the senate (of which he is president) are making “reforms” to Act 250 that will require any new construction to be “carbon neutral”, as well as steering any new housing projects away from the countryside and into urban centers where real estate is most expensive. What do you think this will do to already high housing costs? High electricity costs? Thank Zuckerman-supported renewable energy mandates. High childcare costs? Thank Zuckerman-supported policies kowtowing to the NEA. We could go on and on.
He and his colleges are now advocating for an interstate carbon tax on gasoline and diesel fuel called TCI that will drive up the cost of getting around and doing your job. They have a plan to make Vermont use 100% renewable energy that comes with a price tag of $1.2 billion just for the infrastructure, not including the increased cost of energy. From big ticket items like this to small nickel and dime inconveniences like forcing stores to charge you 10¢ for a shopping bag, is how Zuckerman goes about making Vermont “more affordable.”
With similar nonchalance, Zuckerman calls the minimum wage bill Governor Scott just thankfully vetoed “modest,” “gradual,” and “scaled back”. It is none of these things. Modest? How is a 15% increase modest? Gradual? Doing this over just two years is not gradual. (For comparison, Vermonters are looking at a 4-6 percent property tax increase to pay for public schools this year. Ask yourself if you think that increase to your tax bill is modest and gradual. Because it’s nothing compared to how this minimum wage increase will impact our small employers.) And Scaled Back? This is the biggest fraud of all. The original plan backed by Zuckerman and company called for $15 an hour in four years. Their idea of “scaled back” is to go half the distance in half the time. Then they’ll take the other half. They have said as much on the House floor! It’s no compromise at all, just accounting and political smoke and mirrors. Don’t be fooled.
What Zuckerman and his colleges don’t understand, or don’t care about, is the fact that government cannot give to anyone without taking away from someone else first. So, for example, by mandating a higher wage for minimum wage earning childcare workers, giving them a roughly $5000 a year raise, Zuckerman is taking that money away from young parents who need childcare. By giving a raise to minimum wage healthcare workers, Zuckerman is taking $87 million away from senior citizens who require healthcare services through Medicaid. And, not to mention that after you factor in the increased taxes these low wage workers would pay on a higher income and the loss of benefits due to pricing out of qualifying for things like childcare subsidies, the workers Zuckerman ostensibly wants to help, wouldn’t end up with much more, and in many cases will wind up with less. Given the economic shockwave this would create, it becomes a lose/lose proposition.
Vermont Republicans want people to earn more money too. The best way to do this is to grow the economy, generating more wealth and opportunity for everybody, and to let people keep more of what they earn rather than taxing us all to death. And, if we really need to get more dollars into the pockets of low income workers in the short term, a better way to do so than the minimum wage would be to simply increase the earned income tax credit. This would put more money in pockets without triggering a loss of benefits due to the “benefits cliff"" or creating perverse incentives for employers to cut workers hours, benefits, or jobs to meet budgets. The forty-three Republicans in the House made this recommendation, but it sadly fell on the deaf ears of over one hundred Democrats/Progressives.
Zuckerman finishes his appeal by noting. “I have been fighting for legislation that would lift up working families since I was first elected in 1997.” Over that time he has had large majorities, even super-majorities, of Democrats and Progressives in the legislature to make that happen, as well as Democratic governors, and currently every statewide and federal office holder. So, big question for the voters: how’s this working out? Are you feeling lifted up? Or are you feeling beaten down by what David Zuckerman and his colleagues have done to you over the past twenty-three years?

A Message From The Chair
A Time To Reset Our Priorities
It is difficult each week to come up with a meaningful VTGOP message for you. I desire to show leadership that promotes real difference in how we do Republican politics in Vermont so I strive to say things that will show that Republicanism is more than just winning a political office. There is no question that I want the Vermont landscape to become “Rosy Red in 2020” but more than that, I want to see us return to a time of true caring about those around us, many who are not as fortunate as we are or are forgotten by a world that is so busy with gaining power, influence, control or success and money.
Long before the “stay at home” orders that resulted from the Covid-19 pandemic, there were many lonely and neglected people out there. There can be no question now that there are so many more who are feeling scared and hopeless as they face this time alone or without resources to handle it.
Through no choice of our own, we have much more time on our hands to think, plan and do different things we lacked the time to do before. We could watch more TV, do a puzzle, read a book, bake a pie or take an extra nap or we might try doing something meaningful for someone else.
We could reset our priorities and remember that loved one, that friend we have not reached out to for a long time or the widow or widower up the street who may not even have relatives close by, who could use a little of that caring. Maybe a phone call, the offer to drop off some of your great homemade soup or an offer to pick up some groceries for them or just simply to express a feeling of caring and a willingness to be there if they need someone.
When considering what to publish today, I noticed a news feed on-line about the death this week of Bill Withers, a wonderful black artist and songwriter of the 1970s and it mentioned many of his songs that have “stood the test of time”, including “Lean On Me”. I went to the lyrics of that song and the words spoke to exactly what I have been feeling about the need people have as well as the need I, myself, will also have sometime in the future:
Sometimes in our lives we all have pain
We all have sorrow
But if we are wise
We know that there's always tomorrow
Lean on me, when you're not strong
And I'll be your friend
I'll help you carry on
For it won't be long
'Til I'm gonna need
Somebody to lean on
Republicans do really care and we want to make everyone’s life better, not by fostering big government to do the job, but by freeing people, under a limited government that protects them as it encourages them to be fruitful, create wealth and happiness for all along the way. Reflecting on this made it clear to me that this time of crisis might just be the catalyst for action that will bring true Republicanism back to Vermont and America. When we care for the right reasons, people will notice and when they vote will see we have an “R” next to our name and will choose that.
These unprecedented times we are living in provide us with opportunity to reset our priorities. When we act to make someone else’s existence better and we show them we care, we will be blessed with the right to govern again as we once did. Not only that, when the time comes again, and it will, when we can embrace and hug once more, we may be pleasantly surprised at all who might want to hug our necks for what we chose to do for them now in their moments of greatest need.
God Bless you, stay at home, stay safe and show you care.
Sincerely,
Deb Billado

A Message From The Chair
# Get Out The Vote
The 2020 election is just days away--and the stakes have never been greater. Your choice on the ballot isn’t just a choice between Republican candidates and Democratic candidates.
It’s a choice between greater economic prosperity, or more economic hardship. Between a more affordable climate to work, run a business, raise a family, and retire, or a continually rising cost of living. Between the Vermont values of frugality and self-reliance, or fiscal irresponsibility and government intrusion. Put simply, the choice couldn’t be more clear.
This year, we have an opportunity to win back statewide offices, and make crucial gains in the State Legislature. The importance of these victories to not only our party--but also the future of our state--cannot be understated. With a near-record number of Republican candidates running for office, the wind is at our backs. But we need your help to get us over the finish line.
First, and most importantly, we’re counting on you to vote. You can either drop off your ballot at your Town Clerk’s office, or vote in person on Tuesday, November 3rd. But it’s important to have a vote plan--and you can check out where your polling place is located by clicking here.
Second, we need you to help get out the vote. Talk to a friend, neighbor, or family member and remind them of the stakes in this election. If we each help get five people to the polls, we can boost Republican turnaround by enough to produce an incredible victory.
Third, we need you to help support our get out the vote efforts in our final days of the campaign. To help us with our election day operations, you can make a contribution by clicking here.
Fourth, we need volunteers. Whether you’re able to participate in one of our final sign waves in support of local candidates, or bring signs to your polling location, we’re counting on your help. Click here to inquire about ways you can assist.
The stakes have never been higher, and the choice on the ballot is clear. Let’s bring our statewide and legislative candidates over the finish line with a strong showing on Tuesday so we can turn the tide in Montpelier!
Sincerely,

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
VTGOP Mourns Loss of Rep. George Shaivone
Berlin, VT--Vermont Republican Party Chair Deb Billado issued the following statement after learning of the passing of long time Republican leader and legislator George Shiavone.
While Primary Day can be a buzz of excitement this year Republicans were sobered by the loss of one of their most beloved Republicans, Rep. George Schiavone.
Schiavone was elected in 1992 by the people of Shelburne and served until he stepped down in 2005 to better fulfill his duties to the Republican Party as their National Committeeman, a position he held until 2012. Considering George's service as a model legislator for Vermont Republicans he was a natural and fitting choice for the annual George Schiavone Legislator of the Year Award.
George was a down-to-earth, eager-to-laugh friend to everyone he met, on both sides of the aisle. He was always one of the Republican Party's biggest cheerleaders who found himself attending nearly every pancake breakfast and spaghetti dinner hosted by any Republicans within driving distance. He also served as the Town Chair for the Shelburne Republicans and was involved as a regular member until the day he died.
In addition to serving his party, George was also a devout servant of his community. He was an active member of the Shelburne Rotary club where he often volunteered to varying degrees on several projects.
Below are a few thoughts from some of his colleges:
VT National Committeeman, Jay Shepard
""George was truly a great man who served his Country, his State and especially his friends well. When I was elected National Committeeman after George retired, many said there is no replacing George. They were right! A mentor and a friend that I will miss""

A Message From The Chair
# Re-imagine Schooling
#### By executive order of Governor Phil Scott, school is now officially to begin on September 8th. At first glance there seems to be little reason to doubt that it will, especially considering the support for in-person teaching by the governor and the Department Commissioner of Health, Mark Levine. And after all, children are the least likely among us to suffer any illness from the Covid-19 virus and Vermont’s rate of infection is low. Our children have been spared of the deadly effects. The death rate for school age children percentage wise is essentially zero. Yet, there is doubt being raised by many school administrators. It is reported that many teachers and other support staff are balking at coming back to work and some say staffing will be insufficient to handle in-person teaching.
Officials overreacted and shut down an entire economy back in March that resulted in much more pain, suffering, illness, and loss of life than the disease caused, without protecting us from transmission. We just learned that the economy contracted to a greater degree than ever before in our history in the second quarter. We cannot repeat that mistake! We should have learned a lesson from that to apply to our opening of schools for in-person teaching. Children need to be in school and parents need to be able to go to work.
We must be smart and protect the vulnerable students, teachers and staff. We can do that with reasonable precautions to reduce the likelihood of transmission. We must not, out of fear and the quest for an impossible 0% infection rate, destroy one of our most critically needed institutions.
Our children must get a quality useful education to compete in an ever increasingly complex world. That will not happen when real solutions and rational thought give way to unworkable education delivery gimmicks. We must not over-react and turn school into one frenetic futile protective activity after another while losing track of the need to educate the children.
There are those right now in Vermont considering and working toward forsaking school in school houses and teaching students outdoors. Education is not just an outdoor field trip! Can they really be serious? In Vermont? In the winter? What about toileting? What about eating? Just think about it all and when you stop shaking your head in disbelief, realize that some are serious about this. “I want my mommy” will be a cry heard throughout the state.
The time is now to re-imagine education since public schooling has failed us in so many ways. Home schooling applications are up 75% in Vermont over last year and many are finding that option better meets the educational needs of their children. I have heard homeschooling referred to as the “new revolution”.
More parents are now considering private schools. Even religious schools are more available to students. Recently, in a landmark case, the US Supreme Court in Espinoza v. Montana Dept of Revenue, ruled that public funds used for scholarships to private schools cannot constitutionally be denied just because the school is religious in nature. Other states have led the way in micro schooling where up to ten students come together to do school. Charter schools have joined with home-schoolers to give them in-school options.
That still leaves many, to endure a failed public school system. School choice vouchers must be expanded to give all parents the ability to fulfill their hope to send their child to the best school possible. Let competition reign! Redirect our tax money to a vital and exciting new educational paradigm. Just imagine it!
Sincerely,
####

# Change in the Treasurer's Office
$4,700,000,000.
That’s how much we have in “unfunded liabilities” across the state employees’ and teachers pension systems and other post employment benefits (OPEB). That’s more than $7,500 for every man, woman, and child in the state of Vermont. And that’s the legacy that Vermont’s Treasurer for nearly the past decade will leave behind.
Indeed, Treasurer Pearce has done very little to combat our mounting unfunded liabilities. If anything, her decisions have exacerbated the problem.
First, she’s been unwilling to even consider the adoption of a defined contribution system for new hires--something that more than a third of other states have switched to. A defined contribution system places far less strain on state coffers than the current defined pension plans. But, the benefits are not guaranteed for state retirees--just the amount contributed into their funds.
Naturally, Vermont’s labor unions would oppose this. Perhaps that’s why they’ve donated to Pearce, and why she’s, in return, fiercely resisted defined contributions, despite the urging of experts like Gov. Jim Douglas and Capital Debt Affordability Advisory Committee member David Coates, along with many others.
The State of Vermont already offers a defined contribution for the 600 or so exempt employees, like elected officials and their employees. It’s unfunded liabilities? Zero.
Second, Pearce has previously employed and touted the disastrous select-and-ultimate system, which unfunded pensions for a period of three years, accounting for roughly 10 percent of today’s unfunded pension liabilities.
And third, under Pearce, rates of return on pension investments have been widely overestimated, leading Vermont to fall into the ranking of the Top 10 Worst Performing State Pension Funds.
Under Treasurer Beth Pearce’s watch, we’ve seen our funded ratio decline, our credit rating downgraded (twice), and our pension investments struggle to reform.
Now, to be fair, all the blame can’t be placed on Pearce’s shoulders. Indeed, Governor Howard Dean drastically underfunded the pension fund during his tenure, contributing to the current crisis today. It wasn’t until Jim Douglas was Governor that we finally started fully-funding our pension obligations. Douglas’s tradition of fiscal prudence has continued under Governor Scott, who has actually pre-funded certain obligations and paid off interfund loans.
But Pearce can’t blame the current situation on her predecessors. She shares the preponderance of the responsibility for our current unfunded liabilities crisis. Yet when she’s challenged on it, she doesn’t own up to her mistakes.
It’s time for voters to hold her accountable this November, so we can restore fiscal sanity to the Treasurer’s Office.
Sincerely,

VTGOP Mourns Loss of Rep. Bernie Juskiewicz
Berlin, VT--Vermont Republican Party Chair Deb Billado issued the following statement mourning the loss of long time Republican Representative Bernie Juskiewicz.
Republicans all over the state are mourning the loss of a respective, robust and no-nonsense voice that Vermonters had in the Statehouse today as they have heard of the news of Rep. Bernie Juskiewicz passing away after complications that arose from COVID-19.
Juskiewicz was elected in 2012 by the people of Lamoille-3 District (Cambridge and Waterville) and served for three consecutive terms. Being widely beloved by his district Juskiewicz was unopposed during both of his re-election campaigns.
As a former School Board member, Bernie served with distinction on the House Education Committee for two terms before moving to Appropriations, and oversaw a number of educational reforms, and was instrumental in a shift of joining education policy with education taxes.
Bernie was beloved by everyone who served with him, on both sides of the aisle, for his frankness and willingness to call it like he saw it, regardless of who was saying it.
Bernie began a career in Accounting and Management with IBM in East Fishkill, NY, and transferred to Essex Jct. in 1978. Upon retirement he worked as District Manager for the Department of Employment and Training. He has served on the Lamoille Union High School Board (15 years), Cambridge Elementary School Board (5 years), Cambridge Selectboard (5 years), Cambridge Recreation Board, Reparative Board, coached Little League, basketball, soccer and was a founding member and first Vice President of Lamoille County United Way. Bernie also served on the following boards: Cambridge Regional Health Center for eight years (President), Vermont Golf Association for eight years (Past President) and the Cambridge Town Finance Committee for 22 years. Member of the House: 2013- 2018.
Below are a few thoughts from some of his colleges:
House Republican Leader Pattie McCoy:
As a Freshman Legislator, Bernie took me under his wing and taught me how to navigate the Legislature. Bernie’s strength was his ability to see a problem from all sides to try and come to a consensus with all parties. His passion for all things education, from elementary through college, was unmatched. He championed for UVM as a Trustee of our flagship university.
All of the above pales in comparison to Bernie’s wit, humor, smile, laugh and most of all, his friendship. My nightly dinners during the session with Bernie and Larry Cupoli were times I cherish. These dinners were a way of unwinding at the end of long legislative days, filled with good food and lots of laughs shared with two good, good friends. All Vermont House Republican Legislators will miss him. We are better people, and Legislators, for having known him. Godspeed Bernie.
Former House Republican Leader, Don Turner
“Bernie was a valuable member of our caucus, great legislator and a good friend. Bernie served several years on the House education committee before being assigned to the appropriations committee. Having served on his district school board for many years he was a natural fit on the education committee. His lifelong commitment as a dedicated community servant prepared him well for the legislature. This abundance of practical experience made him an essential part of our caucus. Bernie was a friend to many and we will surely miss him dearly.”
Dedication Story- Bernie was in the hospital for an undetermined medical issue over the weekend and we had an upcoming veto override vote scheduled on Tuesday. We knew the vote would be very close, he called me on Monday to let me know that he was out of the hospital but his doctor didn’t think that it would be a good idea for him to drive to Montpelier. After some discussion, he told me he felt like he was letting the team down so, I suggested that maybe I could find someone to drive him down to vote and then leave. He thought about it briefly and then said yes. I found him a ride, he came down voted with the caucus which allowed us to sustain the Governor’s veto by one vote and then went home. Bernie was a solid man and team player. I will miss him.
Rep. Larry Cupoli:
""Bernie was just a wonderful guy who cared about people. I remember when we met that first time at orientation, we happened to sit next to each other, and he struck up a conversation that ended up being an amazing friendship from that first moment. We served two terms together on the Education Committee, and whenever we went somewhere he would always introduce the two of us as ""The Lee Brothers: Homely & Ugly"" so we had a lot of fun, a lot of joking around.
But Bernie was intensely focused on working hard, and doing all the right things all the time. He was trying to look out for everyone and do his best whatever he was doing. He was that kind of a fellow. He was truly, truly engaged in whatever he did. He served on money committees, both in Education, then Appropriations - so sometimes those discussions can get a little hot. But Bernie always treated everyone with respect. He had a great ability to calm people down, and to be the voice of reason. Bernie did so many other things too, its hard to count. He was still serving as a Trustee for UVM, and a lot of people don't know this but he was working hard for the commissioning of the USS Vermont, which is a Nuclear submarine that, was originally supposed to be commission this weekend. It's too bad he didn't get to see it.
He was such a good friend. Bernie never had a brother, but we spent so much time together, not just in the legislature, but outside too. He will be missed.

# Fight the Good Fight
Last night in the State of the Union Address, President Trump gave one of the most unifying speeches we've ever heard. He highlighted a number of winning issues that can help Republicans win votes from across the political spectrum. There were many amazing and inspiring moments for every American to consider:
-Working to bring new educational opportunities to kids through Opportunities Scholarships and school choice
-Commitment to the Protection of Pre-exisiting Conditions, Protection of Medicare and Social Security
-Proposal for High Speed Internet in Rural American
-Protecting our second amendment right to keep & bear arms
-Funding for Neonatal Research to protect the youngest Americans
-Reducing the number of opioid overdoses for the first time in decades
-A Blue Collar Boom, with all kinds of unemployment numbers at historic lows
-Manufacturing jobs actually coming back to the US
-Using our military to protect Americans
-And Re-uniting families when unnecessary conflicts wind to a close
-Opportunity zones to help underdeveloped economies (several in Vermont)
-Putting the first woman on the moon
-Becoming the first nation to plant our flag on Mars
While this, and so any other accomplishments and goals had Democrats literally sitting on their hands, it gave great hope to Republicans and Independents around the country.
If you are excited to support such an agenda of hope, opportunity and freedom - please consider joining the VT Republicans and run for elected office. To help enact these and other common sense policies that help our people prosper.
We are working to build a brighter, better future for Vermont, and we need the help of men & women who believe in our country and our state, and want to see it become the best that it can be - greater than ever before.
Now is your chance to join the fight, work for the common good and fix the problems in our state. Take a moment now to sign up and join us as a candidate for Vermont Senate or the Vermont House.

A Message From The Chair
(I was so surprised to have received this letter from Santa and decided to share it with you here in my weekly message from the VTGOP Chair)
December 13, 2019
VTGOP Chairwoman
Vermont, United States of America
Dear Deb Billado:
One evening I was making my way home skyward over Vermont heading north when I looked down and noticed there was a warm light far below. The light was atop a hill and softly spread down into the valleys to the towns and villages. Yet, not just any light, but one that conveyed a good feeling to the people, one of security and goodness. You could tell the source was one that exhibited good will, true caring defined by things real and true. I decided to investigate further with my records on Vermont and I was both pleased and saddened at what I learned.
That warm soft comforting light I saw was the VTGOP, a political organization represented by a group of good people who want what is best for Vermont and her citizens. I see that you were chosen to be its head to steer the course, right and true, for Vermont Republicans.
The message coming from the Vermont Democrat Party (VDP) is one of government control and power over the people. Unlike the VTGOP message you share weekly at [[URL REDACTED]], their message is not inviting, holds out little hope for the future and results in many being forced for economic reasons and more, to leave their beloved Green Mountains for a brighter more inviting place.
Some of the things the Vermont Democrats want for Christmas with delivery in January and beyond, are not only naughty, but dreadful, even ghastly. Last session they led the Vermont legislature to enshrine unrestricted abortion into Vermont’s statutory scheme that would guarantee abortion availability right up to seconds before delivery and now they want to enshrine the same into the Vermont Constitution, bringing death to the document that gave Vermont life. They want to commercialize marijuana that has known horrifying consequences for our youth and their brains and Santa cannot countenance that! With increased impairment caused by high-potency THC, I am thankful that I can fly above the highways in my sleigh.
The VDP fails to understand why the Second Amendment is critical to the maintenance of our Republic. They are intent on making fuel costs so expensive through a “carbon tax” and other oppressive regulations and taxes that many will be unable to buy the fuel they need for maintaining life in Vermont. How will they be able to afford to heat their homes, operate their small farms, even use their cars to do grocery shopping, transporting their kids to school, the doctor or to soccer practice?
The VDP is killing economic opportunity and job creation in the state, then they pretend they care about those who are victims of their poor governance. What follows is the use of taxpayer money to create programs that foster an atmosphere of dependence, loyalty and a vote each November. Their goal is perpetual control gained through practicing a form of economic slavery. How hypocritical for these same Democrats to be pushing for an amendment to the Vermont Constitution that supposedly clarifies Vermont’s first in the nation ban on slavery, to ensure “that slavery in any form is absolutely prohibited”.
Because of all the above, the Democrats will be getting some of my special vintage carbon (lumps of coal) in their stockings. You and the VTGOP will be getting something nice in 2020. I didn’t need a list from you to know what it should be, Deb, for I know your heart! It is a gift that will keep giving year after year and it comes in your favorite color, “rosy red”.
This year reflect on the great Republican era of “Christmas Past”, and while “Christmas Present” this year might not be all you might want, after the 2020 election, “Christmas Future” will be superb. Have a “Wonderful Life”, be thankful for your good Republican Party and your ability to leave the world in better shape than when you came in.
To you, your Republican supporters, to all people of good will, and even to Vermont Democrats, a Merry Christmas to all and to all a good night.
Merry Christmas

Right now, all across Vermont, we’re running a radio ad helping Vermonters hear about the clear choice on the ballot.
We can't continue with more of the same: a legislative majority that doesn’t support our Governor, a legislative majority that makes new taxes & fees a priority, and a legislative majority that serves hyper-liberal special interests groups and ignores average Vermonters.
Can you chip in just $15 to help us stay on the airwaves and reach your neighbors?
This November there is a clear choice, and we need to remind voters that our candidates stand for fiscal responsibility and are fighting every day to make Vermont more affordable.
Without your support we can’t win in November, we need you now more than ever to help take back the legislature and reign in our out of control tax bill.

A Message From The Chair
# Empty Chair Democrats
Earlier this week when I saw the confirmation vote for the next Supreme Court Justice in the Senate Judiciary Committee, I saw a lot of empty seats. Senate Democrats didn’t show up to one of the most historic confirmations hearings ever – despite being very vocal about it earlier this month when the polls were in their favor.
To me this reinforced something I have seen time and time again. As a whole, when Democrats don’t get their way, they take their ball and go home. They don’t stand up for what they believe in. They just disappear.
Another recent example has been Nancy Pelosi’s refusal to work out a deal for more COVID relief. Rather than engaging with the President and working to meet in the middle, she wants to sit on the sidelines and do a political calculation to avoid doing something good because it might have the effect of helping Trump.
The same thing happened a few years ago after Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker was fulfilling his election mandate and bringing genuine reform to that formerly deep blue state. When the Democratic minority knew they couldn’t get what they wanted they literally ran away. They completely left the building and actually left the state so as to avoid a state police search. Then they came back and sought to destroy that governor with a referendum – which he beat. When that didn’t work, they tried to eliminate the Governor with a recall. That didn’t work either.
When faced with challenges they don’t know how to overcome – Democrats collapse and run away. It’s the only way they know how to respond. They may talk a good game about being bipartisan. But when push comes to shove, they would prefer to shirk their responsibility than to work out some kind of compromise with Republicans in power.
In Vermont, and previously for years in DC and other places, Republicans have been the minority. We have been in power and we have been out of power. When Obama justices were confirmed Republicans went to every meeting, participated, and many even voted for Obama’s picks. When the Democrats were passing the most horrendous bills imaginable that gave unprecedented government control over our health care system, Republicans still showed up. When Obama went to New Jersey to view the Hurricane Irene/Sandy damage just before an election, Republican Christ Christie didn’t turn him away because of some political calculation. He put his people ahead of his party.
Republicans play the hand we're dealt. We don’t quit, we don’t run away or hide in our basement. We never run away from a fight. We stand ready to meet every challenge head on.
If we win, we have years of working across the aisle to get stuff done and take Democrat perspectives into account that can help us to actually govern in a way that is effective and can consider a broader array of perspectives. Democrats can’t do that if they hit the eject button every time they are in the minority.
As Republicans we make this solemn promise to all Vermonters that no matter how badly the deck may be stacked against us we will continue to engage in the process, provide our insight and feedback.
Sincerely,

A Message From The Chair
Not only Cast a Ballot in November, be a Candidate on that Ballot!
####  When election night comes, as we tune into the results from across our nation, we see maps of states colored red for Republican and blue for Democrat. Sadly, our Green Mountains have for too many decades been colored blue and each election has brought an even darker tone than before. We are at a turning point where if we do not lighten things up, Vermont will find itself in perpetual darkness with a failing economy, exodus of people, especially our youth, and a bleak future for her citizens.
We must transform our political landscape from depressing color blue to the bright and hopeful “Rosy Red”. If we do, it will mark the beginning of a new era of prosperity and hope for Vermonters, evidenced by a reduction in job killing taxes and regulations along with a more limited and fiscally responsible government. With that will come a new sense of optimism for our existing businesses, encouragement for new ones and jobs that will keep our people, especially our children, here to build a strong and vibrant Vermont.
This color change will not come easy and we will have to fight for it at many points along the way. Did you read our Campaign Coordinator's Wednesday email- “The Fight for Our Future”? If not, please do it now for it is a call to action and a warning that time is running out if we are serious about our political, economic, and moral future.
The election Primary is fast approaching in August but before that we must identify those willing to toss their hats in the ring to represent the VTGOP. May 28, 2020 is an especially important time deadline in that quest for candidates. That is just six days away. We need many to make decisions to run for office now because that is the deadline for names to appear on the Primary Ballot. It is easy to do so no need to panic.
While our minds, by necessity must be on casting our vote when the time comes, right now we need people to take that one step further and not only cast a vote when the time is right, but to be the name on the ballot that is cast. There will be House of Representative, Senate and statewide office seats that will go uncontested unless you step forward. I know many of you have entertained the idea of running but have never committed to it. Will you now at this critical time of need? Some would like to but do not feel qualified. I would like to talk to you about that because everyone feels that way at one point. Most take it for granted that others will fill the positions, but that is not the case. In the last election only 75 of 150 House of Representative seats were contested by Republicans. Such apathy has resulted in a super-majority liberal Democrat/Progressive lawmaking body that can and does do anything it wants. There is no balance and the negative results to our state are clear. Republicans even lack the needed numbers to sustain our Republican Governor’s vetoes.
I have one example I wish to share that might help you decide. A reluctant Republican in Central Vermont, just filed candidate papers for the House and when asked why, the response was “I know that I told you, and others, that I would not seek office but in the end I can't bear to see Vermont continue on this same path…I want my freedom back.” What do you want? Will you be willing to come forth and serve with this person who I believe will be there in 2021 when the new session begins?
Is there another position you are feeling called to run for? Reach out to me and tell me what you are thinking. We are here to help. If you are interested in serving in the House of Representatives, the Senate or statewide office, now is the time to submit your consent of candidate forms.
COVID-19 resulted in a simplification of the process to run in that you are no longer required to have signatures on your petition. This means that you can submit a petition to run right now, and you will automatically be placed on the ballot for the August primary. It just takes 2 minutes. It is that easy. If not you, then who. Tell us please!
Fill out your intention to run today by clicking the link below and follow the instructions. If you have any questions, contact us and we will help.

A Message From The Chair
The Power of One
Last week I had mentioned the Democratic super-majority was deciding whether or not to override the Governor's veto of the latest gun control bill. And within just one week the Governor vetoed another piece of terrible legislation, and the super-majority had already taken up the vote to override him
What was at stake was a nearly $30 Million new payroll tax that was to be placed on hardworking employees across Vermont. At a time when Vermont has lagged behind the rest of the country in wage growth, Democratic Progressives want to extract even those modest gains in order to create a new taxpayer-funded benefit program for paid family leave.
If Sue Minter, or Christine Hallquist had been in office, it would have already been signed into law, and businesses would have preparing to calculating how much they would need to reduce their loyal employee's paycheck in the coming year. But one man, sitting in the Governor's office had the ability to put a stop to it, and use the power of the veto pen to save Vermonters from a brand new tax on workers. Standing up for Vermont workers and Vermont taxpayers is something we can all thank Governor Scott for.
But unfortunately the Governor doesn't always get final say. His veto went back to the VT House where they took up the measure immediately in order to override the Governor's veto. This served as the first test of the new super-majority's strength since they gained seats historically held by Republicans in the 2018 election.
Everyone knew it was going to be a tight vote. And the House Democratic Progressive leadership was working people hard, including holding one member in their office for an extended time trying to get them to flip their vote. In the end EVERY vote mattered, and the Governor's veto was sustained by a vote of 99-51.
One vote. That's what separated Vermonters from a $30 Million new payroll tax this week. One single, vote. Every single Republican stood together with the Governor to protect Vermonters and provide a united front that stood up to an out-of-control super-majority, and ""No more!""
One of the remarkable stories that should make every Republican proud was the fact that Rep. Lynn Dickinson of St. Albans had literally just had eye surgery. But instead of taking it easy and getting some rest, she showed up at the state house with an eye patch, fulfilled the duty to her constituents and got to Montpelier to cast one of the deciding votes. If she had failed to make it in time Vermonters would be spending another $30 Million to the state in taxes, instead of spending on what they need and want to provide for their families.
And while we can celebrate this win, despite our current minority, I want every one of you to realize that we cannot leave matter of this weight, and this kind of fiscal impact up to chance. Vermonters cannot afford to have such razor thin margins separating them from such massive tax burdens. In another vote, we might not be so lucky. That's why I am asking you to consider running for the House. We need to give our Governor better margins, and protect the people of Vermont - people like you - and the best way to do that is to recruit and elect more Republicans to the state house.
Many people think they can't make a difference down there. This week proved them wrong. Every single Republican vote counted for something - and it made a difference. A $30 Million difference. The more people that join us in the fight there, the more victories we can have to help our fellow Vermonters.
Maybe you've never thought about running. Well I'm asking you to think about it now. If you are interested, take a moment and complete the form on our website and we'll have someone get in touch with you to answer any questions you have. If nothing else, contacting us will help you get plugged in and better informed about what's happening. Who knows, it could be YOU that gets to be that one, single vote that is part of the Republican team working to stop the next big carbon tax, or the next restriction on our freedoms.
Join the team. Make a difference.

Deb Billado

A Message From The Chair
## Vermont Republicans Resolute to Reverse Democrat’s Control
As we draw to the end of the year and decade, our economy is the envy of the world, the stock market is hitting all time highs, wages are up, unemployment is down. This should provide for even greater hope for 2020 and beyond, and yet there are dark clouds of danger on the horizon that we cannot ignore. While we will always have foreign powers who oppose our Republic, the major storms look as if they will come from within. Our duly elected president has just been impeached by a Democrat House without having been charged with a crime and his good-for-America programs are opposed solely because they cannot accept his 2016 election. Democrat/Progressives are committed to leading us down an anti-American, socialist path. While Capitalism is still favored, knowing the many failures of socialism it is hard to understand how “Positive views of socialism are up 8 points among Democrats and now stand at 51 percent”, and yet it is so and the numbers are trending upward. Many of these same Democrats are teaching and indoctrinating our children in public schools and that dictates a clear need for universal school choice for our future leaders.
We have a rich legacy left to us by our founders, but the journey cannot safely be continued if left on auto-pilot. Our Republican principles must be inculcated into our youth, so they know what it was that made America the great nation for with that knowledge will come the will to fight back. We can only live so long leaning on the pillars our forefathers built for us, for when they are undermined and evidence of those are gone and people do not share what they know to be the truth to our young, we will not be able to survive as a free nation.
Vermont is controlled by a Democrat/Progressive super-majority, but we must not accept that it will always be that way. We must undo this domination and a new year is the perfect time to begin but to do it we must resolve to:
1\. Read, study and talk to our children, grandchildren and others about our Constitution.
2\. Vote in every election and do it as if our vote will be the one that makes the difference.
3\. Encourage people to register and vote.
4\. Consider running for office or encourage others to do that.
5\. Fight for school choice and local control of our communities.
6\. Support the efforts of the VTGOP by donating money to help do that.
7\. Get to know my elected Representatives and communicate regularly with them on what is expected from them.
8\. Hold politicians and those in authority accountable for their wrongful acts.
9\. Encourage and praise politicians when they do the proper things.
10\. Never compromise on the principles that make us conservative Republicans while at the same time respecting those who do not agree with us.
11\. Write a concise letter to the editor on conservative issues in a factual, well-constructed way.
12\. Unapologetically challenge the negative culture on social media in a positive way.
13\. Stand up against those who improperly speak ill of our President.
14\. Remind people that Joe Biden and his son Hunter are guilty of the things that President Trump has been accused of regarding Ukraine.
15\. Dedicate myself to making Vermont’s political landscape colored a “rosy Republican red”.
16\. Remind myself daily that as important as politics are, the things that happen in our lives with our families, in our homes, our schools and churches are the most important things.
WE must not accept those who would discourage us from doing what is right and true in order to preserve our Republic and if we are faithful, the liberty and justice miracle that is America will survive and once more our one nation, under God, indivisible, will be great again and that shining city upon the hill.
I wish a happy and prosperous New Year to you and your families. I would love to hear from you on the resolutions you have made to better our Vermont condition.
Sincerely,
Deb Billado

Deb Billado,info@vtgop.org,Only 5 more days,"Alex,
It’s hard to believe the election is only 5 days away.
That means we only have 5 more days to get the word out about our candidates.
I know our candidates will put Vermonters over special interests.
I know our candidates will fight to lower our tax burden.
I know our candidates will create jobs & grow the economy.
I know our candidates will fiercely defend the Constitution.
The problem is, not all Vermonters know about our candidates.
That’s why I’ve set a goal to raise $10,000 before Election Day to help us reach 100,000 voters and get the word out about our candidates.
It’s more important than ever before to make sure our candidates have the support they need.

We saw what just TWO YEARS of a democratic supermajority did. We need to show them that we will not continue to support their tax-and-spend policies that are bankrupting our State!
It’s time that average Vermonters like us stand up and use our vote to put common sense leaders back in the House and Senate.
Please help us reach our goal by chipping in all you can right now, our State’s future depends on it.

A Message From The Chair
Legislature Should Practice ""Bill Passing Distancing""
The Coronavirus continues to wreak havoc on our way of life at every point including on how we do government. There is, however, no need with this temporary crisis we are facing, to reshape how government has always worked and especially how new laws are enacted.
Vermont House and Senate Committees have been meeting remotely to deliberate during the Coronavirus outbreak. Now some want to allow “remote voting” where lawmakers can vote on bills and resolutions without being present together in their legislative session to do that. Surely, the framers of our Vermont Constitution could never have envisioned legislators being able to vote without meeting under the Golden Dome to do it for they declared in Chapter II, § 7. [BIENNIAL SESSIONS] that “The General Assembly shall meet biennially…” they did not say that they could phone in, or yell back and forth over the back fence. They were to meet!
Then again, no one could have ever imagined such a threat as we are now facing. This is an enemy we cannot see, and we must take steps to protect ourselves. If there is to be any action taken by the legislature, it must be limited to that absolutely needed to counter this threat and to keep the government functioning. However, there is no way that voting should be allowed remotely on the mundane and non-critical matters that hundreds and hundreds of bills in the legislature contain. Not only is it probably unconstitutional if they were to do that, but it would just be wrong and subject the citizens to more control by a super-majority liberal Democrat dominated legislature that will now be able to operate under the radar with even less accountability than they are subject to now.
Many, especially those without adequate broadband, painfully remember through decades, the unkept promises of past governors to have functioning broadband coverage for all of Vermont in the “near future”. That condition persists in many parts of Vermont today. For those people, they will be unable to interact with their representatives the way they could by jumping in their car and coming to Montpelier.
If it is deemed necessary to do budgetary work or matters that address the Covid-19 pandemic, that should be the limit of legislative action. The other stuff can wait. Vermont should postpone such other lawmaking until safe and not try to do a rework of our two plus century old system for this short time, for such will be fraught with dangers, failures and potential abuse of power, loss of transparency, accountability, ultimately doing harm to those the lawmakers are sworn to represent and do good things for. Once the emergency is lifted things can and should get back to normal.
Consider further that our founding document declares; Chapter II § 8. [DOORS OF GENERAL ASSEMBLY TO BE OPEN] “The doors of the House in which the General Assembly of this Commonwealth shall sit, shall be open for the admission of all persons who behave decently, except only when the welfare of the State may require them to be shut.”  There is no question that right now there may be a need to keep those doors shut temporarily, but we should not allow those of the super-majority to pass laws out of the sight and sound of many of the citizens who will be most adversely affected except in the most critical areas of budget and the pandemic crisis. Except for that it is time for them to step down temporarily when those doors to where legislators “sit” are temporarily closed. Nothing will be lost by them doing that.
To allow for the legislature to finalize bills that will become the law of our state, considering this and the rights given those in that situation under Chapter I Article 20. [Right to assemble, instruct and petition] would be wrong and unconstitutional. “That the people have a right to assemble together to consult for their common good--to instruct their Representatives--and to apply to the Legislature for redress of grievances, by address, petition or remonstrance.” Such rights are meaningless if the legislature could, outside the bounds of procedure established in the Vermont Constitution, declare a new way that would infringe on the rights guaranteed by that document. Under Chapter II § 6\. [LEGISLATIVE POWERS] the legislature has the power to do many things, “…but they shall have no power to add to, alter, abolish or infringe any part of this Constitution.”
All too often in times of crisis we are willing to allow our rights to be diminished in the name of safety or expediency. Absolutely we should be practicing social distancing, but I suggest that our legislators should practice bill passing distancing as well. Just as citizens must go out of our homes to do certain things during the crisis, such as acquiring food or medical treatment, so too should our legislature be guided by that approach of necessity. They should do things only when they are essential. No one wants to have their plans put aside, but this could well be the time to listen instead of acting. Our own Calvin Coolidge was quoted as saying, “It takes a great man to be a good listener.” The wounds inflicted on our people and their economy by this virus, will have consequences that no one can now imagine, so now is not the time to pass bills into law without taken those consequences into consideration and we just do not know now. A wise legislature would call “time out” and listen and watch so they will be prepared to do good when they return to their chambers to “sit” where citizens can come to constitutionally “consult” and “instruct their Representatives”.
We must not break the mold of lawmaking that has endured for centuries in Vermont for once you do, how easy will it be for those in power to find excuses to do it again and again. While we must take the proper steps to protect the public, there are ways that can happen without reworking our way of doing governing. The governor has powers to deal with much of what is needed so whatever we do, we should go slowly and give this crisis the needed time to resolve. If legislative action is needed for critical reasons, it should be done only when there is concurrence with the governor’s office and is subject to judicial review.
For now, please stay home and stay safe.
Sincerely,
Deb Billado

A Message From The Chair
WE CAN’T STOP LIVING IN ORDER TO LIVE!
I have been taking the reasonable precautions that have been advised by medical people to be so mindful of not being close to others, to wash and sanitize myself and items I bring into my house and even to wear a mask when, by necessity, I need to go shopping for groceries. I have some doubts as to the necessity and to the added risks due to the feelings of false security that wearing gloves and masks brings, but to show I am a responsible citizen, I am complying.
I was preparing our must eat at home meal last evening and barely listening to the NBC Nightly News with Lester Holt when the words about the spike in deaths in New York City caught my ear followed by the explanation that over 3700 new cases had been added to the death toll resulting from Covid-19 by a decision to include them as presumptively dying from the virus.
On April 14th, 2020, the New York Times also reported: “New York City, already a world epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, sharply increased its death toll by more than 3,700 victims on Tuesday, after officials said they were now including people who had never tested positive for the virus but were presumed to have died of it.”
How suspect are such assumptions by a state like New York, and its Governor Andrew Cuomo, who is clamoring for Federal Aid and has a need to show proof they must have it? How credible is the rest of the data they provide considering this? Why else would they want their numbers to be bad? “Three thousand more people died in New York City between March 11 and April 13 than would have been expected during the same time period in an ordinary year, Dr. Oxiris Barbot, the commissioner of the city Health Department, said in an interview. While these so-called excess deaths were not explicitly linked to the virus, they might not have happened had the outbreak not occurred, in part because it overwhelmed the normal health care system.” Without showing there might be other unusual causes for the spike, the Department decided to just assume. That is not scientific and cannot justify the draconian shutdown of the state.
To add to the pseudo reporting of virus related deaths, the media as would be expected in these days of fake news, reported “… epidemiologists, city officials and medical personnel say those numbers are likely to be far below the city’s actual death toll” and other such justifications for adding unconfirmed numbers of deaths.
It should be a red flag for all when headlines start appearing that “Death Count Expected To Soar As NYC Says It Will Begin Reporting Probable COVID Deaths In Addition To Confirmed Ones.
In Ohio, it was declared in a headline that “Lucas County Republican Party chairman says father died after presumptive COVID-19 diagnosis” while saying they did not have test results and that they didn’t even know if he died in Lucas County.
I have not even begun to check other states and whether they are presuming that deaths are the result of Covid-19, but with New York being the state reporting the highest numbers of deaths and operating in this manner, is it any wonder why there are many people now questioning the data that has led to the panic driven decisions to close the economies of the nation? While it would not be wrong for people who are showing the symptoms of the disease to be presumed to have it in order for safety precautions to be taken, to presume and then publicly report that someone had died from the virus is misleading and brings into question all the numbers of deaths that are being reported. How difficult would it be to confirm before adding to the panic of the nation? Consider that the stock market had been rallying on some positive news on the infection rate in the nation until this was reported last evening and now the Dow Jones Averages have, as of mid-day dropped close to 700 points.
Yet when the number of infections subsides, it is certain that these same “leaders’ who have reacted like “chicken little” will take credit and praise themselves with saving lives.  If we want the orders of our government leaders not to be questioned, their decisions must be based on sound scientific and fact driven conclusions. That is not the case and so I have now counted myself among the group that sees the “cure for the coronavirus as being worse than the disease”. We will have a hard time, if we ever can, recovering from the economic damage inflicted on our economy. Through it all, more people will likely suffer, become ill and more will die as the result of the actions of our government than through contracting the disease.
There is a pandemic and we must take the right actions before it is too late for our health and our way of life. Is it too late? Maybe not, but it will be soon, especially if we are not honest about what is happening and how to properly deal with it.

A Message From The Chair
The VSC Crisis. It Did Not Have to Be This Way!
On Friday, April 17th, Vermont State College System Chancellor Jeb Spaulding shocked many Vermonters when he announced that within 3 days the VSC Trustees would vote to close Northern Vermont University campuses in Johnson and Lyndon and would shutter VTC in Randolph Center, consolidating the programs there into its Williston location, a facility without adequate housing for students.
This insensitive announcement was made at one of the most stressful times in Vermont’s history. What would lead Chancellor Spaulding to do such a thing? Blame was put on the Covid-19 pandemic and past underfunding of the higher education system. I guess the crisis was too opportune for him to pass up, but it seems he miscalculated the public sentiment. The backlash was quick and strong and on April 19th the Board postponed consideration of the move for a week and then the following day the Chancellor withdrew the proposal from consideration.
Imagine being a family in central Vermont whose child, because of financial necessity, is commuting from home to VTC to study nursing, has been hit with the loss of their job due to the Covid-19 virus, is wondering how they will cope with their loss of income, then in the midst of that, hear the news that VTC will be closed leaving a long commute or a need to find an expensive boarding somewhere in the Williston area for their child?
It did not have to be this way! This proposal would cost hundreds of jobs and destroy the economic vibrancy of our rural town centers in struggling areas of our state. The VSC system may be on the brink of insolvency if nothing is done, but considering the stress Vermonters have been experiencing the last two months, shouldn’t he have considered all other avenues in solving the matter before doing what he did? Now he has withdrawn the closing to consider other avenues. Why didn’t he do that before doing what he did when he made this public pronouncement? By his action he has put a possible solution further out of reach since the uncertainty spawned by his announcement will negatively influence any who are currently enrolled or might be considering these schools. All avenues should have been explored before he dropped this damaging message on Vermonters.
VSC is among the lowest state supported state college school systems in the entire country. Why is this and who is responsible? The underfunding began in the period where politician Spaulding was a Democratic operative in Vermont and when Democrats controlled the purse strings. They sent most of available funds to other areas and in fact K-12 education spending is more than we do on transportation, economic development, agriculture, public safety, and even our pension liabilities. This excessive spending, which has increased by several hundred percent since the year 2000, has been accompanied by a declining student population and mediocre results.
Jeb Spaulding and his Democrat colleagues are the ones responsible for that. After all, their campaigns rely heavily on donations from the Vermont NEA, which exerts pressure on them when it comes to making policy. Imagine if we had dedicated just a fraction of the Education Fund to higher education years back, instead of having it all go to the K-12 behemoth!
While there is no doubt that UVM has incurred some remarkably high unexpected costs as the result of the shutdown caused by the pandemic, the comparative harm to the Vermont State Colleges, threatened with closing, must weigh in favor of the latter. I understand UVM has an endowment fund of $550,000,000.00 and while some say it cannot be spent for this, I would hope they could find a legal way in such a serious emergency to cover such needed costs. There is an old saying that; “where there is a will, there is a way.”
Governor Scott and legislative leaders have come out against this campus closing proposal, but this all begs the question: how did we get here? The perfect storm brought about with the Covid-19 crisis, low Vermont birth rate (Vermont has had unrestricted abortions since 1972 resulting in over 100,000 deaths) and exodus of young Vermonters has led to a shortage of 30,000 high school students over the last 25 years. This demographic crisis continues with a yearly loss of 1000 students and has exposed the decades of Democrat maladministration of educational funding that occurred. Spaulding blames that underfunding but fails to say it was his Democratic Party that was responsible
In a comment to the vtdigger article I linked at the beginning, Chet Greenwood, pointed to the cause and the solution for this and other Vermont fiscal problems. “Jeb has been in state politics since 1985. Vermont has been losing ground financially in both our VSC system and our pension system for those years. Time to change strategy.”
Please consider running for office or supporting those who do. We must color Vermont’s political landscape “rosy red”, for if we do not, it is hard to imagine how bad our future will be.
Sincerely,
Deb Billado

#
A National Moment Of Silence
This Memorial Day is different. For the first time, perhaps since it was declared a national holiday the streets will not be filled with parades, or school marching bands. The streets may not be lined with flags, or ice cream vendors or cotton candy. There may not be large gatherings of backyard barbecues. No days spent at the lake or the local park. And while this has been a sad sight most recently, today - on Memorial Day, our national day of silence seems fitting. The engine of our economic and entertainment industries has stopped, and only just started gearing up in the last few days and weeks. But this Memorial Day is filled with a broader and deeper silence that allows us to take a moment to reflect on what was meant when this day was set aside.
While today we notice all the thing that are missing from our lives, restaurants, large gatherings, certain recreational and vacationing activities. It reminds us that the families that have lost a dear loved one in service to our country have had that same sense of loss, which they experience every day of their lives - but without the hope the rest of us have that things will go back to the way they were. Their sacrifice is permanent.
America's wealth cannot be measured alone by our economic prosperity or our GDP. But one of the greatest demonstrations of the wealth and value of our nation can be found in the fact that so many Americans have been, and are still willing to give up their own life, usually the prime of their life, to serve our country, and if need be - die for it. No other country on earth has a larger number of enlisted men and women, and few others can boast a 100% volunteer fighting force. No other place on earth is worth fighting for like America.
So today, as we all are experiencing a Memorial Day that is probably a little different - certainly a little quieter, less busy than previous years - let us do so in a way that honors the immense value that our soldiers placed on our country. Let us Remember, let us Memorialize the value that they placed on the lives of their fellow Americans - OUR lives, which we keep living while theirs have expired. And let us never forget the dear, dear price that was paid for our freedoms and all we enjoy.
So this year, let us observe this unique National Moment of Silence - and be grateful.

Vermont Republican Party Starts Multi-Station Ad Buy
Berlin, VT -- Tuesday morning thousands of Vermonters listened in as the Vermont Republican Party began a multi-station radio campaign across Vermont, getting on the airwaves from Alburg to Vernon.
“The Vermont Republican Party is working together like never before,"" said Chair Deb Billado. ""We are in a much better place than we were two years ago - even just 6 months ago. In light of COVID we were forced to think a little differently, and that has thankfully resulted in us working together more cooperatively, from the Governor's office down to local candidates.""
The Vermont Republicans are using the new radio ads to capitalize on the unprecedented popularity and unrivaled success of Republican Governor Phil Scott. A recent VPR/VPBS poll showed the Governor Scott's 68% approval rating, making him even more popular than longtime Democrat officeholders like Peter Welch and Sen. Patrick Leahy.
""The message is simple,"" added Political Director Paul Dame, ""If Vermonters like the job Governor Scott is doing - then we are asking them to help him get that job done by electing more common sense Vermont Republicans like him who are going to cooperate with him - not work against him.""
While Democrats have tried to appear more cooperative this year, in the last election year a Seven Days reporter caught Senate Democrats violating open meeting laws to conspire how to thwart Governor Scott, intentionally passing bills for the purpose of getting his veto - not making life better for Vermonters.
""We're still in somewhat of a crisis management situation,"" added Billado. ""The Governor has no doubt done the best job in the country in preventing some really dire situations here in Vermont. But we can do better. If he had a legislature that had the experience and the incentive to see him succeed, like Republican House and Senate candidates do - instead of see him and our state fail - the way that the Democrat Party would like to see, then we could not only stop the spread of the virus, but actually start the spread of a more prosperous economy.""
Vermont Republicans have made post-COVID economic recovery their #1 goal and believe with a popular proven Governor they have made the case to voters to give their down-ballot candidates a serious look. Even local small businessman Scott Milne, the Republican candidate in a close race for Lt. Gov. is hoping to benefit from the ads that encourage voters to elect him and other Republicans to help strengthen Governor Scott's hand on election day.
""There are voters out there who usually vote for Democrats, but they know that this time - for this election - we may need a few more of the Common Sense Vermont-style Republicans to balance things out and get us back on track with the economy."" said Billado.
The radio ads can be found on the website and supporters can donate for which commercial they want to hear more of in the weeks leading up to the election

# The Fight for Our Future
Businesses have been closed - some to never reopen again. Thousands of Vermonters and Millions of Americans are on unemployment - some for the first time in their lives. Our Healthcare infrastructure has been pushed to the limit and tested. Tourism, one of Vermont's economic engines is in the shop and out of commission. For the first time in our lifetimes Vermonters have seen empty shelves in the grocery stores, and lined up for miles at food banks.
And what are the Progressive Liberals who just seized power doing? Their immediate focus is taking down a mural that helped to attest the the endurance of the City of Burlington through many seasons of prosperity and difficulty. And in Montpelier already elected officials are fighting over the next round of Climate Change restrictions (and climate pork).
If those are YOUR priorities, then keep doing nothing. But if you believe in a better future for Vermont. If you believe that when something is broke you need to pay attention and fix it than NOW is the time for YOU to stand up.
The tide is changing across America, and in Vermont too. Last week Republicans won a Congressional seat in CALIFORNIA that they haven't held in over 25 years! (That's back before Al Gore invented the internet!) People are done with their trial run of Socialism and they want their money back - and their freedoms.
But they need you. Only you, and people like you, can help put our state back on a path to not just survival but to prosperity. The chickens are coming home to roost and every foolhardy, unwise spending program cooked up by the Progressive/Democratic majority are going to be on the chopping block. Never before has our state been in such dire need of the kind of leadership that Republicans offer.
You've owned a business, you've balanced a checkbook, YOU live in the real world of budgets and meeting payroll. Democrats don't. Their world orbits around grants, programs, non-profits and federal funds. That future is about to change and they are unequipped to deal with it. The only two ideas they ever have are taxation and regulation. Vermonters need YOU and people like you who live in the real world that can help us all adjust to the reality that we can't continue to spend more than we take in, and starting immediately we need to create economic growth.
Governor Scott has already asked his administration to look at a budget proposal with 8% cuts. You know that Democrats are going to want to fill the gap by RAISING TAXES during an economic crisis! If you want the Democrats to win, raise taxes and create new spending programs - stay home and complain - and get ready to put on your mandated masks (Coming soon statewide?). But if you want to be a part of the positive change that VT so desperately needs then sign up today to become a candidate. Our Republican Governor is going to need common sense fiscal conservatives who know how to budget in order to help him sustain a veto - and it would be even better if he had at least ONE House with a Republican Majority.
Vermont needs your help and your willing service in order to help us all keep our family safe and prosperous in these challenging times. If you don't trust Democrats to run your life, run your business, and run your state: don't let them. Take a stand today and be a part of that group of Vermonters like me and so many other Republicans that say enough is enough.
This year may be the easiest year to get on the ballot, and possibly the best conditions for Republicans. But time is running out. If you want to get on the ballot you only have 8 days to turn in your Candidate Consent Form. You can do it by yourself by clicking on the link or contact us at the state party and we'd be happy to help you get started, and answer any questions you have about what it's like to run, win or lose a campaign, and what it's like to sere in the House or the Senate.

VT Republican Party,info@vtgop.org,ICYMI: Friday Meeting on Marijuana,"Did you see this meeting coming up on Friday related to possible new marijuana legislation?
With the very real threat on the horizon that Vermont’s picturesque towns and villages might soon be legally advertising and selling addicting high-potency THC cannabis products that will have very serious and dangerous medical and societal consequences, this coming Friday there will be an opportunity to gain knowledge on the subject.
A free education event (THC/Cannabis commercialization, Implications for Vermont) will take place at the UVM Alumni House ([[URL REDACTED]]), 61 Summit Street Burlington, VT 05401 next Friday, February 21st at 6:00 PM. There will be hors d'oeuvres will be served. The event is free and you register at [[URL REDACTED]] If you go to that site you will see information on the speaker, Dr. Ken Finn from Colorado Springs.
If this time will not work there are two other opportunities the same day, both taking place at the Capitol Plaza Hotel, 100 State Street, Montpelier. These events consist of a breakfast from 7:00 AM to 9:00 AM and the second opportunity will be at 12:00 PM, and a lunch will be served. There is no charge for the events or the meals. For the breakfast register at [[URL REDACTED]] and for the lunch register [[URL REDACTED]]
These events are made possible by UVM Department of Psychiatry, Association of Student Assistance Professionals ([[URL REDACTED]]), Smart Approaches to Marijuana - Vermont ([[URL REDACTED]]) and Physician Families and Friends Inc.
I would like to see many Republicans, especially our Republican legislators taking advantage of this wonderful educational opportunity to gain key and needed information on commercialization of marijuana, lessons learned and its potential impact on Vermont, from Dr. Ken Finn, a pain medicine specialist who has practiced in Colorado for over twenty-four years. The 7 AM breakfast event at the Capitol Plaza could be very opportune for our lawmakers to meet and eat before they begin their day’s work at the statehouse.

Presidential Convention Results:
## Presidential Convention Results
Yesterday a team of 9 volunteers spent nearly their entire Saturday ensuring we had a valid election process by carefully reviewing each ballot before consideration, and then every ballot was counted, then recounted again, and to settle one race they were counted a third time. We received over 350 ballots, which accounted for thousands of individual votes which were all counted by hand. A huge Thank You is in order for our Ballot Counting Team.
We also want to thank all of the candidates that ran. Despite the uncertainty surrounding large scale events in general, we still had a very healthy competition in the delegate race, and we congratulate our winners, our alternates and our runners-up.
With our state convention behind us, let's all now work together and focus our attention on working towards Republican majorities in the House and Senate!

A Message From The Chair
## The COVID-19 Sleight of Hand Trick
I am not suggesting they had anything to do with the COVID-19 pandemic happening, but Vermont Democrat/Progressives are not failing to use it as an opportunity to slip some very detrimental bills through this year’s session of the Vermont legislature. That is what is happening right now with the so-called Global Warming Solutions Act (GWSA). There are other extremely bad bills that may be passed under this cover and I will continue to speak to you about them in the future. While most of our attention is being paid to dealing with the damage and reaction to the coronavirus, many matters are receiving less attention than they normally would or should. This is the dynamic that the liberals are relying on. I call it “sleight of hand” and the Democrat leadership is good at using such cunning to deceive and to accomplish their perverse purposes. Unless their ruse is exposed before it is executed, we will live to regret it.
This bill, which our governor and legislative Republicans are opposed to, will allow “anyone” to bring lawsuits that will cost you, the Vermont taxpayer, if the state does not meet the unreachable emission mandate deadlines in the bill. By the time the rulemaking process, run by unaccountable bureaucrats who will never be able to be reined in, is ready to be completed, the first mandate deadline will be upon us, putting the state in danger of having to defend costly lawsuits. This is a lawyer’s dream and a taxpayer’s nightmare. John McClaughry, vice president of the Ethan Allen Institute, put it this way when In January 2020 he wrote about the GWSA; “Its passage would be a giant step toward unaccountable rule by arbitrary decree that would have astonished and alarmed two hundred years of Vermont governors and legislators, faithful to our constitution’s requirement that our government must always, in a legal way, remain accountable to the people.”
Montpelier’s super-majority Democrat/Progressives have gone from one reckless climate policy to another, from a “carbon tax” to the unaffordable mandates in the GWSA. All of these will have no measurable impact on the environment, and all are harmful to working Vermonters. In his article mentioned above, John McClaughry also noted, “Will all this help defeat the climate emergency? Not detectably, of course, but it would be a virtue signal to the rest of the world: Brave Little Vermont! We have the courage to beggar our own people to battle the Menace of Climate Change!”
We must all do what we can individually and corporately that is reasonable, affordable, and sustainable to preserve and protect our environment. The GWSA measures bring about negatives that damage and discourage businesses that support and sustain Vermonters and their families, especially the young, who because of all the negatives brought about by this and other of their unworkable lawmaking passions, have caused our children to leave Vermont in pursuit of a meaningful life elsewhere. That is incredibly sad!
By proposing such a radical bill, the Democrats and Progressives in Montpelier have demonstrated that they are perfectly willing to sacrifice our state’s economic integrity in exchange for the hypothetical of a minuscule reduction in global greenhouse gas emissions.
We need balance in Montpelier now more than ever, and that is why restoring accountability under the Golden Dome this November is essential. Vote Republican and support those who are running.
Sincerely,

A Message From The Chair
Sustain Gov. Scott's Gun Bill Veto
Last June, Governor Scott vetoed S.169, a bill to impose additional gun restrictions on Vermonters, including a 24 hour waiting period to purchase a handgun.
Now, the ball is in the court of the Legislature to decide whether to sustain or override this veto. As the Governor mentioned in his veto message, it’s imperative we focus on the root causes of violence and mental illness--not enact additional restrictions on law-abiding citizens. That’s why the Governor’s budget proposal includes investments in our mental health system and programs that work like the Zero Suicide initiative.
Here’s the reality: We need to take action to address the underlying causes before someone buys a gun and pulls the trigger--not after. And we can’t penalize the tens of thousands of law-abiding gun owners in Vermont in the process. After all, a right delayed is a right denied.
You can contact your legislators by clicking here. Please, send them an email or call them and ask them to vote to sustain the Governor’s veto on this bill, not override it.
Then, this November, let’s send them another message by electing Republican candidates who won’t pass legislation like this in the first place, and instead focus on addressing the fundamental causes of violence and mental health issues in the first place. If you want to be one of the candidates who will join us to put an end to misguided gun legislation, click here and express your interest in running!
Sincerely,
Deb Billado

In the face of Coronavirus, our Governor set an example of excellence for the entire country and in the face of a democratic supermajority, our Governor fought for fiscal discipline.
Every day Governor Scott works tirelessly for average Vermonters.
He has always had our back, and right now we need you to have his.
If David Zuckerman is elected Governor he will destroy all the progress Governor Scott has made in making Vermont more affordable.

# Whoever They Nominate, VT Dems Won’t Turn VT Around
#### Next week, Vermonters will decide who will be our nominees for statewide office. But on the Democratic side, it’s clear that it really won’t make any difference as to who the nominees are for Governor or Lieutenant Governor.
Why? Because all the Democratic candidates for higher office share the far-left ideological and commitment to the failed policies of the past.
Take the race for Governor. David Zuckerman has spent his career in Montpelier fighting to raise taxes, and has already said he would raise them by even more as Governor in order to pursue Peter Shumlin’s failed Single-Payer experiment. Rebecca Holcombe--Vermont’s failed architect of Act 46--would stand against school choice and further destroy our state’s education system.
What about spending? Well, since David Zuckerman took office, his Lieutenant Governor Office Budget has increased by more than 35%, outpacing the budget growth of his predecessor--then-Lieutenant Governor Scott--who ran a lean office budget that grew just by the rate of inflation. Holcombe didn’t do much better, with her office budget increasing by more than 8% per year while she was Secretary of Education. And she added another 10 bureaucrats to her staff during her time in office.
The Lieutenant Governor’s race is not much better, if at all. Senate President Pro Tem Tim Ashe recently touted raising taxes by $80 million when he was Chair of the Senate Finance Committee, and has also come under fire for sexism accusations. If you don’t like Tim Ashe’s tax hikes, don’t worry--candidate and Sen. Debbie Ingram wants to raise your fees too! Candidate Brenda Siegal wants every single Vermont county to have so-called “safe-injection sites,” which would permit and normalize drug use. And so-called “moderate” Molly Gray is a party-line leftist who has big promises without a plan to pay for any of them.
Put simply: The Democrats on the ballot of Governor and Lieutenant Governor aren’t different at all, either from each other or from the failed policies that the Montpelier Majority has tried to impose for the last decade. They offer no new ideas; only new taxes and fees that you can’t afford.
Indeed, they are all a walking embodiment of what the Vermont Democratic Party has become: a far-left entity indistinguishable from its progressive counterpart.
Whoever they nominate, only Vermont Republicans can turn this state around. Only they can restore balance, fiscal sanity, and a focus on affordability.
Sincerely,

A Message From The Chair
## America Needs to Go Fly a Kite
Religious liberty is under assault in many ways. People of faith are mocked for their religious conscience and government sees religious values as obstacles to overcome rather than a value to cherish and protect. The First Amendment has been perverted to make America not a place of religious freedom, but a place free from it. They have taken the phrase “separation of church and state” that Thomas Jefferson used to make it clear that government was not to interfere with any religious practice, to instead do just the opposite, something he never intended nor does a true reading of the Constitution endorse. Some even argue that phrase is in the text of the Constitution when it is not.
We have moved from a nation that respected and defended freedom of religion to one that now avoids and scorns it, will not defend those who hold onto the cherished right given to us by our founders, and now, that government that is supposed to guarantee it, is preventing people from living out their faith in the public arena thus restricting instead of guaranteeing their free exercise of religion.
When a right as basic as those First Amendment ones of religious liberty and speech, is freely ignored and violated, that precedent will bode poorly for the rights of others. If such a critical part of our founding document can be ignored and violated, nothing in the Constitution is safe from abuse. A perfect example is the raw political use of Constitutional impeachment authority to attempt to remove a duly elected president whose only offense is having won the office against all odds and is of the opposite party that seeks his removal.
In addition to the second-class citizen status put on people of faith, there is persecution, hateful actions and even physical attacks on them, especially Christians, the most persecuted of all faiths. Recently there have been anti-Semitic attacks in New York, a church shooting in Texas and malicious burning of churches are happening regularly. It doesn’t stop there. Violence, drug, alcohol abuse and crime are impacting the entire population as the culture continues to decline. This is a logical outcome of taking the good out of society and replacing it with greed and selfishness. No town is too small or picturesque with its near empty white steepled churches to be immune from addiction and overdose deaths, crime and violence.
As the problems in society get worse, government grows in response, but the situation continues to worsen for government is incapable of fixing the problems. Government feeds on problems and gives liberals more excuse to tax more. It was as if President Adams was able to look into the future, probably with fear in his heart, as he viewed a land, inhabited by people who had lost their way, no longer recognized or even knew what the founding principles were that made America that city on a hill that provided a light for the world. He saw what would happen when people turned from God and moral living. “We have no government armed with power capable of contending with human passions unbridled by morality and religion. Avarice, ambition, revenge, or gallantry would break the strongest cords of our Constitution as a whale goes through a net.” He has described the condition of our people today and how true it is that our government is not the solution for it is incapable of contending with the evil hearts of man.
How do we turn this around to get our great nation back on track? Our nation’s religious and moral beliefs are like a string that is used to fly a kite, that at first glance, seems to hold it down and prevent it from freely flying, but in fact is what holds it up and proof of that is had by letting go of the string. The kite senses it, dips and gyrates, then comes crashing to the ground. So, it is with our nation when we cut the string of our Christian religious beliefs. Some might see it as they first see the string, thinking it holds them back and is no fun, but the reality is, these keep people free from all sorts of enslavements and lets them fly high and free and have real joy. If you remember you still have the string in your hand and before the kite crashes, that if you run like the wind with that string, when you get the slack out, the kite will rise again to new heights. If we get back to the basics of moral living and put our faith in God and live according to His Word, America can experience a revival and we will recover and truly return to the founders intentions for our great nation!

Deb Billado

A Message From The Chair
# The Wind At Our Backs
Did you have a chance to see the VPR poll results this week? The news is bad for Vermont Democrats, but great for Vermont Republicans. Here are some highlights:
* Governor Scott is beating David Zuckerman by a 31-point margin, which would be the largest gubernatorial victory by a Republican in generations;
* Governor Scott not only leads David Zuckerman among Republicans, but also among Independents and Democrats, and in every region in the state;
* Scott Milne is in a statistical tie with Molly Gray. This is the best a Republican has performed in a VPR Lieutenant Governor race poll since Phil Scott was Lieutenant Governor.
* Scott Milne is beating Molly Gray among Independents, and Molly Gray is struggling to get even just 6 in 10 Democrats to commit to voting for her;
* Scott Milne does twice as well among Democrats as Molly Gray does among Republicans; and
* Most Vermonters support the opening of Vermont’s schools and colleges for in-person instruction.
Let me make a prediction right now: the 2020 Governor’s race is over. David Zuckerman’s political career is finished. He has no chance against Governor Scott. The Vermont Democratic Party has all-but abandoned the gubernatorial election this year, and for a good reason.
But more surprising is how close the Lieutenant Governor’s race is. Scott Milne and Molly Gray are practically tied. When Scott Milne ran for Governor against Peter Shumlin in 2014, the VPR poll had him down by 11 points; he only lost by 1 point. If Scott Milne makes up the same ground between now and the election as he did in 2014, he’ll win the Lieutenant Governor’s race.
And he needs to. Because despite Molly Gray’s portrayal of herself as a “moderate,” she’s really a die-hard progressive. She supports a $30 million per-year Green New Deal, mandatory paid leave funded by a new payroll tax, and a government takeover of health care. And, as was revealed this week, she has proposed more than half a billion dollars in new state spending.
Molly Gray has the same “promise now, deliver later” attitude that lost Peter Shumlin his political career. Perhaps that’s why Republicans and Democrats alike have stepped out in support of Scott Milne.
And if the two Republicans at the top of the state ticket are doing well, that’s good news for our House and Senate candidates running for the Legislature.
All-in-all, Vermont Democrats are sweating right now. They know the numbers--Vermont Republicans are performing better than anyone thought possible.
The wind is at our back. Let’s keep up the momentum all the way through election day, so we can finally restore balance in Montpelier.
Sincerely,

A Message From The Chair
## Governor Plans to Reduce Tax Burden
As the Legislature came back into session this week, many hard-working Vermont taxpayers await their actions with baited breath and a tight grasp on their wallets. During the off-season a group of legislators was going around the state promoting a brand new tax that Vermonter drivers would have to pay, but would be managed by another entity outside of our state's control. We also heard perennial politicians promoting more attacks on our 2nd amendment rights. The beginning of the legislative session can be an anxious time given the current single-party rule.
But the silver lining is that we also heard from a Republican Governor who hinted that his upcoming budget proposal will keep in mind the forgotten taxpayer. Here is just a brief excerpt from the Governor's state of the state speech:
""It’s also important to remember that over the last three years, we’ve taken steps to help Vermonters keep more of what they earn. This includes removing the tax on social security for low- and moderate-income Vermonters, lowering income tax rates across the board, significantly reducing the land gains tax, bringing the estate tax more in line with our neighbors and more.
But this is not enough. Overall tax and fee burden is still growing far too fast, especially property taxes, and you can expect additional targeted tax relief in my budget. Because, ultimately, we need to help people in all parts of the state move up the economic ladder, and the best way to do this is to level the economic playing field and make Vermont more affordable for all families and every business.""
While we support the Governor's efforts to lead us into a new year and a new budget that can help Vermonters keep more of what they earn, we also need to support our House & Senate legislators to do the work in their respective bodies and in their committees to help establish and put into effect the common unifying issue of all Republicans to helping make Vermont affordable for everyone from our seniors on fixed incomes, to our families with young children. Everyone deserves to enjoy their fruits of their own labor and our Republican Governor and Republican legislators are there to advance that vision and that hope in the coming year.
Sincerely,
Deb Billado

A Message From The Chair
The Decommissioning of Democrat Created Big Government Commissions
There was a time in Vermont history, when all state offices as well as the legislature and judiciary were controlled by Republicans. Not that things were perfect then but with a steadfast attitude that they were answerable to the people, these dedicated public servants kept government big enough to do the important things that only government can and should do, while keeping it small enough not to get in the way of the citizens exercising their God given rights to live in a free society to raise families and build communities. To maintain the trust of the people, government stayed close and accountable to its citizens in an atmosphere of transparency.
Since the Democrats and Progressives have captured control over the direction government goes, they have imprinted on its actions their misguided belief that only they know what was right for its citizens. They created many boards or commissions, which in an ideal world would provide for a closer tie to the voters allowing citizens to have input into their government but in fact, however, have created a huge bureaucracy, unaccountable to the people and lacking in transparency. The monster has gotten so big that the State of Vermont was unable to keep accurate count of all the boards or commissions that have been created. Not only that, even when some of them ceased to be needed, the legislature, much like a hoarder, did nothing to get rid of even those that cluttered the government, unnecessarily creating cost and inefficiency.
There is no question that some commissions serve a good purpose and allow some citizens to participate in their government. Even so, there are too many of them that don’t do much, are redundant, or have outlived their purpose. Even on the other side of the coin, some of these do too much, are abusive and cause harm to the citizens they are supposed to be helping.
The legislature has created a new board to be known as the Sunset Advisory Board to evaluate the other boards and to make recommendations regarding their continuation. I think I know what you’re thinking but it’s the bureaucratic way. While providing some hope, I would not get to eager to see the numbers reduced dramatically since some of the Board’s members are the ones who created many of these boards in the first place. We can always hope that they will do the right thing for Vermonters and will recommend decommissioning the unneeded boards and those that have done more harm than good.
One such undeserving board being considered by the Sunset Advisory Board for elimination is Vermont’s State Board of Education (SBE) and rightfully so. The SBE has used its large budget to assault local control of towns over their schools, by using unreasonable mandates to independent schools, undermining the 150 year old school choice system, and closing school districts in their attempt to shore up a failing public school system that is losing students for many reasons and which no longer, for many, provides the quality education these people want for their children. The state can do quite well without such wrongful interference, thank you!
Republicans know there is more work to do. Any new boards created should have expiration dates and some others, for example, Governor Shumlin’s Green Mountain Care Board should get scrutiny for possible elimination. This will be a long process to dismantle the massive, expensive bureaucracy constructed by the Democrats and Progressives, but we can in earnest start the process by electing more Republicans to State and local offices in 2020, enlarge the presence of Republicans in the House and Senate and support those who advocate for smaller more responsive government, one that is once again transparent and accountable to the people.

A Message From The Chair
Republican Leaders Have it Right on Corvid-19 Response
The Coronavirus is undoubtedly a concern for many Vermonters, especially considering the virus has been confirmed to have spread to our state. Despite the wealth of misinformation being pushed for partisan purposes, the handling of this health crisis has been robust since its earliest stages.
All the way back in January, the President took immediate and decisive action by declaring a public health emergency, imposing reasonable travel restrictions (which other nations soon replicated), and formulated a task force to respond to the crisis. The Centers for Disease Control has been working closely with our nation’s leaders to coordinate prevention efforts.
Additionally, Congress and the President passed a law allocating more than $8 billion in emergency funding to support vaccine development, assist states with aid, and increase the overall health preparedness of the nation. Since that time, the CDC has been working to accelerate the production and distribution of testing kits at a remarkable rate.
Meanwhile, the President has worked to ease economic concerns by urging the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates to counter market instability, as well as proposing fiscal relief for Americans, including payroll tax cuts and support for hourly workers.
At the state level, the Governor has formed a COVID-19 Task Force composed of health and emergency preparedness officials and has regularly updated the public (in conjunction with the Vermont Department of Health) on developments. The Governor also activated the State Emergency Operations Center to expand the capacity of the state to support the response to the virus.
At the same time, the Governor’s Administration has directed insurance providers in Vermont to cover medically necessary Coronavirus testing without charging Vermont consumers out-of-pocket.
One thing is clear: the federal and state Republican executive branch leadership’s response to the Coronavirus has been well-managed since the very beginning.
To learn more, I would encourage you to go right to the facts by accessing the CDC’s website by clicking here, and the Vermont Department of Health’s website by clicking here.

POSTPONED:
VTGOP State Committee 1st Quarter Meeting Scheduled for 3/28
The VT Republican Party will be postponing it's regularly quarterly state committee meeting that was originally scheduled for Saturday 3/28. Since our state party rules require a quarterly meeting, I will hold a token session where the meeting will be officially called to order, then abruptly adjourned without conducting any business.
Next Tuesday March 24th our Executive Committee we will also be discussing possible impacts of other upcoming events, specifically our Town Caucus and Presidential Convention.
Despite our original intention to hold our Platform Convention in May this year, it is likely to be pushed back to its regular time frame in September.
During this time of national crisis, we are proud to have Republicans leading our nation and our state, so let's do our best to continue to support them.
Sincerely,
Deb Billado, State Party Chair

A Message From The Chair
Montpelier Super Majority Raises Cost of Living AGAIN!
This past Tuesday, the Vermont House of Representatives overrode the Governor’s veto of the minimum wage bill by a single vote. Despite all Republicans (and some Independents and Democrats) voting to sustain the Governor’s veto, the Progressive/Democratic Majority got their way. If this isn’t a wake up call to elect more Republicans in November, then I’m not sure what is.
The effects of this policy (according to legislative economists) will be to raise prices, cost jobs, reduce hours, stagnate state GDP, kick Vermonters off of the benefits cliff, close small businesses, hurt nonprofits, and deepen the economic divide between urban and rural Vermont. Those are the facts.
However raising the minimum wage makes one “feel” is, unfortunately, irrelevant to the reality: this will hurt Vermonters. Period.
It also ignores the fact that Vermont’s minimum wage has increased every single year for the past 15 years (and will continue to increase every year indefinitely), and that our minimum wage is the highest in the country. To impose another increase on small businesses (who are already struggling with excessive taxes and regulation) is a recipe for economic disaster.
This policy will have the effect of a massive transfer of wealth from poor, struggling, rural areas to already vibrant areas of our state. We cannot afford it--but the Democrats and Progressives insisted on it anyway.
We should be proud of our House Republican Caucus for sticking together and voting against this bill, and supporting Governor Scott’s wise decision to veto it. But let this vote outcome be a motivator to run for office, volunteer on a campaign, or donate to help or even just get out to the polls in November to bolster our Republican ranks in the Legislature.
We came just one single vote shy of sustaining Gov. Scott's veto. YOU might have been the one person to restore fiscal responsibility we need in the next legislative session. We were so close - can you help us bridge that gap? Let’s turn this latest mandate from Montpelier into a rallying cry for balance and common sense--for fiscal sanity and affordability.
We can achieve a more prosperous Vermont. But only if we work together to restore balance in the Legislature.
Sincerely,
Deb Billado

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Vermont Republican Party Touts 2020 Republican Recruitment Numbers
Highlights Significant Increases in Republican Candidates Across Vermont
Berlin, VT -- On Monday, the Vermont Republican Party highlighted the 2020 Republican candidates for public office in Vermont who will be on the Republican primary ballot, noting significant trends favoring a Republican wave in the state.
The Party announced the recruitment of 112 candidates for both House and Senate seats, as well as 22 candidates for federal, state, and county offices in Vermont--a marked increase over 2018 figures.
“I am thrilled to see so many Vermont Republicans step up and run for office,” said Deb Billado, Chair of the Vermont Republican Party. “This year’s slate of Republican candidates represents all 14 counties in our state, and indicates strong competition for more House and Senate seats than in years past. I look forward to working with these candidates to make Vermont a more affordable place to live, work, raise a family, and do business, and to bring balance to Montpelier.”
Notably, competitive Republican candidates have appeared in several key districts, including crucial open seats in the Northeast Kingdom, as well as Central and Southern Vermont. Specific top-line highlights include:
* 113 Republican House and Senate candidates filed to run in the primary, an increase of 15 compared to 2018;
* 90 Republicans are running for 85 seats in the House and 23 Republicans are running for 20 seats in the Senate.
* 51 new Republican challenger candidates for House seats, up by 12 compared to 2018;
* Only 5 Republican retirements across the House and Senate--meaning there are fewer than one-third the number of Republican retirements compared to 2018;
* Nearly 40% of House GOP incumbents and 50% of Senate GOP incumbents are running without Democrat or Progressive opposition, virtually double the percentage of those incumbents who ran unopposed in 2018;
* A full slate of House GOP candidates in Lamoille and Orleans counties, and a nearly-full slate in Rutland and Caledonia counties;
* A full slate of Senate GOP candidates in the Caledonia, Franklin, Lamoille, Orange, Rutland, and Washington districts;
* The number of Democratic and Progressive House and Senate retirements has increased by 5 compared to two years ago (from 15 in 2018 to 20 in 2020), while the number of Republican retirements has declined by 8 over the same period;
* A marked increase in the number of contested House Democratic Primaries by more than 2.5 times compared to 2018\--most of which are challenges against existing Democratic incumbents--signaling Democratic infighting and division; and
* 22 separate Republican candidates for Federal, State, and County-wide offices.
Additionally, the VT Republican Party has already secured some and will continue to recruit more candidates before the August 11th Primary, which are not yet included in the numbers above. The Party's goal is to provide every voter in Vermont with a true choice in their legislative representation with at least one Republican candidate on their 2020 ballot for either House or Senate.
Any potential candidates who would like to learn more about how they can secure their name on the general election ballot should contact the state party at [[URL REDACTED]]

VT Republican Party,info@vtgop.org,"VTDems ""prayerfully"" fundraise off impeachment","It's with heavy hearts that... Democrats are asking for money
# VT Democrats blast fundraiser after ""prayerful"" impeachment
Dear Friend,
We have been hearing that DC Democrats have been ""prayerfully"" considering whether or not to ""impeach the $%&^%&$ker"". Despite the breakneck speed at which they have raced through impeachment proceedings, Speaker Nancy Pelosi would like us all to ignore the comments from certain of the far-left Democratic members of Congress and to believe that it is with a broken heart and a solemn prayer that they consider impeaching President Trump.
The entire Democratic Congressional caucus was so somber in fact that Speaker Pelosi had to scold her fellow Democrats after they burst out in spirited cheers when their heartbroken, prayerful votes were cast. These kind of partisan shenanigans are what have led one Democrat from New Jersey to #WalkAway from the National Democratic Party and join the Republicans!
But as irreverent and two-faced the Democrats in Washington were, back at home the VT Democrats made no pretense that they were so thrilled about impeachment, that their ""Rapid Response"" team sent out an urgent fundraiser. See below:
I'm not sure whether I should be disappointed that the VT Dems have become even more insensitive to seriousness of the matter of impeachment, or whether I should be relieved that at least they are not making a mockery of the process by saying one thing and doing another! VT Dems clearly see impeachment as primarily an opportunity to send out a political fundraising email!
Help us put an end to this nonsense. At the VTGOP we are working hard now, even over the holidays, to improve our operations in order to build support for our party and recruit more candidates here in VT for 2020. Just today I had a meeting with staff to review a number of you who have expressed an interest in running for office. Over the weekend I met with our county chairs from across the state to discuss some exciting training opportunities we are hoping to roll out in the new year, as well as how we can help candidates and town committees today.
We have an amazing opportunity in 2020. For the first time in recent memory Democrats are imploding with internal party fights, and self-destructing messaging that has seen President's Trump approval numbers rise, and has even left some Main Street Democratic voters feeling very uncomfortable with their party's focus on hurting Trump - instead of on helping hard-working Americans. Regardless of what's going on in Washington, we ask you to take a moment and show your support for the Republican Party here in VT. Would you please make a donation of $5, $15, $25 or $50 to help us build our base and take on the Democrats?
Thanks for your consideration and support,
Chair, Deb Billado & Team VTGOP

Vermont Republican Party Releases Campaign Video in Response to Zuckerman
Berlin, VT --
Earlier today David Zuckerman released his campaign ad which reminds Vermonter that voting for Democrats means going backward. In the ad Zuckerman wants to take Vermonters back to 2014 and Progressive Governor Peter Shumlin's failed experiment with Single-Payer Health Care. We couldn't afford it when times were good and revenues were strong - how can we afford it now?
Democrats are lining up behind Zuckerman and his attempt to further bankrupt the state with ideas that have already been proven (by other Democrats) NOT to work.
Instead of following failed leadership of the past, Vermonters need a brighter vision for a new future.
That's why the VT Republican Party have launched a new campaign ad to compliment our existing radio ads to let Vermonters know that the best way to support Governor Phil Scott and his hope for a brighter future for Vermont is to help elect Republicans to the House and Senate so they can work WITH Governor Scott to move Vermont Forward into economic recovery.
You can see the new video here:

A Message From The Chair
## This Badge Means So Much!
When I consider the calls for defunding and disbanding police departments, I cannot wrap my head around what those people are thinking. How do they imagine they will be safe in their home, work and play without the protection our police provide? I would not be able to sleep soundly at night if I knew our police were not there. Just being there serves to provide a sense of security and well being. Without them, we would have chaos and anarchy.
The primary role of government is to protect the public so they can live safe, productive lives as they build their community, state, and nation. The founders understood this, and the police powers they created are essential to what has made America great and safe. Imagine a world without our police? Without them, all individuals and households would have to be armed to the tooth to protect their very existence. These are unsettling times and so many people have lost their way and have no respect for human life and what it means. To suggest that in these times of crisis we should eliminate the stabilizing force of police in our land, is irresponsible.
While no one should die at the hands of the police, the nature of the role law enforcers are asked to perform sometimes brings the need for use of deadly force to protect public safety. Most do not, but some fail in the use of that power. George Floyd should not have been killed by the officer arresting him. We must not, however, paint all law enforcement with this tainted brush, and see only the bad acts and forget the countless good our police have done. Humans by nature are imperfect and people in all professions fail and disappoint us. How would you feel as a teacher that you were condemned because a teacher abused a minor in their charge? What if you were a surgeon who was condemned because another surgeon committed malpractice, and someone died? Because some business people are crooked, would it be right for you to be so accused because you own your business? We hold the bad apple accountable and try to build into the system a better way to prevent such wrongful acts in the future. That is the way it should be with our police.
We all know that this wrongful act by the arresting officer is being used by criminals, anarchists, terrorists, and haters, to kill, burn, loot, and destroy. Some are intent on creating chaos, but we should not be a party to this. We have a right to protest and sometimes, the louder the better. But we must be alert not to be used by those who would destroy our way of life. Police are targets from those who benefit from uncontrolled chaos and we must not let this dim the truth that police provide deterrence of criminal acts by some and protect us each and every day while putting their own lives on the line. While we are legitimately concerned about any wrongful police action, we must not unwittingly join in the call for a form of justice that would eliminate those who bring justice to the people.
Justice can never be at the hands of a mob or outside the good order that society has established in dealing with it. Justice is supposed to be blind. It is not driven by emotion, fear, and hate. The justice in the streets where buildings and cars are burned is not justice but is hate and revenge. The officer who knelt on George Floyd’s neck until he died, is and should be prosecuted. That is where justice will and must be had. If we reject that ideal, then we are doomed as a civilized nation. Even this officer is entitled to due process and a trial before his peers to determine his guilt. It cannot be decided by those rioting in the streets or by a biased press who seem to want the role of prosecutor, judge, and jury.
So, in closing, the words in “this badge”, written by an unknown author are worthy of presenting to speak of the overall value and service of our police.
Let me tell you about the badge and the thousands of good men and women it represents.
This badge ran towards certain death as the Towers collapsed on 9-11.
This badge ran into the line of fire to save the people in the Pulse Night Club.
This badge sheltered thousands as bullets rained down from the Mandalay Hotel in Las Vegas.
This badge protected a BLM rally that left five officers dead in Dallas.
This badge ran into the Sandy Hook School to stop a school shooter.
This badge killed the Oregon District mass shooter in seconds.
This badge has done CPR on your drowned child.
This badge has fist fought the wife beater who left his spouse in a coma.
This badge has run into burning buildings to save the occupants.
This badge has been shot for simply existing.
This badge has waded through flood waters to rescue the elderly trapped on the roof.
This badge has intentionally crashed into the wrong way driver to protect innocent motorists.
This badge has helped find the lost child so his mother would stop crying hysterically.
This badge has helped the injured dog off the road and rushed it to the vet.
This badge has escorted the elderly woman across the street because she could not see well and was afraid to cross.
This badge has bought food for hungry kids because they had been abandoned.
This badge has been soaked in blood and tears.
This badge has been covered by a mourning band to honor those who have sacrificed everything in service.
You may hate me because I wear it. But I wear it with pride. Despite your hate and your anger, I will await the next call for help. And I will come running without hesitation. Just like the thousands of men and women across this great nation.
-Author unknown
Please remember that what happened in Minneapolis was the action of one bad person and should not be attributed to those police who are our family, friends, neighbors, and protectors. May God bless and protect them all!

A Message From The Chair
Count Your Blessings
In Times Like These, Count Your Blessings!
The coronavirus pandemic is causing disruption of all segments of our society. Government has ordered the closing of many businesses and the suspension of activities that created economic wealth, services, products and pastimes for people. Theaters, sporting events, political rallies, church services, and gatherings beyond a certain small number have been ordered to end. Even schools have been closed.
With the free-fall of the stock-market comes the fear for the retired and those close to ending their time working, that they will not have enough funds to make it through retirement. No longer can you treat yourself at the end of the week with a Saturday morning pancake and maple syrup breakfast at your local eatery in town. All have been ordered closed. We are also seeing empty grocery store shelves, and this is adding to the apprehension of it all.
It all seems so overwhelming, but instead of dwelling on all the negativity and being consumed by fear, we must count our blessings. God did not give us a spirit of fear but of power and love. We should look for good things and opportunities to make a difference. We should be inspired to do random acts of kindness. Take joy in the loved ones around you. Read some inspiring literature. Study your Bible. Play with your dog or cat and be thankful for the smiles of your grandchildren.
The current crisis that is affecting our retirement plans, our investments, and our daily movement will pass, but for now gives us the opportunity to make a choice between fear or recognizing the blessings we have living in such a wonderful country, surrounded by people who care about us. We should reciprocate those feelings. If we know of an elderly person, we can be assured that few will be visiting them out of fear of transmitting a virus to them. Send them a card, call them or send an email. Offer to drop some food off on their doorstep.
Small business is the backbone of our state and they are the ones adversely affected by the governmental measures taken to reduce exposure to the Covid-19 virus. Try to think of ways to encourage the ones we can in these hard times that impact their livelihood. Send them a note with a compliment about their service and how you look forward to coming to their store and buying from them. Maybe offer to buy a gift certificate from your local closed eatery by email, website or phone so they will have the funds to use to get them over the hump. You can always choose to use the certificate later, or even give it back to the owner as a gift after they reopen. Make sure when this is all over, to support them so they will be there for you tomorrow.
America is a nation known for its ability to always overcome the odds and come out the other side a winner as a stronger and better nation. The United States knows adversity and we learn to live with that for we must, however, we will not countenance defeat. We will overcome this, and we will be stronger because of it. A must lesson to take away is the need for good government, one whose leaders make decisions in the bests interests of those they represent. That used to be the Vermont way and it can only happen again when the Republicans are back in control of that government. The most important election you will ever vote in is just 8 short months away. Republicans must hold the presidency, the US Senate, win back the US House and return the GOP to power in Vermont state government.
Hard times can also offer us the chance to pursue a different course in life, something you didn’t do before but now are forced to try. Maybe run for office yourself but whatever it is, be persistent,
know your purpose, be optimistic and never give up. You have been through tough times before and you made it and prospered. You will again!
Sincerely,
Sincerely,
Deb Billado

The Vermont Republican Party,info@vtgop.org,ACTION ALERT! Release COVID Relief Funds,"View this email in your browser
# Vermonters, This Money Is for YOU, Not Legislators
Federal COVID relief funds were specifically designated to help Vermont businesses and citizens survive the financial shutdown brought about by the pandemic. Governor Scott and Vermont Republicans are urging the legislature to release $310 million of those funds to do just that.
Unfortunately, the Democrats and Progressives who control the legislature are withholding all but $93 million of that money – from you. Why?
As reported on WPTZ and other news sources, “[House Speaker Mitzy] Johnson said lawmakers want to help Vermont businesses but must also plan for ""unforeseen circumstances"" in the months ahead and hopes Congress will change some of the rules so those dollars can be used to fill the state's own budget gaps.” (emphasis added)
That is NOT what this money is for.
The legislature is responsible for crafting a budget. This is no doubt a difficult task given the economic shutdown and the resulting revenue shortfalls that will require some difficult decisions. But, withholding relief funds from suffering Vermonters in hopes that they will be able to at some later date confiscate that money to make their own jobs easier is not the way to go about it.
TAKE ACTION! Please join us in contacting your Representatives and Senators today and telling them to release the COVID relief funds NOW. (FIND YOUR LEGISLATOR HERE)
Vermonters deserve and expect this help. This is what the money was allocated for. Use it!

A Message From The Chair
A Difficult Balancing Act
Across the nation, our President and the governors of our states and territories are coordinating an unprecedented response to a global pandemic, the likes of which our nation has never seen in modern times.
These efforts include distributing medical supplies, breaking down barriers to bureaucratic inaction, making difficult decisions about how to allocate scarce resources, and issuing strict safety guidelines and orders. It is difficult--if not impossible--to imagine the gravity of each and every one of these decisions. Every action taken has the potential to impact the lives of millions. This is the weight and burden our governors and President carry every single day.
Our leaders are engaged in an unenvious balancing act, in which they are simultaneously obligated to protect our lives and our Constitutionally-guaranteed freedoms. In many cases, the answers aren’t always obvious, clear, or easy. In fact, more often than not, the decisions our Republican leaders have made have required extremely careful deliberation, consideration, and contemplation of all the facts.
I won’t pretend to hide that this balancing act has produced--and will continue to produce--results that are somewhat imperfect and controversial. However, they represent the efforts of informed leaders--guided by facts--to make decisions which reflect their best intentions toward the well being of society. Despite disagreements we may have about the particulars of certain measures, we must bear this in mind.
Moving forward, we should continuously reflect upon the hard work and care our nation’s leaders have taken. And, if you are able and inclined to help in this enormous effort, please consider volunteering your time and energies to do so.
Together, as we have in the past, we will move through this and prevail.
Sincerely,
Deb Billado
Chairwoman, VTGOP

"Deb Billado, Republican State Party Chair",info@vtgop.org,Soooooo Cold! - VTGOP Weekly Newsletter -12/13/19,"The only thing colder that a Vermont winter, is paying higher taxes on heating fuel View this email in your browser
# Weekly Newsletter
### December 13th, 2019
A Message From The Chair
So Cold!
December can be a time of wonder and delight as we prepare for the Christmas Season, as we think about the joy that family and loved ones bring to our lives. But it can also be a time of stress. Unfortunately many Vermonters have a hard time making ends meet, and the demands of December can put extra financial stress on some households.
So as some of you are fueling or refueling your oil tanks this winter, it's worth remembering that the VT Republican House caucus stood united and stood strong to oppose a doubling of the fuel tax earlier this year.
The Democrat-controlled Ways & Means committee (i.e. the Tax Committee) supported a measure that would have doubled the tax charged on EVERY GALLON of heating fuel that Vermont families would buy. Even though the measure passed in the House (81-60) that bill has not made it through the Senate - at least not yet.
Surprisingly there have been a number of people on our facebook page that seem to think the tax increase isn't that big, or that it adds up to an ""insignificant increase"" While we're glad that there are some people out there that don't have to worry about an extra $50 here or there, at the Republican Party we know that every penny is valuable to the people who earned it.
You see the most unfortunate thing about this tax is that it is incredibly regressive, and it disproportionately hits low and middle income Vermonters - as well as forcing that tax burden primarily on the more rural parts of the state. It's pretty easy for the Democrats who live in Chittenden County and have access to natural gas to pass a tax that won't affect them - but Vermont Republicans are here to help our rural community survive and thrive - not throw another tax burden around their neck in the dead of winter, right around Christmas time, when people need their money the most so that they can show their appreciation to their loved ones. There is no tax out there that can do more good than the good that Vermonters do for one another around the Holidays.
If you haven't seen the images, check out our facebook page, we have every Democrat who voted to increase the burden, all organized by county. And help us spread the word around your town or county.
We appreciate the fact that there were a few Democrats and Independents that joined Republicans to oppose this tax on poor and rural Vermonters - but we need more people to stand with us. If Republicans elect just 7 more candidates to the legislature we can STOP this from becoming a reality next year. While Governor Scott has said that he would never support a carbon tax, we need enough Republican in the legislature to sustain his veto if bills like this move forward in the future.
If you or any one else you want to help us join the fight against tax increases, please have them fill out our candidate interest form, and we'll have someone reach out to you.
Sincerely,
Deb Billado

# Tomorrow is Opening Day - Are You Ready?
Tomorrow, May 14th will be the FIRST Day that candidates for House, Senate and Statewide offices can submit their Candidate Consent Forms to signify their intention to run for office in the Republican Primary.
This year because of the COVID-19 crisis, candidates are not required to submit ANY petition signature. So if you've thought about running for office before THIS will be the easiest year ever to get on the ballot - IF you do it in time.
While the bar has been lowered on the requirements, the window has also been drastically shortened. While tomorrow is the FIRST day for forms to be submitted, the LAST day will be Thursday May 28th - just two weeks away!
Let me just add a personal word too. So often as I've talked with Republicans so many admit that it's too hopeless to run as a conservative in Vermont. People will tell me that there's no use saving the state, we'll just have to wait until it collapses.
Well, right now we are closer to that reality than ever before. The current fiscal year is nearly $400 Million short, and that had 8 months of normal economic activity, the year ahead is going to need fiscally conservative Republicans in the House and Senate now more than ever. People are looking at the numbers, thinking about the economy and recovery and I believe the scales may be tipped in favor of VT Republicans for the first time in a while. So please if you want to learn more or talk about what it's like to run for office, please reach out to me and I'm happy to share my experience about how I took out and incumbent Democrat in a purple district and what resources the party is planning to provide our candidates for the campaign season ahead.
Your state needs you now more than ever. Consider joining our rebel alliance today.

A Message From The Chair
This Constitution Was Built To Last
During these 2020 presidential primaries, those who are watching, have witnessed the rhetoric from Democrat candidates that exhibits either a lack of understanding of or a disregard for our United States Constitution. It is only important to them when it furthers their narrative and they are all too willing to ignore it when it does not. The Constitution of the United States is the supreme law of the land and was not intended to just serve the political motives of politicians. The Constitution needs to be followed as written and is the foundation of how the government is to function and that does not change just because the politicians change.
Democrats and Progressives seem willing to interpret the Constitution in ways that the founders would never have considered and surely did not intend. The First Amendment free exercise of religion is more often seen by partisan politicians who do not support religious liberty as not promoting religious freedom but instead freedom from religion. The right to bear arms guaranteed by the Second Amendment is daily being eroded by liberal politicians who could care less about what the Constitution says and means. There are many other areas where the Constitution is being ignored or subverted.
The Constitution is not a “living” document meant to be reinterpreted differently by every generation. The late Justice Antonin Scalia said that the Constitution is not a living document but a legal one and “should not be taken as a living, ever changing document”. This thinking ensures stability and certainty as to how government functions so our people can understand their place in the large scheme of being a citizen.
The Constitution was built to last and because it has and has allowed America to become the greatest nation ever to have existed on earth is testament to the wisdom of founders in making it hard to amend.
There have been relatively few amendments to the Vermont Constitution in over two centuries but at present the super-majority Democrat legislature is considering nine amendments that are at various stages of consideration. Because of the super-majority power to have their way, we should be even more cautious about the changes in our foundational document that these partisans want. While the state constitutional amendment process is not as difficult as the federal one, it does present us with the opportunity to scrutinize and understand what they are up to and we should and will do that.
We should not be surprised in the hyper-political atmosphere we see in Montpelier that what is being proposed just may be more political than furthering of the best interest of the people. That is why it is so important that we elect conservative Republican members to the Senate and House in 2020 to provide a balance and prevent an abuse of the process in changing our basic guiding document. We must not be weakened further in our legislative representation and if we are, we can only blame ourselves for not running, encouraging those who do and most importantly, voting for our Republican candidates.
Sincerely,
Deb Billado

A Message From The Chair
Dems & Progs Out To Raise Your Taxes Even More
This half of the legislative biennium, Vermont Democrats and Progressives in Montpelier have gone full-steam-ahead on new taxes and fees they want you to pay. It seems they can’t get enough new revenue for their pet projects and initiatives, and they need already-struggling Vermont taxpayers to pay even more. Here is just a handful of their proposed tax and fee hikes:
* Creating a new payroll tax on Vermont workers and small businesses;
* Raising state income tax rates;
* Imposing a new income tax surcharge;
* Creating a property transfer tax surcharge;
* Increasing the fuel tax and adding a new motor fuel fee;
* Adding a new purchase and use tax for new cars;
* Imposing a new occupancy fee;
* Crafting a new excise tax on sugar-sweetened beverages; and
* Taxing the transfer of tax-exempt property.
Again, these are just a sample of some of the tax and fee measures that Vermont’s Legislative Majority wants to impose on you.
Meanwhile, Vermont Republicans are leading the charge for tax relief. Legislative Republicans have proposed eliminating the tax on Social Security income, as well as military retirement income. They’ve put forth tax incentives to spur economic development. And Governor Scott recently announced an 11 percent decline in Workers’ Compensation tax rates.
While Democrats and Progressives are eager to raise your taxes, Vermont Republicans are hard at work to cut them. Let’s empower our Republican legislators under the Golden Dome by electing more Republicans to the State House this November, in order to secure more tax relief for all.
Sincerely,
Deb Billado

# “Molly Gray--Not Who You Think”

Molly Gray has been a so-called “rising star” in the Vermont Democrat Party, defeating Senate President Pro-Tem Tim Ashe, Senator Debbie Ingram, and activist Brenda Siegal in a four-way primary.
But Gray’s success may have been more about her opponents’ shortcomings than her own advantages. In fact, we must ask, what does Gray bring to the table? Here’s what I found:
* A record of not having voted at all between 2010 and 2016, yet expecting Vermonters to vote for her;
* A dispute over whether or not she even meets the Vermont Constitution’s guidelines to qualify for Lieutenant Governor, with her own party criticizing her over the matter;
* No significant private sector experience whatsoever; and
* A campaign platform indistinguishable from the Progressive Wing of the Democratic Party.
Gray might try to dress herself up as a moderate who wants to work with Governor Phil Scott when she’s elected. She says she wants to be a “partner” with Vermont’s Governor. But when Tim Ashe said his top priority would be getting rid of Governor Scott during a May candidate forum, Gray sat there without a word of opposition--in silent concurrence.
Let me be clear: Gray doesn’t want to be partnership-oriented. She wants to be partisanship-oriented.
Gray’s website is full of platitudes and non-solutions to Vermont’s serious problems, with little specifics on how to actually achieve them. But when she is forced to be specific, her answers are right-in-line with the far-left:
* Implementing paid leave with a new mandatory payroll tax on Vermont workers of $29 million;
* Supporting a so-called mandatory “livable wage” which is estimated to be $39.10 per hour for a single parent with two kids in Vermont. How is that sustainable for Vermont’s small businesses?
* Enacting the Global Warming Solutions Act (GWSA), which would impose job killing regulations and open the state to massive lawsuits.
####
Absent from the issues page of Gray’s website is ANY mention of four key contributors to Vermonters’ high cost of living: taxes, fees, housing costs, and health care reform. They are nowhere on her issues page.
And one of her first endorsements? Peter Shumlin. What a great character reference!
To recap, Molly has not distinguished herself with any unique or new ideas to Vermont’s challenges, wants to continue the failed liberal policies of the past, hasn’t been interested enough to vote unless she’s the one on the ballot, and may not even be eligible for the office that she’s seeking.
And this is the Vermont Democrat Party’s rising star?
I’ll leave you with a quote from one of Gray’s fellow Democrats, Rep. Randall Szott (D-Barnard):
“Molly Gray is perfect - a perfect simulacrum generated by marketing, polling, and communication research. A lab tested candidate with empty slogans and an ‘aw shucks I’m from Vermont’ dodge of her elite grooming.”
Ouch.
Sincerely,

### Hon. Bruce Poliquin (R-ME)
Bruce Poliquin is a Republican politician who represented Maine's 2nd congressional district in the United States House of Representatives from 2015 to 2019. From 2010 to 2012 he was the Maine State Treasurer. In January 2017, at the start of the 115th United States Congress, Poliquin was the only Republican representing a U.S. House district in New England.
Poliquin was defeated in his 2018 run for reelection after Maine adopted ranked-choice voting. Despite winning the first tally, he lost the election. Poliquin claimed the ranked-choice voting process used in the election was unconstitutional and he sued to have ranked-choice voting declared unconstitutional, but his lawsuit was rejected.
Come hear first hand the dangers of ranked-choice voting, how to persevere as a Republican in New England and about Former Rep. Poliquin’s time serving the citizens of Maine.

A Message From The Chair
News in Pursuit of Truth?
##
## Last week I submitted my Friday message to two on-line news services, True North Reports and VTDigger. True North felt it worthy to publish and in fact the day after it was, they reported; MOST READ: Republicans truly care for you (Democrats, not so much). There were many comments posted that evidenced the newsworthiness of what I wrote, something that True North Reports recognized but VTDigger, not so much. Cate Chant, the news editor for VTDigger, a 501(c)(3) tax exempt organization that claims to be “News in Pursuit of Truth”, sent a rejection to our publication request, writing:
## “We would be happy to publish commentary from Deb if they weren't so incendiary, mean-spirited and insulting to her opponents. Sentences like ""Simply put, the Grand Old Party really cares for you, but the liberal left, not so much, and how they use the “Cares” funds clearly shows that for all to see"" are not in the spirit of honest debate, nor is lumping all opponents as the ""liberal left””.
## Give us all a break! My dictionary defines incendiary as “likely to cause violence or strong feelings of anger:” This word is fitting for the burning, looting, anarchy that is happening in so many of our major, Democrat controlled cities. I am OK with people criticizing or differing from what I think and write, but this is outrageous and insupportable.
## My message is the news and is the truth that VTDigger is supposed to be pursuing. The CARES funds that the Speaker of the House wants to hold onto in the hope that at some point in the future the federal government will allow her to use them for other reasons is just plain wrong! That money is intended for the people and not for the purpose of bailing out the state for the past wrong governance that created large shortfalls in our budget. Hurting people need that money now! I could understand it if a news organization called the Speaker’s money withholding actions “mean-spirited” but to call me out as that for revealing what the Speaker intends is beyond the pale.
## Now, with so many people out of work, our left leaning legislators plan to take July off, come back in August to spend more money on some things beyond what Vermont takes in in revenue. Now that is “insulting” to us all and yet my words pointing this out is tagged as an insult by VTDigger.
## I stand by what I wrote. Vermont Republicans genuinely care and while Democrats use high sounding rhetoric to convince people they do; their words are empty when put next to their actions. Actions such as the most recent one where their majority, over the objections of all Republicans, Independents and some of their own party just voted themselves a pay increase. Does that show caring for those who have no paycheck and are struggling just to survive?

Actions such as the most recent one where their majority, over the objections of all Republicans, Independents and some of their own party just voted themselves a pay increase. Does that show caring for those who have no paycheck and are struggling just to survive?
## There is so much more. I believe the Democrats are concerned and rightfully so that the electorate is onto them and so instead of working to insure that the upcoming elections are fair and their integrity is unassailable, they are supporting the scheme of the Democrat Secretary of State to send ballots to all on the check lists, including those who are dead, have left the state or are uninterested. The opportunity for fraud is immense and one can only draw certain conclusions based on who wants to weaken the safety of the voting system and who wants to keep it strong and fair. The Democrat Party is even pursuing an expensive campaign to paint the Republicans as uncaring to the health of Vermonters in opposing the mail-in voting scheme. Vermont currently has a highly effective and safe absentee voting system and all folks need do is to ask for a ballot or vote early at the Town Clerk’s office. This bullying tactic by the Democrats to try to paint Republicans as insensitive to the health of voters cannot stand without firing back with the truth. If we can open the economy and safely carry on many activities in commerce, if we can now eat in restaurants, if people can protest without any restrictions, then we surely can vote in person and do it in a safe and effective manner.
## There are many examples of the non-caring nature that Democrats/Progressives have exhibited in Vermont over the past couple of decades. Their position on abortion, oppressive climate change legislation, legalization of an addicting drug for recreational use, physician assisted suicide, excessive taxing of strapped taxpayers, business unfriendly rules, fees and taxes, and for many, the way they keep them beholden to the party with their economic enslaving programs is shameful.
## So many of Vermont’s Democrat leaders also show unwavering support for the agenda of the radical Democrats such as Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, Senator Chuck Schumer, Barack Obama and Joe Biden in their push for open borders, no limits on illegal immigration, sanctuary cities, impeachment without cause of our duly elected president, and so much more. Is it not proper to label them as “uncaring”? I do and I stand by that!
## Vermont Republicans truly care and if you do as well, then vote Republican in November. We have many candidates running and we need them all elected so we can reestablish Vermont as the conservative fiscal and socially responsible place to live and raise families. It used to be that way.
Sincerely,
####

They want evidence as to what has happened with the postcards the Secretary of State sent to every “active” voter in Vermont for the August 11th primary. So, if you received any postcards from the Secretary of State that were addressed to persons who no longer live at your residence, or were incorrectly addressed in some way, please fill out the attached affidavit listing what town you live in, and providing the facts concerning the issue with the request. (For example: I live in Montpelier, Vermont. I received a postcard from the town clerk addressed to my daughter, who has not lived here for 2 years, and is registered to vote in New York.) You can type it, or hand write it. You will need to sign it in front of a notary.

A Message From The Chair
## Let the Vermont Legislative Computer Games END!
Let the legislative computer games end! Pull the plugs. Turn off the WIFI. It is time for the stay-home legislators to cease getting pay-checks for playing expensive computer games with and inflicting pain on Vermonter’s lives. They should finish by dealing with the budget and transportation bills and do no further damage. It costs the taxpayer $250,000 each week extra for the lawmakers to stay home and play legislative computer games with your tax money. They need to let the dust settle on the damage caused by the shutdown ordered as the result of the COVID-19 scare and not add more to the costs and burdens on hard working and hurting Vermonters.
The Democrat super-majority is loving the power and opportunity to impose reckless policies with a key stroke or two. Even though we’re facing a massive budget gap that the Governor has wisely proposed to close without raising taxes, the Democrat leadership cannot help themselves in following Rahm Emanuel’s advice of not letting a crisis go to waste.
Still on their radar are the following that will cause more pain to our citizens, damage their ability to survive and provide a living for their family.
* A massive regulatory bill designed to address climate change through permitting new rules and red tape, including the possibility of banning wood stoves and ATVs;
* A barrage of tax hikes, including raising the sales tax, taxing clothing, bringing back the cloud tax, the sugar tax, candy tax, tax on services like salons, carpenters and landscapers and more.
* The Vermont Democrat leadership’s solution is $167 million in new taxes and that is like tossing a drowning person a steel anchor instead of a life preserving flotation ring.
* Resurrecting a disastrous Act 250 bill to make economic growth even more challenging in Vermont; and
* Creating a retail market for marijuana sales even though recognizing that any revenue will take years to realize, if ever, and the need for large input of taxpayer money (in the neighborhood of $1 Million Dollars) to pay for the commission and to initiate the process of licensing. ..
They consider these things priority but at what cost to us all. It is time to pull the plug and stop them from playing expensive computer games while at the same time staying home and receiving a paycheck. Many Vermonters have been forced to stay home, but they are getting nothing to help them with their expenses. Tell your legislators to sign off and close the session. We do not need any more harm done to us.
Less than six months until the election. We can use our computers too but will use them to do good things for the people. Spread the truth that Republican leaders offer a bright light of hope of good governance for Vermonters, something that has been lacking for decades under Democrat rule. Run for office, support good candidates, vote, and encourage others to do the same.
Sincerely,

# Weekly Newsletter
### January 3rd, 2020
A Message From The Chair
## A Democrat's Plan to Relocate VT Taxpayers
Vermont is currently facing a significant demographic crisis resulting in the decline of needed workers who are exiting our state. The crisis has in large part been caused by the unfriendly business attitude of the Vermont Democrat/Progressive super-majority legislature over the last decade. Over-taxation and over-regulation have hurt Vermont’s businesses, causing some to fail, others to leave while at the same time not attracting new ones. The resulting lack of good jobs caused by bad legislation has resulted in the exodus of workers, both young and old. While our unemployment rate is very low, that can be expected if businesses are not creating new jobs and workers are exiting to find work elsewhere. Vermont has not been participating in the economic prosperity seen elsewhere in America and it is not hard to realize why. Without good jobs, especially for our youth just entering the job market, Vermont’s economic picture looks bleak. To ensure a healthy economy in the future, the jobs and workers must be here. If the declining trend continues, there will be even fewer families paying taxes, fewer dollars that will be spent in the local economy, health care pools that will have become less diverse and riskier, and so on.
I read that Vermont will begin a new incentive program offering $7500.00 for an out-of-state worker to locate here and work for an established business. I have a much better idea. Why not create a business-friendly climate that will encourage existing businesses to stay and new ones to come, resulting in good jobs, employment for those already here, including our adult children? The money saved, small as it may seem, can be returned to the Vermont taxpayer. Good luck with that! With politicians like Anthony Polina, Democrat/Progressive, Washington County, who will in January propose a Vermont New Green Deal, even more taxpayers will consider leaving.
Caught in the middle of it all are Vermont seniors, most of whose income, even though considered above the federal poverty level, is inadequate to provide for the costs of daily living in our state. Vermont ranks as the worst state in the nation for economic security of older couples. Jan Mutchler, a professor of gerontology at UMass Boston is the author of a UMass report indicating Vermont seniors face one of the highest rates of financial insecurity in the nation. The report said the higher costs of health care and housing in Vermont are part of what makes it difficult for seniors to afford living in the state.
Vermont seniors have understood their income will decline once they retire and that they must live on a fixed income, but not that they would be called upon to carry the same or increased tax burdens on that fixed income as when they had a regular paycheck, benefits and were saving for the retirement that they now want to enjoy. Some feel they are forced to leave because of escalation of their property taxes as well as the other taxes that get heaped on them. Last week, a woman, life-long Vermonter, crying, called me, to tell me she had to pay over half of their social security in property taxes and for the first time in their lives, have had to go to a food shelf and to apply for food stamps. Many won’t ask for help because they feel ashamed to let others know that after all their years of work, they cannot even afford enough food.
What is the solution from the Democrats? Senator Ginny Lyons (D-Chittenden), Chair of the Senate Health & Welfare Committee, wants to blame the federal government and wants it to change Social Security and change Medicare to “a rate that is appropriate."" No mention of eliminating taxing senior’s Social Security at the state level, reducing their property tax, stop state over-spending and over-taxing. Instead the Democrats remain obsessed with single-payer health care that leaves seniors with “ever-rising premiums”. Their fixation on a “carbon tax” is the perfect example of why they do not truly care about cash strapped Vermonters and their ability to live here.
All the above adds up to failed leadership in the Democrat Party. It is time for Republicans to be given the opportunity to govern so help us do that. Register to vote and encourage others to do so, volunteer to help candidates, donate to their campaigns, and even decide to run for office yourself. Together we can paint the political landscape in my favorite color which of course is “Republican rosy red”.
Please pass this message onto your like-minded friends.
Sincerely,
Deb Billado

A Message From The Chair

Progressively Aggressive Protests
Anyone who has lived, or driven through downtown Burlington is familiar with our often quirky, but usually peaceful protesters. Whether it's on campus at UVM or at the top of Church St. it has almost become part of our local charm to some attention-getting sign, or a tricked-out bicycle, or an unusual slogan painted on the side of a house with a message about anything from opposing water fluoridation to the International Socialists.
These people raise awareness about their beliefs, they make their point and they do so in a usually winsome or at least whimsical way. And if you ever stop to talk, they are willing to have generally respectful - though certainly passionate dialogues - but they never harm people or property or in any way threaten the visitors that the Burlington economy relies on.
This week that has been progressively changing. The crowds have grown progressively larger, they are taking progressively more provocative actions, and over the past few days they have been causing progressively more disruption.
Luckily there have been no fires or explosions. At least not yet.
Protests around the country have taken a turn for the worse and have been progressively destabilizing. Once-safe neighborhoods in Kenosha, WI have been threatened with the kind of violence and destruction that we usually don't see outside of natural disasters. Even the ""too nice"" stereotype of Minnesotans have been challenged with riots and destruction in Minneapolis.
If this keeps progressing - unchecked - someone is eventually going to get hurt here too.
Earlier this week a large crowd of unsocially distanced protestors flooded Church St like Mardi Gras. But instead of hurling beads and trinkets, they were hurling insults at innocent diners. These are people who were out trying to support their local restaurants which have been hit hard by this pandemic. Also this week we saw local news anchors being halted by a self-made gestapo of protestors at night, in the dark, ironically ""policing"" the middle of the widest road downtown as they were stopping and re-directing vehicles at their will. Even now there have been reports of windows being smashed in parked cars along Pearl St. on thursday though few details are available.
Democrat pundits can't figure out why in ""Trump's America"" these protestors are hurting Democrats instead of hurting the President. But anyone outside of the Twitter echo chamber gets it. It comes down to the fact that regular people are asking themselves ""Which party ENcourages this and which party DIScourages this violence.""
Democrats are either joining the protestors (only to be shamed away) or they actively voice support for such expressions, or more recently - when the going gets the toughest they simply run away. If Democratic mayors are unwilling to stay and defend their OWN homes, and unwilling to make their neighborhoods SAFE for them and their own families - how can you possibly trust them with yours?
More and more Independent and even working class Democrat voters are realizing the frightening truth - they can't trust the Dems in power any more.
Things are progressively getting worse, and Democrats around the country seem either unwilling or unequipped to respond to changing times. Democratic leadership across the country has been, for many years now, largely giving protestors ""space to destroy"". And if Democrats have already signaled the green light, it's only a matter of time and opportunity before they go barrelling through that intersection.
Thankfully Gov. Scott has felt there is no need to act - yet. But when pressed, he has done the one thing that no Democrat has dared to even suggest - he has assured the hundreds of thousands law-abiding Vermonters that if things continue to get progressively worse, he is willing to step in to provide any help Burlington needs to keep the peace.
We all hope, as does Gov. Scott, that things will not progress to the level that they have in other states, where public safety is in peril. But thankfully we have a Republican Governor who is willing to draw a line and defend the people of VT if things get out of hand.
Sincerely,

A Message From The Chair
##  Condos’ Mail-in-Voting Scheme: A Recipe for Voter Fraud
Secretary of State, Jim Condos (Democrat) is proposing that Vermont allow so-called “mail-in-voting”. Ballots would be mailed to all registered voters in Vermont. Republican Governor Phil Scott has rightly pushed back with his concerns—and many other concerns have been shared in the numerous comments to this and other articles on the subject. And, yes, Voter Fraud is Real!
Governor Scott points out that the November election is nearly half a year away, and to decide now about the impact of the virus on the election is entirely premature. Businesses will adjust and be open to the public and voting at the polls can as well. How about considering staggering the election over several days to accomplish social distancing or providing special times for the elderly and immune compromised people to vote? If grocery stores can do it, so can our government. There are many other good ideas out there as well, I am sure. Share yours with the governor on his website comment line.
Vermont voters who cannot make it to or who feel uncomfortable in being at the polls, can request an absentee ballot. A request for a ballot can be made online, by mail, or at a Town Clerk’s Office. In this way voting can be done by mail or also can be in-person at the Town Clerk’s Office up to 45 days before an election.
Vermont, with its small state voting population is prime country for remarkably close elections, making it particularly sensitive to any improper voting. In 2016 in a Vermont state House seat race the outcome was determined by one vote out of 2,000 votes cast. In such a race there is no room for any fraud! These same contestants, in a previous 2010 race, had their outcome also decided by one vote , with the other candidate being the winner.
Secretary Condos has previously resisted any attempts at addressing or even examining the extent of voter fraud in Vermont. Being that there are adequate means available, we must not institute an unnecessary procedure that has great potential for voter fraud. The real concern should be why Condos, the person who is responsible for the integrity of our elections, is so dismissive of any voter fraud concerns and so eager to take on a procedure fraught with danger. Third-party organizations have found Vermont’s elections are at risk of integrity vulnerabilities. Serious hacking attempts have already been made against Vermont voting records. And despite the frequent talk of Condo’s “plan” to sure-up Vermont’s election system before the proposed mail-in voting, not much of a “plan” really exists at all.
It is also important to note that Secretary Condos is moving ahead with in-person voting for the August primaries and only wants the change for the general election. He would be calling for an immediate switch to mail-in voting for the primaries too if it were safety for the voters he was seeking. It is obvious the reason why the Democrats want mail-in voting and there is recent evidence of that. After California Governor Gavin Newsom (D) tweeted that California would be switching to mail-in ballots, Sam Donnelly, a Burlington Democratic Party delegate and former Burlington Democratic Party chair, bragged in reply, tweeting that “Biden’s margins are about to go [up].” This is clearly a power-play by the Vermont Democratic Party to boost their vote counts and they have admitted it as such. It is because Republicans want and are willing to take their chances in a fair, fraud free election, that they are in opposition.
The individuals and groups pushing the Governor to adopt mail-in voting are Democrat/Progressives and include Democrat candidates for Governor, Rebecca Holcombe and David Zuckerman, currently Vermont Lieutenant Governor, in addition to organizations such as VPIRG, Rights & Democracy, and many more.
If the Democrats/Progressives have their way with mail-in voting, Republicans will have to turn out voters to not only win the majority but to overcome the fraud % that for certain will occur. Please support the Governor in his opposition to the Condos mail in voting scheme.
Sincerely,
Deb Billado

The Vermont Republican Party,info@vtgop.org,Green New Deal,"URGENT UPDATE:
Last week, we sent you the below email outlining a disasterous Green New Deal proposal propelled by the socialists who run our State House & State Senate.
Governor Scott boldly veto'd this job killing, unsustainable, and unresponsive legislation. But the SUPER MAJORITY Democrats overrode the Governor's veto this morning!
That's correct - on a party line vote, Democrats have removed oversight into this bureaocratic monster.
WITH YOUR HELP - last week, we raised enough to identify half of the voters we need to remove the socialist's super majority -- but we still have more to go.
Let's finish the job!
We need to raise $500 by the end of tonight to start our identification first thing tomorrow morning! Time is of the essence.
Extreme democrats have played their hand and need to pay at the polls.
This is so important, I made the first contribution. Join me in making your own donation so we can chip away at this horrible super majority.
Sincerely,
Paul

Alex,
Last month, Joe Biden and his leftist allies gathered across the country to talk about their policies of an extremist socialist country.
We heard from countless national Democrats who exposed the Democrat Platform including AOC talking about how the country has not gone far left enough.
This week, in our State Capitol, the liberals put another feather in their cap as they passed a bill that will create an unachievable Green New Deal that bypasses the Governor, the legislature, and you!
The only way we can defeat these policies is by winning at the polls in November! We need to identify voters in SWING DISTRICTS on this issue.
Help us get the word out that Governor Scott and our Republican team want a clean environment - but not more lawsuits that will lead to Vermont's own job-killing ""Green New Deal""!
Stop Extremists
Sincerely,
Deb

"Deb Billado, Republican State Party Chair",info@vtgop.org,Morality and  Faith are Keys to a Limited Government,"View this email in your browser
Morality and Faith are Keys to a Limited Government
In my message two weeks ago, I spoke of the assault being made on religious liberty. Sadly, many as well have fallen away from their religious beliefs and upbringing while at the same time the nation is in a moral free fall. This was not anticipated by the framers when they constructed the plan and created the founding documents that put into motion a new nation founded on basic God-given freedoms and rights. No one could have imagined at that time the greatness that America would rise to where every citizen would have the opportunity to build their lives, communities, raise a family, accumulate wealth, own their own home and do that under the umbrella of a limited government that would provide them safety and security. The founders believed that people would remain as they were then, faithful, moral and able to properly conduct their own affairs in a way that was harmonious with their neighbors, so a limited government was all that was necessary to do the basics to keep people safe and the nation secure.
As it turned out, morality and religion were the key elements in the equation of American greatness. The Attorney General of the United States, Bill Barr, an expert on this history observed that; “The reason they felt they could grant so much freedom in the Constitution and only provide for limited government was because they felt that religion was there and the people were religious people who could largely govern themselves.” He echoed what our second President, John Adams reasoned when he said; “Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.” It worked because the people were suited for it.
Fast forward to today with a nation, once proudly claiming to be a Christian one, experiencing a moral freefall as many have fallen away from the faith they once held so dear. While there are still faithful and moral people, America is rapidly developing into a Godless nation and as one would expect, our Constitution is not working well as a result. Democrat/Progressives have manipulated our government in a socialistic direction free of the values and religious ideology that once were her strength and instead of following the Constitution, they are manipulating it to fulfill their selfish goals of power and control.
This dynamic is true in Vermont. The Vermont Democrat platform reflects the decline in the moral climate of Vermont by advocating for unrestricted abortions that would permit the killing of a full-term baby seconds before delivery. Their platform also urges the passage of a retail sale of marijuana bill in spite of the vociferous opposition of law enforcement, medical and education organizations as well as the scientific medical facts that document the many dangers of cannabis, especially high-potency THC products that can cause psychosis, hyperemesis, brain damage to children, youth and young adults as well as the increased deaths and maiming of people caused by impaired drivers. These big-spending liberals have moved Vermont government so far from the limited model the framers created that it is unrecognizable. Conservative Vermont Republicans can start the process of bringing us back to what their intentions were for us but we must get the basics right.
While there are still faithful and moral people, America is rapidly developing into a Godless nation. Even in Vermont, where most of our picturesque towns and villages have beautiful church buildings with spires bearing the cross that identifies them as Christian, few have healthy attendance and it has been said that Vermont is the least churched state in the nation.
President Adams was prophetic when he opined that the Constitution was inadequate for people other than those that were moral and religious. The most current example of that is the purely political impeachment of the president of the United States. I don’t need to tell you that our president committed no crime, was wrongfully and unconstitutionally impeached by a Democrat controlled House of Representatives who had the power to do what they did, just because they could and would not accept the will of the people in the election.
Then Tuesday night, the president stood before those who impeached and tried him and delivered his State-of-the Union message in which he declared; “The state of our union is stronger than ever before.” I listened for ninety minutes as he impressively laid out the successes he has brought to us all over the last three years and his plans to continue them into the future. I could not help but think that while our economy may be strong the same cannot be said for the moral and religious health of our people.
Until our people regain the spirit that made this country great and until the pendulum swings back, if it ever will, to a time when people were moral and religious, it will be just a matter of time before America, this nation that for over two centuries has served as a light of hope, will cease to exist as we know it and want it to be.
Government cannot make people religious. The framers did not establish a religion and prohibited the government from doing that but at the same time they made it clear in the First Amendment, that the limited government they created should not get in the way of people exercising their chosen religion. While there is still some life in that right, it is up to us all to exercise it. We need to regain what gave our nation strength and vitality. We must rededicate ourselves to moral and religious living and teach that to our children.
Sincerely,
Deb Billado

Christopher (VDP),info@vtdemocrats.org,a coward,"NYT: Representative Jeff Van Drew, Anti-Impeachment Democrat, Plans to Switch Parties
* * *
You may have heard the news that the leading Democrat opposed to Donald Trump's impeachment has decided to switch parties, to become a Republican.
Van Drew comes from a district that voted for Trump and he thinks voting for impeachment will hurt his chances for reelection. Instead of standing up for our Democratic principles and courageously voting for impeachment, he has decided to take the easy way out — becoming a Trump Republican.
This move from Rep. Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey’s 2nd district comes as Democrats across the country are taking a bold, and in some cases, politically damaging stand to defend our Constitution and hold Trump accountable.
Let me put it plainly, Jeff Van Drew is a coward.
Van Drew is more interested in preserving his own political future than ensuring the future of our very democracy. He should be ashamed of himself.
But, there is hope still. You can help us throw him out of office by making a contribution to his eventual Democratic opponent. Will you rush a split contribution to NJ-02’s eventual Democratic nominee and the Vermont Democratic Party?
The Democrat who will face Van Drew is going to need all the help they can get — they will be up against a “Republican” incumbent with the backing of the President of the United States. A rushed contribution today will make sure that Democrat will have a fair shot at taking back the seat to represent the people of NY-02 with courage and dignity.
Thanks for being in this fight,

This includes fundraising events including the VDP’s St. Patrick’s Day fundraiser and the Curtis-Hoff Awards Dinner, trainings, the March 21 State Committee meeting, and similar activities.
We are strongly encouraging our county and town committees, candidates, and others affiliated with the party to take similar steps.
During this period, we will not be closing up shop and going dark, but instead will be developing a variety of activities that use technology to allow communication and participation for a full range of party activities.
We are busy developing back-up plans for things like the process of electing our national convention delegates and other business. Town caucuses to elect delegates to the state convention which had a targeted schedule of April 21st at 7:00 PM will not happen in person. The state party is working with the DNC to develop alternative methods to conduct town caucuses while remaining compliant with the party’s delegate selection plan. The state party is reevaluating how to conduct the business of the state convention, scheduled for Saturday, May 30th in Barre, if delegates are not able to attend.
It is not a decision we make lightly, but it is the responsible course of action in the face of an unprecedented emerging public health threat. We are determined to do our part to mitigate the spread of this new Coronavirus, and to protect our staff, volunteers, candidates, activists, donors, voters, and all Vermonters.
I spent most of my professional life working in the infectious disease side of public health. Based on discussions over the past few days with colleagues in the field – state, national, and international experts – the threat of COVID-19 is very real, and steps like these are absolutely essential.
We urge everyone to take it seriously, to listen to public health experts, and to do everything you can to protect yourself, your family, your friends, and your community. Rely on accurate scientific information from trusted sources like the Vermont Department of Health or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
We will continue to assess the situation, to adjust our plans accordingly, and to keep you up to date.
In solidarity,

Hi Friend,
Another week, another VDP Community Call! This week, as part of our ongoing ""Meet the Candidates"" series, we'll be welcoming Representative Peter Welch to the call. He will be talking about his experiences representing Vermont as our at-large Congressperson, sharing his vision for the future of our state and our country, and answering any questions you may have.
Sign up here to join the conversation!
Peter Welch has been a champion for working Vermonters throughout his career. He was first elected to represent Windsor County in the Vermont Senate in 1980. In 1985, he was unanimously elected by his colleagues to lead the chamber, becoming the first Democrat in Vermont history to hold the position of President Pro Tempore. Since his election to Congress in 2006, he has been widely recognized as a thoughtful and effective legislator who chooses governing over gridlock.
Peter's record reflects his strong commitment to bringing people together to find common sense solutions to the difficult challenges facing our state and nation. In an era of partisanship, he has worked across the aisle to create jobs, increase access to affordable education and health care, invest in energy efficiency, protect our environment, and care for our veterans.
Come meet Rep. Peter Welch this Friday 9/11 from 7-8pm!
VDP Community Calls happen every Friday from 7-8pm and offer a space for us to come together and share with our Democratic community here in Vermont. As we continue to navigate through both a worldwide pandemic and a worldwide demand for systemic change, we're finding new ways to keep our communities connected. Whether it's joining a virtual town hall, calling voters from the safety of your own home, or reaching out to friends and neighbors online, our goal is to maintain these communities and build lasting connections.
Hope to see you there!

Over the last two weeks, we have been heartened and humbled by the stories we’ve heard from our nearly 60 volunteers who have made over 2000 wellness calls statewide with a goal of connecting Vermonters in the era of COVID-19.
Our volunteers have been checking in with their neighbors from county to county and learning firsthand about the unique struggles affecting each of us during this difficult time. Volunteers, whether you’ve been answering questions about unemployment, spreading the word about a new farm stand in town, or just lending an ear to a concerned citizen, one thing is clear: your hard work is making a difference.
As these circumstances continue to challenge us, we are taking action to grow our volunteer-driven efforts to reach folks in every town in Vermont. Please join us this Saturday and connect with fellow volunteers, make a few calls, and share your Connecting Vermont story.
We’ll be kicking things off with a Connecting Vermont Volunteer Meetup via Zoom this Saturday at 11:00am and will continue (virtually) connecting with our neighbors all day long.
Some ways to take action from the comfort of your home:
* Make calls with us this Saturday between 10:30am-7:30pm
* Snap a photo of yourself making #ConnectingVT calls and share it on Facebook/Twitter
* Record an Instagram Story telling us how you’re Connecting Vermont
* Host your own virtual call party with friends
* Submit a post to your local Front Porch Forum
* Write a Letter to the Editor about your experience
* Share Your Volunteer Story to be featured on our social media channels

Hi Friend,
In this time of social distancing, please join the Vermont Democratic Party and special guest, Congressman Ro Khanna, following the State Convention on Saturday, May 30 at 6:30PM for an intimate and informative virtual get together!
Congressman Khanna is proud to serve as the representative for California’s 17th District. As First Vice Chair of the House Progressive Caucus, Ro has stood at the vanguard of national progressive politics, serving as co-chair of the Sanders presidential campaign, while remaining committed to bipartisan problem-solving in Washington, passing two bills into law during his first term.
During his time in Congress, Ro passed the historic War Powers Act to end U.S. involvement in Yemen, has founded the NO PAC Caucus, advocated for greater college affordability, and has acted as one of the most vocal champions for “Medicare for All” in the House.
As a member of the House Oversight Committee, Ro has worked for greater government transparency. As a part of the House Armed Services Committee, Ro has fought back against special interests and their monopolistic behavior, tackling private companies that gauge from our defense budget and jack up the cost of our national security, and has championed greater government investment in technology and R&D on the House Budget Committee. Ro has worked to spread Silicon Valley jobs nationally to areas of the country left behind during the digital revolution, and has introduced multiple articles of legislation to bring jobs to economically disadvantaged communities across the country.
During this special event, Congressman Khanna will share his experience legislating in Washington DC during this pandemic and identify areas where Democrats can lead in the recovery of our economy and democracy. The event will be moderated by Terje Anderson, VDP Chair as guests will have the opportunity to connect with Congressman Khanna during the 30-minute Q & A following his presentation.

Subject: Re: A long, but thorough, update
Friend —
I hope this email finds you well during these unprecedented times. Across Vermont, the country, and the world, our lives and communities are facing profound changes needed to address the very real crisis of COVID-19. Never before have each of our individual actions been so essential to our collective well-being, to protecting everyone.
While it may be hard to imagine right now, there will be an election later this year. There is tremendous uncertainty about what the campaign and election will look like, and the kinds of limitations public health may place on it. At the Vermont Democratic Party, we are working hard to adapt to the challenges and plan for the unknowable.
So much has changed. Originally we had planned that last night, April 21st, Democrats from across the state would gather at town caucuses to elect delegates to our State Convention (which would, in turn, elect our National Convention delegates).
Obviously, we’ve had to adjust our plans – instead of holding town caucuses yesterday, we’ve adapted by creating an on-line sign-up system to select State Convention delegates, and we’ve extended the deadline to sign-up until 5 pm this Saturday, April 25th.
We don’t yet know exactly what the Democratic National Convention, scheduled for Milwaukee the week of the August 17th, will look like – in-person, virtual, hybrid – but we do know that it will go forward in some form with the essential task of preparing to defeat Donald Trump by nominating Presidential and Vice-Presidential candidates, adopting a party platform and doing other pressing party business. If you want to have a say in who will represent Vermont at this convention, you need to sign-up by Saturday to be able to vote for delegates.
Information about running for National Convention delegate and other details are available on the Party’s website.
Our State Convention, previously scheduled for Saturday, May 30th, is being replaced by a system of email voting. But we will be hosting a number of exciting virtual activities on May 30th – stay tuned for the details.
* * *
With a growing chance that this year’s elections will be conducted largely by mail, one thing you should do right now is check to make sure all of your voter registration information is up to date and accurate (including your mailing address). You can do that by going to the My Voter Page to update anything that needs to be changed. While you’re there, you can also go ahead and request mail-in absentee ballots to be sent to you for both the August primary and November general elections. (And if you aren’t yet registered, you can do that on-line as well!)
* * *
Recent reports show that Vermont has one of the lowest US Census responses rates in the country. You can go on-line and fill out your Census form in a matter of minutes. An accurate count is essential for allocating government resources, making good decisions about state and local projects, and allocating legislative seats. If you haven’t already, fill out your form now!
* * *
While the Vermont Democratic Party’s physical offices have been closed for over a month, our hardworking staff are all still busy doing the behind the scenes work needed to get ready for the hugely important election year ahead: updating our lists, learning new digital technologies, supporting town and county committees, working with candidates, preparing for vote by mail, and strategizing how to campaign during this extraordinary time. I’m incredibly proud of the work they are doing - and look forward to introducing you to them in the coming weeks so you can learn more about what goes on behind the scenes.
* * *
At the Vermont Democratic Party, we are also very proud of the leadership of our federal and state elected officials during this challenging time. They’ve been working to protect the health and economic security of everyone, with impressive results in Washington and Montpelier.
* * *
We thank them all for their extraordinary efforts – whether that is State Treasurer Beth Pearce spending her weekend making sure that emergency checks were sent out to Vermonters desperately waiting payments lost in the snafus of the Department of Labor, Secretary of State Jim Condos and his staff preparing to conduct an election that is safe and ensures everyone has the right to vote, Lieutenant Governor David Zuckerman using his office to share essential resources and information around the state, Attorney General T.J Donovan protecting Vermonters against price gouging and scams, or Auditor Doug Hoffer making staff available to assist in dealing with the unemployment backlog. Our state legislators have moved quickly to adopt vital legislation responding to COVID-19, and will likely continue to work (often virtually) throughout the summer to face the important policy choices ahead. And, of course, we can’t say enough about the exceptional work in Washington of Senator Patrick Leahy, Senator Bernie Sanders and Representative Peter Welch in fighting to protect Vermonters in the important legislation being passed in response to COVID-19.
* * *
This Saturday, April 25th, was originally scheduled to be the Vermont Democratic Party’s annual Curtis-Hoff Leadership Awards and Unity Dinner – a gathering where we celebrate and honor outstanding Vermont Democratic grassroots activists and leaders, and the most important fundraising event on our calendar. While the public health crisis means we can’t gather on April 25th, we have rescheduled for October 3rd and hope that circumstances will allow us to go forward on that date. We’re happy to offer discounted tickets for sale throughout the entire month of April – your purchase now helps provide upfront funding for the essential campaign work that lies ahead.

You may have gotten a call from a Vermont Democratic Party volunteer in recent weeks as part of our new “Connecting Vermont” effort. These aren’t the usual calls we make asking for volunteers, finding out who you are going to vote for, or encouraging you to donate to the party. Instead we’ve been calling many of our supporters across the state to check in during the crisis, find out what is on your mind, and to simply connect with one another at a difficult time. Thank you to all the volunteers who are making calls and to everyone who has picked up the phone to share your thoughts, ideas and perspectives with us. If you would like to volunteer, you can click here to sign up for a volunteer shift.
Please take good care of yourself, your family and friends, and your community during this unprecedented time. Together, we will get through this.

Starting this weekend, the VDP will be hosting a Voter Registration Drive from Saturday, September 26th until Saturday, October 3rd -- and we need your help! We will be assisting Vermonters to register both in-person (at local places that people frequently visit, strictly following COVID-19-related safety precautions) and virtually (assisting online registration or providing guidance over a call).
Want to get involved? Join us Friday (tomorrow!) evening from 7-8pm to talk about how you can help this coming week with the Voter Registration Drive. We’re looking to have as many volunteers as possible from across the state join us in this important work.
Sign up here for this week’s VDP Community Call about voter registration best practices and learn how you can help more Democrats vote in the 2020 election!

Grace (VDP),info@vtdemocrats.org,Action Alert: Minimum Wage,"Friend —
Last week, Democrats in the House and Senate took a big step toward giving Vermonters a well deserved raise by sending S.23, a bill that would raise the minimum wage, to Governor Scott’s desk. Unfortunately, the Governor continues to indicate that he will veto any increase to the minimum wage.
We need all hands on deck in order to give Vermonter across the state the raise they deserve.
Can you add your name now and tell Phil Scott that Vermonters support a fair minimum wage?
Working people across the state deserve better. Let’s make sure the Governor knows where Vermonters stand. Sign here today!

So today I’m asking if you can rush a contribution of $3, $5, $15, or $25 to help keep our digital ads runnings?
Friend —
We need your help. Right before the legislature took summer recess, they passed a crucial piece of legislation — they authorized the Secretary of State to send every Vermonter a mail-in ballot for the 2020 election. Because of this bill, Vermonters will be able to easily vote safely by mail this November.
You’d think legislation like that would draw overwhelming bipartisan support, but it didn’t. Far too many Republicans voted against the measure — seeking to make it more difficult to vote safely this fall.
Unfortunately, far right national Republican talking points are being echoed by Republicans right here in Vermont – where party leaders and Republican legislators loyally repeat Trump’s discredited and patently false claims of “voter fraud.”
So we’ve launched a series of digital ads targeting VTGOP legislative incumbents who voted against sending Vermonters a ballot. We want to make sure their constituents know that their representative in Montpelier voted against their safety.
This is where we need your help. In order to keep running these ads — and others like them — we need the funds to back them up. That’s why I’m asking today if you can chip in a few bucks to help keep these ads up and running. Your support will help our Party keep the pressure on Republicans while also support our campaign’s outreach efforts.
With the coronavirus pandemic still among us, now more than ever we are turning our attention to organizing and persuading voters in digital spaces and one of our best tools is digital advertising. So today I’m asking if you can rush a contribution of $3, $5, $15, or $25 to help keep our digital ads runnings?

"DEM Club Member & Franklin County Democrat, Euan Bear",info@vtdemocrats.org,I stayed out of politics for a long time...,"But now, there’s a place for us small-dollar donors, and I’m using part of my Social Security checks to chip in. We’re the ones who keep the lights on, pay phone bills and travel expenses, contribute toward staff salaries and healthcare. We do it with every $10 or $25 or $50 that we put in steadily, money the VDP can count on Every. Single. Month.
I’ve voted Democratic in every election since I was old enough to vote. Sometimes I had to hold my nose, knowing that the alternative would be way worse. Other than voting, I stayed out of politics for a long time — too dirty, too corporate, too male-dominated.
And then came the stolen election of 2000, Bush v. Gore. I knew that I had to stand up with energy, skill, and, yes, money. I organized my town, became chair, was elected to the County Committee, was elected to the State Committee and became County Chair. That was the energy part. The money part didn’t come until later. I was making less than $20k per year, not much to spare, and didn’t feel welcome to chip in, since fundraising was all about the “big-dollar donors.”
But now, there’s a place for us small-dollar donors through the VDP's DEM (Donate Every Month) Club, and I’m using part of my Social Security checks to chip in. We’re the ones who keep the lights on, pay phone bills and travel expenses, contribute toward staff salaries and healthcare. We do it with every $10 or $25 or $50 that we put in steadily, money the VDP can count on Every. Single. Month.
I hope other Democrats join me in throwing some steady money into the pot. It doesn’t have to be a lot — it still counts. And it’s for the party that’s working for a more humane, more equal, and more just society in this corner of the world and in the bigger world beyond.
Warmest Regards,
Euan Bear

Hi there!
In past election cycles, GOTV (""Get Out the Vote"") was an exciting final week of any campaign where we'd remind all of our supporters when and where to vote. This year, things will be a little different: in late September, every Vermont voter will receive their ballot in the mail.
So, how do we make sure that folks not only return their ballots but also make sure they're voting for our candidates? Let’s brainstorm some best practices, share what different counties are thinking, and make sure that this year’s Get Out the Vote (Get Out the Ballot, anyone?) is as robust as possible!
Have an idea to share? Hop on the call Friday and let us know!
Join fellow Vermont Democrats from across the state this Friday, August 28th from 7:00-8:00pm, as we share ideas and brainstorm ideas for ways to get as many votes as possible for our candidates up and down the ticket!
Sign up here to join the conversation!
VDP Community calls happen every Friday from 7:00-8:00pm and offer a space for us to come together and share with our Democratic community here in Vermont. As we continue to navigate through both a worldwide pandemic and a worldwide demand for systemic change, we're finding new ways to keep our communities connected. Whether it's joining a virtual town hall, calling voters from the safety of your own home, or reaching out to friends and neighbors online, our goal is to maintain these communities and build lasting connections.
Hope to see you there—
Looking forward to working with you,

Scott McNeil (VTdems),info@vtdemocrats.org,our 2020 field program,"Vermont Dems to Hire Staffer for Burlington City Council Races
— SEVEN DAYS
* * *
Our key to victory in 2020 is building a strong ground game — hiring organizers, recruiting volunteers, knocking on doors, calling and texting voters, and so much more.
You might have seen recently in Seven Days that we have begun implementing our ground game by advertising for a full-time field staffer to work in Burlington. This position is just the first of many organizers we need to hire throughout Vermont during the 2020 general election campaign.
As 2019 comes to a close, we are putting together a staffing plan for 2020, which includes a bunch of field organizers stationed from Burlington to Brattleboro and everywhere in between. These folks will be responsible for recruiting volunteers, knocking on doors, making phone calls, staffing field offices, and supporting local candidates.
Field organizers are absolutely crucial to win in 2020 and the only way we can hire more of them is with contributions from people like you — $5 here, $20 there.
Every little bit helps.
Would you consider making an early investment in the Vermont Democratic Party’s 2020 field program?
Best,
Scott

Dear Friend,
2020 has been an election year unlike any other.
This year will be the first time that many voters will vote by mail. The Trump campaign, along with the Republican Party, have spent millions of dollars fighting against vote by mail efforts across the nation. As Vermonters, we have shown the country that voting can be done safely and effectively during a global pandemic. We have demonstrated that unity and decency can exist during a very divisive time in politics.
Throughout this election cycle, the Vermont Democratic Party, local and statewide candidates, and hundreds of dedicated volunteers have taken the lead and are fighting back against Republican policies that are detrimental to our environment, healthcare, economy, and basic human rights and dignity. We have been reaching voters through phone calls, text messaging, mailers, and digital organizing in order to educate voters how to vote by mail, as well as explaining why it is important for Vermonters to elect Democrats up and down the ticket in 2020.
However, we still need your help in order to make this vision a reality. Will you help get our local and statewide candidates across the finish line by making a $25, $10, or $5 contribution to the VDP Unity Ticket TODAY?
“We need to bring decency back to democracy. We have to make sure we elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to the White House. And here in Vermont, we need to take back the Governor’s office, elect Molly Gray as our Lt. Governor, and vote for our great statewide leaders and Democrats in the House and Senate so we can move Vermont in a forward direction. None of this is possible without the support of the Vermont Democratic Party and the field team working on our behalf."" -David Zuckerman, Lt. Governor
Vermont Democrats should stand proud knowing that our elected officials, both in Washington and Montpelier, are quick to take decisive action to protect our elections and the livelihoods of all Vermonters. By supporting the VDP’s Unity Ticket, you are not only helping the VDP educate voters on how to vote by mail, you are also helping the Party elect Democrats up and down the ballot.
""This is the most important election of our lifetime and now, more than ever, we need to support the Vermont Democratic Party and our fellow Democratic Candidates. VDP Staff and volunteers are making calls, texting, assisting Vermonters in making a plan to vote, holding community meetings, dropping literature, and much more. Our Democratic Party supports and amplifies the work of all our great candidates and it is an honor to work with this party and our Democratic candidates in our shared mission to better the lives of ALL people living in Vermont!” -Beth Pearce, State Treasurer
As Vermont and the country face economic disaster on a scale akin to the Great Depression, Republicans will use the crisis to try to slash essential programs and roll back hard-won economic, environmental, and social protections. As the process of rebuilding begins, only by electing Democrats at every level can we make sure Vermont prioritizes the needs of working people, small businesses, students, farmers, seniors, the middle class, diverse communities, and others across our state who are counting on us to fight for them.
Will you help us get Vermont Democrats through the final stretch with one last donation of $25, $10, $5?
""This is an historic election for our country and here at home in Vermont. Together, we must work to elect Democrats up and down the ballot and across Vermont, and continue to work together to recover stronger from this pandemic and build a brighter future for our state. To quote Justice Ginsburg: it's time ‘to fight for the things that you care about, but do it in a way that will lead others to join you.’” -Molly Gray, Democratic Candidate for Lt. Governor
Please join us in the work of making Vermont a more equitable and thriving community for all with a donation today to the VDP Unity Ticket. Your support is greatly appreciated and makes a tangible difference in the lives of all Vermonters.
Sincerely,
Vermont Democratic Party

Yesterday, January 15, 2020, a key committee advanced the Paid Family and Medical Leave Bill Vermonters want and need. The bill (H.107) will provide an essential benefit for working families, providing them time away to take care of themselves, a loved one, or family member.
These are life and death situations. Democratic leaders understand that we need to take action to create a Vermont that works for all of us, not just the select few. We need to pick up the phone and ask lawmakers to pass H.107.
This is our chance to ensure Paid Family Leave is extended to every Vermonter. Call (802) 828-2228 and tell your Representative and Senator to pass H.107.
Thanks for being in this fight,

Vermont Democrats,info@vtdemocrats.org,Rep. Ro Khanna is coming (virtually) to VT!,"During this special event, Congressman Khanna will share his experience legislating in Washington DC during this pandemic and identify areas where Democrats can lead in the recovery of our economy and democracy.
Hi Friend,
In this time of social distancing, please join the Vermont Democratic Party and special guest, Congressman Ro Khanna, following the State Convention on Saturday, May 30 at 6:30PM for an intimate and informative virtual get together!
Congressman Khanna is proud to serve as the representative for California’s 17th District. As First Vice Chair of the House Progressive Caucus, Ro has stood at the vanguard of national progressive politics, serving as co-chair of the Sanders presidential campaign, while remaining committed to bipartisan problem-solving in Washington, passing two bills into law during his first term.
During his time in Congress, Ro passed the historic War Powers Act to end U.S. involvement in Yemen, has founded the NO PAC Caucus, advocated for greater college affordability, and has acted as one of the most vocal champions for “Medicare for All” in the House.
As a member of the House Oversight Committee, Ro has worked for greater government transparency. As a part of the House Armed Services Committee, Ro has fought back against special interests and their monopolistic behavior, tackling private companies that gauge from our defense budget and jack up the cost of our national security, and has championed greater government investment in technology and R&D on the House Budget Committee. Ro has worked to spread Silicon Valley jobs nationally to areas of the country left behind during the digital revolution, and has introduced multiple articles of legislation to bring jobs to economically disadvantaged communities across the country.
During this special event, Congressman Khanna will share his experience legislating in Washington DC during this pandemic and identify areas where Democrats can lead in the recovery of our economy and democracy. The event will be moderated by Terje Anderson, VDP Chair as guests will have the opportunity to connect with Congressman Khanna during the 30-minute Q & A following his presentation.

"Terje Anderson, Party Chair",info@vtdemocrats.org,"A long, but thorough, update","Friend —
I hope this email finds you well during these unprecedented times. Across Vermont, the country, and the world, our lives and communities are facing profound changes needed to address the very real crisis of COVID-19. Never before have each of our individual actions been so essential to our collective well-being, to protecting everyone.
While it may be hard to imagine right now, there will be an election later this year. There is tremendous uncertainty about what the campaign and election will look like, and the kinds of limitations public health may place on it. At the Vermont Democratic Party, we are working hard to adapt to the challenges and plan for the unknowable.
So much has changed. Originally we had planned that last night, April 21st, Democrats from across the state would gather at town caucuses to elect delegates to our State Convention (which would, in turn, elect our National Convention delegates).
Obviously, we’ve had to adjust our plans – instead of holding town caucuses yesterday, we’ve adapted by creating an on-line sign-up system to select State Convention delegates, and we’ve extended the deadline to sign-up until 5 pm this Saturday, April 25th.
We don’t yet know exactly what the Democratic National Convention, scheduled for Milwaukee the week of the August 17th, will look like – in-person, virtual, hybrid – but we do know that it will go forward in some form with the essential task of preparing to defeat Donald Trump by nominating Presidential and Vice-Presidential candidates, adopting a party platform and doing other pressing party business. If you want to have a say in who will represent Vermont at this convention, you need to sign-up by Saturday to be able to vote for delegates.
Information about running for National Convention delegate and other details are available on the Party’s website.
Our State Convention, previously scheduled for Saturday, May 30th, is being replaced by a system of email voting. But we will be hosting a number of exciting virtual activities on May 30th – stay tuned for the details.
* * *
With a growing chance that this year’s elections will be conducted largely by mail, one thing you should do right now is check to make sure all of your voter registration information is up to date and accurate (including your mailing address). You can do that by going to the My Voter Page to update anything that needs to be changed. While you’re there, you can also go ahead and request mail-in absentee ballots to be sent to you for both the August primary and November general elections. (And if you aren’t yet registered, you can do that on-line as well!)
* * *
Recent reports show that Vermont has one of the lowest US Census responses rates in the country. You can go on-line and fill out your Census form in a matter of minutes. An accurate count is essential for allocating government resources, making good decisions about state and local projects, and allocating legislative seats. If you haven’t already, fill out your form now!
* * *
While the Vermont Democratic Party’s physical offices have been closed for over a month, our hardworking staff are all still busy doing the behind the scenes work needed to get ready for the hugely important election year ahead: updating our lists, learning new digital technologies, supporting town and county committees, working with candidates, preparing for vote by mail, and strategizing how to campaign during this extraordinary time. I’m incredibly proud of the work they are doing - and look forward to introducing you to them in the coming weeks so you can learn more about what goes on behind the scenes.
* * *
At the Vermont Democratic Party, we are also very proud of the leadership of our federal and state elected officials during this challenging time. They’ve been working to protect the health and economic security of everyone, with impressive results in Washington and Montpelier.
* * *
We thank them all for their extraordinary efforts – whether that is State Treasurer Beth Pearce spending her weekend making sure that emergency checks were sent out to Vermonters desperately waiting payments lost in the snafus of the Department of Labor, Secretary of State Jim Condos and his staff preparing to conduct an election that is safe and ensures everyone has the right to vote, Lieutenant Governor David Zuckerman using his office to share essential resources and information around the state, Attorney General T.J Donovan protecting Vermonters against price gouging and scams, or Auditor Doug Hoffer making staff available to assist in dealing with the unemployment backlog. Our state legislators have moved quickly to adopt vital legislation responding to COVID-19, and will likely continue to work (often virtually) throughout the summer to face the important policy choices ahead. And, of course, we can’t say enough about the exceptional work in Washington of Senator Patrick Leahy, Senator Bernie Sanders and Representative Peter Welch in fighting to protect Vermonters in the important legislation being passed in response to COVID-19.
* * *
This Saturday, April 25th, was originally scheduled to be the Vermont Democratic Party’s annual Curtis-Hoff Leadership Awards and Unity Dinner – a gathering where we celebrate and honor outstanding Vermont Democratic grassroots activists and leaders, and the most important fundraising event on our calendar. While the public health crisis means we can’t gather on April 25th, we have rescheduled for October 3rd and hope that circumstances will allow us to go forward on that date. We’re happy to offer discounted tickets for sale throughout the entire month of April – your purchase now helps provide upfront funding for the essential campaign work that lies ahead.
* * *
You may have gotten a call from a Vermont Democratic Party volunteer in recent weeks as part of our new “Connecting Vermont” effort. These aren’t the usual calls we make asking for volunteers, finding out who you are going to vote for, or encouraging you to donate to the party. Instead we’ve been calling many of our supporters across the state to check in during the crisis, find out what is on your mind, and to simply connect with one another at a difficult time. Thank you to all the volunteers who are making calls and to everyone who has picked up the phone to share your thoughts, ideas and perspectives with us. If you would like to volunteer, you can click here to sign up for a volunteer shift.
Please take good care of yourself, your family and friends, and your community during this unprecedented time. Together, we will get through this.
In solidarity,

Town Meeting Day is less than a week away! Here in Burlington we’re in the last days of some critical local races. Our City Council candidates are fighting for strong climate policy, affordable housing and robust public infrastructure—they represent voices that are sorely needed on the Council and we need your help if we’re going to be successful on Tuesday night.
First, we have a lot of voters to talk to between today and Tuesday. If you’re interested in talking to your neighbors about the issues that matter to you and turning them out to vote, you can sign up to canvass or make phone calls. We’re also looking for folks to stand outside the polls on Election Day. Finally, we are holding a Get Out the Vote Party at Nectar’s this Friday—we would love to see you there.
These are close races and we won’t win without your help. You can sign up to help out below:

Democrats up and down the ballot in our state are relying on YOUR grassroots support over the next 5 months.
Dear Democrat,
It’s never been clearer that we cannot afford another 4 years with Trump in office.
We’re now facing the final stretch of 2020 – we have just 5 months to out-work, out-organize, and out-mobilize the GOP before November 3, 2020.
You already know, Trump and his allies are dropping millions in states like ours. The only way we can counter their spending is with a committed group of grassroots supporters who will sustain the Vermont Dems team over the next 5 months.
Will you commit to becoming one of the 400 DEM Club members we need to Power Vermont Blue and make a monthly contribution of $5, $10, $20 or any amount?
The Power Vermont Blue campaign is a grassroots movement designed to increase voter, donor, and volunteer engagement throughout the State. We cannot elect Democratic candidates without people and resource power. Our budget has been hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic and will impact our ability to elect Democrats up and down the ballot. And now, Phil Scott has announced that he will be solely funded by out-of-state PACs, corporations, and the Koch Brothers.
If we are to have a fighting chance this election, we will need to have every Vermont Democrat join our movement! Democrats up and down the ballot in our state are relying on YOUR grassroots support over the next 5 months.
Click here to commit to a monthly contribution of $5, $10, $25 or another amount to help us keep up the fight!
If you can’t commit to a monthly gift but can give a one-time contribution of $10, that’s okay! Click here to make a one-time donation.
We appreciate your ongoing support,

Hi Friend!
Election Day is right around the corner, and we need your help! With only 10 days left we need all hands on deck to make sure we turn out every single Democratic voter by the close of polls on November 3rd.
Can we count on you to help us make 10,000 phone calls in the final 10 days?
Never phone banked before? No problem! Training is provided before each shift. Once you sign up, we’ll send you the Zoom meeting information to join other volunteers and learn about how we’re going to Get Out The Vote before Election Day.
Nervous about phone banking? That’s okay! Here’s the best part: we’re only calling supporters. All you need to do is make a plan to vote with them (Are they voting by mail? Will they be voting on Election Day?) Do they have questions about voting this year?) and you’re done! Easy as pie.
Join us, and together we’ll make sure the Blue Wave crashes over Vermont -- and the rest of the country!
We’ve got 10 days to make sure we elect a Democratic Governor and Lieutenant Governor, send back our Democratic statewide officials, increase our majorities in the State House and State Senate, and end the era of the Trump administration -- can we count on you to be a part of positive change for the future of Vermont?
Ever onward!

Due to COVID-19, we’ve made some changes to the process of selecting Vermont’s delegates to the Democratic National Convention in August -- that is IF we end up having an in-person convention at all. Either way, it has never been easier to toss your hat in the ring!
If you want the chance to participate in the state party convention or the Democratic National Convention on behalf of either Vice President Biden or Senator Bernie Sanders it is as simple as filling out one online form. This form, in fact.
In times like these, it’s more important than ever to have a voice in strengthening our Democratic Party. I strongly encourage you to get involved in this process, be it as a county caucus participant, state convention delegate, or candidate for national convention delegate. Join me in making your voice heard.
We’re so excited to get this process underway as our party’s primary is now coming to an end.
In solidarity,

I’m asking for your vote for Governor to help join our great leaders in the statehouse to build a stronger, more resilient Vermont for our future.
Dear Democrat,
For the last four years, we have seen Democratic priorities blocked and vetoed over and over again by the Scott administration.
While keeping Vermonters safe and healthy, together we must also lead Vermont in a new direction that includes economic, environmental and racial justice for all. I am proud to be your nominee for Governor of Vermont, and with your support we can address the climate crisis while creating new, green jobs, raise the minimum wage to a living wage, fight for racial and social justice, and make sure that your voice is represented not only by your legislators, but by your Governor in Montpelier as well!
The election in November is one of the most important -- if not the most important -- elections of our lifetime. Our democracy is at stake. Our future is at stake. We all must vote for Democratic candidates up and down the ballot to build a future that includes every Vermonter.
At the national level, we must vote Donald Trump out of office and support the Biden/Harris ticket. Donald Trump is a demagogue, a misogynist, a xenophobe and a divider. And we must ensure our voices continue to be represented in Washington, D.C. by re-electing Congressman Welch. We must elect Molly Gray as our Lt. Governor, and we must re-elect our great team of Beth Pearce, Jim Condos, Doug Hoffer and TJ Donovan to their respective statewide offices.
Here in Vermont, the legislators and leaders we vote into office in November will be on the front lines of building our economy out of this pandemic. I’m asking for your vote for Governor to help join our great leaders in the statehouse to build a stronger, more resilient Vermont for our future.
Please contribute $10, $15, or whatever you can give to our Coordinated Campaign and help power our VDP Field Team and GOTV efforts.
Too many significant pieces of legislation have been thoughtfully created, debated, and passed by our Democratic legislators only to have been vetoed by Phil Scott. He vetoed paid family and medical leave, raising the minimum wage (twice), a 24-hour waiting period for purchasing guns, a bill protecting us from corporate polluters, and just yesterday he vetoed the Global Warming Solutions Act.
As your Governor, I will continue to listen to and work with all Vermonters -- seniors and young people, Black, indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC), teachers, LGBTQIA, small businesses owners and the working poor, sole proprietors and farmers. I will work with our statewide leaders, Senators and Representatives to craft and support legislation that protects our most vulnerable, that addresses income inequality in our state, that builds a rural economy with jobs that pay a livable wage, that brings broadband to every community to support our students and small businesses, as well as legislation that ensures we are combating the climate crisis while creating a green jobs future.
To build a better and stronger Vermont, I need your help. Please donate to our Coordinated Campaign to ensure we have the resources needed to elect Democrats up and down the ballot.
In less than two weeks Vermonters will receive their ballots and decide who they want to represent them in Washington, D.C. and in Montpelier. Our field team, staff, hundreds of volunteers and our amazing slate of candidates are working to reach every Vermonter with our positive vision for our future. We are calling and texting voters, preparing mailings, organizing honk-n-waves and participating in virtual meetings and telephone town halls. We need every Democrat to join us in these efforts in whatever way you can, and, most importantly, to vote!
Thank you for all you do and for giving what you can to ensure the Blue Wave comes to Vermont and we elect Democrats up and down the ballot.
David Zuckerman
Lt. Governor & Democratic Nominee for Governor

Vermont Democratic Party,info@vtdemocrats.org,Oops! Updated Nomination Link Here -- Call for 2020 Curtis-Hoff Awards Nominations,"Do you know a community leader or activist who is following in the footsteps of Curtis and Hoff? We're accepting nominations for this year's award recipients. This year we are honoring activists, volunteers, and legislative leadership for their historical political initiative as Democrats “fight for the soul of this nation”.

Hello Friend,
The Vermont Democratic Party's signature annual fundraiser, the Curtis-Hoff Leadership Awards & Unity Reception, will be held on October 3rd, 2020, both online and on CCTV-Channel 17 and local affiliate stations.
A Brief History of the Curtis-Hoff Awards
The Curtis-Hoff Awards are held to celebrate those who carry on David W. Curtis and Philip H. Hoff's legacy.
David W. Curtis was the Chair of the Democratic Party from 1997 to 1999. He was a tireless champion of gay rights, women's issues and the legal rights of the poor. Before there was a Roe v. Wade, David successfully argued the Vermont Supreme Court case establishing a Vermont woman's right to choose. Before there were civil unions, David served as co-council on Vermont's landmark case securing adoption rights for gay couples. As a prominent public official and a person living with AIDS, David chose to be visible. His testimony before Congress helped secure reauthorization of Ryan White funding for HIV/AIDS in rural communities. Through his words and deeds, David helped articulate a positive vision for Vermont Democrats.
Philip H. Hoff was elected in 1962 as Vermont's first Democratic governor since 1853. During his governorship, he pioneered unprecedented environmental, development, and social welfare programs, including the creation of the Governor's Commission on the Status of Women. Concerned about racial justice, he joined with New York Mayor John Lindsay to co-found the Vermont-New York Youth Project, which brought minority students from the city together with Vermont students to work on joint summer projects at several Vermont colleges. The poll tax was eliminated during his tenure as governor, and the Vermont Student Assistance Corporation, Legal Aid and Vermont Public Television were established. In the 1980s, Hoff returned to elective politics, serving three terms in the Vermont State Senate (1983-1989). He also served in various advisory and honorary positions and as President of the Board of Trustees at Vermont Law School as well as continuing his work as a lawyer in private practice. In 1989, he co-founded the law firm of Hoff, Curtis.
The first Curtis Awards were held in 1999 in memory of David Curtis, and when Governor Phil Hoff, who had been David Curtis' law partner for many years, passed away in 2018, his name was added to the Awards. We celebrate Democratic leadership in honor of David Curtis and Governor Phil Hoff for their years of service to the Vermont Democratic Party and to the Democratic cause.

SCOTUS Update @ VT Dems,info@vtdemocrats.org,Help us take back the Senate,"Today the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee convened for the opening of the SCOTUS confirmation hearings for Amy Coney Barrett. Quick update: Lindsey Graham continues to ignore requests to implement daily COVID testing for the SCOTUS hearings, while refusing to be tested himself; the much-needed COVID relief bill has been brought to a standstill; and the Republicans are coming for the Affordable Care Act.
Dear Friend,
Today the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee convened for the opening of the SCOTUS confirmation hearings for Amy Coney Barrett.
Quick update:
* Lindsey Graham continues to ignore requests to implement daily COVID testing for the SCOTUS hearings, while refusing to be tested himself
* The much-needed COVID relief bill has been brought to a standstill
* The Republicans are coming for the Affordable Care Act
Republicans are rushing the gates.
The U.S. Senate shouldn’t move forward with a confirmation until after the American people select their next President and the U.S. Congress. The American people deserve to be heard, and we will not let Donald Trump and the Senate Republicans get away with this.
We need to flip the U.S. Senate so Democrats can protect our health coverage as Republicans do everything they can to destroy it. Donate now so we can.
The Democrats face a tough challenge to reclaim control of the Senate, up against the Republicans’ 53-47 majority, but polls are showing that it’s possible.
With 35 seats up for re-election, we’ve got our eye on 10 key Senate races:
* Arizona (Democratic Candidate Mark Kelly vs. Republican Sen. Martha McSally)
* Colorado (Democratic Candidate Gov. John Hickenlooper vs. Republican Sen. Cory Gardner)
* Iowa (Democratic Candidate Theresa Greenfield vs. Republican Sen. Joni Ernst)
* Georgia (Democratic Candidate Rev. Raphael Warnock vs. Rep. Doug Collins and Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler)
* Kansas (Democratic Candidate Kansas Sen. Barbara Bollier vs. Republican Candidate Roger Marshall)
* Kentucky (Democratic Candidate Amy McGrath vs. Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell)
* Maine (Democratic Candidate Maine Speaker Sara Gideon vs. Republican Sen. Susan Collins)
* Montana (Democratic Candidate Gov. Steve Bullock vs. Republican Sen. Steve Daines)
* South Carolina (Democratic Candidate Jaime Harrison vs. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham)
* Texas (Democratic Candidate MJ Hegar vs. Republican John Cornyn)
We will continue to fight for these Democratic Senate candidates as our country’s Republican Senators continue to show that their actions do not align with the priorities of the American people.
Make a donation now to flip the Senate and protect the future of the U.S. Supreme Court while supporting our Vermont Democratic races up and down the ballot.
In solidarity,
Vermont Democratic Party

Vermont Democratic Party,info@vtdemocrats.org,house dems make history,"Friend —
This Tuesday, House Democrats were successful in overriding a Governor’s veto for the 9th time in Vermont’s history and for the first time since 2009, passing S.23 to give hard working Vermonters a raise.
For too long, Phil Scott single handedly stood in the way of the minimum wage increase that Vermonters overwhelmingly support.. Not only do Vermonters believe in a wage increase, so does the editorial board of a major Vermont paper, the Rutland Herald:
“We believe increasing the minimum wage makes Vermont attractive to people thinking about calling Vermont home...Tuesday’s override was a bold act of democracy that we believe will definitely move Vermont in a better direction.”
Phil Scott likes to talk about affordability for working Vermonters, yet he wasn’t willing to give the lowest paid workers a raise of $1.50. Vermonters want a more affordable Vermont - we have your back as we fight to make that a reality.

But is worth stepping back and considering the historical scope of where we are today: a pandemic that has already killed more than 140,000 Americans and is now growing with an intensity that was preventable; the greatest economic crisis since the Great Depression; a dangerous divisive President who uses George Wallace-inspired rhetoric to spread hate and fear; brutal murders that slapped us all in the face with the harsh reality of American racism and inspire a public outpouring of anger, frustration, pain and determination to make real change happen. All taking place against the background of a presidential election year.
In future histories of the US, there can be little doubt the events of 2020 will rank it as one of the defining years for our country -- hopefully one where we rise to the challenge and put the country on a better course.
It has been two months since the murder of George Floyd, and in the aftermath we’ve seen a country wrestling with the realities of systemic racism, of police violence, or the devaluing of Black lives. The outpouring of people of all races into the streets (even during the pandemic) and the first person recounting of the experiences of people of color have produced powerful demands for action, demands that we must all commit to enacting.
At a time like this, some will see a false choice between participating in electoral politics and participating in social movements and protests. In reality, they are integrally connected – and both are essential to making social progress. Recently I reread a powerful essay by Dr. King from 1965 – “Let Justice Roll Down” -- where he refers to the Civil Rights Act as “legislation first written in the streets”, and speaks of the interrelated nature of demonstrations and elections, of the importance of the parallel actions of both protests and voter mobilization. Even now, 55 years later, his powerful words serve as reminder of the power of engaging in both.

Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, much of politics this year has been upended. (A situation made worse by the abysmal “leadership” from the White House.)
The Democratic Party has made the wise decision to transform our scheduled National Convention in Milwaukee into an almost entirely virtual event. The Democratic National Convention will protect the health and well-being of the host city and of all those who might have attended by cancelling in-person gathering. But the Convention will still go forward from August 17-20, with virtual voting and speeches, videos and entertainment being beamed in from across the country. It promises to be a great way to highlight our party, our nominees, our platform and our diversity - make plans to watch during those four evenings.
As Chair of the Vermont Democratic Party, I will be casting my ballot for our own Senator Bernie Sanders, the winner of the Vermont Presidential primary. And when Joe Biden and his Vice-Presidential choice are nominated, I will be proudly joining in with Democrats everywhere in rallying to elect them in November during what is, without question, the most important Presidential election in many decades.
Here in Vermont, we were fortunate that we were able to hold our Presidential primary on March 3, before the pandemic started to close down the state. But we had to make major adjustments to our delegate selection process, conducting completely on-line activities in lieu of the in-person caucuses and state convention we would normally have held. In the end, we had as many state convention delegates elected and voting as we had during the 2016 election – a testament to the commitment and enthusiasm of grassroots Democrats across the state.
We were able to complete the process, electing a delegation pledged based on the results of the primary, and ending up with the most diverse delegation we have ever sent to a national convention.
The members of the delegation are:
FOR SENATOR SANDERS
Kayla Arena (Chittenden)
Jim Dandeneau (Chittenden)
Noah Detzer (Chittenden)
Steffen Gillom (Windham)
Linda Gravell (Washington)
Kate Larose (Franklin)
Bruce Olsson (Lamoille)
Olivia Pena (Chittenden)
Brian Pine (Chittenden)
Maria Rinaldi (Chittenden)
Lisa Ryan (Rutland)
Ryan McLaren (Chittenden) - Alternate
FOR VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN
Aimee Alexander (Orleans)
Andrew Champagne (Chittenden)
Brenda Churchill (Franklin)
Carolyn Dwyer (Chittenden)
Alison Leibly (Windsor)
CD Mattison (Chittenden) – alternate
UNPLEDGED
Senator Patrick Leahy
Senator Bernie Sanders
Representative Peter Welch
Governor Howard Dean (former DNC Chair)
Terje Anderson – VDP Chair
Tess Taylor – VDP Vice-Chair
Tim Jerman – National Committeeman
Mary Sullivan – National Committeewoman
STANDING COMMITTEE MEMBERS
(SELECTED VT EACH CAMPAIGN)
Rules – David Weinstein (Chittenden – Sanders)
Credentials – Martha Allen (Essex – Sanders)
Platform – Governor Peter Shumlin (Windham – Biden)
Congratulations to all the delegates and to everyone who participated in the process!

Have you completed the 2020 US Census?
Vermont has one of the lowest Census response rates in the country right now, and the pandemic has greatly interfered with the ability of Census workers to go door-to-door collecting information.
The national count is an essential part of distributing government resources, making important planning decisions, and allocating political power. We need everyone to respond.
If you have not already done so, please take just a few minutes complete the short form – you can respond on-line or by phone (844-330-2020 in English, 844-468-2020 en Español )
display: block; margin: 0px auto; width: 600px; max-width: 100%;
Thanks to the leadership of our Secretary of State Jim Condos and our Democratic legislators (and over the stonewalling of Republican Governor Phil Scott and Republican legislators), Vermonters will be able to vote safely this year, with expanded voting by mail and other options.
If you haven’t already done so, go to the “MyVoter” page at the Secretary of State’s website to make sure your mailing address is correct, and to sign up to receive a mail ballot for the August 11th primary. (All active registered voters will be mailed a ballot for the November general election.)
And, as an added bonus, if you miss getting your “I Voted” sticker at your local polling place, the VDP will gladly send you a “I Voted by Mail” sticker. Just sign up on our website.

Finally, a personal note:
It has been nearly three years since I was first elected as Vermont Democratic Party Chair. Sadly, I have to announce that I will be stepping down to deal with on-going health issues that prevent me from being able to continue to devote the time, the energy, and the focus that being Chair requires.
Serving as Vermont Democratic Party Chair has been one of the greatest honors of my decades of political involvement, and it greatly saddens me to have to leave. But, especially during an election year, the Party deserves to have a Chair who can fulfill the role. I will remain involved and fully support the VDP in any way I can going forward, albeit in a more limited capacity.
Under VDP By-Laws, an election for a new Chair can’t take place until at least 30 days after announcement of a resignation, so the State Committee will hold a special meeting to elect a new Chair in late August or early September. In the meantime, I will be working with an ad hoc committee of Party officers and committee members to make certain that all of the essential work of the Chair is still being done.
I leave with full confidence in the capable professional staff that carries out the work of the party day-to-day, in our talented elected officials and candidates, and in the countless volunteers who lead on the state, county and town committees, and all those who support the party across the state.
Thank you for the opportunity to serve for the last three years. While it has certainly been challenging at times, I am proud of what we have accomplished as a team and knowing that the VDP is in a much stronger place than we were before.
In solidarity,
Terje

Vermont Democratic Party,info@vtdemocrats.org,Milwaukee or bust? Find out how to become a convention delegate,"Friend —
Have you ever thought about being a delegate to the Democratic National Convention? Casting your vote for our next President? Being there in Milwaukee in July for the speeches, the cheering, the confetti, the excitement of thousands of Democrats from across the country coming together to help oust Donald Trump?
Going to the Democratic National Convention can be the political experience of a lifetime. You don’t need to be a famous person, a wealthy donor, or an elected official to become a delegate - here in Vermont, we run a process that is open to everyone, and every four years we send a diverse group of grassroots Democrats to represent us at our national convention.
If this is something that interests you, we’re offering a series of public trainings around the state (and on-line) to walk you through the process. Anyone who is interested in being part of it is encouraged to attend.
You can sign up at the links below:
Montpelier, Monday February 24.
Brattleboro, Saturday March 14.
Winooski, Monday, March 16.
Rutland, Saturday, March 21.
Online, Wednesday April 1.
Don’t forget to vote in the March 3rd Democratic Presidential primary - that’s how we decide which Presidential candidates get Vermont delegates, and only people who vote in the primary are eligible to run for delegate.
Click here to register to vote, check your registration, or where you should vote on Primary Day. (Use the [[URL REDACTED]] link)
And save the dates for the April 21st town caucuses to select state convention delegates, and the exciting May 30th Democratic State Convention in Barre, where a thousand Democrats from across the state will gather to elect our delegates.

MASKS WORK,info@vtdemocrats.org,Tell Your Governor: Masks Save Lives,"Add your name to a growing list of Vermonters who are demanding GOP Governor Phil Scott implement a statewide mask mandate.
Friend —
As COVID-19 cases around the country are on the rise, calls for statewide mask mandates have grown louder, including right here in Vermont.
Yet, Vermont’s Republican Governor Phil Scott has refused to institute a statewide mask mandate, calling the measure unnecessary and counterproductive. His refusal to do so is an outlier among a bipartisan chorus of governors from Texas to Kentucky, Massachusetts to Maine, who are mandating their residents wear a mask in public. In fact, Vermont and New Hampshire are the only two states in New England not mandating face coverings.
Add your name to a growing list of Vermonters who are demanding GOP Governor Phil Scott implement a statewide mask mandate.
The nation’s leading voice of reason and authority on all things COVID-19 says masks prevent the spread of the virus and save lives. Even Phil Scott’s own health commissioner urged Vermonters back in April to wear face covering in public spaces: “Wearing a face mask may help people from spreading the virus.” Stand up for science by added your name now.
During a recent news conference, Scott told Vermonters why he won’t institute a mask mandate: He thinks mask requirements are controversial and counterproductive: ""From what I've seen across the country, [mask mandates are] having mixed results, and I think it creates a lot of controversy. It puts people at odds, and I believe it's counterproductive to what we're trying to do today.”
Let Governor Scott know that you don’t think there is anything controversial or counterproductive about requesting all Vermonters wear a mask when out in pubic. It’s simple: Masks keep us all safe.

VDP Team,info@vtdemocrats.org,Lit drop with us!,"This week’s VDP Community Call will be a little different — instead of talking with candidates, we’ll be talking with Indra Acharya, VDP Constituency Organizing Manager, and Andrew Champagne, State Committee Member and voter registrant extraordinaire, about ways to get more Vermonters voting this cycle.
Hi Friend,
With only four weeks to go, it’s more important than ever to get involved this election cycle. Each weekend, from now until Election Day, we’ll be doing lit drops across the state to remind Vermonters to vote -- and vote Democratic up and down the ballot!
Sign up here to get involved!
“Lit drops” happen when we leave a piece of literature at a voter’s door to provide voter education on candidates, how to vote, and more. These lit drops are no-contact canvassing: all we ask is that you bring a face mask, a water bottle, and most importantly, a friend to join you! Shift times are 12:00-3:00 and 3:00-6:00 on Saturdays and Sundays. If you’d like to do a lit drop during the week, please contact your local field organizer (listed below) to set up a date/time to pick up your materials.
How lit drops work:
* Step 1. Meet at your local staging location 15 minutes before your shift begins.
* Step 2. Get your targeted list of voters, your map, and a packet of literature to leave at doors.
* Step 3. Leave a piece of campaign literature at each door on your list.
* Step 4. Celebrate big wins across the state on November 3rd!
Want to join in the fun? Sign up here to do a lit drop in your area!
For more information, please contact your local field organizer to learn more about how YOU can make a difference:
* Chittenden County: Michelle Loree and Ike Nierman
* Addison, Franklin, Grand Isle Counties: Charlie Glassberg
* Caledonia, Essex, Orleans, and Lamoille Counties: Marissa Oves
* Washington and Orange Counties: Jesse Schwartzman
* Rutland and Bennington Counties: Lydia Gulick
* Windham and Windsor Counties: Tristan Anderson
Onward to November,

RCD (VDP),info@vtdemocrats.org,kicking off the legislative session,"Friend —
Tomorrow, January 7th, marks the first day of the 2020 legislative session and Democrats in the House and Senate are fired up and ready to go.
House and Senate Democrats have a busy few months ahead of them — with commitments to pass legislation guaranteeing Vermonters paid family leave and an increase in minimum wage, overriding Governor Scott’s veto of a bill aimed at holding polluters responsible, and passing legislation to help curb the climate crisis. Just to name a few.
So while our elected representatives are rolling up their sleeves and getting to work, we need to do our part to make sure Democrats are in a strong position to hold seats, grow majorities in both chambers, and elect a Democratic governor in 2020.
As Montpelier kicks off the legislative season, will you rush a contribution to help put Democrats on a strong footing as we begin 2020?
Your early support today means the earlier we can begin hiring field staff, running digital ads, knocking on doors, calling and texting voters, and so much more. This is how we win.
Let's get to work,

Patrick Leahy,info@vtdemocrats.org,We Must Continue to Fight for Everyone's Right to Vote!,"We have already seen the dangerous impact of this Republican obstruction and why this election is the most important one in our lifetimes. Like you, I have watched with anger the images of long lines of voters waiting hours and risking their wellbeing to exercise their right to vote. We cannot allow this voter suppression to happen again in November.
Dear Fellow Democrat,
Donald Trump and the Republicans are at it again – tweeting lies about vote-by-mail and spending millions filing lawsuits to block efforts to make voting safe and easy. It is the same playbook they always use – engaging in voter suppression by every means available, spreading fear and misinformation to try to undermine democracy.
We have already seen the dangerous impact of this Republican obstruction and why this election is the most important one in our lifetimes. Like you, I have watched with anger the images of long lines of voters waiting hours and risking their wellbeing to exercise their right to vote. We cannot allow this voter suppression to happen again in November.
In Vermont, Democrats have been leaders in protecting our right to vote. Our Democratic legislators overcame Republican opposition to pass legislation that will send out a general election ballot to every active voter on the voter roll. And of the $2 billion I was able to secure for Vermont through the CARES Act about $3 million for election assistance will specifically cover the costs of printing and
mailing those ballots.
But that is just the beginning. The Vermont Democratic Party has been hard at work educating voters on how to vote by mail for this election. That is why I am asking you to join me in supporting the Vermont Democratic Party’s Vote by Mail Fund by contributing $25, $50, $100, or whatever you can afford!
2020 will be an election unlike any other one. This will be the first time that many voters will vote by mail and the Trump campaign as well as Republican groups are preparing to spend millions of dollars fighting back against vote by mail efforts across the nation. As Vermonters we have a responsibility to once again be a leader in showing the country that voting can be done safely and effectively during a global pandemic.
Vermont Democrats have already taken the lead and are fighting back against Republican opposition by reaching out to voters through phone calls, text messaging, and digital organizing educating voters how to vote by mail, as well as explaining why it is important Vermont elect Democrats up and down
the ticket in 2020. However, they need your help.
Will you support the important work the VDP is doing to uphold the integrity of our elections by making a $25, $50, $100, $250 contribution to the Vote by Mail Fund TODAY?
I am proud to be a member of the Vermont Democratic Party where our elected officials in both Washington and Montpelier quickly recognized the need to take quick and decisive action to protect our elections and our right to vote in the face of COVID-19 and Republican opposition. By supporting the VDP’s Vote by Mail Fund, you are not only helping the VDP educate voters on how to vote by mail, you are also helping the Party elect Democrats up and down the ticket to fight for all Vermonters in Montpelier and Washington.
The right to vote has been hard fought in our country’s history, and people have died to gain and protect their franchise. Vermont Democrats understand we must continue to fight for everyone’s right to vote from the onslaught of Republican attacks. I hope you will join me in this fight.
Sincerely,
Patrick Leahy
P.S. For the Vermont Democratic Party to run its vote by mail program, they need at least 500 people who receive this email to make a contribution. Your contribution of $25, $50, $100, $250, or whatever you can afford will be critical in providing the Party the resources needed to make sure Vermonters can vote by mail this year.

About State Treasurer Beth Pearce
State Treasurer Beth Pearce is currently the only woman serving in a statewide elected office in Vermont. She is effective in times of crisis and cares deeply about people in our state. In 2011, Beth Pearce fought hard to advance over $155 million to Vermont's most affected communities after Tropical Storm Irene. During the ongoing response to COVID-19, Beth has convened a national group of government finance leaders to navigate the U.S. Treasury's guidance on the use of CARES Act relief funds. Vermont's own reserves were healthy going into this crisis because of Beth's years of advocacy and financial prudence. With over 40 years of experience in government finance, Beth Pearce is the most qualified candidate for State Treasurer in Vermont’s history and we need her to return to Montpelier.
About Molly Gray
Molly Gray is the Democratic Nominee for Lieutenant Governor. Molly was born and raised on a vegetable and dairy farm in Newbury, Vermont. She is a proud product of Vermont’s public education system, and a graduate of the University of Vermont and Vermont Law School. She has spent over a decade working in human rights and humanitarian aid, and currently serves Vermont as an Assistant Attorney General. Molly is running for Lieutenant Governor to create a future for Vermont where rural communities thrive and our economy is restored, where Vermont is the best place to raise and support families from infants to elders, and where our land and environment are protected for future generations.

And tomorrow, we will stand up stronger than ever before and take action to win this November: we will check our voter registrations, remind our friends to vote, make phone calls to our neighbors, and together, we will move forward to build a better America for everyone.
We hope you can join us and Senators Leahy, Brown, and Booker tonight. Click here to RSVP.

Vermont Democrats,info@vtdemocrats.org,We ♥️ Obama[care],"Friend —
Ten years ago today, President Barack Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law.
Access to health care is more important than ever -- especially given this new reality we’re living in. President Obama fought so hard to pass that historic piece of legislation because he knew health care is a human right.
Yet, in the midst of a global pandemic when the government should be doing everything in their power to protect everyday Americas, the Trump administration has been fighting to end the Affordable Care Act as we know it. They are fighting to take away our health care.
Republicans have a rich history of trying to strip Americans of their health care.
Their tactics:
* Challenging the ACA in the courts (courts they have packed with right-wing ideologues)
* Cutting funding for parts of the law
* Refusing to defend the ACA in court battles
* Trying to repeal the act altogether
That’s why today, on the tenth anniversary of the Affordable Care Act becoming law, we’re asking you to add your name to a growing list of Americans demanding the Trump Administration keep their hands off our health care.
The Affordable Care Act represents the very best of what Democrats believe in: Fighting for those in need -- be it for health care, for a livable wage, a decent job or an education.
We’re in this thing together, Friend.

Hi Friend,
In this time of social distancing, please join the Vermont Democratic Party and special guest, Congressman Ro Khanna, following the State Convention on Saturday, May 30 at 6:30PM for an intimate and informative virtual get together!
Congressman Khanna is proud to serve as the representative for California’s 17th District. As First Vice Chair of the House Progressive Caucus, Ro has stood at the vanguard of national progressive politics, serving as co-chair of the Sanders presidential campaign, while remaining committed to bipartisan problem-solving in Washington, passing two bills into law during his first term.
During his time in Congress, Ro passed the historic War Powers Act to end U.S. involvement in Yemen, has founded the NO PAC Caucus, advocated for greater college affordability, and has acted as one of the most vocal champions for “Medicare for All” in the House.
As a member of the House Oversight Committee, Ro has worked for greater government transparency. As a part of the House Armed Services Committee, Ro has fought back against special interests and their monopolistic behavior, tackling private companies that gauge from our defense budget and jack up the cost of our national security, and has championed greater government investment in technology and R&D on the House Budget Committee. Ro has worked to spread Silicon Valley jobs nationally to areas of the country left behind during the digital revolution, and has introduced multiple articles of legislation to bring jobs to economically disadvantaged communities across the country.
During this special event, Congressman Khanna will share his experience legislating in Washington DC during this pandemic and identify areas where Democrats can lead in the recovery of our economy and democracy.

Vermont Democratic Party,info@vtdemocrats.org,Call for 2020 Curtis-Hoff Awards Nominations,"Do you know a community leader or activist who is following in the footsteps of Curtis and Hoff? We're accepting nominations for this year's award recipients. This year we are honoring activists, volunteers, and legislative leadership for their historical political initiative as Democrats “fight for the soul of this nation”. We will be accepting nominations now through tomorrow, Saturday, September 12th at 12PM, so don't delay!
Hello Friend,
The Vermont Democratic Party's signature annual fundraiser, the Curtis-Hoff Leadership Awards & Unity Reception, will be held on October 3rd, 2020, both online and on CCTV-Channel 17 and local affiliate stations.
A Brief History of the Curtis-Hoff Awards
The Curtis-Hoff Awards are held to celebrate those who carry on David W. Curtis and Philip H. Hoff's legacy.
David W. Curtis was the Chair of the Democratic Party from 1997 to 1999. He was a tireless champion of gay rights, women's issues and the legal rights of the poor. Before there was a Roe v. Wade, David successfully argued the Vermont Supreme Court case establishing a Vermont woman's right to choose. Before there were civil unions, David served as co-council on Vermont's landmark case securing adoption rights for gay couples. As a prominent public official and a person living with AIDS, David chose to be visible. His testimony before Congress helped secure reauthorization of Ryan White funding for HIV/AIDS in rural communities. Through his words and deeds, David helped articulate a positive vision for Vermont Democrats.
Philip H. Hoff was elected in 1962 as Vermont's first Democratic governor since 1853. During his governorship, he pioneered unprecedented environmental, development, and social welfare programs, including the creation of the Governor's Commission on the Status of Women. Concerned about racial justice, he joined with New York Mayor John Lindsay to co-found the Vermont-New York Youth Project, which brought minority students from the city together with Vermont students to work on joint summer projects at several Vermont colleges. The poll tax was eliminated during his tenure as governor, and the Vermont Student Assistance Corporation, Legal Aid and Vermont Public Television were established. In the 1980s, Hoff returned to elective politics, serving three terms in the Vermont State Senate (1983-1989). He also served in various advisory and honorary positions and as President of the Board of Trustees at Vermont Law School as well as continuing his work as a lawyer in private practice. In 1989, he co-founded the law firm of Hoff, Curtis.
The first Curtis Awards were held in 1999 in memory of David Curtis, and when Governor Phil Hoff, who had been David Curtis' law partner for many years, passed away in 2018, his name was added to the Awards. We celebrate Democratic leadership in honor of David Curtis and Governor Phil Hoff for their years of service to the Vermont Democratic Party and to the Democratic cause.

During this time of national crisis, we want you to know the Vermont Democratic Party is here for you, and we support you.
Our elected leaders are doing everything they can to make sure you and your family are safe and financially secure during these troubling times. Our volunteers are making calls into communities to offer information on local, state, and national resources that are available. Our staff is working around the clock to adapt our entire way of practicing politics to meet this new moment we're in.
But during times like, we want to hear from you -- our community. It’s crucial that we’re listening to one another right now, which is why we’re eager to hear your story. We want to know how you, your family, your friends, or your neighbors are dealing with this pandemic. How has your community helped you? How have you helped your community?
We want to elevate your story. Sad, glad, anxious, whatever -- we want to hear from you.
Whether you’re in quarantine and working from home or have to go in to essential work to keep food on the table, we know that COVID-19 has had an impact on you and your community. Sharing the stories of our communities will bring us that closer together, and right now in a time of distance, we could use some fellowship.
Onward,

Terje Anderson,info@vtdemocrats.org,Enough.,"The upcoming election is now more important than ever, and in the face of Donald Trump, Phil Scott, and Republicans up and down the ticket, there is no time to lose.
Fellow Democrats,
Vermonters joined millions around the world reacting with horror, grief, anger and profound sadness to the murder last week of George Floyd under the knee of Minneapolis police. Sadly, this was not an isolated event, but rather part of a long and sustained history of racist violence against African-Americans going back centuries and occurring far too regularly. The stain of racism on our national fabric is one that we cannot ignore or erase.
Unfortunately, at a time when the nation needs unity and healing, Donald Trump is seeking to inflame the situation with his incitements to violence, his threats of militarization of America’s streets, and his efforts to sow fear and racial division for political purposes. All responsible leaders, regardless of party, need to loudly denounce and reject his incendiary words, threats and actions.
Vermont is far from immune to systemic racism – in law enforcement, in education, in economics, in health care, and in day-to-day community life. We must be willing to collectively and individually face and challenge these painful realities. We can and must reject all forms of racism and hate to build a Vermont that can, finally, become safe, healthy and inclusive for all.
Be well,
Terje

Grace (VDP),info@vtdemocrats.org,Impeachment update: Scott embraces GOP talking points,"Friend —
Phil is back at it.
When Governor Scott endorsed the Trump impeachment inquiry in September he said, “I believe we need to figure out what exactly did happen, establish the facts, and let the facts drive us from there to where we go.” If he really thinks this, it has been hard to tell by his behavior over the past few months — he has done nothing but embrace GOP talking points and actively support his party’s ongoing coverup.
Just last week he was asked if he trusted Mitch McConnell to hold a fair impeachment trial and responded, “I trust the Senate and the integrity of the process to prevail.”
Donate to Dems pushing back against GOP obstruction now.
Yet again, Governor Scott is proving himself afraid to really stand up to Donald Trump and his party's political base - whether it is his Republican Governors Association dark money backers in DC or the radical right wingers who run the Vermont Republican Party.
Unlike Governor Scott, Democrats are united against the President’s abuses of power. Can you rush a contribution to the Democratic Party in support of Democrats who are fighting back against GOP misconduct?

That work starts here.

"Claire Cummings, VDP Organizing Director",info@vtdemocrats.org,"hi, i'm claire!","My name is Claire and this is my first week as the VDP’s Organizing Director — and let me tell you, I couldn’t be more excited about rolling up my sleeves and getting to work.
Friend —
My name is Claire and this is my first week as the VDP’s Organizing Director — and let me tell you, I couldn’t be more excited about rolling up my sleeves and getting to work.
Even though we’re living in a time of social distance, here at the Vermont Democratic Party, we’re putting our heads together to build creative field programs that are safe, effective, and exciting. That means we’re utilizing digital tools like text messaging, digital organizing events, and social media to help fill in for the usual door-to-door style of campaigning that we’re all used to.
Some things remain the same, though. We still need to hire staff, recruit volunteers, raise funds, send mailers, and talk to as many voters as possible. That’s where you come in.
To help our people-powered party win big this November, we need every member of our team off the bench and in the game. Being in the game is going to look different for every person.
If you have a few hours of your time to help us call or text voters, we’ll take it! If you have a few bucks to give to the party every month to help fund our field programs, we’ll take that too. The bottom line is this: Powering Vermont Blue is going to take folks like you giving what you can (time, money, expertise, you name it!) to help us move forward.
So if it sounds like volunteering is the right way for you to pitch in, you can get involved right here!
If you have a few extra bucks a month, $5, $10, or even $20 to help support our party, you can join the DEM Club here!
The power truly is with the people and that’s why I’m so lucky and excited to be the party’s Organizing Director — to tap into that people power and help channel it into victories up and down the ballot in November.
Are you with me?

"Asha Carroll, VDP Digital Organizing Director",info@vtdemocrats.org,why we're doubling down on digital,"Extraordinary circumstances call for extraordinary innovation.
Friend,
Extraordinary circumstances call for extraordinary innovation.
I’m Asha, the VDP’s Digital Organizing Director. You and I may have met in recent months at a phone bank or text bank training, across email or social media, or perhaps when you volunteered for the VDP’s COVID-19 response initiative, Connecting Vermont.
When I joined the VDP back in January, I knew that 2020 would be our most digital election cycle yet. In the age of social media disinformation and presidential tweets, it is more important to us than ever to lead with the facts and to connect with voters wherever they are, in supplementation of traditional field activities.
In March, our lives changed, seemingly overnight. The challenges presented by the global pandemic quickly pushed us into new territory when it came to how we listen to and turn out voters. We were faced with a decision: stay quiet or innovate fast. With Trump in the White House and Republicans up and down the ballot threatening the safety and wellbeing of all Vermonters, the answer was clear -- but we knew we’d need your help.
So you set to work and you adapted to new technology. You made phone calls daily and came through with small dollar donations so that we could keep the lights on when so much seemed dark. You laid the foundation for our digital organizing program, and today, we’re making every dollar count as we grow our digital voter outreach efforts so we can win big in November.
Here at the VDP, we’ve been doing our part, too. We’ve talked to Vermonters over 400,000 times online about important issues and about the candidates they support. We’ve made tens of thousands of phone calls and just recently, we’ve begun sending thousands of text messages to Vermonters all over the state. We’re doing what we do best, and that’s talking to voters; things are just a little bit different this time.
You showed up when it counted, and you know as well as I do that the fight’s not over yet. I’m asking you, Friend, to keep showing up today.
Help us turn out Dems in November. With just a few extra bucks a month -- $5, $10, or even $20 to help support our party -- you can join the DEM Club now.
Your $10/month DEM Club pledge can fund:
\- 242 phone calls per month to check in with people new to voting by mail
\- 84 guides sent to voters per month on how to vote by mail that help ensure each vote is counted
\- 167 texts sent per month to remind first-time voters to cast their ballots
Donating isn't the only way to support our digital program. We're looking for volunteers like you, and we'll stand with you every step of the way.
Our August Primary is right around the corner, and with November 3rd nearly three months away, we can’t afford to slow down now. The pandemic isn’t over, and the election isn’t, either. We’re showing up where we can, when we can, safely -- using every tool that we’ve got.
Will you help us move forward today?

Trump lied when he downplayed the risk of the virus in February – and he’s lying now. His only goal is to win by any means necessary, even when it means putting American lives at risk.
Just weeks ago, Trump was here in Nevada for an INDOOR rally of his supporters, where there was very little social distancing and even less mask-wearing, despite state regulations.
We know how the saying goes: politics can be dirty. But it shouldn’t have to be deadly.
In these final weeks, we have no choice but to fight like hell and make sure the pendulum swings in the other direction.

Team, did you see the news last week?
Donald Trump announced he is withdrawing the United States from the World Health Organization (WHO), the specialized agency under the United Nations responsible for international public health.
The United States contributes about $400 million annually and is the World Health Organization's largest contributor.
Withdrawing that funding now, in the middle of a pandemic, puts hundreds of millions of people across the world in jeopardy and will only contribute to our current global humanitarian crisis.
Call on Donald Trump to immediately reverse his decision to pull the United States out of the World Health Organization by clicking here to add your name today →
ADD YOUR NAME
Not only would withdrawing the United States from the WHO have severe repercussions on our fight against COVID-19, but it would also drastically impact resources for countries battling other deadly viruses like Ebola, Polio, and HIV.
This is a reckless move by Donald Trump and sends a dangerous message to the world.
That's why the withdrawal is opposed by the American Medical Association, the nation's largest physician group, which has urged him to reverse course.

The results of grassroots investment in Nevada is already showing in our elections so far:
* Democrats now have a 6% advantage among registered voters in Nevada over the GOP.
* During the primary election, Democrats led in overall turnout by more than 16,000 votes.
* 66,000+ more Democrats participated in the election compared to the 2018 election — and over 110,000 more Democrats compared to 2016.
NV Dems are in the strongest position we’ve ever been heading into a general election and it’s entirely thanks to strong grassroots investment in our mission.
But if we fall short on our public FEC filing, that success could easily be washed away by floods of GOP money.

Then, when the Supreme Court struck down Louisiana’s anti-choice legislation and upheld Roe v. Wade, we saw another national victory for families everywhere.
But now, Mississippi passed ANOTHER restrictive reproductive health care bill that could put Roe back in jeopardy if it comes to Trump’s conservative Supreme Court.

While Republican-controlled states across the country try to roll back reproductive rights in every way imaginable, Nevada bucked the national trend and repealed restrictive reproductive health requirements that limited the right to choose.
Our state is leading the charge in the fight for reproductive rights in America — but if Brett Kavanaugh and his conservative colleagues on the Supreme Court see the right opportunity to overturn Roe v. Wade, they might take it.

Trump: So I said to my people “slow the testing down, please”
Trump’s response to COVID-19 has been one failure after another.
First, he said it wasn’t a big deal and would be over by Easter. Then he failed to get medical professionals the equipment they needed. Now he’s talking about slowing down testing to make it seem like we have fewer cases.
Fight back: Denounce Trump’s latest comment and pledge to vote him out this fall.
SIGN ON
Donald Trump started up his MAGA rallies this weekend and right out the gate he’s showing his true colors.

Friends,
After Trump took to Twitter to lash out about our fight to expand access to the ballot box here in Nevada, we knew we had to fight back.
Trump and the GOP know Nevada is a key battleground if they want to cling to power in November and they’re already deploying hundreds of staffers and MILLIONS in spending to flip states like ours red.
That’s why we need 500 supporters to come together and fight back against Trump’s threats. Join us as an official Team NV Dems member with a gift of $10 or any amount before our membership drive closes at midnight on Sunday:

NV Dems is committed to making voting safe and accessible so that everyone’s voice is heard. But Trump sees any effort to elevate the voice of the voter in a battleground state like Nevada as a direct threat to his chances of staying in the White House.
That’s why he’s attacking us directly, threatening to withhold federal funding from our state as punishment.
In order to fight back against these attacks and out-organize the GOP, we need a strong team of supporters standing with us — click here to pitch in any amount and activate your membership on our team today!

The latest poll in Nevada is bad news. Biden and Trump are locked in a “close race” and the GOP could easily flip Nevada red this November.
We knew we’d be in for a fight this year because of the record-breaking war chest Trump and the GOP have available to pour into our state – this new poll is proof that we need to double down on our organizing efforts this year.

Here's why this goal is too important to miss:
* This is the biggest FEC deadline of the election — the last one before most voters cast their ballots.
* We will be reporting these fundraising numbers out to the public — where the media, political analysts, and the GOP will be looking to see where Democrats' grassroots strength stands.
* Trump is already watching us closely, and with the recent ratings shift toward Republicans from The Cook Political Report, we can't miss a beat.
We know we have what it takes to out-organize and out-mobilize the GOP, but missing this goal would be a blow to our efforts.

There’s a reason Trump is trying to stop votes from being counted in our battleground state — because he knows his best path to victory lies in making sure Americans CAN’T vote.
Clark County is home to a diverse group of communities — and instead of trying to win their votes fair and square, Trump is trying to sue our state into suppressing them.

Nevadans are heading to the polls RIGHT NOW in an effort to make their voices heard, exercise their civic duty and vote Trump OUT.

Here’s the truth: our country has experienced four years of tragedy after tragedy.
Gun violence. Relentless attempts (and some successes) at gutting health care. Attacks on reproductive rights. Police brutality. Racism and discrimination. An economic crisis. A global health pandemic. An administration that has thrived in the chaos and only made things worse, never better.
Now, Trump is trying to impede the vote in battleground states like ours. We can’t take another four years of this. Can you rush a $15 contribution to protect the election from his voter suppression efforts?
Every bit counts. Every vote counts.
We got this.

Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are counting on our state to deliver a victory, and we’ve been working nonstop to help make that happen. From organizing digital town halls to days of actions — we aren’t about to leave anything to chance.
Especially now that we’ve been called the most likely state to go from blue to red.
Team, there’s a silver lining to FiveThirtyEight’s model: now we know what we’re up against, which means we can work double time — with your help — to prove their prediction wrong.

NVDems.com,info@e.nvdems.com,re: Trump's threats,"Last week, Trump threatened to withhold federal grants from Nevada because we're expanding vote-by-mail and making it safer for voters to participate in our democracy.
Do you agree Trump's attacks directly threaten the integrity of our elections? YES NO
In case you missed it, Trump took to Twitter last week to threaten outrageous (and undemocratic) consequences for Nevada — all because we're on the frontlines of the fight to expand access to the ballot box and make voting as safe as possible in our upcoming elections.
Trump believes that making voting safer and easier is the same as trying to ""cheat in elections"" and he wants to punish Nevadans.
The entire NV Dems team was outraged by Trump's blatant attempt at voter suppression and we need to hear from you about it:
Do you agree that Trump's threat to withhold federal grant funding over Nevada's vote-by-mail program is a direct threat to our voting rights? YES NO
Last month, NV Dems joined the Democratic National Committee, Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and Priorities USA in filing a suit to expand voting access in Nevada.
We're committed to making voting safe and accessible to every voter in our state.
Trump, on the other hand, views any effort to elevate the voice of the voter as a direct threat to his chances of winning in November.

Patricia Ackerman,info@e.nvdems.com,the seat that slipped through the cracks...,"Friends,
Our state was instrumental in generating the blue wave in 2018 — Democrats across Nevada helped flip one of only two Senate seats to go from red to blue and cast hundreds of thousands of votes to protect house seats from Republican control.
But one seat slipped through the cracks.
I’m running to finish the job and flip Nevada’s second district, which would put our state's entire congressional delegation in the blue column.
Can you chip in $10 and be a part of the historic movement to FLIP our entire state BLUE?
My opponent, Mark Amodei, has sided with private interests over Nevadans on far too many occasions — from failing to protect our public lands, to voting in favor of repealing the ACA which could leave millions of Americans and over 300,000 Nevadans without health care, to accepting money from corporate interests and faceless wealthy backers.
This is NOT the kind of representation Nevada needs. Join me and the team at NV Dems in our fight to flip this district blue → If you saved your information, clicking any button below will cause your donation to process instantly and split between NV Dems and Patricia Ackerman for Congress:

The results of our primary election this month speak for themselves.
* Democrats now have a 6% advantage among registered voters in Nevada over the GOP.
* Statewide, Democrats led in overall turnout by more than 16,000 votes.
* 66,000+ more Democrats participated in the 2020 primary election compared to the 2018 election — and over 110,000 more Democrats compared to 2016.
Bottom line? NV Dems are in the strongest position we've ever been heading into a general election — but all that work will be for nothing if GOP mega-donors and dark money groups find weaknesses in our grassroots network.

If you didn't watch the GOP Convention last month, I don't blame you. It painted a dystopian picture of America with an authoritarian leader at the helm.
But it's not too far from our current reality. Trump has threatened to suspend mail-in voting, cut off access to health care, and sell our public lands to private hands.

Tonight is the final night of the Trump Show (aka the GOP convention), and Trump is about to take the stage, giving an explicitly political speech directly from the White House.
Night after night this week, we’ve watched Trump and his allies spread lies about Democrats. Instead of discussing their vision for the country, they’ve taken aim at leaders and activists who are challenging Trump on the most important issues currently facing our country.

Can you chip in $10 right away and help raise the final $6,312 we need for our Voter Education Program to set the record straight after the RNC’s onslaught of misinformation?

Here’s why this is so important:
National Republicans have been preparing for this election for years – filling their deep pockets with special interest and dark money, and breaking fundraising records across the board.
Now they’re ready to spend big – and they have their sights set on these four critical states.
They know Democrats in Nevada, Pennsylvania, Arizona, and Florida stand between them and another four years of Donald Trump.
Let’s prove them right.
If you can, make a donation today and help make sure these state parties have the resources to deliver big wins up and down the ballot on Election Day – and finally get this country working for working people.
I know these are difficult times for our nation, but we will get through them as we always do: by coming together, as Americans, to fight for a better future.
Thanks for being a part of this,
Elizabeth

Trump and Republicans have tried to rewrite history. They've tried to wipe their hands clean and pretend their actions have nothing to do with the worsening effects of the global pandemic on Americans' health, livelihoods, and future security.
But the families of over 170,000 dead Americans would disagree — so would the 40 million unemployed Americans and countless others whose lives are forever changed because of Trump's tragic mishandling of the virus.
We must stop the chaos and put an end to Trump's authoritarian presidency.

After four long years, Democrats finally have the opportunity to end the Trump Administration and start solving the many crises it created. As our party gathers virtually for the convention, we know there’s no shortage of issues that need to be covered.
With Joe, Kamala, and Democrats from all across the country getting ready to take the stage (virtually, of course), we want to know what issues are top-of-mind for you. Will you take our 2020 Convention Survey and share your insights as we’re gearing up for the next few days?
Democrats are ready to embark on a positive path forward – one that involves increasing access to health care, safeguarding voting rights, and protecting our environment.
But with Trump botching every issue his administration has ever touched, we want to hear about what’s top-of-mind for you and your family right now.
TAKE THE SURVEY
There’s no doubt about it: Trump and his administration will leave a legacy of mismanagement and corruption – and it’s up to Democrats to correct their many wrongdoings and missteps.
All eyes are on our battleground state as we kick off the convention – which is why your insight is so valuable. Joe and Kamala are depending on us to work together and share our ideas for the country – what do you say?

* Train volunteers to run digital voter outreach programs instead of traditional canvassing
* Reach voters across the state by phone, text, email, and through digital events
* Ensure voters know where, when, and how to vote by the time Early Voting begins
* Fight back against the FLOODS of GOP money that will threaten to drown us out
We cannot do that without scaling up our digital reach in a major way. These matched donations could be make-or-break for Democrats up and down the ballot in our battleground state.

Trump’s strategy is all smoke and mirrors — but in some counties in our battleground state, it's actually working.
Here’s an unsettling example: during the first weekend of early voting in Washoe County, GOP turnout actually overtook Democratic turnout.
This is eerily similar to 2016: the closer it got to Election Day, the more vocal and emboldened Trump supporters became.

While Republican-controlled states across the country try to roll back reproductive rights in every way imaginable, Nevada bucked the national trend and repealed restrictive reproductive health requirements that limited the right to choose.

The next 100 days are crucial for Democrats. We know the GOP is fundraising hand over fist and they’re already pouring money into our state.
Normally we’d counter that by getting out to knock on doors and talk with Nevadans in person, ensuring every Democrat is registered and fired up to send Joe Biden to the White House. This year, we’re relying entirely on virtual voter contact before Election Day.
Donald Trump admitted he’s on “Joe Biden’s field” here in Nevada – we can win this thing, but only if we out-work and out-organize the GOP in the final 100 days of the election.
If you’ve been waiting for an opportunity to make the most out of your support – this is it.

And that’s why I’m writing to you today, because NV Dems needs your help. They are working tirelessly to elect Democrats across the state. And with more Democrats elected in Nevada, the more allies we’ll have to make Joe’s vision a reality.

As Joe likes to say, we are in the battle for the soul of this nation, and I couldn’t agree more.
This is our chance to take our country back and not only return to normal, but build back better. There is no limit to what Democrats can accomplish — but only if we win up and down the ticket in 2020.
And that’s why I’m writing to you. I’ve been working on campaigns for the last 20 years. So believe me, I know that campaigns are won — or lost — by hitting these fundraising goals.
So if Joe and the NV Dems are going to be successful in November, it's imperative they hit their fundraising goals at the end of the month.
It's going to take committed Democrats to do it. So they need your help.

* Reach voters across the state by phone, text, email, and through digital events
* Ensure voters know where, when, and how to vote by the time Early Voting begins
* Fight back against the FLOODS of GOP money that will threaten to drown us out

There’s a reason Trump is trying to stop votes from being counted in our battleground state — because he knows his best path to victory lies in making sure Americans CAN’T vote.
Clark County is home to a diverse group of communities — and instead of trying to win their votes fair and square, Trump is trying to sue our state into suppressing them.

One thing is clear: Donald Trump’s re-election campaign just isn’t going well, even in battleground states.
The repeated failures of his administration, the hateful rhetoric of his presidency, and the dangerous decisions he’s made since entering office are all finally catching up with him.
But Trump’s getting desperate and he’s going to use the only tool he has left: massive spending.
National Republicans are still raking in cash across the board and now we’re seeing how they intend on spending that money → in battlegrounds like Nevada.
Showing up for our movement has never been so important. This is the most consequential election of our lifetime and Trump is doing everything in his power to drown out our message. We have to fight back.

PETITION via NVDems.com,info@e.nvdems.com,URGENT: AMA calls on Trump to reverse decision,"Team, did you see the news last week?
Donald Trump announced he is withdrawing the United States from the World Health Organization (WHO), the specialized agency under the United Nations responsible for international public health.
The United States contributes about $400 million annually and is the World Health Organization's largest contributor.
Withdrawing that funding now, in the middle of a pandemic, puts hundreds of millions of people across the world in jeopardy and will only contribute to our current global humanitarian crisis.
Call on Donald Trump to immediately reverse his decision to pull the United States out of the World Health Organization by clicking here to add your name today →
ADD YOUR NAME
Not only would withdrawing the United States from the WHO have severe repercussions on our fight against COVID-19, but it would also drastically impact resources for countries battling other deadly viruses like Ebola, Polio, and HIV.
This is a reckless move by Donald Trump and sends a dangerous message to the world.
That's why the withdrawal is opposed by the American Medical Association, the nation's largest physician group, which has urged him to reverse course.

Poll Alert: New numbers in the presidential race here in Nevada show our battleground state is still in play for Trump
The latest poll in Nevada is bad news. Biden and Trump are locked in a “close race” and the GOP could easily flip Nevada red this November.
We knew we’d be in for a fight this year because of the record-breaking war chest Trump and the GOP have available to pour into our state – this new poll is proof that we need to double down on our organizing efforts this year.
This is going to be a tight race, and there’s no room for error. We’re up against a massive fundraising juggernaut, and we need your support if we’re going to be able to take on Trump.

NV Dems is committed to making voting safe and accessible so that everyone’s voice is heard. But Trump sees any effort to elevate the voice of the voter in a battleground state like Nevada as a direct threat to his chances of staying in the White House.
That’s why he’s attacking us directly, threatening to withhold federal funding from our state as punishment.
In order to fight back against these attacks and out-organize the GOP, we need a strong team of supporters standing with us — click here to pitch in any amount and activate your membership on our team today!

Patricia Ackerman,info@e.nvdems.com,we can't afford 4 more years,"Friends,
Our battleground state will be pivotal this November. After the Democratic Convention last week, it’s clear: Republicans up and down the ballot are not capable of achieving the positive change our country desperately needs.
That’s why I’m running to flip the last red Nevada Congressional district BLUE. Amid a global pandemic, a struggling economy, and a President who relishes in the chaos – we simply can’t afford to lose.
Can you chip in $10 and be a part of the historic movement to FLIP this district blue and elect Democrats up and down the ballot in our battleground state?
The Democratic Convention last week reminded me what bold ideas and strong leadership look like. I am so proud that our party has found its footing – from fighting for access to health care, to protecting reproductive rights, to safeguarding the environment – we are pursuing progress and hope at every opportunity.
The GOP convention, on the other hand, painted a darker and more sinister picture for our future. The country needs leaders who will champion progress – not incite fear and anger. Can I count on you to support my campaign and join me in the fight for progress?

Patricia Ackerman,info@e.nvdems.com,Trump's rallying (?) in my district (!),"Donald Trump is holding a rally in my district this weekend.
He announced, canceled, and un-canceled the rally trying to find a venue that will accommodate a dangerous crowd in the middle of a pandemic – and now he's settled on holding the event in my hometown.
Trump will try to rally for my opponent: Nevada’s last Republican in the House, Rep. Mark Amodei. Trump calls Amodei a “warrior” for his agenda.
We won’t let Trump come to Nevada without a fight.
To defeat Trump and Amodei, we need to be ready to counter Trump’s lies and attacks at today’s rally. Rush a $10 donation to my campaign and NV Dems so we can fight back.

Wherever Donald Trump goes, he spews misinformation and hate. And Rep. Mark Amodei is right there with him, voting with Trump 97% of the time.
Trump and Amodei have failed to extend COVID-19 relief families in need. Instead, Trump wants to spread COVID-19 through my community by hosting a rally.
We won’t cower in fear. We will DEFEAT them. Voting starts in just a few weeks, and we need your help NOW:

For months now, Republicans have gone on Fox News and feigned outrage over Democrats' serious response to the COVID-19 pandemic – which has taken hundreds of thousands of American lives already.
And for months now, they’ve been supported and encouraged by their reckless leader in the White House, who proudly ignored health guidelines for months and ultimately tested positive for COVID-19, along with dozens of administration officials and other GOP leaders.
Trump’s actions are dangerous, irresponsible, and a stain on the fabric of this country. Can you help us mobilize Democrats with just DAYS left in the election?

Harry Reid via NV Dems,info@e.nvdems.com,❗Nevada is a key state❗,"Folks,
When I spoke at the Democratic Convention four years ago, I said, “When Trump decided to run for president, he probably said to himself: ‘I’m an egomaniac. I don’t believe in science. I think women are inferior. Where would I feel at home?’ ”
Since that day, Trump has proved me right time and again. He has tried to reshape America in his own image – and he has made it clear he will stop at nothing to hold on to power.
The upcoming election is the most important in our lifetime and we must come together to elect Joe Biden and usher in big wins for Democrats up and down the ballot. Click here to join me in supporting NV Dems to make 2020 a change election.

From his failure to respond to COVID-19 to his attacks on healthcare and women’s rights to his systematic dismantling of voting rights – Donald Trump has proven he is unfit to lead this nation for another four years.
As the former Senate Majority Leader, I know firsthand the crucial role Nevada plays in the presidential election – and I am not alone. Even the Nevada GOP has admitted when campaigning in Nevada, Donald Trump is “playing on Biden’s field.”

We're committed to making voting safe and accessible to every voter in our state — but unsurprisingly, Trump views any effort to elevate the voice of the voter as a direct threat to his chances of winning in November.

Did you see Emily’s message? She’s rightly concerned about Trump’s blatant indifference towards funding the U.S. Postal Service – even though the agency has been providing critical deliveries throughout the pandemic and would ensure people are able to cast their ballot.
We can’t let Trump win and allow USPS to go insolvent – not with Americans’ health, civil rights, and jobs on the line:

It’s clear: Trump will stop at nothing to subvert the will of the voters come Election Day – including undermining the U.S. Postal Service, the agency that would allow MILLIONS of Americans to safely cast their vote by mail this November.
If Trump allows USPS to run out of funds, ALL three of these things could happen:
* 600,000 hard working Americans out of a job – when unemployment is at its highest.
* The delivery of critical supplies like medication would be impacted (during a global pandemic no less).
* And voters would be robbed of their right to mail in their ballot during the most consequential election of our lifetime.
Please, add your name to demand that Congress save the USPS and protect our ability to vote by mail.

* This is the biggest FEC deadline of the election — the last one before most voters cast their ballots.
* We will be reporting these fundraising numbers out to the public — where the media, political analysts, and the GOP will be looking to see where Democrats' grassroots strength stands.
* Trump is already watching us closely, and with the recent ratings shift toward Republicans from The Cook Political Report, we can't miss a beat.

Taking action has never been more important than it is right now.
Republicans expect us to just sit back as they rip away health care for millions of Americans (including more than 300,000 Nevadans), curtail reproductive rights, and push through an ultra conservative Supreme Court Justice weeks before Election Day.

When I spoke at the Democratic Convention four years ago, I said, “When Trump decided to run for president, he probably said to himself: ‘I’m an egomaniac. I don’t believe in science. I think women are inferior. Where would I feel at home?’ ”
Since that day, Trump has proved me right time and again. He has tried to reshape America in his own image – and he has made it clear he will stop at nothing to hold on to power.
The upcoming election is the most important in our lifetime and we must come together to elect Joe Biden and usher in big wins for Democrats up and down the ballot. Click here to join me in supporting NV Dems to make 2020 a change election.

From his failure to respond to COVID-19 to his attacks on healthcare and women’s rights to his systematic dismantling of voting rights – Donald Trump has proven he is unfit to lead this nation for another four years.
As the former Senate Majority Leader, I know firsthand the crucial role Nevada plays in the presidential election – and I am not alone. Even the Nevada GOP has admitted when campaigning in Nevada, Donald Trump is “playing on Biden’s field.”

Since his last visit to Nevada, Trump and at least 22 of his top advisors and inner circle have tested positive for COVID-19 after he held a superspreader event at the White House.

We hate to say it, but it looks like Trump’s smear campaign and lies against Democrats are working.
The Cook Political Report, a top election ratings site, updated its Electoral College rating and DOWNGRADED Nevada in Trump’s favor.
We’ve been talking about this for months: Nevada is a key battleground and Trump knows it. That’s why he held a dangerous indoor rally in our state this past weekend — he’s betting on Nevada to secure another four years in the White House.

Unfortunately, Trump’s underhanded tactics of lying to voters about the pandemic, election security, and so much more are starting to work — the numbers don’t lie.
But, they can change.
With ONLY 7 weeks to go, will you contribute $10 immediately and help us ensure Nevada elects Joe Biden and Kamala Harris?

Final Update via NVDems.com,info@e.nvdems.com,"November is coming, and FAST","Team, it’s clear: Trump has Nevada on the brain. Not only did he recently attack our Governor for securing mail-in-voting, but his bus tour visited Nevada for a campaign stop.
He’s obsessed with holding onto power and that means winning battleground states like ours.
And that’s not all. He also staged in-person campaign events in battleground state Wisconsin, failing once again like he did by holding a huge MAGA rally in Tulsa — leading to a spike in new COVID-19 cases.

We know the road to the White House runs right through Nevada. That means Trump and the GOP are prepared to spend BIG to create an innovative field program to energize their base and turn out voters to flip our state red.
That’s exactly why, as NV Dems Field Director, I’m relying on grassroots supporters to stand with us through the final 5 months of the election and make sure we can counter their big money.
By committing to a monthly contribution of $10 today, you are helping ensure we have the resources to go toe-to-toe with the GOP and sustain our own revamped field program:

We’ve grown our field team over the last few weeks, and although we’re not doing any face-to-face voter contact right now, we’re still working hard to protect the voice of the voter across Nevada and make sure we break turnout records in 2020.

Earlier this month, GOP Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel publicly said that Nevada was “in play” for Trump.
With Trump and his team focusing on Nevada as a critical state for his 2020 re-election, we’ve already seen national Republicans pour money into our state. We know this is just the start.
They have a war chest of more than $200 million to spend on the November election, and they are already using it to flood our state with operatives willing to do anything to win.

Donald Trump and the GOP have been ramping up their voter suppression tactics because they know they cannot win this election fair and square.
Turning out a historic number of Democrats is kind of our specialty here at NV Dems.
We did it earlier this year, smashing 2016 turnout numbers and delivering the most successful First in the West Caucus to date.
With your help, NV Dems mobilized 75% of all caucus-goers to take advantage of early voting locations across the state.
We can match and exceed these turnout levels again. But time is of the essence, and we need your grassroots push.

The results of our primary election this month speak for themselves.
* Democrats now have a 6% advantage among registered voters in Nevada over the GOP.
* Statewide, Democrats led in overall turnout by more than 16,000 votes.
* 66,000+ more Democrats participated in the 2020 primary election compared to the 2018 election — and over 110,000 more Democrats compared to 2016.

Mike Pence has been a rubber stamp for Trump’s reckless policies since day one.
He even took a page out of Trump’s playbook and was in Nevada TODAY to hold a MAGA bus tour stop –– spreading more hate and lies, and creating a COVID breeding ground.
As head of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, Pence has played a central role in enabling this administration to ignore science and medicine and put the American people at risk.
And now he’s bringing that harm right here to Nevada.
Less than four weeks to go to ensure the Trump/Pence Administration is a one-term ticket.

The Presidential and Vice Presidential debates reminded me what bold ideas and strong leadership look like (and what they don’t look like). I am so proud of where Democrats stand on critical issues like health care, reproductive rights, and climate change — we are pursuing progress and hope at every opportunity.
Donald Trump and Mike Pence, on the other hand, painted a darker and more sinister picture for our future. The country needs leaders who will champion progress — not incite fear and anger. Can I count on you to support my campaign and join me in the fight for progress?

The GOP knows how critical my seat is, which is why they’re concentrating their resources on flipping it. Rodimer and Trump make for a dangerous duo, and the thought of them governing together — as allies in Trump’s backwards vision for the country — is beyond terrifying.
We can still put a wedge in their dangerous and distorted vision for Nevada, but we have to act fast. What do you say?
Democrats like myself, Joe, and Kamala are prepared to fight for proactive change — but our opponents are relentless in their attacks.
With just a few weeks left until the election, Nevada Democrats up and down the ballot need your help to fight back, set the record straight, and make sure the GOP doesn’t carry out Trump’s dark plan for the country.

This is blatant voter suppression in our key battleground state and NV Dems needs your help to raise $20,000 immediately to keep up this fight:

Team, we wanted to make sure you knew about Trump’s latest attack on legislation to expand safe voting options in the upcoming election.
After repeated attacks on Twitter and in press briefings, the Trump Campaign filed a lawsuit this week challenging legislation Nevada passed to ensure voters could safely cast their ballots in our upcoming election.
But as we know, Trump is scared of expanding voting access – he knows his only hope of winning battleground states like Nevada and keeping control of the White House is to suppress as many voices as possible.
NV Dems is fighting tooth and nail to combat this administration’s corrupt efforts to silence voters, but we need your support.

All Trump and his GOP allies care about is winning the election — everyone else, even their own supporters, are nothing but collateral damage.
Hosting an in-person event with thousands of people, during a global health crisis, is beyond irresponsible. It is negligence on the part of a leader who has known for MONTHS just how dangerous this disease is.
We cannot afford another four years of a president who puts his own personal gain above the basic health and safety of the American people.

It's true: even contributing just $5 will help with our capacity to reach more than 10 voters.
Our state is a battleground and everyone knows it, including Trump.
On Tuesday the Trump campaign even admitted when campaigning in Nevada, they'll be ""playing on Joe Biden's field"".
That's why his team is pouring all their resources into spreading falsehoods and lies about Joe Biden and the Democratic party.
They will do whatever it takes to paint our state red — and usually, we would have our field staff ready to combat their misinformation campaigns by knocking on doors and talking to voters face to face.
But campaigning today is different from in the past, and we need your help to adjust to the new normal. Are you in?

Voting rights, healthcare, a woman’s right to choose, environmental protections -- they’re all on the chopping block.
Democrats in the Vermont Legislature are the only thing standing in the way of the U.S. Supreme Court taking away healthcare access for tens of thousands of Vermonters, a woman’s unfettered right to comprehensive reproductive health, the ability to vote easily and safely during a pandemic, and so much more here in Vermont. In the final week of the election, Vermont House Democrats need your help to make sure we return a strong Democratic majority to the Vermont House of Representatives on November 3rd.
Knowing that this day could come since Donald Trump was sworn in in 2016, House Democrats have taken the steps necessary to make sure that in Vermont healthcare remains protected, abortion remains legal and accessible, and voting is made easy.
During the 2019-2020 Legislative Biennium, House Democrats passed legislation to mail every registered voter a ballot in 2020 in order to keep voting safe and accessible during the pandemic, protected certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act should it get repealed, and guaranteed that reproductive rights remain protected through law and by a constitutional amendment.
We need your help to make sure a strong Democratic majority returns to the Vermont House on November 3rd. Democrats in the Vermont Legislature could be the only backstop to ensure that Vermonters remain protected from future, damning Supreme Court decisions.
This final week is our moment. Let’s make it count.

Dear Democrat,
With only a handful of months standing between us and a full scale general election, it's critical that our Party has the systems and resources in place to lift our Democratic candidates to victory before it's too late.
We cannot ignore the fact that this election is far too important to stop now. We may not be able to knock on doors or hold large rallies, but we can change how political campaigns are run. That means investing in virtual phone banking, digital organizing, peer-to-peer texting, and the staffing infrastructure needed to deploy new technologies. These tools and resources will be vital to our success this year, but we cannot Power Vermont Blue without your help.
As bad as things are now, if Donald Trump is re-elected in November and we lose strong Democrats in Vermont, things will get even worse, and our Country and State may not fully recover.
Will you help us Power VT Blue by joining the DEM Club today with a monthly recurring gift of $5, $10, or $25/month?  As we deploy our Power VT Blue grassroots campaign over the summer, having community leaders like yourself on board, makes all the difference!
As a member of the “Club"" you will receive an official “card carrying Vermont Democrat” card & commemorative campaign postcards, invitations to special events, and more! You can also designate 10% of your monthly contribution to your Democratic County Committee, House or Senate campaign.
Can we count on your to help Power VT Blue with a monthly recurring gift of $5, $10, or $25/month?
Donald Trump, Phil Scott, and his Republican allies up and down the ballot in Vermont are counting on millions of out of state contributions. In order to fight back, we need your support now more than ever -- become a DEM Club member, make a one-time donation, and/or volunteer today!
Thank you,

October 16, 2020
Welcome to Weekly Roundup, where every Friday we’ll break down the week’s political happenings and offer our take on the news of the week.
In this week’s Roundup: Vermont’s U.S. Senators are well positioned to lead post election, Phil Scott has not succeeded in making Vermont more affordable, Zuckerman release campaign ad, Leahy calls SCOTUS nomination illegitimate, Pearce receives support across party lines, and updates from the Vermont Democratic Party's efforts across the state.

🏛 ON THE HILL
LEAHY CALLS SUPREME COURT NOMINATION PROCESS 'ILLEGITIMATE'
VT DIGGER: ""Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., denounced Republican lawmakers who are poised to approve President Trump’s nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court, a process he called illegitimate and a “callous political grab.”
""Leahy’s comments came on Thursday, the final day of the Supreme Court confirmation hearings for Judge Amy Coney Barrett.
“This is a caricature of illegitimacy,” Leahy said. “That we had a nominee before Justice Ginsburg was even buried — in order to jam this nomination through before the election will forever mark this process as the callous political grab that it is.”
""Democrats have also criticized Judiciary Committee Chair Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and other committee Republicans for pushing Barrett’s nomination process, when they refused to grant a hearing for Merrick Garland, former President Barack Obama’s last pick for the Supreme Court."" [10.15.20]

🏛 ON THE HILL
KEVIN ELLIS: VERMONT SENATORS ARE WELL POSITIONED
VT DIGGER: ""If Democrats take over the Senate — and that’s a fair bet — Leahy and Sanders become chairs of two powerful committees that control federal spending in this country. Leahy has chaired committees over the years, has been president pro tempore of the Senate and is that body’s most senior member.
""As the ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, he is next in line to chair that panel. That means Leahy would have control of the federal budget and oversee the budgets of every federal department: the Pentagon, Homeland Security, the CDC, agriculture subsidies, National Endowment for the Arts, public broadcasting. You get the picture. It is the most powerful, least sexy role in government. But it means Vermont would be in line for major influxes of federal spending, or at least not be left out. Leahy has toiled for decades with the Appropriations machinery, chairing subcommittees and making sure federal dollars come to Vermont for land conservation, historic preservation and other things we value.
""If Trump wins the election and the Senate is controlled by Democrats, the White House will have to negotiate with Patrick Leahy. I would pay for that seat.
""Whatever happens, if a Democratic wave hits the U.S. Senate, get ready for Vermont’s two senators to gain an immense amount of power. And they know how to use it."" [10.13.20]

🎙 THE BRIEFING ROOM:
ICYMI: HAS PHIL SCOTT MADE VERMONT MORE AFFORDABLE?
RELEASE \-- Last week, Seven Days released an extensive article looking at the affordability of Vermont after four years with Phil Scott as Governor. Topics of wages, health care, child care, housing, and paid family leave were all addressed. The article sheds light on what Vermonters already know; Vermont is not more affordable because of Governor Scott and too many Vermonters are struggling to meet their basic needs.
""Affordability has become one of those buzzwords that is used by many to lead into a discussion about very predictable issues: 'It's unaffordable. We have to cut taxes,'"" said state Auditor Doug Hoffer, a Democrat/Progressive. ""But for people at the low end, taxes are not a big deal at all."" The actual cost drivers, he maintains, are housing, health care and — for those with young kids — childcare. ""Those are the things I wish we had more conversation about,'' Hoffer said.
“The real threat to affordability, according to House Speaker Mitzi Johnson (D-South Hero) is the slow growth of wages, the rise in income inequality and the concentration of wealth in the hands of the few. ""What we are seeing overall in Vermont and nationwide is that people who have more are getting more, and that gap is widening and growing,"" she said.”
In fact, this can be clearly seen in the example of the paid family leave bill Phil Scott vetoed during the legislative session. “According to Speaker Johnson, Scott had it backward. ""For the governor, it wasn't affordable because it had a very small tax in it that was shared across all Vermonters,"" she said. ""For me, that was a critical step to affordability for the many, many Vermonters who cannot afford a $500 emergency.""
“Hoffer, the state auditor, takes issue with the administration's methodology, which only considers out-of-pocket health care costs — and does not take into account childcare, transportation or food costs. Kavet, the legislature's economist, notes that ""averages can be very misleading.""
""People have no cushion left,"" said John Sayles, CEO of the Vermont Foodbank. ""And even if COVID were to go away and the economy were to turn around tomorrow, it's going to take a long time for people to build that cushion up.""
In a global pandemic, with crushing costs of living, preventing taxes from rising is not enough to provide the support Vermonters need to thrive. Phil Scott and his allies in the Legislature have not made Vermont more affordable. In fact, he has stonewalled and vetoed most of the legislation that would have brought Vermonters stability and prepared the state for the current crisis. [10.15.20]

ZUCKERMAN FOR VT RELEASES VISION NOT VETOES CAMPAIGN AD
RELEASE: ""Zuckerman for VT campaign released a new tv ad. The ad, titled “Vision not Vetoes,” highlights the discrepancy between Vermonters’ opinions on climate change, paid family leave, and our Vermont state colleges with the Governor’s vetoes and lack of budgetary support on these issues. The ad then highlights Lt. Governor Zuckerman as the choice for Vermonters in this critical election.
""The campaign shared the tv ad with its followers on social media stating: “We need a Vermont governor with vision, not a governor who vetoes... help David flip Vermont and unseat the governor who has blocked paid family leave, pay increases for struggling Vermonters, and climate change legislation.

BETH PEARCE SOUND CHOICE TO BE VT. TREASURER
MESSENGER: ""I am a life long Republican, a former town committee chairman and member of the State Republican Committee and I will be voting for Beth Pearce in November. The Treasurer needs to be non-partisan and Treasurer Pearce has done just that. She served as Deputy Treasurer for 8 years prior to being elected State Treasurer. She isn't a career politician, instead she has dedicated her life to public service. Her leadership at the Treasurer's office has been unmatched and the proof is during this crisis the state hasn't had to borrow money, this was in large part to her and Governor Scott's leadership. What we need now more than ever is to stay the course and that is why we need Beth Pearce to remain State Treasurer. --Joe Sinagra"" [10.16.20]

LEAHY TO BARR: HALT EFFORTS TO GUT THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IN COURT
VERMONT BIZ: Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vermont), the former Chairman and longest serving member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, along with 19 other Senators, on Wednesday sent a letter to Attorney General William Barr, urging the Department of Justice (DOJ) to rescind its support of the Supreme Court lawsuit that seeks to invalidate the Affordable Care Act (ACA).
In the letter, the Senators spotlight how health insurance protections for millions of Americans are at stake in light of the current Supreme Court nomination fight and the ways in which health insurers could discriminate against millions more people who contract COVID-19 if the pre-existing protections in the ACA are gutted.
""We urge the Department of Justice to immediately rescind its support of the lawsuit in California v. Texas asking the Supreme Court to declare the ACA unconstitutional and invalidate the law in its entirety,"" wrote the lawmakers. ""Passed in 2010, the ACA dramatically expanded the number of Americans with health insurance. Destroying this progress and ripping away critical protections is cruel on its face. Looking to do so in the midst of a nearly unprecedented public health emergency — a COVID-19 pandemic that has claimed over 220,000 American lives and infected over 8 million people — is especially unconscionable.""

VERMONT CONGRESSMAN DISCUSSES FEDERAL PANDEMIC ASSISTANCE DURING CHAMBER FORUM
WAMC: ”The Vermont Chamber of Commerce has launched a Virtual Policy Series that features business and government leaders answering questions from members and other chambers across the state. Its initial meeting on Monday featured at-large Congressman Peter Welch discussing federal pandemic assistance efforts.
“About 100 people registered for the meeting with the Democrat. About a quarter represented the state’s hospitality industry, another quarter were from business services and organizations and the rest were from manufacturing, higher education and retail.
“Congressman Welch began by praising the state for having the lowest COVID infection rate in the country. He then discussed the economic repercussions of the pandemic, saying the federal CARES Act passed because the economic price of the pandemic was obvious. He said it’s now crucial to complete negotiations on the next aid bill. House Democrats passed the HEROES Act in May. “Here’s the challenge. We’re seven months in. The money from the CARES program is dried up and we need to take the next step. We’re borrowing money and I’m a pay-as-you-go person but this is a once in a hundred year event. And my goal is to try to make certain through the assistance that only the federal government can provide that these Vermont businesses that when we get to the other side of COVID you’ll come with us.” [10.20.20]

🎙 THE BRIEFING ROOM:
PHIL SCOTT, SCOTT MILNE AND THE VERMONT REPUBLICAN BRAND
RELEASE \-- Phil Scott claims he has never run a negative campaign, but his television ad partner Scott Milne has run nothing but negative campaigns. Milne, running his third statewide race focused on attacking his opponents, has doubled down on his twice failed strategy of negative campaigning by retaining the services of known “nasty” campaigner Jim Barnett.
“Jim Barnett returns to Vermont politics, putting his ‘nasty’ touch on Milne’s campaign” reported VTDigger. The story notes Barnett’s infatuation with well known Republican attack dogs, Lee Atwater and Karl Rove, best known for their race baiting and personal destruction approach to politics.
With him, Jim Barnett brought Harris Media to help Scott Milne. Harris Media is known for its work with Mitch McConnell in the United States as well as Marie Le Pen and far right groups in Europe. In fact, VTDigger noted “The personal attacks on Gray…coincided with Milne hiring Jim Barnett.”
While Phil Scott remains silent, others have called out Milne and Barnett’s negative campaigning. In its endorsement of Molly Gray for Lt. Governor, The Addison Independent noted:
“While Gray has tried to focus on substantive issues that will shape Vermont’s future, Milne’s campaign has done the opposite — waging, instead, what some have called one of the “nastiest, negative campaigns” in recent history, and somewhat akin to President Trump’s tactics…While Milne says he won’t vote for Trump, he’s happy to take the money and, he said, be associated with those Republican causes.”
With each of these ads, Scott Milne is cementing his Republican brand as a negative campaigner who focuses on personal attacks. Phil Scott, standing by his side, is giving his seal of approval for the worst brand of Republican politics. [10.23.20]

VERMONT SIERRA CLUB ENDORSES ZUCKERMAN, GRAY, AND OTHER CANDIDATES
VT DIGGER: “The Vermont Sierra Club announced today that it has endorsed Molly Gray for Lieutenant Governor, after already endorsing David Zuckerman (See our Gubernatorial announcement), Beth Pearce, TJ. Donovan, Jim Condos, and Doug Hoffer. The Vermont Chapter also announced the complete list of legislative endorsements. This follows a months-long process of candidate research, interviews, and research. Congressman Peter Welch was endorsed previously, in action taken by the national Sierra Club Board of Directors, following a recommendation by the state chapter.
“In Vermont, we are lucky to have an abundance of great leaders who are committed to pursuing our shared values of caring for our planet and working towards a just and equitable society,” said Rachel Stevens, Chair of Sierra Club Vermont. “We are facing many crises at once, over ensuring racial justice, keeping our state healthy in the face of the pandemic, and numerous environmental crises, all in times of great economic challenges. We need the intelligent and creative leadership this team can provide.” [10.20.20]

MEET MOLLY GRAY, DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE FOR VERMONT LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR
MY CHAMPLAIN VALLEY: “An assistant attorney general, Gray said she decided to run for the office last winter. A lot has changed since then, but Gray says her background and political experience have prepared her for the job, even in a pandemic.
“I’ve worked in crisis,” she said, adding that her global relief efforts as a former member of the Red Cross could fare well in navigating a global pandemic. “We have a lot of human need here in the state.”
“Vermont is one of the oldest states in the country,” she said. “We have more deaths than births in a majority of Vermont counties and we are struggling to keep a generation here, bring a generation back. Our tax base continues to shrink. It’s the other big crisis that we face beyond this pandemic.”
“My goal is to unify our state across generations, across backgrounds,” she said, “and really try to bring us together as we try to address some of these challenges that we have to be united in addressing, — broadband, childcare, workforce development, racial injustice and climate change.” [10.23.20]
