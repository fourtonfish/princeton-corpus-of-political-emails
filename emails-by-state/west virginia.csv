Dear Alex,
With only days remaining in the regular legislative session, Senate Bill 733 faces defeat if it fails to get through the House Judiciary committee, despite having already passed overwhelmingly in the Senate.
Our bill has quad-partisan support. Senators Ihlenfeld (D) and Trump (R) introduced the legislation, in addition with support from the Libertarian Party.
Our bill is critical for ballot access, as it allows a party‚Äôs candidate for president to maintain a party‚Äôs ballot access if they receive 1% of the vote statewide. Currently, qualification only occurs with candidates for Governor.
For more information on the bill, click here.

June 20, 2020 | [[URL REDACTED]] | For Immediate Release:
## Mountain Party Nominates Danny Lutz For Governor
(WEST VIRGINIA ‚Äî June 20, 2020) The West Virginia Mountain Party today nominated Daniel P. ‚ÄúDanny‚Äù Lutz for Governor at its biennial State Convention, which was conducted via Zoom video conferencing. The convention was originally planned to be held in Braxton County.
Re-elected on the June 9th election, Lutz has served as Conservation District Supervisor for the Eastern Panhandle, representing Jefferson County since 2016. Lutz, a retired Air Force Major, is one of two elected Conservation District Supervisors who are active members of the Mountain Party.
Former Mayor of Ranson and Former President of the Jefferson County Commission, Gregory Lance, was nominated for Jefferson County Sheriff. Other candidates nominated by convention include Donald Kinnie for State Senate (15), Robert E. Smith for House of Delegates (59), and Mary Kinnie for House of Delegates (60).
Nominated by primary election include Steve Hamilton for House of Delegates, seeking one of four seats, in the 48th District and David Tabb for Jefferson County Assessor, where no Republican filed to run for office.
Business addressed by the party included officer elections and amending party documents. Amendments were adopted to the bylaws to clearly affirm the party‚Äôs identity as West Virginia‚Äôs Green Party, in addition to updating its membership structure and nominating procedure. The convention was recessed to address platform amendments in the near future.
The timing of the State Convention coincides with a major announcement from the Howie Hawkins / Angela Walker campaign for President and Vice President. Today the ticket has clinched enough delegates to secure the Green Party nomination and will be on the ballot in West Virginia on the ‚ÄúMountain‚Äù ballot line.

Dear Alex,
Thank you for supporting a progressive vision for West Virginia. This year we have the opportunity to build bridges and create coalitions, so our shared vision can one day become reality.
To truly be a people-powered party, your input and involvement is necessary. Our party can reach new heights only through member participation. Along these lines, we are working to breathe new life into local chapters, and plan to have regularly scheduled public meetings across the state. We hope to have this going in the Eastern Panhandle and other regions within the coming weeks.
Our party has turned a new leaf, and it is exciting to see the progress made even within the past several months.
We hope you stay connected and help shape our party, as we enter a new decade.
Respectfully,
State Executive Committee
Mountain Party of West Virginia
# New Year, New Party
With a new year, comes new commitment to build and improve the Mountain Party of West Virginia. In previous years, we have faced many difficult challenges. Last year, new leadership began to make necessary reforms. Some of the actions included:
* Adopting a candidate pledge
* Building a new website and communications infrastructure
* Drafting revised ballot access legislation
* Updating branding and social media
This is just the beginning. We aim to improve accountability within the party and heighten candidate standards. We will explore different approaches to organizing, for more effective outreach. Additionally, we will review our electoral strategy for the new decade.

# 2020 Call For Candidates

We are encouraging West Virginians everywhere to step up and run for office. Seats around the state are up for election, including for board of education and conservation district supervisor. Local level races are winnable, with a foundation of local Mountain officeholders to achieve even bigger wins in the future.
