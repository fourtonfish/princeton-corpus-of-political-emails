John March,jmarch@rpv.org,FWD:. RPV Statement on Dictatorial Mask Mandate,"Richmond, VA
Email not displaying correctly? View it in your browser.
Friend,
Did you see this press release from the Republican Party of Virginia? It's shameful how Ralph Northam and the Democrats have abused their power and attacked your freedom & liberty.
Will you join me in sending the Democrats a message? The RPV has extended its fundraising deadline until midnight tonight - they only need 36 more patriots to give just $15 so they can tell Ralph Northam that Republicans are kicking the Democrats out of office this November!

RPV Statement on Dictatorial Mask Mandate
Richmond, VA - Republican Party of Virginia Chairman, Jack Wilson, issued the following statement in response to Governor Ralph Northam's dictatorial mask mandate:
""Governor Northam's latest edict infringes on the freedoms and liberties of the citizens of Virginia. This nation was founded as a direct rebuttal of tyrannical, authoritarian rule from those who thought themselves suited to govern a land to which they had no real connection. Ralph Northam appears to have forgotten that.
""Maybe our tune would be different if Governor Northam had not been caught just this weekend in a crowded public area with no mask and no regard for social distancing. While this administration's COVID-19 response has been defined by its unforced errors, this is the first time it has turned them back on suffering Virginians. Will those without masks be able to tell Big Brother that they 'forgot it in the car'? How are we supposed to take this man seriously?
""Even the roll-out of this mandate was bungled and has raised more questions than it has answered. First, Northam told us it was more of a recommendation than an order. Then we find out that failing to comply is a class one misdemeanor.
""In a time of crisis, Ralph Northam has failed. He has failed our seniors in long term assisted living facilities. He has failed thousands of small business owners. He has failed Virginia's minority communities. He has failed our students. He has failed every single Virginian. This Commonwealth used to be a leader in this nation and a shining example of what a state should be. Governor Northam has turned it into a third-rate mess.""

Alex,
I'll get straight to the point. We must pass Amendment 1 (the Redistricting Commission Amendment) to the Virginia Constitution this year.
What's the Redistricting Commission Amendment? A ""YES"" vote supports transferring the power to draw legislative districts in the General Assembly and Congress from the partisan state legislature to a bipartisan redistricting commission composed of an equal number of state legislators and citizens.
Voting ""YES"" means that our legislative districts will be drawn fairly—without smoke-filled back rooms, political maneuvers, and partisan gerrymanders.
Can you chip in $10 to make sure we can get the word out to all Virginians about just how important voting ""YES"" on Amendment 1 is?

Let’s let citizens—not Richmond partisans—draw fair legislative maps in 2021 and beyond!

Alex,
You probably saw the damage and destruction that the so-called ""tolerant"" left did to our office on Friday—the same thugs whose enablers in the General Assembly Democrat Caucus are implementing a pro-criminal/anti-police agenda and have trampled our 2A rights. Look what the headquarters of the Republican Party in Virginia looks like now. Is this somewhere you would want to go to volunteer? Make calls? Pick up yard signs or bumper stickers?
>> Help Us Clean Up Virginia <<
I consider this a personal attack on millions of Virginia Republicans who have called RPV HQ their political home for four decades.
So while we're cleaning up the office, you can clean up Virginia by re-electing President Trump, electing Daniel Gade to the U.S. Senate, and electing 11 great Republicans to the U.S. House.
Can you chip in just $15 or even $25 to show the radical and violent liberals that your voice and vote will be heard, no matter what?

The damage and destruction you saw on Friday isn't stopping anytime soon. Only until every last Democrat is kicked out of office here in Virginia will the madness finally stop. And after that, we’ll have a new Republican majority in the House and Senate in 2021 that will repeal every single bill that the extremist left passed in 2020. It's up to you.

The first Presidential debate is not scheduled until September 29th, at which 8 MILLION Americans in 16 STATES could have already voted in the Election.

Join other Virginians and DEMAND the Debate Commission to move the FIRST debate to the first week of September and add a FOURTH debate.
If the Commission wants to prove their legitimacy to the American people, they MUST comply with our demand to move the first debate up AND add a fourth debate. It’s time Joe Biden steps out of his basement and debates with President Donald J. Trump.
We’ve just launched our Official Debate Commission Accountability Survey, and the President wants to know what YOU think.

DONATE
It's been nearly 50 years since Joe Biden was first elected. Here's a quick rundown:
* On health care, Biden’s “public option” is a step towards a government takeover of health care, which would slowly kill Americans’ private insurance plans.
* Now Biden is pushing a far-left agenda that makes Bernie Sanders and The Squad blush.
* Biden wants to “absolutely” defund the police and he doesn’t think the $93 trillion Green New Deal goes too far. After all, the coronavirus is an “opportunity” to “transform” the economy with the GND.
* Note: Biden’s energy agenda would eliminate 19 MILLION jobs and reduce our GDP by $7.1 TRILLION.
* Biden also wants to hike taxes on the American people by $4 TRILLION and his tax agenda would raise taxes on 82% of middle-class Americans.
America can not afford to put him in the White House, which is why we're reaching out to you. Can you give in the next 45 minutes and get your donation matched 2.5X?

Meanwhile, Virginia Democrats Elaine Luria - (D-VA02), Abigail Spanberger (D-VA07), and Jennifer Wexton (D-VA10) have yet to say whether they’ll stand by their endorsement of Biden amidst allegations of sexual assault.
REMINDER: Luria and Spanberger don’t have a great track record in the #MeToo era. Both of them believe Lt. Gov Justin Fairfax is a serial rapist but haven’t returned his money.
Remember when they gave Brett Kavanaugh the benefit of a doubt? Me neither. That's why you need to send a message: Virginia will not stand for hypocrisy.
We have until midnight tonight to raise $10,000 to start a Take Back the House Task Force dedicated to winning back VA02, VA07, and VA10. If everyone that receives this email chips in just $10, we'll meet our goal.

We all heard it. Last night during the debate, Joe Biden said he would ""eliminate Trump's tax cuts.""
Do you know what that means? It means that your taxes will be higher. Your paycheck will be smaller. Prices will go up and wages will go down. Can you afford that?

Dear Fellow Virginia Republicans,
Yesterday, Virginians from across the Commonwealth gathered in our first-ever unassembled RPV State Convention for a time-honored task: To elect Republicans to senior positions of party leadership.
As we turn from party elections to the task of electing our great Republicans to federal office, I wish to express my sincere thanks to my fellow Republicans for placing their trust in me to serve as your state party chairman. I pledge to you that I will devote every degree of mind, spirit, and energy that I possess to the long-range interests of our party—and to the essential mission of electing Republicans and defeating Democrats.
On behalf of RPV and our 126 local Republican units, I express our appreciation to Chairman Jack Wilson for his devoted service to our party in multiple leadership positions at the unit, district, state, and national levels.
I am especially grateful to those who offered themselves as candidates, and I congratulate those who have assumed positions of senior leadership in our party. Congratulations on a job well done to National Committeeman Morton Blackwell, National Committeewoman Patti Bast Lyman, Elector E. W. Jackson, and Elector John Selph. You have distinguished yourselves, and all Virginia Republicans are proud of you.
With party elections behind us, we now turn our full energies to re-electing President Trump, electing Daniel Gade to the U.S. Senate, and electing 11 great Republicans to the U.S. House. We are at a critical crossroads in the life of our Commonwealth and country, and it is imperative that Virginia Republicans elect and send these outstanding leaders to Washington next January.
And so, let us begin by recapturing our party’s will to fight and win, confident in the conviction that we take up this fight for our families—and for our future as a free people.
I truly look to the future of the Republican Party of Virginia with great confidence—not because I have been chosen as party chairman, but because of all of you who daily demonstrate your love of Commonwealth and country.
Let us begin by rededicating ourselves to the belief that IT’S TIME TO FIGHT AND WIN AGAIN!
In Victory,
Rich Anderson

Alex, I won't lie to you, Mark Warner is building a war chest.
He and his ultra-wealthy liberal friends are pouring money into Virginia to try and silence your conservative voice. He's recruiting all the usual suspects in his fight against your freedom: Terry McAuliffe, the Clintons, George Soros, etc.
Don't let Mark Warner silence your voice. Will you commit just $15 by midnight tonight and raise your voice for freedom & liberty?

Alex, things are getting out of control. This country is at a turning point, and it needs your attention.
When you call 9-1-1, you expect help, right? Apparently that's not the case anymore. As you just watched, Democrats in big cities have completely caved to mob rule and will even go so far as to apologize to the protesters - not the scared mother and daughter \- for what's happening.
We need you to take a stand. Are you on the side of law and order? Will you elect Republicans that pledge to support our country's law enforcement officers?
Contribute
You and I know that the Republican Party is made up of millions of grassroots activists just like you - we don't have ultra-wealthy mega-donors that can write million dollar checks like the Democrats. That's why Republicans need your help.

Alex - Republicans DOMINATED local elections in Virginia yesterday.
* FLIPPED Staunton
* SWEPT Chesapeake
* TOPPED Fairfax City
* WON in Vienna
* TOOK OVER Radford
* FLIPPED Waynesboro
* ADVANCED in Lynchburg
But, you already knew this. You knew this because you were there in 2016 when the largest grassroots movement in U.S. history shocked the world. You were there at the Second Amendment rally this year in Richmond, and you will be there when we take back Virginia in November.
Without YOU, none of this is possible. I truly believe that we can flip Virginia red this year and deliver the Old Dominion for President Trump. When we do, I want you to know that you made the difference.
Take a day - soak in these Republican victories on our city councils and school boards. But tomorrow, it will be time to strap up again and fight to Keep America Great!
I know you can do it.
In Victory,
Jack R. Wilson, III

The General Assembly is voting tomorrow to END qualified immunity for law enforcement officers. That means the men and women protecting your neighborhood will no longer have their own protection.
We need you to call Democrat State Senator Chap Petersen at (804) 698-7534 & (703) 349-3361 AND your own State Senator (click here to find your Senator's contact information) TONIGHT and leave a message in support of qualified immunity for law enforcement officers.
Tell them you are a proud Virginia citizen and that you DEMAND that all State Senators vote NO on House Bill 5013. Tell them to stop trying to strip protections away from those who protect us.
State Senator Petersen is thought to be a SWING VOTER on this bill tomorrow - he needs to know how REAL Virginia feels.
Our law enforcement officers need YOUR help. Call tonight and keep calling until we defeat this bill!

Alex, last week, establishment Democrats went on the record as saying they OPPOSE fair, constitutional redistricting. Do you know what that means?
The Democrats are going to redraw the districts for the House of Delegates, State Senate, and U.S. Congress to benefit other Democrats and draw Republicans into nothingness. That's textbook gerrymandering, and it's not what the Democrats supported when they were in the minority.
But we're going to fight back. We're going to fight them in the press, we're going to fight them in court, and we're going to fight them at the ballot box. We need your help to get that done.

DO NOT DEFUND THE POLICE
The Democratic Party has officially turned the corner into full blown insanity, with the ""Defund the Police"" movement going from the radical fringes to a Democrat purity test almost overnight.
The mayors of New York City and Los Angeles have promised to slash their police budgets amid violent riots and looting in their cities. And the Minneapolis City Council has gone even further, with a veto-proof majority of members pledging to eliminate the police entirely, and a member of the council telling residents that if their home is broken into in the middle of the night they should check their privilege.

Today, the Republican Party of Virginia officially demanded the resignation of Richmond mayor, Levar Stoney.
Stoney has driven this once great city straight into the ground. He's allowed riots, looting, and chaos while at the same time firing his chief of police and keeping law-abiding citizens locked-down over coronavirus ""concerns"".
Can you chip in to make sure Stoney gets this message and resigns for the good of Virginia?
CHIP IN
We can't do this without you.

Alex,
I'm sure you saw my email last night, but I wanted to make sure I got a chance to introduce myself. My name is Rich Anderson and on Saturday, I was elected Chairman of the Republican Party of Virginia.
The Democrats are already coming after you and me. As you know, the DNC Convention started today, and they're already promising radically liberal changes to this country. They're going to implement their socialist agenda, eliminate the Second Amendment, and raise your taxes if Republicans don't win in November.
Can you chip in to help the RPV fight back against the Democrats and their radical agenda?
DONATE
It's a new day. I need your help to turn this state around and make Virginia WIN again.
Best Regards,
Rich Anderson

That means we have just 12 weeks to tell voters about President Trump, Daniel Gade, and all of our fantastic Congressional candidates.
I'll be blunt - we can't do it without your help. That's why I'm offering you a chance to WIN with the Republican Party of Virginia. Can you commit to giving $4, $6, or even $10 a week until Election Day?
CLICK HERE TO WIN
For the equivalent of just one dollar per day, you can do your part to ensure that Republicans are elected up and down the ballot here in Virginia. That's less than a cup of coffee or a newspaper.
Experts are saying Virginia is a targeted state for both presidential campaigns, so every little bit helps. Don't let the Democrats buy our state anymore.

RPV Chairman Rich Anderson,info@rpv.org,Save the date!,"2020 Annual RPV Advance
Email not displaying correctly? View it in your browser.
Alex,
After conducting an email survey and tabulating results of Virginia Republicans who attended our RPV Advances over the last three years, we have determined that we will host the 37th Annual Donald W. Huffman RPV Advance on the weekend of December 4-6 at The Homestead Resort in Hot Springs, VA. Accordingly, please mark your calendars for a fun-filled and productive weekend in southwest Virginia at a premier resort that knows how to do it up right during the Christmas and holiday seasons!
The majority of respondents wished to move forward with a traditional RPV Advance, a result that aligned with what I and members of the State Central Committee (SCC) Executive Committee have heard during our travels across Virginia and our 11 Congressional Districts in recent months. During the unusual circumstances of the current COVID-19 environment, The Homestead Resort has cooperated with us in unprecedented ways by waiving traditional minimums for the number of attendees, meals, and lodging rooms, which greatly minimizes our financial risk during this period of unpredictability. Additionally, The Homestead staff is working with us to employ, as a number of you requested in your survey responses, common-sense social distancing and hygiene precautions that respect the current COVID-19 environment.
Hosting this year’s RPV Advance at The Homestead Resort is an opportune time for us to reflect on the results of the 2020 federal elections and position us for the all-important state and local elections where we will elect a new Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Attorney General, and 100 members of the Virginia House of Delegates. I and the newly-seated SCC are committed to achieving electoral victories in 2021, and we surely need the presence and vision of our grassroots Republican leaders from across Virginia—all of you—to make that happen.
In a nutshell, our weekend in Hot Springs will consist of hospitality suites, working meals, general session meetings, breakout sessions, and the inaugural meeting of our newly-seated State Central Committee (the governing body of RPV), where we will tackle an agenda of meaty issues that will set the stage for the next four years.
The RPV Committee on Arrangements, which is tasked with the planning and execution of the 2020 RPV Advance, is hard at work and has already met on multiple occasions to craft an agenda for our annual get-together. This year’s Advance will include many of the traditional events that you’ve come to know over the years, but the committee is also looking at a number of innovations that we believe will make your presence in Hot Springs productive and worthwhile.
You may consider this notification to be the first of many communications that we will share with you as we move closer to December and the 2020 RPV Advance. In the near future, we will roll out a page on the RPV website and populate it with information on a regular basis as we firm up details of the Advance.
As I approach two months as RPV Chair, I want you to know how much I have valued this opportunity to serve all of you and our great Republican Party of Virginia. I look forward to great successes in the years ahead because of the dedicated and focused work of our grassroots Republicans who do the hard work of winning elections across our Commonwealth. Since my election on August 15th, I have put nearly 5,000 miles on my car visiting local units and events hosted by the Trump 2020 Victory Team and by our candidates for the U.S. Senate and House. During that time, I have been truly amazed by the devotion of Virginia Republicans to the principles of our party and the urgent necessity of electing Republicans to office up and down the ticket.
In that spirit, I and Team RPV highly value your views, the work you have done throughout 2020, and the epic work that you will do in 2021 to elect Republicans to all three offices in the Executive Branch of state government and to the Virginia House of Delegates. The 2020 RPV Advance will be a critical first step in that journey to electoral successes, and I and your SCC look forward to welcoming you to Hot Springs on the weekend of December 4-6, 2020!
Fellow Virginia Republicans, LET’S FIGHT AND WIN AGAIN!

RPV Statement on Dictatorial Mask Mandate
Richmond, VA - Republican Party of Virginia Chairman, Jack Wilson, issued the following statement in response to Governor Ralph Northam's dictatorial mask mandate:
""Governor Northam's latest edict infringes on the freedoms and liberties of the citizens of Virginia. This nation was founded as a direct rebuttal of tyrannical, authoritarian rule from those who thought themselves suited to govern a land to which they had no real connection. Ralph Northam appears to have forgotten that.
""Maybe our tune would be different if Governor Northam had not been caught just this weekend in a crowded public area with no mask and no regard for social distancing. While this administration's COVID-19 response has been defined by its unforced errors, this is the first time it has turned them back on suffering Virginians. Will those without masks be able to tell Big Brother that they 'forgot it in the car'? How are we supposed to take this man seriously?
""Even the roll-out of this mandate was bungled and has raised more questions than it has answered. First, Northam told us it was more of a recommendation than an order. Then we find out that failing to comply is a class one misdemeanor.
""In a time of crisis, Ralph Northam has failed. He has failed our seniors in long term assisted living facilities. He has failed thousands of small business owners. He has failed Virginia's minority communities. He has failed our students. He has failed every single Virginian. This Commonwealth used to be a leader in this nation and a shining example of what a state should be. Governor Northam has turned it into a third-rate mess.""

It's time. Senate Democrats like Mark Warner must stop playing partisan games with the highest court in the land.

Can you chip in and help kick Mark Warner OUT of office?
This offer won't last long and Election Day is only THREE WEEKS away. There is no time to waste.
We only have three weeks between us and a possible Biden-Harris administration. It's up to all of us to win Virginia for President Trump.

* TOOK OVER Radford
* FLIPPED Waynesboro
* ADVANCED in Lynchburg

Without YOU, none of this is possible. I truly believe that we can flip Virginia red this year and deliver the Old Dominion for President Trump. When we do, I want you to know that you made the difference.

* Signed the biggest package of tax cuts and reforms in history.
* Confirmed Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch and confirmed Justice Brett Kavanaugh.

You've probably heard the news, but I wanted to tell you myself: our 2020 State Convention has officially been rescheduled. Details can be found on our website ([[URL REDACTED]]).
It's time to turn over a new leaf in Virginia. For far too long, the Democrats have been able to run all over our Commonwealth. That stops this year. These are my promises to you, and it starts right here at our State Convention:
* Win Virginia for President Trump!
* Elect Daniel Gade and kick Mark Warner out of the U.S. Senate
* Re-elect Rob Wittman in VA01
* Elect Scott Taylor and kick Elaine Luria out of VA02
* Elect John Collick and kick Bobby Scott out of VA03
* Elect Leon Benjamin and kick Don McEachin out of VA04
* Elect Bob Good and keep VA05 red
* Re-elect Ben Cline in VA06
* Kick Abigail Spanberger out of VA07 once we have our nominee next week
* Elect Jeff Jordan and kick Don Beyer out of VA08
* Re-elect Morgan Griffith in VA09
* Elect Aliscia Andrews and kick Jennifer Wexton out of VA10
* Elect Manga Anantatmula and kick Gerry Connolly out of VA11
* PUT A REPUBLICAN IN EVERY RACE IN 2021
We can accomplish all of these, but not without you. I talked to President Trump's team, and they helped me set up a money bomb for the Convention. Can you commit to chip in $20.20 today AND $20.20 at the State Convention?

Alex, I'll be blunt; the Republican Party of Virginia needs your help.
We're trying to recruit candidates to run in every single race, but some of them want to see a surge in activist support before committing. They've said they need to see the Republican Party get 500 donations by midnight TOMORROW to show how great the grassroots really is.
Contribute
Luckily, other Virginia Republicans have stepped up to the plate and we're so close to reaching our goal!
Can you commit to donating just $10 to show that Virginia Republicans have incredible grassroots energy?

Election Day is less than two weeks away, and we want to tell you a little bit about our incredible U.S. Senate candidate, Daniel Gade.
CLICK TO HELP ELECT DANIEL GADE >>
Dr. Daniel Gade is a retired U.S. Army lieutenant colonel, professor, and public policy leader running to serve the Commonwealth of Virginia in the U.S. Senate. During more than 20 years of military service, he was awarded the Legion of Merit, Bronze Star, and two Purple Hearts.
There is no person more qualified to represent Virginia in the U.S. Senate than Daniel Gade. That's why we're reaching out and asking for you to chip in to help elect him!

Mark Warner has gone off the deep end. He has fully embraced the Democrat Party's radical agenda of defunding the police, raising taxes, and eliminating your individual liberties.
The choice is clear, and it's up to you to make that choice.

For years, Democrats have been encouraging the violence while Biden has made the laughable claim that looters and rioters are merely “peaceful protesters.”
* Kamala Harris said protesters “should not” let up.
* Nancy Pelosi said Republicans are “domestic enemies...enemies of the state.”
* Maxine Waters encouraged Democrats, “If you see anybody from that cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you get out and you create a crowd, and you push back on them, and you tell them they’re not welcome anymore, anywhere.”
* And Joe Biden is not without fault, suggesting that, “We’re going to make [President Trump] feel the pain.”

Not only do Biden and Kamala Harris support eliminating cash bail, Harris encouraged her supporters to help bail out the rioters while Biden’s campaign staff ponied up the cash.
These were not peaceful protesters they bailed out, they were people charged with violent crimes including sexual assault, attempted murder, and murder.

The clean-up process can only start with your help. Virginia is run by Democrats who would rather watch their cities burn than do something to help their citizens. Can Virginia count on you to help elect people who actually care?
We need to VOTE. THEM. OUT.
We must re-elect President Trump. We must elect Daniel Gade to the U.S. Senate. We must elect every single Republican running for Congress. And don't forget about the Governor's election next year - we must elect a strong conservative to take Virginia back.
There are only 6 days left to take back Virginia. Are you up for the challenge?

You've probably heard the news, but I wanted to tell you myself: our 2020 State Convention has officially been rescheduled. Details can be found on our website ([[URL REDACTED]]).
It's time to turn over a new leaf in Virginia. For far too long, the Democrats have been able to run all over our Commonwealth. That stops this year. These are my promises to you, and it starts right here at our State Convention:
* Win Virginia for President Trump!
* Elect Daniel Gade and kick Mark Warner out of the U.S. Senate
* Re-elect Rob Wittman in VA01
* Elect Scott Taylor and kick Elaine Luria out of VA02
* Elect John Collick and kick Bobby Scott out of VA03
* Elect Leon Benjamin and kick Don McEachin out of VA04
* Elect Bob Good and keep VA05 red
* Re-elect Ben Cline in VA06
* Kick Abigail Spanberger out of VA07 once we have our nominee next week
* Elect Jeff Jordan and kick Gerry Connolly out of VA08
* Re-elect Morgan Griffith in VA09
* Elect Aliscia Andrews and kick Jennifer Wexton out of VA10
* Elect Manga Anantatmula and kick Don Beyer out of VA11
* PUT A REPUBLICAN IN EVERY RACE IN 2021
We can accomplish all of these, but not without you. I talked to President Trump's team, and they helped me set up a money bomb for the Convention. Can you commit to chip in $20.20 today AND $20.20 at the State Convention?

Terry McAuliffe,info@mcauliffeoffice.org,Mark Warner needs us,"Friend,
Last night Mitch McConnell’s Republican Senate confirmed Amy Coney Barrett to sit on the Supreme Court for a lifetime appointment.
Americans are worried today. With Barrett on the court, everything from Roe v. Wade to the Affordable Care Act is on the line. During the hearings, Barrett refused to stand up for voting rights or acknowledge climate change is real.
With a week to go until the most important election of our lifetimes, last night’s sham confirmation was a call to action for all of us. Whatever we’ve done so far in this election is not enough -- we all need to do more.
I’m hoping you’ll join me today in doubling down on our support for Mark Warner in his reelection fight.

If Mark loses, we’ll have no chance at flipping the Senate and stopping Mitch McConnell. Let’s make sure that doesn’t happen.
Thanks,

Terry McAuliffe,info@mcauliffeoffice.org,Cameron Webb’s opponent wants to repeal Obamacare,"Friend,
As a doctor, lawyer, and father, my friend Cameron Webb brings a critical perspective on the health care crisis. Not only does he understand the importance of health care for all Virginians, but he’s also going to be a fierce advocate for expanding and improving access to health care in Congress.
Meanwhile, his Republican opponent Bob Good is actually running on repealing the Affordable Care Act that insures hundreds of thousands of Virginians in the middle of the pandemic.
In the final stretch of this election, let’s dig deep to help Cameron Webb win his race. He’s neck and neck right now -- can you contribute $5, $10, or more?

When I took office, we only had three Virginia Democrats in Congress. This year, if we can help Cameron Webb win on Tuesday, we’ll have eight Virginia Democrats in Congress.
Let’s do this.

Terry McAuliffe,info@mcauliffeoffice.org,Dr. Cameron Webb can flip Virginia's 5th district,"Friend,
A brand new poll has Dr. Cameron Webb up two points in his razor-thin Congressional race against radical right-winger Republican Bob Good.
As recently as this summer, nobody thought Democrats could flip the 5th Congressional District -- but through hard work and a message of unity, Dr. Cameron Webb has put this race on the national radar. We have a real chance to flip this seat from red to blue, but only if Democrats like us help him over the finish line.
Can you make a contribution today to help Cameron flip the 5th district?

As a doctor, lawyer, and father, Cameron brings a critical perspective on the healthcare crisis. He knows how important healthcare is for all Virginians and will fight to expand and improve access in Congress. His opponent Bob Good is actually running on repealing the Affordable Care Act. In the middle of the pandemic!
So let's get to work and make sure Cameron wins. There's too much on the line for Virginia and our country to stay on the sidelines.
Game on!

Terry McAuliffe,info@mcauliffeoffice.org,Mike Pence was in Virginia today. What he didn't say is important.,"Friend,
Mike Pence just left Virginia where he spoke to military cadets at the Virginia Military Institute.
Pence said a lot in his speech today, but there's one thing I didn't hear him do:
Apologize on behalf of Donald Trump for disgracefully calling fallen men and women in uniform ""losers"" and ""suckers.""
Pence's silence isn't a surprise. As Vice President, Pence has simultaneously become Trump's loudest cheerleader and his most embarrassing enabler.
Mike Pence wants us to forget all that -- but we can't.
We have to hold them accountable by sending a strong message that Donald Trump's disgraceful behavior won't be tolerated in Virginia or anywhere else in our country.
To do that, I'm asking for your help.
Can you chip in anything you can afford right now to help me hold Mike Pence and Donald Trump accountable by making sure Virginia Democrats win up and down the ticket in 2020?
Thanks,
Terry

Terry McAuliffe,info@mcauliffeoffice.org,Trump is undermining government scientists and it’s costing lives,"Friend,
Last week the New York Times published a bombshell:
The White House pressured the CDC to discourage COVID-19 testing against the objection of CDC experts and scientists.
It’s the latest example of Donald Trump’s ongoing effort to (in his own words) “downplay” the deadliness of COVID-19.
I don’t have the words to describe just how disgusting it is that Donald Trump is playing politics with a deadly pandemic like COVID-19.
But what’s equally disgusting is that so many Congressional Republicans refuse to condemn Trump’s reprehensible behavior.
It’s time for Congressional Republicans to put American lives before politics. Can you sign my petition and urge them to stand up to Donald Trump’s effort to undermine government scientists?
Look, you know me, I’m an eternal optimist.
Even after everything we’ve seen from the Republican party under Trump, I still believe most public servants get into politics because they genuinely want to help people.
When I hear that a former Chief of Staff to Betsy DeVos or a former White House Homeland Security advisor to Mike Pence are standing up to Donald Trump by endorsing Joe Biden, it gives me hope that other Congressional Republicans are ready to do what’s right too.
And, when it comes to COVID-19, doing what’s right means supporting doctors, scientists, and all of our public health officials who are trying to keep us safe.
So please, add your name right now and join me in calling on Congressional Republicans to demand that Donald Trump stops playing politics with the lives of the American people.
Thanks in advance,
Terry

With less than 72 hours until the most important fundraising deadline of 2020, we’re still $18,438 short of our $20,000 fundraising goal.
The country is counting on Virginia to send Democrats to office up and down the ballot. If we fail, Donald Trump gets four more years, Democrats lose Congress, and the Supreme Court gets packed with right-wing Justices for decades to come.
I’m doing everything in my power to stop all that and right now I need your help.

Before Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell even started barreling ahead with their desperate attempt to seat another right-wing Justice on the Supreme Court, Mark’s opponent Daniel Gade had already made up his mind.
Friend, he vowed to rubber stamp their Supreme court pick before she was even announced!
Virginians need an independent Senator who works for them, not Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump.
That's Mark Warner. Mark understands that Virginians are already voting. That's why he’s fighting to make sure their votes count in the selection of the next Supreme Court Justice.
Mark has always had Virginia’s back — before his debate tonight, let’s show him we’ve got his back too.
Please contribute $17 or more and join me in standing with Mark before his debate tonight:

Terry McAuliffe,info@mcauliffeoffice.org,Louis DeJoy is still running the Postal Service. He should resign.,"Friend,
Here’s the hard truth:
Donald Trump hired mega-donor Louis DeJoy to sabotage the U.S. Postal Service.
That’s not just me saying it, that’s the conclusion of federal Judge Stanley Bastian. In Bastian’s own words:
“the heart of DeJoy's and the Postal Service's actions is voter disenfranchisement”
The judge also blocked the USPS from making policy changes nationwide, including delaying mail, removing sorting machines, or anything else that may hamper the postal service’s ability to handle election mail.
The judge’s ruling makes clear what we already know: Louis DeJoy must resign immediately from his position.
I’m calling for that to happen today and I need your voice with me.
Can you sign my petition demanding the resignation of Postmaster General Louis DeJoy?
Thanks,
Terry

It's a disaster. With Amy Coney Barrett on the Supreme Court, everything from Roe v. Wade to the Affordable Care Act is on the line.
Friend, it’s a hard moment, but I still have hope. If we do our part and make sure Mark Warner wins reelection, we can help Democrats take back the Senate and fire Mitch McConnell.
But if Mark loses -- Democrats have no shot.
With so much on the line, I’m not about to let that happen and I need your help.

Friend,
Tonight, Mitch McConnell and Senate Republicans will end their illegitimate mad-dash to send Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court.
I’ll be blunt -- this entire confirmation process has been a sham.
The worst part is what this sham is really all about: confirming a Justice who will take health care from millions of Americans, including the 3.5 million Virginians who struggle with a pre-existing condition.
In the middle of a pandemic!
Friend, I don’t blame you if you’re mad as hell. I sure am.
But here’s the thing -- we can’t give up.
If we give up, Mark Warner will lose and Democrats won’t take back the Senate. If we give up, Medicaid expansion could end in Virginia and too many will face the nightmare of losing health care in the middle of a deadly pandemic.
In 8 days we have the chance to hold Mitch McConnell accountable for betraying the will of the American people -- I promise you I’m doing everything I can to make sure that happens and I could really use your support.
Please contribute anything you can right now and support my efforts to help Virginia Democrats win up and down the ballot this November.
Thanks for staying in this fight,
Terry

I know Joe will have our backs and stand up to Trump’s clown show routine at tonight’s debate.
Before Joe and Trump take the stage, I’m trying to raise $10,000 to show Joe Virginia has his back.
According to our records, you still haven’t contributed to my “Stand with Joe” debate fund. Can you take a look and make sure we have it right?

If I know Joe, he’s working hard at this very moment preparing for tonight’s debate. That’s who Joe is. He puts in the work because he knows how important it is for our country.
Joe will always work hard for us and tonight I want to send him the message that we’re working hard for him.

Terry McAuliffe,info@mcauliffeoffice.org,Final ask for Joe Biden,"Friend,
In 2016, Trump lost the popular vote by millions of votes but secured an Electoral College victory by winning a few battleground states by razor-thin margins. We know that the election in those battleground states will be very close once again.
Let's be clear, Donald Trump is a clear and present danger to our democracy, and history will judge us harshly if we don't do everything we can to defeat him in these final hours.
That’s why I’ve asked everyone to step up and hit this last-minute $10,000 fundraising goal by midnight tonight.
Your contribution will go directly towards reaching out to voters in the final hours of this race. There's still plenty to do from online ads and sending more texts to making more calls to voters about how they can vote on Election Day.
And every little bit has the potential to make the difference in this election.
We’re still short of our $10,000 goal, so I’m asking you one last time before Election Day, will you chip in right now to help Joe Biden and Virginia Democrats win tomorrow?

Last night, Donald Trump was in full form. He told lie after lie and embarrassed all of us once again.
The biggest lie he told was that we’re “turning a corner” on COVID-19. Really?
With infection rates at all-time highs across the midwest, we know that’s simply not true. We deserve a president who gives it to us straight. We’ve got to be honest about this virus so we can take it head-on.
Let’s show Donald Trump that his 90 minutes of lying has us more fired up than ever to send him packing in November.

Dr. Cameron Webb is running in Virginia’s 5th District and he’s our best chance this year of flipping a congressional seat for Democrats.

Friend,
As the COVID-19 pandemic rages on, Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans have dug in and doubled down on their efforts to dismantle our health care system. And they still can’t admit that COVID-19 is a problem that we haven’t adequately addressed.
In fact, Trump has a case in the Supreme Court right now that could eliminate Obamacare. 3.5 million Virginians with pre-existing conditions could lose their health care immediately. Health care for millions of people hangs in the balance and with a pandemic that has killed over 200,000 Americans, we need health care advocates in Congress more than ever.
That’s why I’m supporting Jennifer Wexton, Abigail Spanberger, and Elaine Luria’s 2020 re-election fight.
Please chip in anything you can afford right now to help get them over the finish line on Tuesday.

For Republicans to even put Virginia families in a position to have to worry about their health care right now is disgraceful. These three incredible Congresswomen know how important it is for all Virginians to have health care and they will continue to fight for that in Congress.

I’m sorry to keep emailing you about Donald Trump’s rally tonight in Newport News, but it’s important.
In a week where we mourned the deaths of 200,000 Americans to COVID-19, it’s appalling that Donald Trump is putting the lives of Virginians at risk by holding a super-spreader hate rally in one of our communities.
His recklessness is another urgent call to action for Virginia Democrats. With only hours left until Trump arrives, will you help us reach our $20,000 rapid response goal before midnight? We’re still $7,500 short and I could sure use your help.
We know how important Virginia is winning Congress, the White House and saving the Supreme Court. No matter what the polls say, we can’t take anything for granted heading into the final weeks of the election.

Terry McAuliffe,info@mcauliffeoffice.org,It’s time for Louis DeJoy to resign.,"Friend,
Friday the Washington Post published an explosive report detailing Postmaster General Louis DeJoy’s shady donation scheme to help Donald Trump and the Republican Party.
According to the Post, DeJoy pressured his employees to contribute to Republican campaigns and then reimbursed them in violation of state and federal laws.
I don’t know about you, but I’m sick and tired of the rank corruption of the Trump administration. It’s WAY past time for DeJoy to go and today I’m calling for his resignation.
Please, add your name right now and join me in demanding the resignation of Postmaster General Louis DeJoy.
Let’s get real. Louis DeJoy never should have been running the Postal Service in the first place.
Donald Trump only picked him for the job because DeJoy was one of the top donors to his campaign.
Now we’re seeing late deliveries, reduced hours, the removal of sorting machines — we’re in the middle of a pandemic and instead of preparing for the upcoming election, Trump and DeJoy are teaming up to sabotage it.
It’s corrupt, it’s anti-democratic, and we need it to stop immediately.
It’s time for Louis Dejoy to resign. Can you add your name if you agree?
Thanks,
Terry

From breaking tradition (and violating the Hatch Act) by using the White House as a campaign venue to using a naturalization ceremony as a prop, Donald Trump really, really wants you to forget who he really is:
A xenophobic racist who is intellectually and morally incapable of doing the job as President.
Friend, we know who this guy is. And we can’t let him lie his way into four more disastrous years.
I’m doing everything I can to make sure Virginia Democrats up and down the ticket have the resources they need to stand up to Donald Trump this November — that’s why I’m asking for your help.

Mark’s Senate debate is about to start, and I wanted to make sure you saw my note from earlier.
With the Supreme Court on the line, it’s more important than ever for us to have Mark’s back. If Mark’s far-right opponent Daniel Gade wins, Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell get another rubber stamp in the Senate.
That’s one more vote for Amy Coney Barrett on the Supreme Court.
With the Court hearing a case that could end the Affordable Care Act this November, we can’t let that happen.
Friend, Virginia elections are always close and we can’t afford to take anything for granted.

\-----Forwarded message-----
Friend,
In a moment, I’m going to ask you to donate to Mark Warner before he debates his far-right opponent Daniel Gade today, but first I want to tell you why.
Before Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell even started barreling ahead with their desperate attempt to seat another right-wing Justice on the Supreme Court, Mark’s opponent Daniel Gade had already made up his mind.
Friend, he vowed to rubber stamp their Supreme court pick before she was even announced!
Virginians need an independent Senator who works for them, not Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump.
That's Mark Warner. Mark understands that Virginians are already voting. That's why he’s fighting to make sure their votes count in the selection of the next Supreme Court Justice.
Mark has always had Virginia’s back — before his debate tonight, let’s show him we’ve got his back too.
Please contribute $17 or more and join me in standing with Mark before his debate tonight:

When all was said and done, I attended more than 140 events in support of Democratic candidates. And we were the top donor to the Democratic Party of Virginia.
Thanks to grassroots supporters like you, a group of incredible Democrats had critical resources to run winning campaigns.

Terry McAuliffe,info@mcauliffeoffice.org,Amy Coney Barrett and what’s next,"Friend,
I’m going to tell you something you already know:
Amy Coney Barrett’s confirmation process was a sham aimed at ripping Americans’ access to health care away from them in the middle of a pandemic.
To make sure Donald Trump’s pick got through, Mitch McConnell and Senate Republicans broke precedent and violated their own rules.
All this just to ram a partisan nominee through who would repeal Obamacare and overturn Roe v Wade.
Like it is for so many of you, this is personal to me.
As Governor, I fought hard to expand Medicaid under the ACA. And I was a brick wall against Republicans’ attack on women’s reproductive freedom.
Now with Amy Coney Barrett on the Supreme Court, all of those things are on the line.
Friend, the stakes in this election have never been higher.
We must keep fighting to elect Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and a Democratic Senate to protect Virginians’ access to health care, especially for the 3.5 million Virginians with pre-existing conditions who would lose their protection if Obamacare is repealed.

Terry McAuliffe,info@mcauliffeoffice.org,New poll (not good),"Friend,
A new poll shows that Elaine Luria’s race is statistically TIED and with just three days to go, we’re running out of time to help her pull ahead.
Elaine was one of the incredible Virginia Democrats who helped flip control of the House in 2018. A 20 year veteran of the United States Navy, Elaine been a fierce advocate for us in the response to COVID-19.
But right now, Republican super PACs are going all in to try and defeat her. They know she’s vulnerable -- so our support for her campaign right now could make all the difference.
Please rush a contribution of $10, $20, or whatever you can afford to get her the resources she needs to turn out last-minute voters in this election.

Terry McAuliffe,info@mcauliffeoffice.org,Asking for Joe Biden before Donald Trump takes the stage tonight,"Friend,
I’ll get right to the point.
Donald Trump is an utter failure. We are facing a series of urgent, unprecedented crises and every day he remains in office is a dangerous one for our country.
If we want to stay safe from COVID-19, recover from the worst economic crisis in a century, and dismantle the structural racism tearing us apart, we urgently need to elect Joe Biden.
It’s the most important election of our lifetime — Joe has to win and I’m asking you to do your part right now to help.
Before Donald Trump speaks tonight, please donate anything you can and show Joe Biden you support his campaign.
I’ve known Joe for 40 years. There’s no one better for this moment — he’ll be a rock for us just like he’s been his whole life.
We can’t mess this up. Future generations are counting on us.

If we don’t do our part in Virginia, Donald Trump gets four more years in the White House -- it’s that simple.
That means no leadership through the health and economic catastrophe of COVID-19. That means a Supreme Court packed with conservative judges for decades.
I’m not about to sit by and just let that happen and neither can you.

It's pretty hard to find something more offensive than Ted Nugent, but Amanda Chase has delivered again.
At a moment when heartbreaking gun violence is still far too common in our communities, a leading Republican gubernatorial candidate is giving away an AR-15 assault rifle to excite her base, just days after she, with her own assault rifle in hand- reportedly joined a heavily armed gathering that included white supremacists in Richmond.
It's an urgent reminder of the true level of extremism we are up against with Virginia Republicans and why it's so critical to elect Virginia Democrats up and down the ticket in 2020 and beyond.
I'm going to fight like hell to make sure we win and I need your help.

Friend,
My team set a critical $20,000 goal to hit by Thursday, October 15th and I’m worried we might miss it.
The initial response to this critical goal was great -- and then donations slowed way down. Please click here to rush a donation to help us close the gap.
You know as well as I do what’s at stake this year. The White House, Congress, and the Supreme Court are riding on what happens in the Commonwealth.
That’s a big responsibility for Virginia Democrats. No doubt about it.
But now’s not the time to slow down. With just three weeks to go, we’ve got to push as hard as we can. We can’t afford to leave this election up to chance.
Please rush a donation towards our $20,000 mid-month goal before Thursday at midnight.
Thank you for all you’re doing.

With the Supreme Court on the line, our most important job in Virginia just became more important.
Here’s the truth:
If we take this election for granted and my friend Mark Warner loses his reelection fight, Democrats have ZERO chance of winning back the Senate. If he loses, that guarantees another right-wing judge on the Supreme Court and another rubber stamp for Mitch McConnell.
I don’t need to tell you what a disaster that would be for Virginia and our country.
I’m not staying on the sidelines at such an important moment, and you can’t either.
That’s why I’m setting a goal of raising $10,000 for Mark by Monday at midnight. It’s ambitious, but with your help I know we can do it.
Please, donate anything you can afford right now and show your support for Mark’s campaign:

I don’t blame you if you’re worried.
Please chip in right now and support my effort to help Virginia Democrats win in November. We can’t let Donald Trump get the momentum.
In 2016, polls kept showing Hillary Clinton ahead and Democrats got complacent.
In the end, Trump barely won the electoral college by a handful of votes in a few key battleground states.
We know what happened next. Donald Trump became the most corrupt, unqualified President in our nation's history.
With COVID-19, an economic calamity, and racial division tearing apart our country, I can't imagine a worse person for the job.
Friend, every single day that Donald Trump is in the White House is a dangerous one for our country. We can’t take anything for granted — we have to work our hearts out for Virginia Democrats between now and November.
Please chip in anything you can afford right now and join me in fighting for Virginia’s future. With your help, I know Joe Biden and Virginia Democrats can win up and down the ballot in November.

Friend,
This Friday, Donald Trump is holding his first rally in Virginia. It’s the latest sign the Trump campaign thinks winning the Commonwealth is critical to winning four more years in the White House.
I want to send Donald Trump the message that Virginians are fired up to vote him out this November. That’s why I’ve set a rapid response goal of raising $20,000 for my effort to support Virginia Democrats before Trump’s rally Friday night.
Please, contribute any amount that’s meaningful to you right now -- we can’t reach our ambitious goal without your support.
Having one of Trump’s clown show rallies in Virginia is bad enough, but with the threat of the rally turning into a COVID-19 super spreader event, Trump’s visit is especially disgusting.
In the week where we mourned the deaths of 200,000 Americans, it’s appalling Donald Trump is announcing he’s putting Virginians at risk.
His recklessness is just the latest urgent call to action for Virginia Democrats. No matter what the polls say, we can’t take anything for granted heading into the final weeks of the election.
Can you contribute to my effort to support Virginia Democrats up and down the ballot?

Friend,
We’re in the middle of a deadly pandemic and it’s crazy we’re still talking about Republicans dismantling our health care system.
But one week after Election Day, the Supreme Court will finally hear a Republican and Trump backed case that could eliminate Obamacare.
We honestly don’t know what the court will decide, but we do know that Obamacare is in real jeopardy.
For Republicans to put Virginia families in a position to even have to worry about this right now is disgraceful.
That’s why I am so proud to support Jennifer Wexton, Abigail Spanberger, and Elaine Luria’s 2020 reelection fight.
They shocked the world and helped Democrats take back the house in 2018 because they are fierce advocates for the health care of Virginia families.
As long as they’re around, they’ll never sit back and let the Supreme Court, Donald Trump, or the Republican Party dismantle our health care system.
They’re fighting for us and we need to fight for them too.
Can you pitch in anything you can afford right now? Your contribution will ensure each of these women have the resources they need to run winning campaigns.

On issue after issue, Democrats are on the right side of working families and the right side of history.
Good paying jobs. Affordable health care. Putting an end to systemic racism.
I fought for these issues as Governor and I’m proud to see so many Virginia Democrats stand up to Donald Trump and fight for our agenda.
With polls tightening across the country, we can’t afford to get complacent. It's too important.
So please, contribute anything you can afford right now and help us reach our ambitious goal.
Thanks for everything,
Terry

As a first-term Democrat in Congress, Elaine Luria has a target on her back. And, friend, she’s defending one of the most contested toss-up districts in the country. She needs our help. Elaine is one of the most effective members of Congress -- we must make sure she has the resources to win.
Donald Trump and his shady network of GOP super PACs have set their sights on Elaine’s seat and are spending BIG to defeat her in the final days of this election. They know they have a chance and if we don’t step up right NOW, they could win.
With three days to go until Election Day, please rush a contribution to Elaine Luria to show that you have her back.

Friend,
As the COVID-19 pandemic rages on, Republicans have dug in and doubled down on their efforts to dismantle our health care system.
Trump has a case in the Supreme Court right now that could eliminate Obamacare and we don't know what the court will decide, but we know that Republicans have been trying this for years. We know that ensuring that all Virginia families have quality health care is not a priority for them.
For Republicans to even put Virginia families in a position to have to worry about their health care during a pandemic is disgraceful.
That’s why I am so proud to support Jennifer Wexton, Abigail Spanberger, and Elaine Luria’s 2020 reelection fight.
They know how important it is for all Virginians to have health care and they will continue to be fierce advocates for that in Congress.
They’re fighting for us and now we need to fight for them too.
Can you chip in anything you can afford right now to help them get over the finish line?

Yes, you read that correctly. Betsy DeVos thinks COVID-19 is good for public education.
I’m a positive guy, but even I can’t see the good in millions of kids starting the school year at home because Donald Trump spends more time on Twitter peddling quack cures than he does keeping Americans safe from the virus.
Betsy DeVos and Donald Trump still refuse to take COVID-19 seriously and our children are paying the price. Can you add your name and tell them we deserve better?
For Betsy DeVos, COVID-19 isn’t a national crisis, it’s an opportunity to keep pushing  a radical anti-public education  agenda that diverts funding from public to wealthy, private schools.
DeVos’ comment is the same shameful opportunism we see in every corner of the Trump administration.
Someone like Betsy DeVos should never have been confirmed as Education Secretary. This November we finally have the chance to fire her and get a Secretary of Education who actually fights for our kids.
Please join me in standing up to Betsy DeVos by adding your name right now.

Friend,
I’ve said it over and over again — there’s nothing more important for Virginia than making sure Mark Warner wins his reelection fight this November.
Let’s start with what you already know:
Mark is an incredible Senator. He fights for an economy that works for all Virginians. He’s been a fierce advocate for Virginia’s health care and he’s made us proud leading the Senate investigation into Donald Trump’s corrupt 2016 campaign.
Those are all great reasons to support Mark, but here’s another:
If Mark loses Democrats have no chance to take back the Senate. ZERO. That means Mitch McConnell stays in power and the Senate will continue to get nothing done at a critical moment for our country.
I don’t have to tell you what a disaster that is. That’s why I’m asking for your help.
Can you donate anything you can afford and show your support for Mark’s campaign? Virginia and our nation’s future are counting on it.
Thanks,
Terry

Terry McAuliffe,info@mcauliffeoffice.org,Donald Trump is a reckless super-spreader,"Friend,
Let’s be clear, Dorothy and I wish Donald Trump, the First Lady and anyone struggling right now because of COVID-19 a speedy recovery.
But let’s get real, Donald Trump’s reckless behavior is putting the health of Virginians and millions across the country at risk.
Just days before Trump tested positive for the virus, his campaign held a massive superspreader-style rally in Newport News, an area still recovering from an early summer surge.
The rally was like far too many Trump campaign events. Social distancing rules were ignored. Most in attendance didn’t wear masks.
I joined countless Virginia public health experts in calling on Trump to cancel the event. Our calls fell on deaf ears and the dangerous event still went forward.
In the days since testing positive for the virus, Trump and his campaign show no signs of changing.
The very first thing Donald Trump did after returning back to the White House was take off his mask and tell the American public that COVID-19 was nothing to be afraid of. And Mike Pence is still planning on holding a rally in Arizona this Thursday!
Friend, it’s reckless and I want to send them a message.
Will you add your name and join me in calling on the Trump campaign to halt their dangerous superspreader rallies?
Virginians deserve a President who puts their health and safety first, not his ego and his campaign.
Thanks for your help,

In Virginia, we have the opportunity to help expand our majority in Congress, help Mark Warner flip the Senate, and help Joe take back the White House.

The debate is starting soon so I’ll be direct:
We’re still $3,491 short of our goal of raising $10,000 for Joe Biden before he takes the stage tonight.
We might not make it, friend.
It’s disappointing because tonight is the most important presidential debate in the history of our country and I wanted to show Joe that Virginia has his back.
I’m counting on you to step up right now, friend. Let’s send the message that Virginia is ready to send Joe and Kamala to the White House in November.
Please, before you cheer on Joe tonight, rush your contribution right now and show him you're in his corner:

The debate is about to start so I’ll make this quick:
I set a goal of raising $10,000 this morning for Joe Biden before he takes the stage tonight and right now we’re still $3,945 away. We’re currently at risk of coming up short.
The worst thing we can do right now is get complacent or slow down. There’s too much on the line in this election and the country is counting on Virginia to show up.
Please, before Joe takes the stage tonight, rush a contribution and show him you’ve got his back.

Terry McAuliffe,info@mcauliffeoffice.org,"Save health care and the Supreme Court, support Mark Warner","Friend,
I’ll be blunt: if Donald Trump’s Supreme Court pick Amy Coney Barrett is confirmed by the Senate, it will be a total disaster for Virginia families.
Why? After the election, the Court will hear a Trump backed case that could end the Affordable Care Act. Think about that, millions of Americans might lose health care during a deadly pandemic.
It’s outrageous and, now more than ever, Virginians are lucky to have Mark Warner fighting for us in the U.S. Senate.
Friend, Mark Warner is fighting like hell to stop Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell’s desperate attempt to seat another right-wing Justice on the Supreme Court.

Friend, Mark’s right-wing opponent announced he would rubber stamp Trump’s Supreme court pick before she was even announced!
Virginians need a Senator who works for them, not Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump.
That's Mark. Mark understands that Virginians are already voting. That's why he’s fighting to make sure their votes count in the selection of the next Supreme Court Justice.
Mark is fighting for us and I’m asking you to do your part and fight for him today.
Please contribute anything you can afford right now and show your support for Mark’s campaign.
Thank you,

Polling guru Nate Silver at FiveThirtyEight says determining control of the Senate is still “too close to call.”
The good news is we still have time to make an impact in this election. Earlier this year nobody thought that we could flip the Senate blue -- but now we have a real shot.
The bad news is that my friend Mark Warner is being bombarded by Republican attack ads from his extremist opponent. If we lose Mark’s seat, we lose our shot at flipping the Senate.
Please rush a donation to Mark Warner’s campaign to make sure he holds onto his seat this November. Your support in the final days of this election is critical.
Democrats across the country are counting on us to win this seat. If Mark loses, Mitch McConnell could keep calling the shots for years to come.
Please chip in whatever you can to help Mark.

You know the routine. First, Donald Trump says something misleading, racist, or illegal. Then, after there’s an outcry, he says he was “joking” or he denies ever saying it all.
The latest is Trump’s dangerous suggestion that North Carolina voters vote twice in the upcoming election.
Of course, that’s illegal, but coming from Trump, it’s not surprising.
Can you join me in standing up to Donald Trump’s gaslighting by contributing to my effort to help Virginia Democrats win in 2020? Even the smallest donation can have a huge impact.
Over and over Donald Trump has shown an utter disdain for our democracy and the right to vote:
* He won’t commit to accepting the election results if he loses this November.
* He said he’s not funding the USPS because he wants to sabotage vote by mail.
* He’s tweeted so many lies about voting that Twitter started hiding his tweets.
Friend, we know Donald Trump will do anything to hold on to power. The only sure way to stop up to him is to run up a HUGE margin of victory up and down the ticket here in Virginia.
I’m doing my part to lead that effort and I would sure appreciate your help. Can you donate right now and help Joe Biden and Virginia Democrats up blow Donald Trump out of the water this November?
Thanks,
Terry

Like so many of you, when I heard that Donald Trump called our military men and women “suckers” and “losers” it was personal to me.
My dad was a World War II Army Captain and my son was a Marine Captain who served in the Middle East.
I’m proud of their patriotic service to our country — just as I'm proud of every single man, woman, and family who sacrifices for our country.
That’s why one of my proudest achievements as Governor was functionally ending veteran homelessness in Virginia.
I have always, and will always stand up for our men and women in uniform. And that includes standing up to Donald Trump’s disgraceful comments today.
Can you add your name and join me in telling Donald Trump our men and women in uniform aren't ""suckers"" and ""losers""?
Donald Trump has spent a lifetime looking out for himself, not having to worry as others risked their lives to protect our country. A guy like him could never understand the true meaning of patriotic service for country.
To him, sacrifice means skipping the tanning bed for a day — Donald is the kind of guy who’s born on third base and spends the rest of his life telling everyone he hit a triple.
President Obama said it best when he said, “Donald Trump hasn’t grown into the job [of President] because he can’t.”
I couldn’t agree more. The job of Commander and Chief will always be too big for a selfish, small person like Donald Trump.
Our military men and women deserve better.
That’s why I’m calling Donald Trump out for his disgraceful comments today. Can you add your name join me in standing up for our men and women in uniform?

Tonight at midnight we close the books on the final public fundraising deadline of this election. It’s the last opportunity we’ll have to showcase the strength of our grassroots support -- so we need to make this one count.
More importantly, it’s one of our last opportunities to make an impact before this election is over. Voters are already casting their ballots in Virginia and we don’t have much time left.
That’s why I’m so excited to tell you about today’s matching opportunity. A group of generous donors has stepped up to match every dollar that comes in between now and midnight.
Will you rush a contribution before midnight and have your donation doubled?

Please rush a donation right now to Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and be one of the 250 grassroots donors we need to hit our goal.
We are now less than two weeks from what is undoubtedly the most important election of our lifetimes. Everything is on the line this November in a way we haven’t seen before.
Every dollar you give us another dollar that can be used towards reaching voters over the next 13 days. And as you’ve probably heard, nothing is more important than making sure we turn out our voters between now and Election Day.
We’ve seen enough to know that Trump and his web of dark money allies will do whatever it takes to win. Who knows what kinds of tricks they have in store but if we remain focused and do everything we can right now, it won’t matter.
Chip in right now to Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and be one of the 250 grassroots donors we need to hit our goal before the presidential debate tomorrow night.

When Nate Silver says your race is the closest in the country, you know it’s important.
Dr. Cameron Webb is in a true a toss-up, and even though Republicans have controlled this seat for a decade, a recent poll shows Cameron leading radical Republican Bob Good by two points.
Flipping this seat from red to blue is within reach, and with just hours left before voting ends, now is the time to step up and make it happen.
Will you rush a contribution before midnight to help Cameron pull ahead? With every hour that passes, Cameron’s opportunity to reach last-minute voters diminishes.
Every dollar that Cameron’s team receives right now goes straight out the door to bolster their voter outreach efforts. And, friend, we know this election is going to come down to turnout.

* Democrats took back the Senate, and Mark Warner won six more years as Virginia’s Senator
* Democrats expanded our House majority because Virginia Democrats now hold seats in 8 of our 11 Congressional districts

This Friday, Donald Trump is holding his first rally in Virginia. It’s the latest sign the Trump campaign thinks winning the Commonwealth is critical to winning four more years in the White House.
I want to send Donald Trump the message that Virginians are fired up to vote him out this November. That’s why I’ve set a rapid response goal of raising $20,000 for my effort to support Virginia Democrats before Trump’s rally Friday night.
Please, contribute any amount that’s meaningful to you right now -- we can’t reach our ambitious goal without your support.
Having one of Trump’s clown show rallies in Virginia is bad enough, but with the threat of the rally turning into a COVID-19 super spreader event, Trump’s visit is especially disgusting.
In the week where we mourned the deaths of 200,000 Americans, it’s appalling Donald Trump is announcing he’s putting Virginians at risk.
His recklessness is just the latest urgent call to action for Virginia Democrats. No matter what the polls say, we can’t take anything for granted heading into the final weeks of the election.
Can you contribute to my effort to support Virginia Democrats up and down the ballot?

With the Supreme Court vacancy, doing our part to make sure Joe Biden and Virginia Democrats win up and down the ticket this November is more important than ever.
Here’s the good news:
Thanks to new laws passed by our new Democratic majorities in Richmond, no-excuse early voting started last week in the commonwealth -- that means you can go vote and do your part to take our country back from Donald Trump RIGHT NOW.
Voting early is easy and convenient. Just click here to find your local registrar’s office to find out where you can vote early NOW!
Once you find your location and make a plan to vote early, just head over in-person with any form of ID, including: your driver’s license, passport, utility bill, bank statement, or a paycheck with your name and address.
This isn’t any ordinary election. Donald Trump is terrified of losing so he’s already laying the groundwork to dispute the results of the Election.
We don’t know what Trump will do if he loses, but we do know this:
If we rack up a HUGE margin of victory in Virginia and around the country, Trump won’t have any wiggle room to play games with the result.
So do your part today.
You can vote early in person anytime between now and Saturday, October 31st. Please click here to find your local registrar.
Thanks for doing your part. Winning starts with your vote, so make it happen today!

Last night we mourned the loss of an American icon in Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
Today, we honor her legacy by fighting for the future of the Supreme Court.
Friend, with the future of the Supreme Court on the line, can you sign my petition and tell Mitch McConnell to let the next President pick the next Supreme Court Justice?
Mitch McConnell already said it: he’s pushing for the Senate to vote for Donald Trump’s nominee as quickly as he can.
It’s a total about-face from 2016 when Mitch refused to let the Senate hold an up or down vote on Barack Obama’s nominee Merrick Garland.
Mitch McConnell’s blatant hypocrisy is shameful. And we know Donald Trump will nominate a Justice who could overturn the Affordable Care Act and Roe V. Wade.
The best way to stand up to them and fight for the future of Supreme Court is to get to work, right now, to make sure Democrats win here in Virginia.
I’m going to work like hell to make sure that happens and I need your help.
Please add your name right now and tell McConnell to let our next President pick Ruth Bader Ginsburg's replacement.
I know we can win this fight. Thank you in advance for your support,
Terry

Terry McAuliffe,info@mcauliffeoffice.org,"Louise Lucas stood up to racism. Now she needs us to stand up for
 her.","Dear friend,
Last week, my good friend and the first African-American President Pro Tempore of the Virginia Senate, Louise Lucas, was charged by police in relation to the removal of a Confederate statue in Portsmouth.
Suspiciously, Louise’s charges came hours before she and her Democratic colleagues were set to begin a special legislative session to address police and criminal justice reform.
The purpose of the racist Confederate monument isn’t up for debate. Erected in 1876, the statue sits at a location where slaves were once violently punished. It’s a monument of hatred built for the sole purpose of intimidating African-Americans.
Louise is a trailblazer, successful small business owner and civil rights leader in Hampton Roads. She’s not afraid to do and say what is right. Her opposition to this Confederate monument is exactly what the late John Lewis would have called ""good trouble"".
Louise has always stood up for her constituents and Virginians across the Commonwealth. We can’t let Louise's voice be silenced. Would you sign our petition and join me in standing with her?
Thanks,
Terry

As a first-term Democrat in Congress defending one of the most contested toss-up districts in the country, Elaine Luria has a target on her back.
Donald Trump and the GOP Fundraising Machine have set their sights on Elaine’s seat and are working overtime to beat her. They know it’s a close race and are investing heavily right now.
A recent poll confirmed the race is statistically TIED and with less than two weeks to go, we don’t have much time to help her pull ahead.
Can you rush a contribution to Elaine Luria to show that you have her back?

Earlier today I asked for your help in making sure Mark Warner wins his Senate reelection fight.
Here’s what worries me:
We’re still a massive $8,450 short of our goal. That’s a huge gap to make up and we only have 24 hours to do it.
Friend, my advice to anyone who will listen right now is to ignore the polls. We know how close elections can be in Virginia.
With the Supreme Court on the line, it’s too important that Mark wins for the future of the Supreme Court.
So, I’m asking — please donate and stand with Mark and I today.

There are now just 10 days until the most important election of our lifetimes and Terry and I couldn’t be more fired up.
In Virginia, we have the opportunity to help expand our majority in Congress, help Mark Warner flip the Senate, and help Joe take back the White House.
Things are looking good right now. But, like all of you, I remember what happened in 2016. And I think most of us wonder if the polls are right this time.
So we have to ask ourselves: are we doing enough?
The worst thing we can do right now is get comfortable. With just 10 days to go, please pitch in $15 or more right now and do your part to help Terry and me support Virginia Democrats.
If we don’t leave it all on the field, Trump could win four more years. We could lose incredible Virginia Democrats like Elaine Luria and Abigail Spanberger -- even Mark Warner.
I’m not going to sit by and watch that happen and I’m not going to stop working until Trump is squarely defeated.
Please contribute if you can and let’s keep pushing to Election Day.

✓ Expanding voting rights
✓ Tackling climate change

Roll Call just named Denver Riggleman (VA-05) the 4th most vulnerable congressional incumbent in America. If that doesn’t say that we can flip the 5th this year, I don’t know what does.
Will you help us flip the 5th district from red to blue?
We have some amazing candidates running in the 5th Congressional District Democratic Primary, and whoever wins the nomination will have the best shot in years to flip this seat from Republican control.
As we’ve said in the past, Denver Riggleman is a Trump rubber stamp (he votes with Trump 94.4% of the time) and errand boy (he submitted Trump’s papers to get on the ballot this year). The people of the 5th CD deserve better than a rubber stamp. They deserve better than Denver Riggleman.
This is our chance to make it clear once and for all: Virginia is a blue Commonwealth. The 5th is the last purple patch in Virginia that Republicans hold.
Help us flip this district blue by donating today.

Friends --
We all want to believe that our elected leaders have our best interests at heart -- but sometimes that’s just not the case. Right now, multiple Republican leaders are calling for the immediate re-opening of Virginia’s businesses even though health experts warn that doing so will “almost certainly” result in more people being infected and dying from COVID-19.
If you can, will you chip in before our end-of-month deadline to help elect more Democrats who will always put Virginians’ best interests first?
Think about this: Two Virginia state senators, Ryan McDougle and Bill Stanley, are currently representing Gold’s Gym in a lawsuit to undo the executive order that is keeping their own constituents safe. House of Delegates member and candidate for the U.S. House, John McGuire, recently shared a video in which he praises people protesting in Richmond to open businesses immediately.
And are these “leaders’” actions really surprising when the leader of the Republican Party -- the great tweeter-in-chief himself, President Donald Trump -- recently tweeted, “LIBERATE VIRGINIA, and save your great 2nd Amendment. It is under siege!”?
Friends, these and other elected officials who proudly ignore the guidance of health and medical experts, who shrug at the possibility of thousands of people needlessly dying, shouldn’t be representing any constituents -- and certainly not Virginians!
If you agree that we need to do everything we can to elect people who will lead with wisdom and compassion during a crisis, will you consider chipping in before our end-of-month deadline?

Folks,
We all know the goal. We need to elect my friend Joe Biden on November 3rd and kick Donald Trump and his rhetoric out of the White House for good. But more than that, we need to re-elect Mark Warner, and our Congressional Delegation.
I’m not going to sugar coat this for you -- we won’t get there without a strong State Party. That’s why I’m asking you to donate what you can to help us keep Virginia Blue in 2020.
When I became Governor, one of the best things I did was put Susan Swecker in charge of the DPVA -- under her leadership the DPVA has grown from a 3 person operation to maintaining a staff of between 10-15 people year-round. That’s helped us maintain the organization we built on my race, and that every Statewide Democrat has used since. But we all know, in politics especially, talented people are at a premium -- even in the political hotbed that is our Commonwealth.
Now in order for the DPVA to run the programs it needs to get not only Joe Biden a win in Virginia, but send all our Democrats back to Washington as well, they need your help. We’re coming up to the End of Quarter for the Party, and they’re trying to hit goals that surpass their 2016 numbers to give us our best shot in November.

Dr. Webb is running against Bob Good, a right-wing extremist who’s more focused on making sure churches can discriminate against LGBTQ Virginians than he is on helping residents of the 5th district get through the COVID pandemic and economic recession.
Good has been traveling around the district holding rallies without masks or social distancing, and running ads with the same kind of racial dog whistles we’ve seen from President Trump. Virginians are fed up with this kind of behavior, and we need to make sure they turn out for Cameron Webb.
The polls show this race is going to come down to the wire. We’re counting on you to help us flip this district. Can you donate today?

There’s so much at stake in this election: The presidency, control of the Senate and House -- and the future of our Virginia Democratic delegation.
We have the chance to replace Donald Trump and Mike Pence with Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in the White House. And we can re-elect great Virginia Democrats like Senator Mark Warner and Representatives Elaine Luria, Abigail Spanberger, and Jennifer Wexton.
But first, we have to beat the Trump campaign, the Republican Party, and their outside groups. They are POURING money into our Commonwealth to get our 13 electoral votes, Senator Warner’s seat, and to turn the three congressional districts we flipped in 2018 back to RED!
Friend, we can stop this from happening. But it’s going to take every single one of us to keep Virginia BLUE.

Friend,
Virginia Democrats have shown you what happens when they're elected. In the Senate, Mark Warner championed Virginia, fought for the security of our nation, and sponsored a crucial environmental protection bill that will create thousands of jobs.
In the House, we've fought to expand access to healthcare, protect Virginia's veterans and active military personnel, increase broadband access in rural areas, and passed legislation to save our economy in the midst of a pandemic and recession.
In the General Assembly, Democrats ratified the ERA, took on criminal justice reform and commonsense gun reforms, made it easier and safer to vote, passed landmark climate change legislation, and so much more.
But here's the thing -- Virginia Democrats wouldn't be here without tireless supporters like you, friend. There is so much at stake tomorrow. We're so close to solidifying the gains we made in 2018 and taking back the White House.

Virginia has a long history of electing governors of the opposite party of the sitting president. This trend dates back to the 1960s -- and in 2013, Terry McAuliffe became the only governor to buck that trend in decades.
Despite a lack of quality opponents in the race, we know that unqualified and ill-equipped Republicans have been winning around the Commonwealth for decades. Join our Blue Commonwealth Coalition today to help us make history -- this November AND next year.

Friend,
Virginians have been out casting ballots in record numbers. If you’ve already voted -- thank you, it means the world to us. If you haven’t, we know you will. We aren’t worried about your vote. It’s your neighbors’ votes we’re concerned with.
See, we know that you’ve supported us in the past, that you’ve been a reliable Democrat -- someone we can count on -- but this year, we need to mobilize everyone to get out and vote. There are only 10 days until Election Day. Can we count on you again to chip in so we can make sure every Virginia Democrat votes this year?
If 19 people in Aldie give just $20 dollars, we can get Donald Trump out of the Oval Office and we’ll be one step closer to flipping VA-05 and protecting key Democratic seats in VA-02 and VA-07. Will you be one of the 19 people in Aldie we need to step up today?

The Trump administration REFUSES to adopt the
Equal Rights Amendment
Donate to elect Democrats who will fight for us
Friends --
In January the new Democratically controlled Virginia General Assembly ratified the Equal Rights Amendment as one of its first official actions. Virginia became the 38th state to ratify the amendment, which guarantees women equal treatment under federal law -- and the last state needed to officially add it to the U.S. Constitution.
But now, the Trump administration is refusing to recognize the ERA’s ratification, displaying a new level of contempt for women who dare to demand to be treated equally.
Will you chip in now so we can elect more Democrats who will fight for the equal treatment of all Americans?
Virginia, along with Illinois and Nevada, is suing the Trump administration for its refusal to adopt the ERA. The administration, of course, robustly defends its actions, relying on a technicality: an arbitrary deadline for the ERA’s ratification has passed. What they choose to ignore is that the House of Representatives already voted to eliminate that deadline! But Trump's stooge, Mitch McConnell, won’t let the Senate vote on the resolution to eliminate the deadline -- essentially handing the administration another victory in its ongoing battle against equality.
Friends, this administration’s brazen refusal to adopt the ERA, which Americans have been fighting for nearly a century, and which was rightfully ratified by the 38 required states, should be a wake up call for all Americans. As long as Republicans stay in office, they will continue to fight against equality and do only what serves their narrow self-interests. They will continue to hold us back -- as individuals, and as a nation. We cannot allow it.
If you’re able, will you please donate now to help us elect Democrats at all levels of government who will work for our best interests and move our country forward?
Thank you,

Friends --
Can you imagine if we had a U.S. Senator who pushed fringe conspiracy theories, called the governor an “enemy of our liberty” who “terrorizes” Virginians, and handed out assault weapons to residents? Well, come next November, you may not have to imagine it -- because self-proclaimed “junkyard dog” Tom Speciale (who’s recently done all of these) is running to replace Mark Warner in the Senate.
Will you donate right now to make sure we get out every Democratic vote this November to stop far-right extremists from representing Virginia in Washington?
Friends, Speciale isn’t even our biggest problem. Front-runner Daniel Gade is making gains in his campaign to defeat Mark Warner, and he’s got major GOP money backing him up. In a recent debate between the candidates for the Republican Senate nomination, Gade scoffed at landmark achievements for LGBT equality, calling them “this LGBT agenda stuff” and “special interests.” And then the candidates moved on to spend significant time discussing one of the most important issues currently affecting hardworking Virginians: Sharia law?? (Yes, they did!)
While these fringe, far-right candidates may have dubious relationships with reality, their chances of winning in November are all too real. The only thing that can stop them replacing Mark Warner in the Senate is Virginia Democrats voting in the largest numbers we ever have. If you can, will you please chip in now to help us mobilize Democratic voters across the Commonwealth and defeat the GOP in November?

Our General Assembly ratified the Equal Rights Amendment yesterday in a historic vote for our Commonwealth. Victories like these are exactly what happens when Democrats win on Election Day.
Listening to our leaders speak on the floor of the House and Senate today was inspiring, educational, and emotional for me. Seeing Democrats in the General Assembly take the reins of history and ratify this essential amendment makes me unbelievably proud to be a Virginian and a woman. After so much hard work, Virginia is playing a major role in affirming our shared values of fairness and equality.
I wanted to thank you for playing your part in getting us here. I know that this wouldn't have happened if you all didn't go knock on doors, make those phone calls, and most importantly, go vote last November.
The ERA was ratified on Martin Luther King, Jr.'s birthday, January 15th. That brings to mind one of my favorite quotes by Dr. King: ""The time is always right to do what is right.""

We’ve built an amazing, inspiring Blue Wave over the past few election cycles, but we can’t keep our momentum without our grassroots supporters.

2) Build on our incredible momentum to keep going and flip districts that haven't been blue in years.

This plan might seem simple -- but accomplishing each of these tasks requires lots of work and resources. And to make it more complicated, in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic we’re having to find new ways to talk to voters, turn out Democrats, and keep our majority in the House.
To make sure we can fully fund operations in our target districts, we need to hit our critical end-of-month goal of $10,000 by midnight Friday. Will you help us raise enough money to keep Virginia blue before time runs out? All it takes is $5 to help bring us closer to a big win in November.

John McGuire is keeping his word -- about not keeping his word. Last year, the hyper-partisan Republican delegate was asked whether he would finish his term in the General Assembly if he was re-elected, but he wouldn’t commit. Not surprisingly, he abandoned his constituents just weeks after winning re-election and announced he was running for Congress in the 7th District. Even worse, McGuire was recently caught making fundraising calls in the Capitol while the House was voting on legislation. He’s not even doing the job he was just elected to do.
He’s not right for Virginia as a Delegate, and he’s certainly not right as a Congressman. Just look at his record in the General Assembly to see how out of touch he is -- and then donate to keep him out of Congress:

In addition to the Trump Victory Initiative, the president's campaign has put its headquarters in Virginia. And now Republicans have exploited a loophole to allow their big donors to contribute more than half a million dollars each to Trump's re-election campaign. (In case you're wondering, that's 103 times more than an individual can legally donate to Trump's campaign committee!)
The election is just about nine months away. How many events will the Trump Victory Initiative hold in that time? How many Trump supporters will donate over half a million dollars? We can sit on the sidelines and watch or we can suit up, get in the game, and fight back harder than we ever have before.
We've chosen to fight back. Will you join us by chipping in toward our $20,000 goal right now?

Friend --
Two years ago, Virginians made history -- sending Elaine Luria, Abigail Spanberger, and I to the halls of Congress. This year, we can make history again -- by sending our entire congressional delegation back to Washington, and sending Qasim Rashid and Cameron Webb to join us.
I'm asking you to join me in supporting the Democratic Party of Virginia today. We know that the Get Out The Vote period in the final weeks of the election can make all the difference in close races. Driving up turnout is how we flipped my district in 2018, and how we elected Elaine Luria and Abigail Spanberger. It's how we're going to win up and down the ballot again this year too.
But running a successful Get Out The Vote operation takes a lot of resources. Between now and Election Day, our volunteers need to personally contact hundreds of voters. We're counting on dedicated grassroots supporters like yourself to make sure we have what we need to finish this race strong.
Will you join me in supporting the staff and organizers at the DPVA as they try and win this election? Anything you can give makes a difference and shows them that you have their back.

Friend --
We had a major win in the Supreme Court last week. The highest court in the land ruled that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 must be read to prohibit employment discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation under Title XII. It was an exciting moment to say the Supreme Court was catching up to Virginia, where those protections were already passed by our Democratic majority and signed into law by our Democratic governor.
Democrats in Virginia are committed to being on the right side of history. I’m asking for your help today in supporting these efforts.

Last week was a major ruling against the Trump administration who:
❌  recognized the Pulse anniversary by rolling back Obama-era trans-inclusive protections in health care
❌  barred trans people from joining the military and aimed to remove employment protections for LGBTQ+ workers
❌  uses trans-phobic language like ‘gender-confused’ and scaled back civil rights enforcements for LGBTQ+ students
❌  allows government agencies to work with contractors and organizations that deny services to LGBTQ+ people
❌  rolled back protections for homeless LGBTQ+ youth to ensure equal access to homeless shelters
❌  allowed adoption agencies to turn away would-be parents because they are LGBTQ+
❌  defended the ‘right’ of companies to refuse service to LGBTQ+ customers
❌  dropped an Obama-era federal lawsuit against North Carolina’s “bathroom bill” law
And Republicans in Virginia are still supporting the Trump administration, hoping support from the President will help them win in November. We can’t let their ideas take power in the Commonwealth.
Democrats in Virginia accomplished so much since the Blue Wave in 2018. Several protections for the LGBTQ+ community we passed this year go into effect next month, including:
✅  outlawing discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity
✅  banning conversion therapy for minors
✅  allowing Virginians to receive a new birth certificate after gender transition
✅  barring medical insurance companies from denying or terminating coverage to people on the basis of gender identity
✅  mandating the development of model school policies outlining the treatment and protection of transgender students
✅  removing gender-specific terms related to marriage from the legal code
This is what makes Virginia a civil rights leader in the South. This is what is possible when Democrats are in office. But there is still so much to get done. So please, if you’re able to make a contribution toward those efforts, do it today and help us keep Virginia blue this November.
Thank you for your support,

In the past decade, we’ve seen small-dollar donations from grassroots Democrats like you explode. Want proof? Just check out the chart below.
(But before you do, can you take a quick second and make a one-time donation to help us continue this incredible momentum? Our 2019 average contribution was $28.15. Can you chip in that amount right now?)
SMALL DONATIONS EXPLODE: How a decade transformed Virginia politics -- Democrat: 273,995; Republican: 19,705. DONATE NOW
These donations -- in increments as small as $20, $10, or even $5 -- allowed Democrats to win presidential, gubernatorial, Senatorial, and Congressional elections across Virginia.
And your tremendous grassroots support helped turn the entire General Assembly blue this past November!
We’re heading into 2020 with momentum, but if we slow down for even a second, we risk losing everything this November.
By making a one-time donation today, you’ll be helping us prepare for Election Day. Can you give $28.15 (our 2019 average contribution)?

Donald Trump is pouring everything he’s got into flipping our Commonwealth, multiple Republicans are challenging Sen. Mark Warner, and national GOP groups like the National Republican Congressional Committee are targeting our freshman Members of Congress.
If we want to protect what we’ve fought so long and so hard for, we need to be ready to fight on multiple fronts in 2020.
Thanks for standing with us,
Team DPVA
P.S. We couldn't have re-elected Sen. Tim Kaine and flipped multiple House seats in 2018 without small-dollar donations. We also couldn't have retaken the Virginia Senate and House of Delegates in 2019. If we're going to win in 2020 we need you with us again. Donate now.

Friend,
Daniel Gade won the Republican nomination for US Senate last night. And just like Corey Stewart and Ed Gillespie, Gade would be a rubber stamp for Donald Trump. Donate today to support Mark Warner and make sure we keep Daniel Gade and Donald Trump out of Washington in November.
While Trump’s mismanagement of the COVID-19 pandemic has led to skyrocketing unemployment and a tragic loss of life, Daniel Gade has stood right by the President’s side. He urged his supporters to ""just do normal things"" and praised President Trump’s handling of the crisis saying, ""the president's leadership on this has been great.""
Gade is far out of step with what Virginians want from their leaders. While overwhelming majorities of Virginians demanded action on gun violence after the Virginia Beach shooting, Gade dismissed their concerns, and said school shootings are ""not really a gun problem.""
He also opposes Medicaid expansion, a program that has given health care to hundreds of thousands of Virginians and saved thousands of lives, and opposes the anti-discrimination measures for LGBTQ+ Americans we passed in this year’s legislative session.
The bottom line is that Daniel Gade would vote the way Trump wants him to on every issue. And he has some big-money Republican donors behind him who are betting that he’ll put their interests ahead of every day Virginians in the Senate. We can’t let that happen.
Virginians want someone to go to Washington to do the hard work -- the people’s work. They don’t want Daniel Gade. Please contribute to help us keep Gade out of Washington.

It's easy to miss things when info dumps are constantly raining on your head. Sometimes, you just need a different point of view, a place above the fray.
This is that place. This is the VAntage point: A newsletter highlighting what's happening in VA politics that you may have missed.
The VAntage Point #1: The stories that get written
Here are a few things you may have missed in the deluge of recent news stories…
* After we flipped both chambers of the General Assembly last November, our new majority in Richmond passed long-overdue gun safety bills, delivering on our campaign promises to keep Virginians safe. Gov. Northam signed these new bills into law on April 10th.
* The governor also signed the Reproductive Health Protection Act, ending draconian restrictions on abortion procedures and halting the assault on reproductive rights in Virginia.
* Voting rights in the Commonwealth have also transformed. Gov. Northam signed a host of bills last week including automatic voter registration, expanded absentee voting and vote-by-mail, and same-day voting.
* We officially removed racially discriminatory language on the books that allowed for segregation in public transportation, medical care, and public facilities.
Stories like these are proof of what happens when Democrats win up and down the ballot. We’ve made amazing progress in the last three years but if we want to continue that progress, we need to re-elect Virginia Democrats in Congress. Donate today to send our entire congressional delegation back to Washington.
Until next time, this is the VAntage Point.
Stay safe,

Maybe Nick thought we’d forgotten... but he’s the same man who:
* After the Parkland shooting, ranted on the House floor that gun violence was caused by “the abortion industry.”
* Is staunchly anti-choice... and holds an A+ rating from the NRA.
* Ran a write-in campaign -- funded with $500,000 from a conservative billionaire -- because he forgot to file the paperwork for his House of Delegates race in 2019!
* Was endorsed by the Club for Growth as a “conservative rockstar.”
* Is a zealous Trump supporter.

Friend,
The National Republican Congressional Committee's (NRCC) entire purpose is to get more Republicans elected to the U.S. House of Representatives and a few Republicans from Virginia have caught their eye. These three politicians have been added to the Young Guns program, a list of candidates the NRCC has deemed “instrumental” in a Republican comeback in the House.
Ben Loyola (VA-02) is the latest to join the program and Scott Taylor (VA-02) and Nick Freitas (VA-07) have both been promoted to the “contenders” tier, meaning national Republicans are going to be focusing hard on these districts.
The NRCC provides direct funding and organizational assistance to these candidates with the sole purpose of getting them elected. We cannot let that happen.

"Andrew Whitley, DPVA",info@vademocrats.org,We are here to listen,"Friends,
This week has been rough on many of us. The murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and Ahmaud Arbery have shed light on a cruel truth about America -- that institutions meant to serve, protect, and enhance the lives of Americans are warped by racism and violence. Too often our leaders have not seized the opportunity to change these institutions, and the protests we’re seeing across the country are a direct response to that.
That is why people are standing up and screaming the sacred fact that Black Lives Matter.
As we participate in discussions with Black & Brown leaders in the Commonwealth, I wanted to reach out and ask for you to join the discussion. This is too big of an issue to think any one person can solve it on their own. No one has all the answers, but one step toward creating a more just society is to listen to those who have been silenced for too long.
In a normal year, Democrats would be canvassing neighborhoods across the Commonwealth, going door to door to hear your stories and talk about current events. We can’t do that right now, but we still want to hear from you.
We want to hear about your experiences and feelings over the past week, your thoughts on policies that can be implemented to defeat systemic racism, and what institutions like the Democratic Party can do better. If you want to amplify someone else’s story or simply want to share your emotions, that’s okay too. You can share your experiences, feelings, and thoughts here.
Our staff will be reading everything you submit, and if you’re comfortable, please include your contact information so we can reach out to you again to chat more about your ideas.
We believe that Democrats fight to give voice to the voiceless and we’ve worked our entire careers to try and elect men and women that will move our Commonwealth and country forward. 2020 was already shaping up to be one of the most important years in the history of our nation, and the past few weeks have only made that clearer. This is the year to have your voice heard at the ballot box. More than ever before, we need to hear your voice.
I won’t ask for donations to the Party here, instead please consider looking here to find out about organizations working every day to improve the lives of people of color around the nation.
Thank you for being in this fight, we’ll be right there with you.
Andrew

Democratic Party of Virginia
Countdown to end-of-month deadline Monday at midnight
Friend,
We have less than 70 days to go until Election Day, and less than a day to meet our August fundraising goal -- and we’re falling short.
There is so much at stake on November 3rd -- including the presidency, House, AND Senate. We can’t sit this one out! If you can, will you join our Grassroots Supporter Team with an online donation before our end-of-month deadline tonight at midnight?
This election will test the strength of the big, Blue Wave we built together in 2018. We are up against an extremely well-funded Trump campaign and GOP, who are getting HUGE amounts of cash from outside groups and special interests.
That’s why we must meet our August fundraising goal. And we need your help to do it.
If we don’t hit this goal:
➟  Donald Trump could win Virginia’s 13 electoral votes
➟  Mitch McConnell could remain Senate Majority Leader
➟  And the House of Representatives could fall into Republican hands -- erasing all of our gains
Friend, we can’t sit back and watch that happen. If you can, will you join the Grassroots Supporter Team by making your first online donation right away to help us keep Virginia BLUE? We can’t meet our goal of 1,500 new online donors without you.

Friends,
We know that there isn’t anyone among us that hasn't been affected by the coronavirus pandemic. We wanted to share some tips on staying safe during this pandemic and also let you know what the Democratic Party of Virginia is doing to keep moving towards victory in November.
Many people out there are spreading misinformation, both unwittingly and deliberately. Please make sure that you are following the guidance provided by the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC) and the Virginia Department of Health (VDH). They are the specialists and they know what they’re talking about -- please take their lead. Here are some of their guidelines.
1. Wash your hands regularly with soap and water
2. Practice social distancing (stay 6 feet away from others)
3. Stay home when possible (travel only for essentials)
4. Work from home when possible
5. Contact your primary care physician if you believe you may have contracted COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus
Governor Northam is providing regular updates about Virginia’s response to COVID-19. The press conferences can be viewed here → [[URL REDACTED]]
The DPVA is committed to electing Democrats up and down the ticket in November, and COVID-19 doesn’t end that -- it just means we have to do things a little differently for the time being. Our priority is the health and wellbeing of our staff, friends, and committee members. While our physical office is closed, DPVA staff are always available to help via phone and email.
Stay tuned to our website, [[URL REDACTED]], our social media accounts, @vademocrats across all platforms, and check in at [[URL REDACTED]] to stay up to date on how you can stay involved virtually so we can keep up the fight.
Stay well,
Team DPVA

Friend,
Super Tuesday -- and the Virginia Democratic Primary -- is TOMORROW!
We can’t wait to see who Democrats in our Commonwealth pick to be our nominee. We know that there’s a whole lot of excitement in our party for this election and for beating Trump in November!
But first we need 20 more voters from Aldie to commit to vote tomorrow. Will you take our Super Tuesday Voter Pledge right now?
The DNC has labeled Virginia as a “battleground state.” And it’s ALREADY being targeted by Trump and the GOP!
Because of people like you, we built a big Blue Wave, helped flip the House, and brought a Democratic majority to our General Assembly. But now ALL of this is in danger!
We need to show Trump and the GOP that we’re ready to take them on and defeat them in November. But in order to do this, we need to turn out in record numbers. This primary is a great place to start!
Are you with us? Take our Super Tuesday Voter Pledge now and share it with your friends and family on Twitter and Facebook!
Thank you for all of your support of Virginia Democrats. See you at the polls!

We understand that times are tough for many of you, and that everyone has been affected by the coronavirus pandemic. Please only give if you can; your health and safety are the most important thing right now.
Friend --
Have you heard about the corruption running through the GOP in the 5th Congressional District? The powers that be in that district are actively making it harder for their incumbent Republican congressman to win the Republican nomination this year. Not that we feel bad for Denver Riggleman (he votes with Trump 94% of the time), but that’s really just the beginning of the trouble.
Riggleman officiated a gay wedding between two former employees and he’s being punished by the local GOP. The party originally planned to have a District Convention in April to decide on the nominee, but with the COVID-19 pandemic, they were (understandably) forced to change plans. What isn’t understandable and reeks of impropriety, is where they chose to move the convention -- the church of Riggleman’s opponent, Bob Good!
Now Good and Denver Riggleman are engaged in a power struggle, trying to manipulate the election to favor them -- not democracy. Will you donate to the Flip the Fifth Fund to make sure we elect a Democrat who will make this district proud?

This is what the Republicans in the 5th have come to. The people of the 5th Congressional deserve better than infighting at best, and outright corruption at worst.

Survey for: [[EMAIL_REDACTED]]
Topic: Do you approve of President Trump’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic?
Status: Pending
Take the survey
Friends,
As thousands of Americans continue to die from COVID-19, and tens of thousands of Americans continue to be infected every day, Donald Trump continues to congratulate himself for the “fantastic” job he’s doing responding to the pandemic.
The administration even went the extra mile, deploying Jared Kushner to Fox News to keep the stream of praise flowing. “The federal government rose to the challenge, and this is a great success story,” he said about the pandemic that is still worsening in many areas of the country.
So we know that Donald Trump thinks he’s doing a stellar job responding to the pandemic. But we want to know -- what do you think? Tell us in this short survey.
Meanwhile, Governor Northam is taking aggressive action to protect Virginians from the ongoing pandemic. He issued a stay-at-home order through June 10, to slow the virus’s spread. And he continues to work hard every day to help Virginians stay healthy and secure through this crisis -- from taking action to expand our healthcare workforce, to making sure every teacher in the Commonwealth is able to continue teaching online.
A recent poll shows that the majority of Virginians -- 76% -- are pleased with the governor’s leadership during the pandemic. Only 50% of Virginians approve of how Donald Trump has handled it. But we want to hear from you: Do you think Governor Northam has responded well to this crisis? What about Donald Trump? Share your input in this quick survey.

The Democratic Party of Virginia invites you to join us for this month’s installment of In the Know: Political Updates and Happenings from the DPVA. We are thrilled that Kristina Hagen, Executive Director of the Senate Democratic Caucus, and Trevor Southerland, former Executive Director of the House Democratic Caucus, will be this month’s panelists!
Over the past few years, Kristina and Trevor have worked tirelessly with our DPVA staff to develop and implement our Party’s strategy to elect a Democratic majority in our Commonwealth. Their efforts flipped majority control of the General Assembly from red to blue, giving Democrats control of the House, Senate, and the Governor’s office for the first time in decades.
They’ll be chatting about the lessons we have learned from our success in 2017 and 2019, governing in a Democratic Majority, and the political landscape of the 2021 elections. You won’t want to miss the chance to hear from these architects of our historic successes!

The Democratic Party of Virginia has canceled all in-person fundraising events to help keep our Commonwealth healthy during this uncertain time. We created this series to make sure that our supporters can stay involved — and In The Know — while safely at home.

Virginia is a battleground state. Donate now to keep Virginia blue.
Friend,
It’s official: Virginia has been categorized as a “battleground state” by the DNC -- which means we’re going to have to fight hard to keep the GOP from winning up and down the ballot in November.
Battleground states will decide the election, and we have to start organizing NOW to fight the GOP’s efforts to take back Virginia. It’s going to take all of us working together this year to protect everything that we’ve won since 2016.
Will you chip in right now to help us keep Virginia blue in November?
Look, Democrats won Virginia’s 13 electoral votes in 2016 by a narrow margin. And Donald Trump won a few of the Congressional districts we need to win this year! We’ve had some key victories recently but Virginia is hardly a reliably blue state. This year we’re a battleground because our recent gains are all on the line.
Can we count on you to help us fight back against the Trump administration and other Republicans’ aggressive efforts to win in Virginia?

Friends --
Senator Kamala Harris is going up against Vice President Mike Pence in tonight’s vice presidential debate in just a few hours. This is a historic night -- it’s the first time a woman of color has ever stepped onto the VP debate stage. That’s why we wanted to make sure you saw our email from yesterday.
Will you donate before the debate starts to help us reach our pre-debate goal of $7,000?
Every dollar you give will help make sure Virginia stays blue this election. It will help to replace Donald Trump and Mike Pence with Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. And it will help keep the House blue by sending back a congressional delegation filled with Democrats.
Thank you for your continued support during an election where the stakes have never been higher.

Friend,
Donald Trump keeps screaming from his pedestal at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue that the people need to “LIBERATE” their states, while deflecting questions from the press by crying about a hoax he calls “Obamagate.”
He is trying to take away healthcare from millions, but at the same time, the Trump campaign is capitalizing on the pandemic by selling Trump/Pence branded masks to campaign donors.
Mike Pence has traveled all around the country not wearing masks, spreading inaccuracies, and carrying empty supply boxes into a healthcare facility in Arlington for a crude photo-op.
Meanwhile, Senators Mark Warner and Tim Kaine are working from home whenever possible and only going to Capitol Hill when necessary. They both went viral on social media for their efforts to educate and show how to be a responsible citizen during this pandemic: Sen. Warner snuck a handwashing tutorial into a tuna melt recipe video and Sen. Kaine has gotten some recognition and acclaim for the bandanas he’s using as masks.
Vice President Joe Biden has moved his entire organization into the digital space and is holding regular virtual town halls from the safety of his home. His campaign has recently stalled production on merchandise from his online store to give his union print shop the ability to adhere to stay at home orders.
Democrats have leaders in Virginia and all over the nation who are taking this pandemic seriously.
Republicans have Donald Trump and Mike Pence.
Donate today if you want to see Democratic leadership in the White House and Senate.

Friends --
The Congressional Leadership Fund (CLF) is swooping in with almost $2 million to bailout struggling Republican candidates Scott Taylor and Nick Freitas -- two Trump cheerleaders who are eager to roll back Democrats’ progress in Congress. This Super PAC dedicated to electing Republicans to the U.S. House of Representatives is snapping up ad reservations across the country, including right here in Virginia. That means they’re locking in low rates for TV and digital ads so that as races heat up, they can bombard us with ads for Republicans -- and against Democrats.

In just over six months, we will have the opportunity to put our country on the track of progress by electing leaders who will put the best interests of everyday Americans first. But the GOP is doing their best to make sure we don't.
Both Taylor and Freitas have deplorable track records of prioritizing party politics over the citizens of Virginia -- which is exactly why the GOP is determined to get them elected to Congress. We need to defend our seats in the House, and we're going to need all the help we can get to do it.
Of course we understand that many Americans are facing financial setbacks right now, but if you're able will you make a contribution so we can keep Democrats in Congress fighting for our best interests?

Jennifer Carroll Foy,info@vademocrats.org,Why we need new leadership,"Democratic Party of Virginia
Friend,
Last month we lost a giant, an icon, and a woman who had an indelible effect on my life. Ruth Bader Ginsburg made it her life’s work to break barriers that kept girls and women down. She has had an indelible impact on my life, authoring the decision that allowed me to become one of the first women to graduate from Virginia Military Institute.
President Trump appointing Amy Coney Barrett stands in blatant defiance of Justice Ginsburg’s wishes, and opens up the possibility that the Supreme Court will completely strike down the Affordable Care Act and Roe v. Wade. Senate Republicans are more than willing to do Trump’s bidding. This is another sign that we need to elect Joe Biden and a Democratic Senate. We need new leadership in the White House and the Senate -- which is why I’m asking you to donate $10 to the DPVA right now.
The staff at the state party is working day and night to re-elect Mark Warner, Congresswomen Luria, Spanberger, and Wexton -- and to send Joe Biden, Cameron Webb, and Qasim Rashid to Washington next year.
But they have a critical deadline tomorrow -- the last FEC deadline before Election Day. We need to show Democrats and Republicans that Virginia is a Blue Commonwealth in 2020, 2021, and beyond. It’s time to build on the foundations we laid in 2017, 2018, and 2019.
I know that times are tough right now, but we have 21 days to shape the future of our Commonwealth and our nation. I hope you’ll join me in supporting the party today.
Thank you,

Hi friends,
Donald Trump has been shamelessly exploiting his impeachment trial to raise money for his re-election campaign. From running ads proclaiming his innocence to flaunting the fact that his cronies in the Senate voted to acquit him, Trump has used his impeachment to mock the constitutional process and raise millions of dollars.
It’s bad enough that the president violated his oath of office. But to then use his misconduct to extract money from the American people -- it’s disgusting. And we don’t have to accept it. Virginia Democrats worked hard in Congress to hold Trump accountable, and now they’re up for re-election. Will you donate to Virginia’s Trump Removal Fund so we can make sure Virginia Democrats defeat Donald Trump and his allies in November?

In just the last quarter of 2019, the Trump campaign brought in $46 million \-- its biggest fundraising quarter yet. And the campaign admits that they used impeachment as a ploy to get all that money.
Let's show Donald Trump and his cronies that Virginia won't stand for his corrupt behavior. Can we count on you to pitch in to our Trump Removal Fund so we can send Donald Trump packing and restore integrity to Washington?

In 2019, Virginians donated $707,617 to Donald Trump’s re-election campaign.
We need to answer their flood of donations with a tidal wave of our own. And when Trump says he thinks he can turn our Commonwealth red, we can tell him, “Not on our watch.”
Can you chip in ASAP to DPVA’s Not On Our Watch Fund? If we can raise 10% TODAY of what Virginians gave to Trump in 2019, we’ll be well on our way toward fighting back.
Not On Our Watch Fund

DONATE
We know Trump is making a strong effort to flip our Commonwealth this November...
* He’s placed his re-election headquarters in northern Virginia
* The Trump Victory Initiative held 82 events in Virginia in 2019 alone
* And the president himself has claimed that he could turn our state red
Since Trump narrowly won in 2016, we’ve elected a new Democratic governor, re-elected Sen. Tim Kaine, flipped three Congressional seats, and turned the entire General Assembly blue.
Now Trump’s back on the ballot again, and he wants to flip Virginia and undo all the progress we’ve built over the past four years. Clearly, there’s some people in our Commonwealth who want to see him succeed.
We don’t have to let their donations go unanswered. Donate today (right now!) to DPVA’s Not On Our Watch Fund.

We are just 5 days away from this month’s In the Know series with special guests: Kristina Hagen, Executive Director of the Senate Caucus, and Trevor Southerland, former Executive Director of the House Caucus. Trevor and Kristina worked tirelessly with our DPVA staff to take the majority in the Virginia General Assembly — and their work paid off!
Join us, Wednesday June 10th for a conversation with Kristina, Trevor, and our former Executive Director, Chris Bolling. They’ll give you a behind the scenes look at how we flipped the House and State Senate, what it’s like to govern in a majority, and the political landscape of the 2021 elections.

The Democratic Party of Virginia has canceled all in-person fundraising events to help keep our Commonwealth healthy during this uncertain time.

We hope you can join us!

Virginia Democrats,info@vademocrats.org,Proof positive: Democrats put people first.,"Democratic Party of Virginia
Friends --
Virginia has had more early voters so far than almost any other state in the country. That’s something to be proud of, especially when you consider that only two years ago a study found that Virginia was the second-most difficult state in the country for voting.
Pitch in now to help us get more Democrats to vote early
So what’s changed in Virginia in the last two years? [Dramatic pause as all eyes simultaneously turn to the Virginia Capitol.] That’s right -- we flipped the General Assembly! Virginians elected Democrats who prioritize the democratic process over their own interests. Chip in to help us keep the blue wave going in Virginia.
Here are just some of the ways our Democratic-led legislature has already made it easier to vote in Virginia:
* Expanded early voting -- up to 45 days before Election Day
* Allowed everyone to vote absentee/by mail -- without needing an excuse to do so
* Eliminated the photo-ID law
* Made Election Day a state holiday
* Expanded absentee ballot drop boxes
This is proof positive that when we elect Democrats, our lives, our communities, and our country get better in tangible and meaningful ways. And that is why we must never stop working to elect Democrats at every level of government.
Will you chip in now to help us mobilize Democrats to vote early all across Virginia?

I wanted to be the first person to reach out and welcome you to the team, friend. The Democratic Party of Virginia is made up of some of the most committed, most fired-up people I’ve ever worked with, and we’re pumped to have you!
We had some great successes in 2018. We sent amazing new leaders like Elaine Luria, Abigail Spanberger, and Jennifer Wexton to Congress. We re-elected Senator Tim Kaine and Congressmen Bobby Scott, Donald McEachin, Don Beyer, and Gerry Connolly. And, we struck a huge blow against Donald Trump’s disastrous agenda by winning control of the U.S. House.
But 2019 will be a whole new challenge. After reducing the Republican majority in the General Assembly to the thinnest margin in years, we have ambitious plans to win control this November.
If we’re successful, we’ll be able to move forward on important issues like advancing gender equity, providing a solid educational foundation to every student in the commonwealth, and securing more affordable housing for Virginia families.
I won't lie: It's going to be a lot of work, but I know we can get it done with you on our side.

DPVA Rapid Response,info@vademocrats.org,We have a nominee,"Friends,
With Senator Sanders suspending his campaign today, we now know who will be going head to head with Donald Trump in November. Vice President Joe Biden will be our party’s nominee for President.
We want to take the time to thank Senator Sanders for moving the party forward, changing the conversation, and for inspiring a movement of voters to get involved for the first time. His contribution to this primary race and the Democratic Party won’t be forgotten by anyone here at the Democratic Party of Virginia.
Now it’s time to unite Virginia Democrats and build the strongest grassroots organization our Commonwealth has ever seen to win the White House and both chambers of Congress. Donate today to beat Donald Trump in Virginia!
Virginians turned out to vote in record-breaking numbers on Super Tuesday. It’s clear we are fired up and ready to take on Trump this November -- but we are not taking anything for granted this year. Donald Trump and conservative dark money donors have their sights set on Virginia. They are going to fight tooth and nail to win the Commonwealth any way they can. Donald Trump is already tweeting about this, trying to stoke division within our party.
Let’s make this clear: there is no path to the White House for Joe Biden without a blue Virginia. We need to make sure we have the ground game and infrastructure in place to beat Donald Trump and deliver Virginia’s 13 electoral votes to our next President, Joe Biden.

Republicans are beginning to outraise Democrats online in the race for Congress! A recent memo from the National Republican Congressional Committee reveals that their massive investments in online fundraising have allowed Republicans to raise more than Democrats online for five of the first six months in 2020!
And make no mistake, they’re going to be using a ton of that money to try and win the seats they lost last time around right here in Virginia! They’ve made it clear they want Virginia back, and now we know they’ll have the resources to put up a fight.

DPVA Campaign Team,info@vademocrats.org,Republicans are going after your rights,"Democratic Party of Virginia
Friend,
Earlier this year, we sent out an email talking about the need to elect Democrats who will protect and defend the right to choose. I’ll be honest -- it didn’t get the response we thought it would. It seems that a lot of folks think that, because Democrats control the state government and we have a number of Democratic senators and representatives in Congress, we don't have to worry about issues like reproductive freedom and access to affordable quality health care in Virginia. But we can’t afford to get complacent -- we need to keep up the momentum that’s brought us here. Will you donate today to help us keep fighting?
Virginia Republicans have nominated a plethora of “pro-life” candidates, but still don’t practice social distancing or wear masks at campaign events. The GOP's 10th Congressional District Committee passed a slew of hateful, vitriolic resolutions to attack LGBTQ rights, reproductive rights, and spit in the face of the separation of church and state. The GOP in the 5th District nominated Bob Good, who ran a single-issue campaign in his primary -- that he’s anti-LGBTQ.
Republicans across the country are trying to take away access to needed health care, including abortions, during the COVID-19 crisis. One Republican who looms large and affects us all is Donald Trump. He and his vice president, who we all know is an anti-woman, anti-LGBTQ Trump lackey, have been using this crisis for political gain -- not fixing a broken economy, nor protecting the least among us. We need you to help us make sure Virginia votes BLUE in November.

We need to beat back the attempts to take away our health care at every opportunity. It is imperative that we win in November to keep the rights and freedoms so many have sacrificed so much for.
Your contribution will help ensure that we win in Virginia once again, and make sure that we have elected officials who believe in the right to choose and that love is love, no matter who you are.

Democrats are making Virginia cleaner. DONATE TO ELECT MORE DEMOCRATS >>>
Friends --
It’s Earth Day, and Governor Northam gave Virginians a reason to celebrate our planet when he signed the Virginia Clean Economy Act into law earlier this month. This landmark piece of legislation puts the Commonwealth on a path to clean energy while creating thousands of jobs.
The law requires the state’s biggest utility companies to deliver electricity created from a hundred percent renewable sources by the year 2045, among other major clean energy provisions. It makes Virginia the first Southern state to set a goal of going carbon-free -- and it happened only because Democrats control both houses of the General Assembly.
Will you make a donation to help us elect more Democrats so we can keep combating climate change and create a cleaner environment for Virginians?

This news is especially welcomed at a time when the Trump administration is rolling back environmental protections at a horrifying rate. Now they’re even exempting polluting industries from monitoring their levels of pollution, and shamefully using the COVID-19 pandemic as an excuse. The Trump administration is removing restrictions on big polluters at a moment when they should be doing more \-- not less -- to safeguard Americans’ health.
We’re proud that Virginia can now serve as an example of how states can lead the way in combating climate change, while creating a healthier environment and bolstering the economy. Of course, we know not everyone is able to donate at this time, but if you can, will you chip in to help elect more Democrats this year and keep Virginia on the path to a cleaner and brighter future?
Thank you so much,

Team DPVA,info@vademocrats.org,What a year it's been,"Virginia Democrats made history this year.
Friends,
We accomplished a lot this year. It’s no secret that we had a historic election result in November thanks to your help, but with 2019 coming to a close we wanted to take a step back and recap some of our biggest accomplishments of the year.
In January, Medicaid expansion finally went into effect. One of our biggest fights over the past few years has been pushing to expand Medicaid in Virginia, ensuring that hundreds of thousands of Virginians would have access to affordable and effective health insurance. This year, it went into effect and the results were immediate. Over 340,000 Virginians signed up and got coverage this year alone. That’s an amazing result and we’re looking forward to protecting everyone’s health care going forward.
We passed crucial bills during the legislative session. Democrats played key roles in raising teacher pay, expanding no-excuse absentee voting, and nearly passing the ERA. Virginia Democrats continued to deliver for their constituents and our work helped set the stage for what is going to be an incredibly productive and successful legislative session in 2020.
Our Congressional delegation held Trump accountable. By September, every single Virginia Democrat in Congress supported opening an impeachment inquiry into Donald Trump’s abuse of power. Thanks to your efforts last year that helped us flip the House, our Congressional Representatives have been able to do their Constitutional duty and hold Donald Trump accountable.
Help our Virginia members of Congress get the support they need to continue standing up to Donald Trump. Donate today.
We made history in November. Virginia Democrats flipped six seats in the House of Delegates and two seats in the Senate to take full control of state government for the first time in 26 years. This was a hard-fought victory and your support made it possible. We set records with our voter turnout and won in places Democrats haven’t won in decades.
Now we have historically diverse leadership in the General Assembly. We didn’t stop making history on November 5. Come January, Delegate Eileen Filler-Corn will be the first woman and first Jewish Speaker of the House of Delegates. Delegate Charniele Herring will be the first African American Majority Leader. Senator Louise Lucas will be the first woman and first African American Senate President Pro Tempore. And more than a few chairs and vice chairs of committees in the General Assembly will also be historic firsts.
None of this would have been possible without your continued support. The Democratic Party of Virginia is now stronger than ever heading into the most important election year of our lives. But getting things done next year is not going to be easy. We helped set the stage for a groundbreaking 2020, but Republicans are getting ready to fight back hard. A lot is on the line.
As 2019 comes to a close we want to thank you for making this an incredibly successful year. Can we count on you to chip in to make sure we carry this momentum into 2020?

Friends --
2018 was a big year for Virginia Democrats. We made huge gains and flipped three target districts -- all thanks to grassroots supporters like you.
But the stakes are higher than ever this year. Another four years of Trump could threaten our Commonwealth. And we need to make sure we have a strong congressional delegation that will stand up for Virginians. After all, right now, the Democratic majority in the House is all that stands between Trump and a Republican Congress that will enable his utter chaos. Will you make a contribution today and help us send more Democrats to Congress?
Here’s a reminder of how far we’ve come. This is the breakdown of how Virginians voted for their representatives in 2016. That’s a lot of red.
Map of Virginia election outcomes in 2016
But in 2018 we made some huge gains and picked up three more seats! All because you helped us reach the voters we needed to turn the Commonwealth blue.

Friend,
Today marks two weeks from Election Day. The finish line is in sight, but now isn’t the time to take our foot off the gas. It’s going to be close in the 2nd, 5th, and 7th congressional district races, and we need to boost turnout across the Commonwealth to give Joe Biden a decisive victory in Virginia.
Our final deadline of the election is coming up at the end of October -- and we’re pushing to raise $30,000 over the next 11 days. Will you chip in to help us hit our last fundraising goal of the year?
Polls are showing a dead heat in three competitive congressional races. Election Day success will come down to turning out more Democrats to vote. But Republicans and their allies are throwing millions of dollars into making gains in Virginia.
We must meet this final fundraising goal to protect our incumbents and take advantage of the chance we have to flip the 5th district. Democrats can’t win big across the Commonwealth without your help. Will you help keep the momentum going in the final two weeks by rushing a donation today?

Friends --
Can you believe this? Last week Donald Trump announced he’s taking action to “terminate” the entire Affordable Care Act -- in the middle of a deadly pandemic.
Elected Democratic leaders are taking a united and forceful stand against the president’s reckless plans. But they can only actually stop him from ripping away millions of Americans’ health insurance if they stay in office -- so it’s critical that we reelect them.
Will you donate now, if you can, to reelect Virginia Democrats who will protect the ACA and affordable health care?
Here’s how a few of our leaders here in Virginia have already responded to Donald Trump’s threat to steal away Americans’ health insurance during the pandemic:
Virginians with pre-existing conditions -- and their loved ones -- should not have to live in fear of their health coverage being taken away by President Trump… I encourage all Virginians to choose protecting and expanding on the ACA this November by electing Joe Biden.
\-- Senator Mark Warner
For Donald Trump and Republicans to continue to chip away at Virginians’ health care, even in the midst of this unprecedented pandemic, is reprehensible. Republicans’ continued attacks on health care underscore why we need new leadership in the White House who will protect and expand the Affordable Care Act.
\-- Senator Tim Kaine
Countless families in Northern Virginia rely on the Affordable Care Act -- either directly for their care or indirectly through the protections it grants for younger Virginians and Virginians with pre-existing conditions. It should not need to be said, but apparently it does: the height of a global pandemic is when our leaders should be expanding our access to health care, not seeking to rip it away. President Trump should end this reckless lawsuit.
\-- Congressman Don Beyer, VA-08
In Virginia and across the country, communities of color have been disproportionately impacted by the coronavirus pandemic. Yet today, even with thousands of brown and black people across the country dying from COVID-19, Republicans are still working to make it even harder for these folks to access the care they need. This has to end.
\-- Congressman Donald McEachin, VA-04
The mere fact that Republicans are continuing with their irresponsible attempts to strip health coverage from Virginians is awful. But Virginians have a choice this November, and the opportunity to elect a President who will end these attacks on our health care: Joe Biden. The choice is crystal clear.
\-- Congressman Gerry Connolly, VA-11
Friends, we have strong leaders in Washington who are ready to fight Donald Trump and his allies to make sure Virginians -- and all Americans -- have access to affordable health care. But they’re only able to do it if we keep them in office. We need to do everything we can to make sure Virginia reelects Democrats to the U.S. House and Senate in November.
If you’re able, will you chip in to keep our strong Democratic leaders in Washington fighting for us?
Thank you, and take care.

Joe Biden has a running mate -- Senator Kamala Harris. Senator Harris has devoted her life to public service, serving as California’s Attorney General and then as Senator for the last four years. Donate today to help the Biden-Harris ticket win in Virginia!
Known for her no-nonsense style of governance and leadership, her staunch support of the people of California, and for holding the Trump administration accountable at every turn, it’s clear why Biden chose Senator Harris.

When Senator Harris decided to run for President in 2019, she used the slogan “for the people” -- a nod to her time serving as a prosecutor and then as Attorney General of California. To those who worked on her campaign and who serve in her staff, it’s more than just a slogan, it’s a constant reminder of why elected officials and their staffs do the work they do -- for the people.
Now, it’s time for the people to support a Biden-Harris ticket. Donate today to send them to the White House.

Pitch in to keep Virginia blue and hold Trump accountable this November >>
Friend,
Republican senators’ acquittal of Donald Trump has given him the all-clear to retaliate against anyone who participated in the impeachment process. But this November, voters will have the chance to hold Trump accountable and remove him from office themselves.
If that’s going to happen, we have to make sure Virginia stays blue on Election Day -- and with the Trump campaign already ramping up their campaign operations in Virginia, it’s crucial that we’re able to keep up.
That’s why we’re emailing you right now, friend. The Trump campaign wants to turn Virginia red in November -- pitch in to show them there’s no way that’s going to happen!
DONATE NOW
Every day since his acquittal, Donald Trump has continued to prove why he deserved to be impeached in the first place. He fired key witnesses like Gordon Sondland and Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, who simply complied with subpoenas from Congress, and he even fired Lt. Col. Vindman’s brother -- who was in no way involved with the impeachment process!
It’s clear that Donald Trump learned nothing from impeachment. In fact, he’s only been emboldened in his continued abuse of power! We can’t let it continue -- but we need your help to put a stop to it this November.
Will you make a donation right now to help give us the resources we need to keep Virginia blue and remove Trump from office on Election Day?

Friends,
The first presidential debate of the general election is coming up in less than 3 hours! If you can, will you chip in right now to help us reach our pre-debate goal?
Together, we built a blue wave in 2018 and flipped key districts, helping Democrats win the House. But now, we have just 35 days to go before the 2020 election -- and people are already voting here in the Commonwealth!
The Trump campaign, the Republican Party, and the outside groups that support them are spending HUGE amounts of cash in an effort to erase our gains. If they are successful, they could re-elect Donald Trump, keep the Senate, and flip the House back to RED!
That’s why we’ve set a goal of raising $5,000 before tonight’s debate. Will you help us do it?
If we reach our goal, we can help Joe Biden and Kamala Harris win our 13 electoral votes and have a big win on November 3rd.
And we’ll be able to send our Democratic delegation back to Congress, flip the Senate, and make sure that Virginia stays BLUE!
But friends, we can’t do it without your support. And with so little time left on the clock, EVERY moment counts.
So if you’re able, will you make a donation before the debate starts tonight?

We understand that times are tough for many of you, and that everyone has been affected by the coronavirus pandemic. Please only give if you can; your health and safety are the most important thing right now.
Friends,
Most Americans aren’t focused on the upcoming presidential election these days, for good reason. But we only need to look at the president’s handling of this deadly pandemic to remember why presidential elections matter -- and how high the stakes are this November.
If you can, will you pitch in toward our end-of-month goal so we can fight back against the Trump campaign’s efforts to win Virginia this year?
Since becoming president, Donald Trump has often disregarded Virginians’ best interests. And he continues to do so. Recently, he tweeted:
“LIBERATE VIRGINIA, and save your great 2nd Amendment. It is under siege!”
Donald Trump put the safety of Virginians at risk by encouraging people to go out and protest the governor’s current stay-at-home order which follows his own administration’s recommendations. “And take your assault weapons with you!” the tweet implied -- which many happily did.
Yet despite repeatedly undermining Virginians’ best interests, Donald Trump still thinks we’ll re-elect him in November! “Tell them we think Virginia is in play and that I’m going to be there,” he told Pence ahead of the VP’s visit with Virginia Republicans. The campaign even set up their national campaign headquarters in the Commonwealth, signaling their optimism about winning it back in 2020.
What’s most frightening though, is that Donald Trump may actually have a chance -- unless Democrats get serious about fighting back -- now.
Will you chip in to make sure Donald Trump loses Virginia big time -- and leaves the White House once and for all?

Trump Golf Trip Count: 258 since inauguration
Cost to Taxpayers: $105,000,000
Chip in now to vote Trump out of office
Friend,
In less than four years President Trump has taken more than 200 golf trips, costing American taxpayers at least $105 million. That’s considerably more than the total cost of President Obama’s golf trips during all eight years of his presidency. But the truly egregious part is that taxpayers are actually paying Trump to golf -- because the money we’re paying is going to his own properties -- and into his own pocket!
Will you chip in now to make sure Trump takes his very LAST trip out of the White House this winter?
Not only is Trump happily pocketing our cash while leisurely putting the afternoons away, he’s doing it while Americans continue to suffer and die during a deadly pandemic. He was enjoying golfing on Memorial Day as the number of American deaths from COVID-19 reached 100,000, and he was on the course again last weekend as cases soared to frightening new highs.
Friends, we don’t know exactly how much taxpayers are paying to Trump’s businesses, and we don’t know exactly how many lives would be saved if Trump combatted this pandemic with the seriousness and urgency it deserves. But we do know that these are only a couple of the many, many reasons he is unfit for office. Will you donate now to make sure Virginia votes BLUE this November and defeats Donald Trump?

Virginia Republicans have nominated EXTREME, Trump-supporting candidates.
Countdown to 11:59 PM EST on June 30th
Donate by 11:59 PM on June 30th to defeat them
Friends --
Virginia Republicans have chosen most of their candidates for the general election: a slate of extreme and out-of-touch Trump sycophants -- with the occasional ongoing criminal investigation thrown in. Let us introduce you to the headliners!
First up is backwards Daniel Gade, who opposes equality for LGBTQ people and has said Donald Trump’s leadership on the COVID-19 pandemic “has been great.” He’s going after Mark Warner’s Senate seat, determined to roll back hard-won years of progress in Virginia. He'll be nothing more than a rubber stamp for every nonsensical whim Trump has.
Then you’ve got former Congressman Scott Taylor running in District 2, who was already fired from the job he’s now re-applying for -- but didn’t seem to quite get the message. His claim to fame is his role in an election fraud scheme his campaign perpetrated -- for which two of his former staffers were indicted and for which he’s still under criminal investigation. And then there are his policy positions: He didn’t only vote to take health care away from more than 45,000 of his constituents, he bragged about it!
Donate now to defeat these
extreme Republican candidates
It’s troubling to think that these candidates are the cream of the crop for the Virginia GOP. They’re the candidates Republicans are pinning all their hopes on in their effort to “win back” Virginia. But what’s even more troubling is that they actually have a chance of doing it!
Friends, if we don’t want Gade and Taylor representing us in Washington, we have to act now. We have to support the campaigns of the great Democrats they’re trying to replace: Senator Mark Warner and Representative Elaine Luria.
Can we count on you to chip in before our end-of-quarter deadline on Tuesday to defeat the GOP and keep strong Democrats fighting for us in Washington?

Together, these candidates will help us redeem our country’s promise by sticking up for working class people, restoring fairness and opportunity to our system, and fighting for the good of all Americans -- not just those at the top. They make me optimistic not just about our party’s chances in November, but about our country’s future long after that.”
These endorsements are a big deal in a year when every vote counts and we have to keep up an advantage in enthusiasm if we want to win. President Obama is counting on us to make sure Democrats win these districts come November.
Our end-of-month fundraising goal is coming up and we need your support. Can you chip in today to make sure we help the candidates that President Obama endorsed win in November?

Friend --
The deadline to request an absentee ballot in the Virginia June Democratic Primaries is just ONE MONTH from today, and we need your help to fund our outreach efforts and make sure as many Virginians as possible safely cast their ballots.
The COVID-19 pandemic has led to big changes in our voter mobilization strategy. With more and more Virginians concerned about the risks associated with registering to vote and casting a ballot in-person, it’s crucial that we’re able to help people understand what they need to do in order to vote by mail.
One thing won’t change, though: Democrats are likely to win big when voter turnout is high. We saw it in 2017 and 2019 when record turnout helped us win full control of the state government for the first time in years \-- and given everything at stake in this election, we need to work as hard as possible to make sure turnout stays high in November.
So while we understand that not everyone is in a position to give right now, please make a donation if you can to help us fund our voter outreach efforts and keep Virginia blue on Election Day.

Today is Trump's birthday. Let's ruin it by setting a one-day fundraising record. GOAL: 10,000 dollars. Ruin Trump's birthday
Friends --
They say that a good gift is something that the recipient would never get for themselves. So for Donald Trump’s birthday today, we figured out the perfect gift: raising $10,000 in one day and breaking a fundraising record!
Donate today and ruin Trump’s birthday
We probably don’t need to tell you, but Trump isn’t the easiest person to shop for! We considered putting his picture on a fake TIME magazine cover -- but he already has one of those. And someone already offered him a solid gold toilet -- a fitting tribute to someone so “flush” with cash.
But then we realized that making his birthday our biggest fundraising day of the year is a gift he’d never expect! So will you help us disappoint the birthday boy by helping us reach our $10,000 one-day goal?
It will be a fun birthday surprise -- at least for us!
Thanks!
Your friends at the DPVA

Friends,
Over the past week, we’ve heard both amazing stories of communities coming together and tragic accounts of doctors and nurses being stretched thin. We want to take the time to thank each and every one of the medical professionals for, once again, putting the lives of others before their own during this crisis. Thank you.
All of us are learning how to navigate a new world, so we want to hear stories of how Virginians are working together (from a safe distance) to get through this. We have an incredible platform to highlight the best of us, and to call out the worst. We all know that the response from Washington has been lacking -- to put it lightly -- and we want to use our platform to get your stories -- both good and bad -- out there, if you’ll allow us.
TELL US YOUR STORY
We have all been affected by this coronavirus. Whether that’s losing a job, being forced to self-isolate, work from home, or falling ill, daily life for us all has changed seemingly at the drop of a hat. This pandemic has proven to be a test of all of us, of our character as a Commonwealth and a nation -- a test most of us weren’t expecting. Let us know how you’re dealing with this new reality.

There’s a lot at stake in Virginia this November: Three Democratic House candidates are extremely vulnerable.
Cook Political Report: VA-07 → Toss Up, VA-02 → Toss Up, and VA-05 → Toss Up
Thanks to your support, Democrats made huge gains in 2018 by flipping three U.S. House seats from red to blue. VA-02 \(Scott Taylor → Elaine Luria\), VA-07 \(David Brat → Abigail Spanberger\), VA-10 \(Barbara Comstock → Jennifer Wexton\)
But this year we have to hold on to those gains
and flip another district blue: VA-05 \(Cameron Webb\)
With these House races so close, we need you to come through right now to keep the blue wave rolling across Virginia! Pitch in now to help Virginia Democrats win big in the U.S. House!

The Democratic Party of Virginia invites you to join us for this month’s installment of In the Know: Political Updates and Happenings from the DPVA.  I’ll be hosting this month’s call with our panelists Kristina Hagen, Executive Director of the Senate Democratic Caucus, and Trevor Southerland, former Executive Director of the House Democratic Caucus.
As the former Executive Director of the DPVA, I worked hand in hand with Kristina and Trevor to develop and implement our Party’s strategy to take the majority in the House and Senate. We’ve spent countless hours working late into the night together to elect leaders that will deliver on our Party’s platform of common sense gun safety reforms, expanding voting access, and ratifying the ERA—and our hard work paid off!
Join us Wednesday, June 10th to hear about the lessons we have learned from our success in 2017 and 2019, governing in a Democratic majority, and the political landscape of the 2021 elections. Maybe we’ll even share a few stories from the campaign trail!

Thank you so much for your time and continued support of the DPVA. I hope you can join us!

DPVA HQ,info@vademocrats.org,A look back at the first month of the 2020 session,"Dear friend,
2020 is already off to a momentous start, with Democrats fully in control of our state government for the first time in decades. And we didn’t waste any time getting to work. Already in the first month of session we’ve accomplished some pretty big things:
* We ratified the Equal Rights Amendment, becoming the crucial 38th state to pass the amendment
* New bills to expand voting rights and make it easier than ever for Virginians to vote are advancing quickly
* Crucial gun safety legislation is passing both the House of Delegates and Senate
* Bills to expand LGBTQ equality have already passed the Senate
Your support has made this Democratic majority and everything we’re accomplishing possible. Can you help us meet our January fundraising goal of $20,000 so we have the resources we need to keep electing Democrats throughout the Commonwealth?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:

DONATE ANOTHER AMOUNT
But even though we’re on our way to a momentous legislative session, Republicans in the General Assembly are doing everything they can to stand in the way of progress. Session lasts just 60 days and the more they can jam up the process, the less we can get done. We still have a lot more on our agenda:
* Raising Virginia’s minimum wage above $7.25/hour (currently among the lowest in the country)
* Passing vital legislation to address climate change and preserve our environment
* Expanding reproductive rights
* Making health care more affordable
* And so much more!
A successful 2020 election year starts by showing Virginians how much we can accomplish when Democrats are in charge. And if we want to keep the momentum going, we have to meet our first fundraising goal of the year: raising $20,000 by the end of the month.
We don’t have much time left, and we need to show everyone in the General Assembly that Virginians stand on the side of progress and oppose Republican obstructionism. Can you contribute to make sure Democrats have the support they need for a successful 2020 session?
Thank you,
Team DPVA

Friend,
We have less than 100 days to go until Election Day -- and a crucial end-of-month deadline coming up TONIGHT at midnight! If you can, will you chip in right now?
In 2018, because of your hard work and dedication, we built a Blue Wave which flipped key districts and helped Democrats win the House! But now, in 2020, those gains are at stake -- as are the presidency AND the Senate.
Donald Trump's campaign, the Republican national, senatorial, and congressional campaign committees, and the dark money groups that support them are all spending MAJOR cash on holding onto the White House and Senate and flipping back the House. And they have nearly limitless resources to do it with.
That’s why we MUST meet our July fundraising goal. Will you help us do it?
If we don’t hit our goal:
* ➔ Donald Trump could win Virginia
* ➔ Mitch McConnell could stay in power in the Senate
* ➔ An we could lose all our gains in the House of Representatives and see it fall into the hands of Trump Republicans
Friend, we can’t let that happen. If you’re able to, will you chip in before midnight to help us keep Virginia BLUE?

Politico: Trump gets some good election news: GOP voter registrations outpace Dems
Folks,
This is not good news.
If we can’t register more Democrats to vote, Trump could flip Virginia on Election Day. We could also lose key congressional races in VA-01, VA-02, VA-05, VA-07, and VA-10.
Turnout will be key to keeping our Commonwealth blue and winning those congressional races, so we gotta ask: Can you chip in today to help us close the voter registration gap, turn out Democrats, and keep VA blue?
The Republican edge in voter registration isn’t the only ominous sign we’re seeing: Trump’s reelection campaign is already investing heavily here, and he’s leading former Vice President Joe Biden in campaign donations from Virginia.
All of this adds up to one unshakeable fact: We need to fight back. ASAP. Doing nothing simply isn’t an option.
Here’s something YOU can do right now: Donate today to help us register more Virginia Democrats and turn them out on Election Day. That way, our Commonwealth will stay a nice shade of blue.

"Shyam Raman, DPVA",info@vademocrats.org,Biden’s campaign manager says it’ll be close,"Democratic Party of Virginia
Friends,
On Wednesday night, Jen O’Malley Dillon, Joe Biden’s campaign manager, tweeted this warning to Democrats everywhere:
Now: Early voting is already underway in many states. Millions of voters have already cast their ballots. But there is still a long way to go in this campaign, and we think this race is far closer than folks on this website think. Like a lot closer.
Donate to elect Democrats
Jen is right. The race for the White House isn’t over -- a lot can happen in two weeks -- and there is a real possibility that Donald Trump wins again in November. This is a reminder from one of the most knowledgeable people in this election that we can’t take anything for granted.
The race here in Virginia could be closer than people think, and that might mean the difference between having Democrats or Republicans representing VA-02, VA-05, and VA-07.
We have a shot over the next two weeks to change our country’s course. By spending every resource, mobilizing every registered voter, and ensuring every vote is counted, we have a chance to win the White House, the Senate, and to keep the House. But we can’t do that without your support. Will you chip in $10, or whatever you can, to help us get out the vote?
Thank you for everything,
Shyam

If you knew how far your donations went -- we know you’d donate -- so here’s the deal:

We are ready to go the extra mile to make sure that Virginia Democrats win up and down the ticket, every single year. We wouldn’t be here without the support of you, and your fellow Democrats, building a grassroots infrastructure and giving what you can to make sure we win.
We know you're getting asks like this multiple times a day now -- but if you can, please donate to the DPVA to help us contact every voter and protect every vote.

ALERT: VA-02, VA-05, and VA-07 have all been rated TOSS-UPs by The Cook Political Report!
Friend,
KEY RACE ALERT: Two years ago, we flipped VA-02, VA-07, and VA-10 from red to blue. But this time around, two of these Congressional districts have been moving in and out of the Cook Political Report’s “toss-up” column, meaning that they could still flip back to RED on Tuesday! We also have the chance to pick-up another district -- VA-05 -- that hasn’t elected a Democrat to the House for a decade.
If we want Democrats to keep control of the House -- and to beat Donald Trump -- we cannot lose these races. But we need your help. Will you donate right away?
Keeping these seats in our column on Election Night won’t be easy.
Washington Republicans have been POURING cash into these contests all year. And they have gotten a lot of help from the dark money groups who support them, as well as from the Trump campaign. It’s all part of their effort to go through these districts to get our Commonwealth’s 13 electoral votes and to help re-elect Donald Trump!
Friend, the entire team here at DPVA is putting our all into helping Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and Virginia Democrats win up and down the ballot, in just two days. But we can’t do this without you. If you can, will you chip in now to help keep Virginia BLUE?

Democrats haven’t won here since 2010. BUT it also means that we’re closer than we’ve been in a decade to flipping the fifth district, and experts say it’s still a toss-up! Will you contribute to our end-of-quarter fund right now?

Friend,
There's a lot on the ballot this year.
This election isn't just about the candidates running to represent you -- all the progress we've made over the last few years is also on the ballot. Democrats in Virginia have been an example for the rest of the country: flipping Congressional districts Republicans have held for decades, winning statewide elections by record margins, taking the General Assembly, and passing landmark legislation on a number of issues.
But that progress could be undone in November if we don't elect Democrats up and down the ballot. That's why I'm asking for your support -- not just for my campaign, but for the Democratic Party of Virginia as well. Will you split a donation right now between the DPVA and my campaign?
We’re getting into the home stretch here, where every little decision could have a big impact. That's why I'm teaming up with the DPVA to try and make sure each and every Democratic candidate in Virginia has the resources they need to win.
This is where you come in, friend. We have the power to keep Virginia blue and move our Commonwealth -- and our country -- forward. But we're counting on our supporters like you.
If you can, will you donate to keep Virginia Democrats moving forward?
Thank you for all of your support.

The CARES Act ran out of money on July 31st. Knowing that this virus wouldn’t just magically disappear, Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats in the House passed a bi-partisan second HEROES Act back in May, to provide further protections for individuals, families, and businesses alike.
Mitch McConnell let the House bill sit on his desk for well over a month before Republicans even started negotiations with Democrats. Now, while there’s still time for your input, we want to see what you think needs to be in the next relief bill.

Friends:
We’re sorry to share more troubling news. But we’ve learned that Virginia Democrats are in danger of losing two U.S. House seats to the GOP.
The Cook Political Report has announced that the seats in Virginia’s 2nd District and 7th District are “toss-ups” in the upcoming election.
Virginians in VA-02 & VA-07 kicked out their old Republican representatives during the Blue Wave in 2018. They elected strong advocates for their constituents and women who won’t sit by and let Republican obstructionism stop them from working tirelessly to move our country forward. Needless to say, it would be a major blow to Democrats in Virginia and around the nation if these seats switch back into Republican hands.
Will you help us fight back against Republicans’ efforts to replace Virginia Democrats in Congress?

But there’s also a silver lining in the Cook Political Report’s recent rankings of Virginia House districts. They say the 5th District, currently held by a Republican, is a near toss-up. That means we could flip another U.S. House seat and send another great Virginia Democrat to Congress!
However you look at it, one thing is clear: Virginia Democrats are in tight races this year. We need every bit of help we can get to fight back against the GOP and keep Virginia -- and the House -- blue. Can we count on you to pitch in now?

Friend,
Last night, Donald Trump held a super-spreader rally in Newport News and vowed to campaign heavily to turn our Commonwealth red in November. New polling shows Biden with a smaller margin over Trump in Virginia than Clinton had in 2016 -- so we need to do everything we can to stop a Trump takeover in November.
Trump said 39 days from now we're going to win Virginia
Trump has been raising millions of dollars from Virginians for his campaign. His campaign is headquartered in our Commonwealth, and he’s been sending his cronies like Mike Pence and Betsy DeVos to do events across Virginia. He thinks he can win here, and it’s up to us to prove him wrong. Donate now to keep Virginia blue.

Trump and the RNC are planning to flood your TV, your mailbox, and the internet with lies and dark money-funded scare tactics. Virginia was the one southern state that Trump didn’t win in 2016 and we all know how greedy he is. He wants what he doesn’t have -- he wants Virginia.
If you want to keep Virginia a blue commonwealth, please donate now so we can beat back the dark money flowing into the VA GOP coffers!

Friend,
VA-05 has long been a Republican stronghold, but Democratic candidate Dr. Cameron Webb could change this in November. Before Dr. Webb won the primary last month, this race was rated as likely Republican. Now we’re building momentum and the rating is shifting in our favor! But the work is just getting started! Will you help to flip this district?
It is vital that Dr. Webb succeeds. VA-05 is an open seat, because the current representative was ousted in a bout of establishment GOP homophobia. Republicans chose Bob Good, a far-right conservative who opposes abortion in all cases, wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act in the middle of a pandemic, and opposes common-sense gun reform.
Flipping this district would also make Dr. Webb one of the first Black physicians elected to Congress, a massive accomplishment that should have been reached well before now. His election will be a major victory in the effort to keep a Democratic hold on the House and block Donald Trump’s re-election.
Dr. Cameron Webb is a great candidate, who ran on unity and equity. But winning this seat won’t be easy. Virginia Republicans and the Trump campaign are investing millions of dollars to hold on to this seat. Donate to help Flip the Fifth!

Friend,
Aliscia Andrews is the Republican candidate challenging our incumbent in VA-10. Andrews is a disaster, much like the rest of the GOP these days. She was one of SEVEN Republican candidates in Virginia who failed to turn in their paperwork in time to get on the ballot. And she wants to represent Virginians in Congress. We need your help to protect this district.
More important than her apparent incompetence, Andrews is also positioning herself to be a Trump lackey in Congress. She cites Trump’s racist, impractical border wall as one of her main issues, advocates relentlessly against the right to choose, pushes the narrative of military dominance, and spreads the lie that the Democratic Party aims to confiscate everyone’s guns.
Andrews is part of the dangerous wave of xenophobic, far-right politicians who want to undo the progress we’ve made. We can’t let this happen. It is vital that Democrats hold on to the House, take back the Senate, and maintain our majority in the Commonwealth. Our work is not done. Donate to help protect the tenth!

VIRGINIA REPUBLICANS HAVE RAISED
OVER $12 MILLION
Pitch in $5 to help us reach our $10,000 end-of-month goal and fight back!
Friend,
We’ve been warning all year that Republicans are trying to turn Virginia red this November. Donald Trump placed his headquarters here and he asked Mike Pence to tell state Republicans that “we think Virginia is in play.” But now it’s clear they’re raising the money to make good on their threats!
If we don’t have the resources to fight back against Republicans’ big money, we could lose all the progress we’ve made in the last few years. That means losing newly elected Congresswomen like Elaine Luria, Abigail Spanberger, and Jennifer Wexton, and allowing Republicans to take back the majority in the Virginia Assembly. We can’t let that happen!
We know that Virginians are with us, but we have to raise the money needed to make sure they turn out to VOTE in November. That’s why we’ve set a goal of raising $10,000 before Friday’s end-of-month deadline -- and we need your help to reach it!
Will you pitch in just $5 before Friday’s midnight deadline to help us reach our $10,000 goal and keep Virginia BLUE on Election Day?

Friend,
Donald Trump’s mishandling of the Coronavirus pandemic has forced me to be at home this semester, putting a halt to my education and preventing me from building lifelong friendships. But I won’t let my time off be a vacation, and that's why I committed myself to this election and to helping Democrats win all over the Commonwealth.
Will you join me in supporting the Democratic Party of Virginia today?
College may be a formative time in a young person’s life, but right now, nothing is more important than this upcoming election. Our country is in a time of crisis, and I couldn’t be more honored to be able to dedicate my time to the Democratic Party of Virginia, helping to elect great candidates up and down the ballot in our Commonwealth.
But our party is nothing without you and your support. Folks are already voting in droves here in Virginia, and right now donating $20 can make the difference, friend. Can you help me remind the nation that we are a Blue Commonwealth?
Trump can’t stop me from learning, growing, or fighting for my community. I want to use this unexpected time to make a difference. I’m making the most out of a tough situation, and I’m sure you are too. Let’s work together to make sure we are seeing blue in November.

Friend,
This week the Republican super PAC Congressional Leadership Fund (CLF) announced that they were spending an additional $45 million across the country to try to win back the House. Since Virginia is a top battleground for control of Congress, that means they’re going to pour in millions of dollars to try to unseat the Democrats we elected in 2018. Will you help us fight back against super PACs like CLF by donating today?!
Republicans have upped their spending in two of the most competitive Congressional districts in Virginia, spending over $4 million to unseat our Democrats. Can you chip in today to help us stop them?

The Republican Party of Virginia has a new leader -- and he has a plan to flip our Commonwealth back to RED! Help us fight back.
Upon his election as its chairman, Rich Anderson vowed to make the Virginia GOP “an election-winning machine that again elects Republicans and defeats Democrats.”

"Nick Scott, Digital Director",info@vademocrats.org,57% acceptable,"CBSNews: 57% of Republicans think number of COVID deaths are acceptable
Democratic Party of Virginia
Friends,
As I’ve been scrolling through social media the last few days, paying attention to the reaction to our Convention and the nonsense coming out of the RNC Convention, I came across a poll from CBS News asking whether the death toll from COVID-19 was “acceptable.” Fifty-seven percent of Republicans said that it was. I was stunned.
If this stuns you, too, please, make a donation today so we can kick Trump out of the White House. It’s the only hope we have of repairing the damage his “leadership” has inflicted on us.
I’ve got to say that, as we near 200,000 American deaths from this virus, seeing a majority of Republicans say that this is acceptable hurts. I grew up hearing stories of bi-partisanship getting things done in Washington, that when the nation faced a threat, people would come together as one to protect this country. THAT is what’s made America the greatest country in the world.
Donald Trump has turned today’s Republican Party into an unrecognizable shell of itself. They are now the party of Fox News, which they told their viewers that COVID was a hoax, and of Donald Trump, whose misdeeds during this pandemic response are countless.
We cannot afford Republican leadership anymore. They’ve let their hunger for power poison their party to the point where they think nearly 200,000 preventable deaths is a price worth paying. Donate today if you think that the COVID-19 response has been UNACCEPTABLE and want to see a change in leadership.

When Democrats vote, Democrats win. In the 2019 election, we shattered turnout records and flipped both houses of the General Assembly, giving Democrats full control of state government for the first time in over two decades!

Friend --
We want to make three things clear about Scott Taylor. He’s a cheat. He’s got national money flooding into his race. And he’s Virginia’s version of Donald Trump.
Keep Scott Taylor out of office
Members of Taylor’s 2018 campaign team have recently been charged with election fraud. The charges stem from a planned attempt to get a Democrat on the ballot as an Independent to spoil the election for Elaine Luria.
Now, the NRCC and ultra-conservative super PACs are funneling money into his campaign and buying up air time to place pro-Taylor and anti-Luria ads all over the 2nd Congressional District. Republicans with massive checkbooks are sending in blank checks to dark money PACs. The GOP knows they need this seat if they have any shot at flipping the House. We need to keep that from happening. Donate today to help Virginia Democrats remind Scott Taylor that we defeated him in 2018 and we'll do it again in 2020.

You may ask yourself, “Why would major Republican donors and high ranking Trump officials care about Scott Taylor? He lost.” Well, the race was close in 2018, and with all the money that is getting dumped in, there is a real shot that he wins this November. The GOP wants as many Trumpites in Congress as possible and with a Trump-voting record of 98%, Scott Taylor fits that bill.
He is more concerned about what Donald Trump and his bankrollers think than his constituents. Remember, if he cared about the people, his campaign wouldn’t have tried to perpetrate a fraud against them. We can’t afford to let him back into the corridors of power in Washington.
Donate to keep Taylor at home and away from our government.

Friend,
Donald Trump must be feeling the heat in Virginia. Recently he's been tweeting a lot about our Commonwealth and the work that we're doing at the DPVA. He's also painting a target on the Democratic Party of Virginia and our legislators and lying to the American people once again. We made some minor edits to fix his latest tweet:
Trump tweet about the DPVA with corrections made to read: The Democratic Party in the Great Commonwealth of Virginia is working hard to pass common sense gun reforms that make our communities safer. This is just the beginning. Let's make it happen, VOTE DEMOCRAT IN 2020!

Democrats in Virginia are working hard to pass common sense gun safety measures, not take away anyone's constitutional rights. And we're also working hard towards another goal: making sure that Donald Trump is a one-term President. After all, when he loses in November, he'll have plenty of time to learn how our government works and to spell our name correctly.
But we need your help to make that happen. Donald Trump's campaign is already hard at work organizing volunteers, registering voters, and setting up campaign events right here in Virginia. To defeat him this year (and put a stop to his ridiculous tweets) we're going to need a strong voter turnout operation. Can we count on you to chip in today so we have the resources necessary to defeat Trump in November?

Friend,
Virginia Democrats have shown you what happens when they're elected. In the Senate, Mark Warner championed Virginia, fought for the security of our nation, and sponsored a crucial environmental protection bill that will create thousands of jobs.
In the House, we've fought to expand access to healthcare, protect Virginia's veterans and active military personnel, increase broadband access in rural areas, and passed legislation to save our economy in the midst of a pandemic and recession.
In the General Assembly, Democrats ratified the ERA, took on criminal justice reform and commonsense gun reforms, made it easier and safer to vote, passed landmark climate change legislation, and so much more.
But here's the thing -- Virginia Democrats wouldn't be here without tireless supporters like you, friend. There is so much at stake on the 3rd.

Friends --
A new poll came out from The Economist last week with some bad news for Democrats in the House -- Republicans are neck & neck with Democrats in the race for the House of Representatives. 44% said they would vote for a Democrat for Congress this year while 43% chose a Republican. This could be bad news for the nation, and especially bad news for our Commonwealth.

Virginia Democrats have done extraordinary work across the Potomac in the last year, and we need to do everything we can to make sure they get reelected. With Donald Trump targeting Virginia and polls showing close Congressional races, Virginia is sure to be a battleground state this year.

We’re in uncharted waters running a campaign during a pandemic, and getting voters to turn out is going to take a lot more resources this year.
But this investment is going to be worth it if we can send Dr. Webb to Congress.

Folks,
Donald Trump is blatantly undermining the core principles of democracy our country was founded on. He is laying the groundwork to portray any victory by Joe Biden and the Democratic Party as fraudulent, rigged, and void. THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS. We need to ensure that Joe Biden takes the office of the President of the United States -- but to do that, we need your help. Please contribute to our End of Quarter campaign. Virginia Democrats need your support now more than ever.
I know that you’re getting asked to donate and volunteer and organize almost every day. That’s only because we know the importance of this election -- and we know you know it, too. By spreading lies and admitting gross incompetence in his handling of the pandemic, Donald Trump has spent the last few weeks proving its importance.
* Donald Trump has been spreading lies that voting by mail is not secure, even though he and members of his cabinet and administration have voted by mail for years. We all know that voting by mail is the safest way to vote during a global pandemic -- Trump is just scared he’ll lose if more people vote.
* He’s fired the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York, the same office that has tried and convicted many Trump associates since he took office.
* At a sparsely attended rally in Tulsa (under 6,200 people in a venue that holds 3 times that), Trump even said that he told his administration to slow down COVID-19 testing. He believes that less testing means fewer cases when all it means is fewer cases we know about.
These are just a few examples of the President spouting lies and once again proving unfit for office. He’s done this too many times to count -- but truly, the only way we get through this is with Joe Biden and our Congressional Delegation coming away from November 3rd victorious. Join us in supporting Democratic campaigns across Virginia today.

We’ll get straight to it, friend.
A new poll from VA-05 was just released to the public and it says that Dr. Cameron Webb is within two points of Republican Bob Good. With 13% of voters undecided, this is anyone’s race -- we’ve never been closer to flipping the Fifth. But we need everyone on board to help make this a reality.
Will you chip in today to help us elect Dr. Cameron Webb in VA-05 on November 3rd?

This district is changing with Virginia, moving from a solidly Republican district to a statistical tie in just four years -- but we need your help to make sure that this opportunity doesn’t slip away from us. We’re in uncharted waters running a campaign during a pandemic, and getting voters to turn out is going to take a lot more resources this year.
But this investment is going to be worth it if we can send Dr. Webb to Congress. Remember -- Bob Good, the Republican nominee in this district, ran a primary campaign against the current Republican representative solely because he officiated a same-sex marriage. This hate, division, and vitriol is what we’re fighting against in this race.
Will you join us in the fight to Flip The Fifth?
Thanks for your support,

Roll Call names two districts in Virginia as the key to the House majority
Friend,
Roll Call just released a list of seven congressional races this year that could make or break the Democratic majority in the House of Representatives, and two Virginia districts made the list: VA-2 and VA-7.
Experts are predicting extremely close races in these two congressional districts held by Democrats in Virginia. Can we count on you to chip in to help us protect these seats?

Republicans know these seats are “must wins” if they want to flip the House. This means they’ll be pouring in more money and resources than ever before to try to take these seats back. It’s up to us to make sure we keep these districts blue and continue the progress Democrats have made in Congress.
Will you help us protect the seats Republicans are targeting by making a donation right now?
These races were incredibly close in 2018, and with Donald Trump on the ballot this year, they could be even closer. If we want to keep our majority in Congress, it’ll be up to us in Virginia to win these races. Help us defend the seats we flipped in 2018 by pitching in today.
Thanks,
Team DPVA

Friend,
I have to be honest for a moment, we’re running behind this month. We’ve seen a dip in fundraising over the past two weeks, but the truth is there is an election in 26 days, and we need your support now more than ever.
We’ve hit our fundraising goals every month this year, but here’s the thing: so have the Republicans. They’re pouring millions of dollars into key congressional districts in our Commonwealth, trying to flip seats from blue to red. And now that we’re in the most crucial part of the election, we’re in danger of falling behind.
We both know that Virginia is still a battleground, that the GOP is still flooding our TVs and websites with negative ads, and lining the pockets of candidates and PACs with dark money and special interest donors. But we also know that grassroots donors like your are key to helping us beat back these Republican attacks.
So please, if you can, will you donate $25 to the Democratic Party of Virginia today?
Thanks,
Nick Scott

We need more Democrats to win in Virginia. Look at what we’ve already accomplished with a Democratic majority in the General Assembly:
* Expanded Medicaid to get over 400,000 people health coverage
* Passed landmark gun safety legislation
* Ratified the ERA
* Protected LGBTQ Virginians from discrimination
And that’s not even all of it!
All of these victories were because people like you understood how important it was to elect Democrats up and down the ballot. But so much of that progress could be undone if we don’t win big in November.
We’ve set a modest mid-month goal for where we are in this election cycle: $10,000 over two days. It may not seem like much, but it all adds up to a winning strategy that we’ve been refining and implementing throughout Virginia for the last 4 years. You’ve seen the success we’ve had here. Will you help us hit our goal this month so we can continue that success?

The Congressional Leadership Fund, a dark money group with a mission of helping Republicans regain control of the House, is focusing its efforts -- fueled by its huge war chest -- on flipping VA-07 back to red and making sure that VA-05 remains in Republican hands.

Donate today to help us stand up to Trump’s dark-money donors.
The truth is, Democratic candidates across the country rely on small-dollar donors like you -- the DPVA’s average online donation is $30.99 in 2020. This isn’t news to us, but it’s still a point of pride for Democrats in the Commonwealth -- and proof that we represent the working people who make Virginia great.

Republicans, on the other hand, continue to rely on the mega-rich, who’ve had their pockets lined by the Trump administration from the very beginning. It’s clear to us that they will throw every resource they have into getting Trump reelected (and they have a lot).
This is where you come in -- these next 83 days before the election are going to be some of the most important in American history. It’s in that time that we will have to decide if we want to restore the soul of our nation -- or let it continue being torn to shreds by Donald Trump.

Friends,
This year has certainly been one for the history books. As people take to the streets to fight for the right to breathe, install reforms, and speak their truth, I’ve wondered what comes of this activism and hunger for change if Donald Trump is still commander-in-chief in 2021. If we want to see real change in this nation, we need new leadership in the White House.
Polls are saying that Joe Biden is leading nationally and in key battleground states by large margins. All that serves to do is fill the Trump campaign coffers with donations from scared GOP donors and give Democrats a false sense of security about November 3rd. Remember, Hillary Clinton had a massive lead on Donald Trump a few weeks out from the election in 2016. And we all know how that turned out.
We’ve set a $20,000 goal and we have 13 days to hit it. Chip in now to help us stay on track!

Never before has Donald Trump proven less capable of leading this nation and that’s saying something. The fact that he and his “Justice Department” are calling for military action against peaceful protesters should be an impeachable (and removable) offense. Unfortunately, with McConnell controlling the Senate, we’re stuck with Trump. For now.
In 2016, many folks were guilty of expecting a result that never came, but in 2020, we have a chance to come together and get Donald Trump out of Washington for good. This moment demands we get to work -- we need you to join us. Donate today.

Democratic Party of Virginia
Friend --
Turnout is how Democrats win in Virginia -- it’s how Virginia stayed blue in 2016, and it’s how we’ll beat Donald Trump again.
Election Day is just two months away and the Virginia voter registration deadline is in just over a month -- and Republicans are beating us in registering new voters and fundraising.
We need to turn this around now \-- not in a few weeks.
Donate $20.20 to help us close the registration gap, turn out our voters, and keep Virginia blue.
The pandemic means we can’t go door-to-door to reach unregistered voters but we must increase voter registrations if Democrats are going to win the Commonwealth in November -- and it’s not just the presidential race,  friend. Key congressional races across the Commonwealth are at risk.
Our digital program is scaling as quickly as possible, and we’re limited only by our resources -- the more we have, the more voters we can reach. It's that simple.
Can you donate $20.20 today to register Democrats and keep VA blue?
Thanks,

Friend,
The coronavirus pandemic has impacted millions of Americans -- including many right here in Virginia. And it’s changed so many aspects of everyday life and how we interact with others.
With so much uncertainty, we’ve had to move most of our election year efforts to digital platforms. These changes are of course necessary in light of the social distancing we need to slow the spread of this dangerous virus. But they have made it more challenging to get our message out.
Friend, if you are able to, will you consider donating now to help us keep Virginia blue?
Donald Trump and the GOP are specifically targeting the three seats we flipped from red to blue in 2018: VA-02, VA-07, and VA-10.
With your support that year, we knocked on 4,500,000 doors and we were able to spend $2.93 million to elect Democrats across our Commonwealth. You made the big, Blue Wave that swept these districts possible.
But this year, we’ll have to do even more to protect these key gains.
Republicans are already POURING money into Virginia. The DNC now considers it to be a battleground state. And FiveThirtyEight has rated Virginia’s partisan lean as EVEN.
We need to protect these vulnerable seats, defeat Donald Trump, and elect more Virginia Democrats.
Virginia Democratic leaders at all levels of government are helping us through this pandemic. We need this type of leadership in the White House too.

Donate NOW to Kick Trump Out of Office
This is yet another attempt by Trump to suppress the vote by spreading lies about voting by mail and to set up his eventual loss on November 3rd as “inaccurate & fraudulent.”
Here are the facts about voting by mail:
* It’s the safest way to vote during the pandemic.
* There is absolutely no proof that it’s susceptible to fraud.
Donald Trump knows this too -- he just knows that if we have a fair and open election, he’ll lose. Much like the dictators and despots he admires so much, Trump is trying to hold on to power by any means necessary. It started with spreading lies about voting by mail. It escalated to sending federal troops to invade Democratic-run localities across the country. Now, he’s proposing to delay Election Day to stay in power as long as he can (even though he does not have the power to do so).
Simply put, we need to get him out of office, we need to win by a landslide, and we need your help to do it.

Politico: Trump gets some good election news: GOP voter registrations outpace Dems
Folks,
This is not good news.
If we can’t register more Democrats to vote, Trump could flip Virginia on Election Day. We could also lose key congressional races in VA-01, VA-02, VA-05, VA-07, and VA-10.
Turnout will be key to keeping our Commonwealth blue and winning those congressional races, so we gotta ask: Can you chip in today to help us close the voter registration gap, turn out Democrats, and keep VA blue?
The Republican edge in voter registration isn’t the only ominous sign we’re seeing: Trump’s reelection campaign is already investing heavily here, and he’s leading former Vice President Joe Biden in campaign donations from Virginia.
All of this adds up to one unshakeable fact: We need to fight back. ASAP. Doing nothing simply isn’t an option.
Here’s something YOU can do right now: Donate today to help us register more Virginia Democrats and turn them out on Election Day. That way, our Commonwealth will stay a nice shade of blue.

Democratic Party of Virginia
Friends,
Earlier this week we learned that Donald Trump knew about the devastating effects of COVID-19 and LIED, yet again, to the country. Bob Woodward’s tapes proved that, back in February, Trump knew that the virus would be “[[URL REDACTED]] deadly than even your strenuous flus,” while he continued to hold rallies and lie publicly about how dangerous it was.
We need reliable information coming from the White House.
If Donald Trump’s deadliest lie has shocked you, make a donation so we can bring honesty to the public and respect back to the White House this November.
The president's actions had fatal outcomes and endangered many individuals that trusted government officials to keep them safe.
We need to replace Donald Trump with a president that will put the public’s health and wellbeing above all else. We cannot afford to have more lies fill our country and have more lives taken away from loved ones.
If you think that the COVID-19 lies from the president are DISGRACEFUL, donate today.

Friend,
Virginians have been out casting ballots in record numbers. If you’ve already voted -- thank you, it means the world to us. If you haven’t, I know you will. We aren’t worried about your vote. It’s your neighbors’ votes we’re concerned with.
See, I know that you’ve supported us in the past, that you’ve been a reliable Democrat -- someone we can count on -- but this year, we need to mobilize everyone to get out and vote. There are only 17 days until Election Day. Can we count on you again to chip in so we can make sure every Virginia Democrat votes this year?
If 83 people in Aldie give just $20 dollars, we can get Donald Trump out of the Oval Office and we’ll be one step closer to flipping VA-05 and protecting key Democratic seats in VA-02 and VA-07. Will you be one of the 83 people in Aldie we need to step up today?

Friend,
Over the weekend Virginia Republicans in the 5th district decided to kick out current Congressman Denver Riggleman and nominate right-wing extremist Bob Good to be on the ticket in November.
This is a big deal. The district was looking competitive even before Good became the nominee. Now, elections experts are predicting his nomination gives Democrats an even better chance to flip the 5th.
Bob Good is a dangerous extremist. His views have no place in Washington, and we can’t let him win in November. To give you just a few examples of how dangerous he is:
* He’s extremely anti-LGBTQ rights. When Good was elected to the Campbell County Board of Supervisors in 2015, he signed a resolution declaring the U.S. Supreme Court “lawless” for legalizing same-sex marriage.
* He’s anti-woman. Good opposes abortion in all cases, even in the case of sexual assault or when the pregnant person’s health is at risk.
* He’s anti-immigrant. He wants to eliminate birthright citizenship, make English the national language, and require all immigrants to learn it -- far-right positions on immigration that would make it even harder for immigrants to make a life in America.
Bob Good is a right-wing extremist who doesn’t belong anywhere near Congress. Can you chip in now so we can make sure a Democrat takes this seat in November?

DONATE $10

With Riggleman out of the picture, we have an even better chance in the 5th district. Bob Good doesn't have the name recognition or endorsements that Riggleman did, and his far-right views put him way out of step with a majority of Virginians.
This is still an uphill battle. It’s been over 10 years since a Democrat has won this district. But this year -- with high turnout anticipated, strong Democratic candidates, and a far-right bigot on the Republican side -- is looking like it could be the perfect storm for the Blue Wave to hit VA-5. We’re counting on supporters like you to flip the 5th district this year. Can you donate now so we can make sure Bob Good never gets to Washington?

"Terry McAullife, 72nd Governor of Virginia",info@vademocrats.org,Why we need Joe Biden,"Beating Donald Trump
Democratic Party of Virginia
Friend,
You all know I’ve been around Democratic politics for a long time now. I know Joe Biden and I know the kind of man he is. Joe has shown us, time and again, that he is the person we need to right this ship -- a president that can empathize with the nation and has lived a life many of us can recognize. Proven leadership is what we need right now, which is why I’m asking you to donate to the DPVA to keep Virginia Blue for Joe & Kamala.
Now, I also know Donald Trump, and the kind of man he is. Folks, he just can’t do the job. He isn’t the person this nation needs today.
Those two days in Charlottesville were the most difficult days of my term as your governor. The ugly hate that was on display by those neo-nazis reminded the nation that extremism is still alive and well in our nation -- and it served as a leadership test for our president. Was he going to condemn white nationalists and nazis? No. He said “If you look at both sides -- I think there’s blame on both sides” and “... you also had people that were very fine people, on both sides.”
Donald Trump isn’t capable of fulfilling the duties of President of the United States. Joe Biden is.
In selecting Senator Harris as his running mate, three things happened -- Kamala became the first Black woman and first Asian-American to run on a presidential ticket for a major party, she energized the base of the Democratic Party to work their tails off to get this ticket elected, and Mike Pence got really nervous about the VP debate in October.
In his announcement video, Joe said Charlottesville played a big part in his decision to run. He knows that we truly are in a fight for the soul of our nation. That’s why I’ve endorsed him, it’s why I was so glad to see Joe select Kamala Harris as his running mate, and it’s why I’m asking for your support today. Please give what you can.

Friend,
You might not be surprised to hear that Republicans in the Commonwealth have been bothered by the public exercising its right to protest. Scott Taylor, failed House and Senate candidate, posted something on Instagram that has put him in the spotlight:
Meme posted to Taylor's instagram account: Dear potential looters, I wouldn't. Sincerely, the armed dads stuck in their homes for 3 weeks being forced to watch their kids make Tik Tok dance videos while their 401k plummets. With Taylor's comment: A little humor, but, for real
""A little humor, but, for real,"" he wrote. He might think it's funny to joke about pointing a gun at someone, but the meme is in poor taste and reflects a worldview that criminalizes protest. To even insinuate that looters are targeting private homes intentionally mischaracterizes the news.
Donate now to make sure Scott Taylor loses his election by a landslide.
He should be embarrassed that his first response to health crises and protest is to turn to violence. Under the guise of ""self-defense,"" Taylor advocates for civilians to turn guns on one another.
It's not right, and we won't let it stand. But we need your help to hold Taylor, and the Republicans who support him, accountable.
If you're able, will you please donate today to support our fight to get Democrats elected up and down the ballot and to keep Republicans from translating their dangerous rhetoric into wins at the polls?

Friends --
We don't need to remind you that the 2020 election is important. But the presidency is only a part of it. We have to maintain our control of the House if we want any chance of moving America forward in the next four years. And it's not going to be easy. In Virginia alone, Republican congressional candidates have already raised $4,403,166. And we're only five weeks into 2020!
Friends, if we're going to stand a chance of keeping the House of Representatives -- and Virginia -- blue, we have to ramp up our efforts NOW. Can we count on you to pitch in to Virginia's Blue State Fund to fight back against the GOP?
And we haven't even mentioned the Trump Victory Initiative yet! That's the huge, well-funded operation in Virginia that's raising money for the president's re-election. They held 82 events in the Commonwealth last year and seem to be going stronger than ever -- they've already raised millions from Virginians.
The truth is, we're running behind the GOP's aggressive fundraising efforts in Virginia. We have a lot of catching up to do to make sure we win in November. Will you help us do it by donating now to Virginia's Blue State Fund?

ALERT: In our 2018 Blue Wave, we flipped VA-02. But now, Republicans are trying to turn it back to RED! Will you donate right now to help us stop them -- and keep this key district in the Democratic column on Election Night?
The National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) just named Scott Taylor -- the Trump Republican Representative Elaine Luria defeated last time \-- as one of their “Young Guns”.
VA-02 voters have already fired Taylor once. He’s still under criminal investigation for an election fraud scheme his last campaign took part in. And he openly bragged about his vote to take health care away from more than 45,000 of his (now former) constituents!
But defeating Taylor (again) won’t be easy. Donald Trump recently tweeted out his support for Taylor to the base they share. Republicans, and the special interest groups who support them, are already raising a TON of cash to help him get this seat back. And The Cook Political Report has just rated this race as a “toss-up!”
Friend, the team here at DPVA is doing everything we can to make sure we hold onto this seat and to elect Democrats, up and down the ballot, on November 3rd. But we can’t do it without your help. So if you’re able to, will you chip in today to help us protect this key district -- and keep it BLUE?

Friend,
Remember Amanda Chase? She’s that Republican senator who promised to “shoot down” gun control groups in a campaign ad last year. The same Republican senator who blamed rape victims for being “naive and unprepared.” The same Republican senator who cursed out a member of the Capitol Police when she was told to move her car, campaigned with a pro-Trump conspiracy theorist, and got kicked out of her local Republican Party committee.
We could go on, but last week Amanda Chase announced big news: She’s running for governor in 2021. From the conspiracy theory-peddling Ken Cuccinelli to the anti-immigrant extremist Ed Gillespie to the Confederate flag-waving Corey Stewart, Amanda Chase fits right in with Virginia Republicans’ past statewide candidates. And it’s up to us to organize and stop her.

Amanda Chase has made it clear that she would roll back everything Democrats have accomplished this year. She’s spent her time in the Senate voting against everything from commonsense gun safety rules to a minimum wage increase. If she won the governor’s race in 2021, she’d take Virginia back to 1921.
That’s why we have to start organizing now to stop her -- or whoever the Republicans nominate -- from taking back the Governor’s Mansion next year. Amanda Chase is way too dangerous and extreme for Virginia. But if there’s one lesson Donald Trump taught us, it’s that Republicans will nominate just about anyone. She could end up on the ballot next November, and it’s our job to defeat her. Can you donate today so we’re ready to defeat any far-right extremist the Republicans nominate for governor?

There’s a lot at stake in Virginia this November: Three Democratic House candidates are extremely vulnerable.
Cook Political Report: VA-07 → Toss Up, VA-02 → Toss Up, and VA-05 → Toss Up
Thanks to your support, Democrats made huge gains in 2018 by flipping three U.S. House seats from red to blue. VA-02 \(Scott Taylor → Elaine Luria\), VA-07 \(David Brat → Abigail Spanberger\), VA-10 \(Barbara Comstock → Jennifer Wexton\)
But this year we have to hold on to those gains
and flip another district blue: VA-05 \(Cameron Webb\)
With these House races so close, we need you to come through right now to keep the blue wave rolling across Virginia! Pitch in now to help Virginia Democrats win big in the U.S. House!

Help DPVA keep battleground districts blue! Donate
Friend,
We’ve got our work cut out for us if we’re going to keep Virginia blue in November! In addition to defeating Donald Trump, we need to defend the new House majority \-- and that means re-electing the Democrats we sent to Congress in 2018!
Newly elected Congresswomen like Elaine Luria (VA-02) and Abigail Spanberger (VA-07) will be on the front lines of the battle for the House. The National Republican Congressional Committee is targeting both districts in 2020, and it’s our job to fight back!
Winning these districts again won’t be easy. In 2018, Congresswomen Luria and Spanberger both won close races to flip Republican districts. But with Donald Trump on the ballot, nothing is certain -- he won both of the districts in 2016!
Congresswomen Elaine Luria and Abigail Spanberger have spent their first term fighting across the aisle to deliver results for Virginia. They’ve both fought for lower prescription drug prices, been strong advocates for the environment in Virginia, and worked hard to secure better resources for veterans in their communities.
Will you pitch in to help us keep Virginia blue so they can keep fighting for another term?

Jenn McClellan,info@vademocrats.org,Why I need you to support the DPVA,"Democratic Party of Virginia
Friend,
I’m asking for your support. The Democratic Party of Virginia is gearing up for GOTV right now -- making the final decisions that will decide this election. We need to make sure that the DPVA has every resource they need to get us over the finish line in 2 weeks. Please, if you can, join me in donating today to help the DPVA get out the vote this November. Any amount you contribute will help us finish this election cycle strong.
Over the past few years we’ve won crucial elections in Virginia that flipped seats up and down the ballot. Thanks to the hard work of grassroots volunteers and donors like you, we took control of the General Assembly and passed landmark legislation to stop gun violence, transition to clean energy, protect the right to vote, ban discrimination, and much more. And as a state senator, I can tell you we have much more we want to get done, and it takes Democrats to do it.
We know what works to get the vote out -- making as much direct contact with voters as possible. And the DPVA is hard at work trying to reach every last voter. For most of my adult life, I have worked closely with the DPVA team to elect Democrats: as President of the Virginia Young Democrats, as a member of the Steering Committee, as a Vice Chair of the DPVA, and as a member of the DNC. I know how hard they work, but they also need our help! These final few weeks of the election are critical, and it’s when your donation can go the farthest towards electing Democrats.

Friend,
In 2016, when Donald Trump nearly ran the table in the South, you stepped up to keep Virginia blue. In 2018, when Tim Kaine was up against a white supremacist in Corey Stewart, and we had the chance to send Elaine Luria, Abigail Spanberger, and Jennifer Wexton to D.C., you pitched in and made the difference.
2020 is the most important election of our lifetime, so I'm asking you once more to help us win in November. Can I count on you to donate $5, $10, or more to help us hit our pre-primary fundraising goal of $20,000?
I'm asking you to stand up against racism, bigotry, hatred, sexism, and abuse of power. I'm asking you to stand up against Donald Trump once more and send him home once and for all. I'm asking you to stand up for Joe Biden, Mark Warner, and our amazing Congressional delegation.
I know what this election means to you, to me, to all of us. I've committed my life to the values we share and to elect Democrats across Virginia and the South. It has been the honor of my life to serve Democrats across Virginia as your Chairwoman. I couldn't be more grateful for all that we have accomplished in the last few years, but it's time to finish what we started here in our Commonwealth -- it's time to win again in Virginia.

HELP US REACH OUR 12-HOUR GOAL
Friend,
ALERT: Donald Trump is coming to Newport News today. And he will be joined onstage by Scott Taylor and Nick Freitas, the two Republicans who are trying to unseat Representatives Elaine Luria and Abigail Spanberger! If you can, will you chip in right now to help us reach our 12 hour goal?
We built a big, blue wave in 2018. Together, we flipped key districts and helped Democrats take back the House. But there are just 39 days to go before November 3rd -- and people are already voting here in Virginia!
And now, two of the seats we picked up are at serious risk of turning back to RED. Republicans are trying to unseat two first-term Congresswomen who have been working tirelessly for their constituents. Help us stop Taylor and Freitas!
If we lose these two seats, Democrats could lose the House. And if we don’t take action right now, Republicans could keep the Senate -- and Donald Trump could win our Commonwealth’s 13 electoral votes [[URL REDACTED]] quite possibly be re-elected!
Friend, we can stop this. And together, we can elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and re-elect great Democratic leaders like Representatives Luria and Spanberger.
But we can’t do it without your help. So if you’re able, will you make a donation before Trump takes the stage with Taylor and Freitas tonight?

VA Democrats,info@vademocrats.org,The VAntage Point #2: How we're expanding voter access,"Here are a few recent developments that were easy to miss in the deluge of news stories...
At any given moment, we're being bombarded by a dozen BREAKING NEWS stories slapped across the bottom of the TV screen. There's a blizzard of articles analyzing the tiniest developments in high-profile races and pundits endlessly argue with each other on the cable shows. It's easy to miss things when info dumps are constantly raining on your head. Sometimes, you just need a different point of view, a place above the fray.
This is that place. This is the VAntage point: A newsletter highlighting what's happening in VA politics that you may have missed.
The VAntage Point #2
Here are a few recent developments that were easy to miss in the deluge of news stories…
* The big news is that on April 28th the state attorney general announced that Virginians will not need to have a witness sign absentee ballots they mail in for the June primary election. Now all Virginians can safely vote without risking their health or potentially exposing others during the ongoing pandemic.
* Predictably, the Virginia Republican Party is fighting this measure that makes it easier for Virginians to vote in June. They’re pulling out their old, tired (and completely baseless) cries of “voting fraud” -- because they know that when Virginians vote, Democrats win.
* The ACLU won a federal lawsuit filed on behalf of the League of Women Voters of Virginia to waive the witness signature requirement on mail-in ballots for the June primary. While the Virginia attorney general had already agreed to the request, the federal judge’s decision is a huge win in the national fight to expand access to the ballot.
* DPVA Chair Susan Swecker and the chairs of the Privileges and Elections Committees in the Virginia House and Senate, Creigh Deeds and Joe Lindsey, authored an eloquent and forceful piece in The Washington Post that argues for the expansion of voting rights across the country. The Virginia General Assembly passed a series of bills before the pandemic started that makes voting much easier for Virginians, and that should be a model for the rest of the country.
These developments are proof that when Virginia elects Democratic leaders, our Commonwealth moves forward. We’ve made some amazing progress recently but if we want it to continue we need to re-elect Virginia Democrats in Congress. Will you donate today to send our entire Democratic congressional delegation back to Washington?
Until next time, this is the VAntage Point.
Stay safe,

Friend,
There are now just 3 days left to go until Election Day, with the final GOTV push starting today here in Virginia! But we also have a crucial end-of-month deadline -- the LAST one of this campaign -- coming up TONIGHT at midnight. If you can, will you chip in right now?
There is so much at stake, including the presidency, House, AND Senate -- as well as the future of our Virginia Democratic delegation. Three of the closest Congressional districts in the nation are right here in our Commonwealth, including two that we flipped in our Blue Wave of 2018. And according to The Washington Post, these races are ALL “within the margin of error”!
Donald Trump's campaign, along with the Republican campaign committees and the dark money groups who support them, are all spending MAJOR cash in Virginia. They want to get our 13 electoral votes to hold onto the White House, defeat Senator Mark Warner in order to keep the Senate, and flip the House back to red by winning these three highly competitive seats.
That’s why we MUST meet our final fundraising goal of 2020. Will you help us do it?
If we don’t hit our goal, we won’t be able to:
➞ Call, e-mail, and text the voters who still need to vote
➞ Make sure voters have a plan to vote
➞ Turn out Democratic voters across our Commonwealth
➞ Elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris
➞ Flip the Senate
➞ Send our Democratic delegation back to Congress
➞ ... Keep Virginia BLUE!

Friends,
150 days. That’s all the time we have to right the wrongs of the last four years of Donald Trump. That’s all the time we have to take control of the United States Senate & reelect Mark Warner. That’s all the time we have to ensure we send our Congressional delegation back to Washington and keep the House of Representatives.
As we all know, these aren’t normal times. The protests and the civil discourse of the Black Lives Matter movement are changing the fabric of our society and casting light upon an issue that has been in the shadows of America’s political dialogue for far too long.
While we work toward the goals of equality for all in the great experiment called the United States, we cannot forget that change comes for the powerful on Election Day. It is the day that we hold accountable the leaders who have failed us and our communities. It is when the chickens come home to roost.
Donald Trump has done nothing but shift blame, complain, sow division and discord, and run away from crisis after crisis -- manufactured or otherwise, in his time in the Oval Office. Mitch McConnell cares more about putting wholly unqualified former aides in lifetime appointments to some of the highest courts in the nation than he does about the American people. These men do not deserve to hold on to the power they so blatantly abuse.
We have 150 days to plan, organize, mobilize, and vote. We need your help to get it done. Please donate today.

Team DPVA,info@vademocrats.org,Good news and bad news for the 2020 session,"Republicans are already gearing up to stonewall our agenda
Friend,
The new Virginia General Assembly session begins next week and we’ve got some good news to share (along with some bad news).
The good news is that all of our hard work organizing and winning tough races over the last few years is paying off. This is the first session in decades where Democrats are in full control, and we have the chance to finally make some long-needed change throughout the Commonwealth.
We have a chance to:
* Pass commonsense gun safety laws (like universal background checks) that the vast majority of Virginians support
* Ratify the Equal Rights Amendment, making Virginia the crucial 38th state to pass the amendment
* Raise Virginia’s minimum wage above $7.25/hour (currently among the lowest in the country)
* Pass much-needed legislation to address climate change and preserve our environment
We’re on the cusp of making these historic changes because of your support in 2019. But Republicans are gearing up for a fight in 2020. Can we count on your support to help us deliver on our promises in 2020?
Here’s the bad news: Republicans in the General Assembly are already getting ready to prevent Democrats from fulfilling the promises we made to Virginians. The new House Minority Leader, Delegate Todd Gilbert, vowed that Republicans are going to fight our agenda “at every turn” next year. We can’t let them succeed, which is why we’re counting on your support.
Change never comes easily, and with so much at stake next year, we need to show Democrats in the Assembly that we have their backs. Republicans are already organizing to stop some of our most ambitious proposals, and they’re already putting together lists of Democrats they're planning to target in 2021.
It’s absolutely critical to start the new year off strong to show that our Democratic majority is here to stay. We’re going to be taking on Republicans at every level next year, and we need your help to make sure Democrats have the resources they need to fight back and have a successful 2020 session.
With so much at stake next year, Republicans in the Assembly are going to do everything they can to stop our historic agenda from passing. Can you chip in to make sure Democrats have the support they need for a successful 2020 session?

We have less than 50 days left before Election Day -- every day is critical, every voter contact could swing an undecided voter, and every dollar contributed helps us reach more voters.
That’s why I’m asking you to help us hit our September mid-month goal of $10,000 by midnight tomorrow. What we raise today will set the stage for how much we can do to support Democrats in the final weeks before the election. Will you help?

We need more Democrats to win in Virginia. Look at what we’ve already accomplished with a Democratic majority in the General Assembly:
* Expanded Medicaid to get over 400,000 people health coverage
* Passed landmark gun safety legislation
* Ratified the ERA
* Protected LGBTQ Virginians from discrimination
And that’s not even all of it!
All of these victories were because people like you understood how important it was to elect Democrats up and down the ballot. But so much of that progress could be undone if we don’t win big in November.
We’ve set a modest mid-month goal for where we are in this election cycle: $10,000 over two days. It may not seem like much, but it all adds up to a winning strategy that we’ve been refining and implementing throughout Virginia for the last 4 years. You’ve seen the success we’ve had here. Will you help us hit our goal this month so we can continue that success?

Donald Trump and the Republicans have their eyes on Virginia... HELP US KEEP IT BLUE
Friend,
We’ve got some bad news: Donald Trump and the Republicans have their eyes on Virginia -- and they are trying to flip it RED! Can you please donate before our end-of-quarter deadline on Tuesday at midnight to help us keep it BLUE?
The National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) is spending some MAJOR cash on putting our Commonwealth back into the Republican column on Election Night in November. And they’ve just made a $600,000 ad buy in Richmond against Rep. Abigail Spanberger! This brings the total to over $2 million spent against Congresswoman Spanberger so far this cycle.
Rep. Spanberger’s district, VA-07, was one of the seats we flipped from red to blue when we won back the House in the 2018 Blue Wave. But now we’re in the middle of a presidential election year -- and Virginia is, once again, a swing state, with an EVEN partisan lean according to FiveThirtyEight.
Friend, it’s going to take every single one of us to keep Virginia BLUE. We need to replace Donald Trump with Joe Biden in the White House and send our amazing slate of congressional candidates, including Rep. Spanberger, back to Washington. And we also need to elect new Virginia Democrats, up and down the ballot.
We have a crucial deadline coming up -- and we need 17 people from Aldie to step up before midnight on Tuesday. So if you’re able to, will you chip in by then?

Nick Scott,info@vademocrats.org,It's Official,"Friend,
Saturday was an interesting day in Virginia’s 7th district.
Republicans in VA-07 gathered (in person, in the middle of a pandemic) to decide which right-wing extremist to nominate for the House of Representatives. They ended up nominating Delegate Nick Freitas, who has made a career of sitting deep in the pockets of conservative mega-donors and standing with alt-right groups. We need to keep him out of Washington. Please chip in what you can to help us win in VA-07 -- every dollar counts.
For those of you who missed the action on Saturday, here’s a brief recap of what went down:
* Rand Paul (a staunch Nick Freitas supporter) and his PAC gave away an AR-15 in a raffle \-- a raffle that meant more to some of the attendees than actually voting for their nominee.
* As a result, it took Nick Frietas three (!!!) ballots to get a majority of the vote -- in the midst of the backroom deals being made by candidates, the race was decided by fewer than 2,500 people.
* Over two dozen people reportedly passed out from heatstroke at the event, which was held outside in the middle of the hot Virginia summer. You have to wonder why the local GOP committee didn’t have “chill out” tents for folks to go hydrate and cool off.
Donate now to stop Freitas from turning VA-07 red again -- and stop the spread of right-wing extremism.
Even before Saturday, Freitas had put people in the 7th district at risk of COVID-19 infection by holding in-person campaign events without masks or social distancing. It seems clear that he is willing to put his political campaign over the health and safety of the people he wants to represent.
Freitas’s “legislative accomplishments” and anti-choice, pro-NRA, hyper-partisan, right-wing conspiracy theories stand in stark contrast to what the people of the 7th want -- and what Virginia has come to stand for in the South and nationally. We don’t need Nick Freitas, we don’t want Nick Freitas, and we certainly can’t allow him to represent us in Washington.

It's taken Virginia Democrats nearly ten years to recover from historic losses in 2010 and 2011. After losing the governorship in 2009, we lost three seats in Congress, lost our majority in the State Senate and lost a number of seats in the House of Delegates. But finally, Democrats are achieving major victories and we can proudly say that with your help, we've turned Virginia blue. But now is the truly hard part -- keeping Virginia blue.

We need to protect the progress we’ve made. In 2016, Donald Trump made traditionally blue states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin super competitive. And Democratic majorities in state legislatures across the country have slipped away over the past several years. Now that Democrats have power in Virginia, it can be tempting to take our foot off the gas. But that’s exactly what Republicans want.
Decision-makers in DC and around the nation are starting to take Virginia for granted. They’ve turned their focus to other states they want to flip. Meanwhile, conservative groups haven’t given up in Virginia. They’re pouring hundreds of thousands of dollars into races here, hoping they catch Democrats slacking off.
We need your help to combat this flood of dark money pouring into our Commonwealth. We need you to step up and donate today. Every dollar you donate means more doors knocked, more phone calls made, and more voters to the polls. And we know when turnout is high, Democrats win.
Virginia is blue, but our Commonwealth only stays that way with your help. We need you now more than ever before.

Donate now to help close the gap!
This could mean that Trump voters are more energized than Democratic voters. It could mean that the Trump campaign is investing heavily in the Commonwealth. But whatever it means, it’s definitely not great for our chances of keeping Virginia blue in 2020 -- and for electing a Democratic president.

Democratic Party of Virginia
Friends,
Last night’s debate was further proof that Donald Trump is not capable of being the President. It’s clear that Joe Biden, even when being interrupted at nearly every turn, won that debate. And it’s clear that we need to elect Joe Biden in November. Will you donate to the DPVA to help us end this nightmare?
Trump has lied to the American people over 20,000 times since he took office, it’s time that we have an administration that tells us the truth, and that cares about you, your jobs, your family, the environment, and our standing around the world.
That’s what the Biden-Harris Administration will do, but we need your help to make sure everyone votes. Donate today to help us get a Biden-Harris Administration in the White House.
Last night Joe said “[Trump] cannot stop you from being able to determine the outcome of this election... If we get the votes it's going to be all over, he’s gonna go, he can't stay in power.”
We need to make sure we get the votes. And to do that we need to double down on our efforts to register as many voters, make as many phone calls, and turn out as many Democrats as possible before Election Day. Our September fundraising deadline is today. Can you help us make sure we turn out as many voters as possible by contributing today?

Friends --
Can you imagine if we had a U.S. Senator who pushed fringe conspiracy theories, called the governor an “enemy of our liberty” who “terrorizes” Virginians, and handed out assault weapons to residents? Well, come next November, you may not have to imagine it -- because self-proclaimed “junkyard dog” Tom Speciale (who’s recently done all of these) is running to replace Mark Warner in the Senate.
Will you donate right now to make sure we get out every Democratic vote this November to stop far-right extremists from representing Virginia in Washington?
Friends, Speciale isn’t even our biggest problem. Front-runner Daniel Gade is making gains in his campaign to defeat Mark Warner, and he’s got major GOP money backing him up. In a recent debate between the candidates for the Republican Senate nomination, Gade scoffed at landmark achievements for LGBT equality, calling them “this LGBT agenda stuff” and “special interests.” And then the candidates moved on to spend significant time discussing one of the most important issues currently affecting hardworking Virginians: Sharia law?? (Yes, they did!)
While these fringe, far-right candidates may have dubious relationships with reality, their chances of winning in November are all too real. The only thing that can stop them replacing Mark Warner in the Senate is Virginia Democrats voting in the largest numbers we ever have. If you can, will you please chip in now to help us mobilize Democratic voters across the Commonwealth and defeat the GOP in November?

"Ellen, UVA Student",info@vademocrats.org,What Cameron Webb’s campaign means to me,"Virginia’s Fifth Congressional District is up for grabs
Democratic Party of Virginia
Friend,
Virginia’s Fifth Congressional District is up for grabs this year, with the GOP nominating a homophobic bigot and the Democrats in VA-05 nominating Dr. Cameron Webb, a highly qualified public servant, accomplished physician, and former policy advisor to Barack Obama.
Electing Dr. Webb to represent VA-05 in Congress will prove to the nation, yet again, just how far Virginia has come. Will you donate today to help Dr. Webb and other Virginia Democrats keep our Commonwealth blue?
As a student at UVA, I have seen the groundswell of support for Dr. Webb among students, staff, and other folks in the Charlottesville community. I’ve seen the steps that Charlottesville has taken to evolve and confront the issues that came to light after the infamous rally in 2017 that concerned many residents of VA-05. Dr. Webb knows what it means to be a part of this community, to take no one for granted, and to make sure that no voice is left silenced or unheard.
That’s why I decided to work with the Democratic Party of Virginia this year -- to get Dr. Webb and all the other Democrats around the Commonwealth elected this November -- and it’s why I’m asking you to support us today.
I’m proud to be an honorary resident of VA-05 while I attend UVA, but I know that we have more work to do. It’s time we elected another fellow Wahoo to represent Virginia. Let’s get to it.

First, you’ve got Nick Frietas and John McGuire who are both looking to replace Representative Abigail Spanberger in the U.S. House of Representatives. They’re not just competing with each other for the GOP nomination, they’re also competing to be the most ineffective Virginia legislator: Frietas has passed a grand total of 0 bills this year, and McGuire has actually tried to move Virginia backwards by voting against Medicaid expansion in 2018 and against the Equal Rights Amendment this year.
Then, you’ve got Amanda Chase \-- a right-wing extremist who recently announced her candidacy for Virginia governor next year. As a state legislator, she’s claimed that rape victims are attacked because they are “naive and unprepared” and has openly carried a gun onto the Virginia Senate floor to act as a “deterrent for over-exuberant” Senate colleagues.
And don’t forget about Scott Taylor, who’s looking to unseat Representative Elaine Luria in Congress. Here's the thing: The people of Virginia voted him out of the House of Representatives just two years ago and replaced him with Elaine Luria. He obviously hasn't accepted that Virginians don’t want a Trump rubber stamp representing them in Washington.
Friends, these candidates are serious about reclaiming Virginia for the GOP. If we want to keep Virginia blue and moving forward, we all have to do our part.
Will you make a donation before midnight so we can meet our end-of-month goal and make sure we keep Democrats who are fighting for us in office?

“Six months before a presidential election in which turnout could matter more than persuasion, the Republican Party, the Trump campaign and conservative activists are mounting an aggressive national effort to shape who gets to vote in November -- and whose ballots are counted.”
\-- New York Times
Friends,
You read that right. Donald Trump and the RNC are gearing up for the greatest voter suppression campaign since the Voting Rights Act was signed into law. They brought their plan out in the open because they don’t care about any ramifications if it wins them the White House.
Republicans have never played fair and now, they’re getting ready to spend $20,000,000.00 fighting legal challenges by Democrats trying to vote. This is what we’ve been fighting against all these years. Donate now to help us fight back.

Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans know that they’re in hot water, so they’ve concocted a scheme to recruit volunteer “poll monitors” to ensure voter fraud doesn’t happen. Here’s the thing -- voter fraud isn’t a problem in our elections. But you know what is a problem? Voter intimidation. The very thing that Republicans have been found guilty of four times in past elections when they’ve had voter-fraud “operations” at the polls.
The GOP has been crying wolf about unfair elections for years when it’s clear they are tipping the scales in their favor. Because when Democrats turn out, we win. Will you donate today to help us fight against Republican efforts to suppress our vote?
Thank you for fighting with us.

Dear Friend,
We have 200 days to beat Donald Trump.
November 3rd, 2020 will be written about in history books for years to come. It will either be the day we elect Joe Biden as president -- bringing competence, decency, and checks and balances back to Washington -- or we re-elect Donald Trump -- letting the GOP coronate him while simultaneously eroding everything that we hold dear about our democracy.
Vice President Biden has been fighting for us since the very beginning of his career, and his leadership is needed now more than ever. But we need to start investing NOW in order to ensure he’s in the White House next year. Donald Trump already has millions of dollars in his war chest and he’s going to be ruthless. That’s why we’re calling on you. Will you donate today to make sure Joe Biden defeats Trump in November?

Let’s be clear: Donald Trump is a threat, one that Virginia Democrats have never ignored. We were the only southern state he didn’t win in 2016, and we’ve rebuked him every November since. Four more years of Trump and his disastrous policies will cause irreversible damage to our nation.
We have 200 days to show up and stand out. 200 days to host Zoom parties, house parties, make phone calls, talk to friends and family, and create an effective grassroots digital campaign. 200 days to prove who we are as a nation.
This really will be the most important election of our lives -- one that decides the fate of our democracy. And we cannot afford anything other than a victory. Join us.

Dave Brat has proved again that he has no idea what the people of the 7th actually want in their Congressional representation. Choosing to endorse someone whose own party thinks he's a joke is just more proof that the 7th CD was right in kicking him out of office.
The people of the 7th CD deserve better than Dave Brat & Nick Freitas. Donate today to keep the district blue.
After all, this is Nick Freitas we’re talking about. The same Nick Freitas who couldn’t beat Corey Stewart, a Confederate flag-waving extremist in the 2018 Republican Senate primary. The same Nick Freitas who has an A+ rating from the NRA. The same Nick Freitas who takes to the floor of the House of Delegates for self-promotional speeches full of lies and racist dog-whistling. Sadly, Brat isn’t alone in backing Freitas. He’s got the backing of big name Republican elected officials and, maybe more importantly, the GOP’s big donors as well. We’re counting on you to help us keep this seat.
Donate today to tell Dave Brat that he’s wrong -- again.

Friend,
Nick Freitas made headlines last year for his dark money-funded write-in re-election campaign for his seat in the House of Delegates. Remember, it was a write-in campaign because he didn't submit his filing paperwork in time to get on the ballot last November.
Y'all, he did it again \-- this time when running for Congress in the 7th Congressional District. He failed to turn in the paperwork that tells the Commonwealth that he's running for office this year.

Freitas had done a fairly good job of staying quiet and out of the news during the pandemic. That changed when he went on the John Fredericks Show and promoted a dangerous and debunked conspiracy theory that Republican candidate for governor and State Senator Amanda Chase spread to her followers earlier this month.
Freitas went on to say that anyone calling for the removal of Confederate monuments had a ""fundamental dislike of America."" Despite protest being one of the cornerstones of American democracy, it would seem that Delegate Freitas is more concerned with protecting monuments celebrating losers and traitors than protecting the lives of Black Americans or competently running a campaign.
His policies and ideals aren't in line with the district he is hoping to represent, and his proven ineptitude only proves that he is unfit to serve the people of the 7th.
Let's keep him out of Washington.

It's hard to beat an incumbent. But in 2018, turnout was up an unbelievable 18 points from the previous midterm election -- and it's a big reason why our three amazing Congresswomen beat their Republican incumbents.
But national Republicans continue to funnel money into Virginia at an alarming rate. They've already spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on attack ads against our Democratic members of Congress. As for their ground game, Trump decided to move his Campaign HQ to Virginia, and Team Trump has already held dozens of organizing events throughout the Commonwealth in the last few months.
Will you donate to help us defend our Congresswomen in November?
We need to make sure we have the funds and volunteers and staff to reach out to voters and capitalize on the momentum we're seeing around Virginia and turn out as many Democrats as possible in November.
Turnout is going to be key. Can you help us turn out the vote? Donate today.

Nick Freitas is running for Virginia’s 7th Congressional seat against Congresswoman Abigail Spanberger, who flipped the seat blue in 2018.
Freitas has managed to accomplish absolutely nothing in the Virginia House of Delegates, passing a grand total of 0 bills this year, but his platform has won the support of both the Republican establishment and of right-wing extremists like Amanda Chase.

Just take a look at the kinds of people from whom Freitas is welcoming support:
* Amanda Chase: A right-wing extremist who is known for arguing for conversion therapy, blaming rape victims for the crimes against them, and carrying guns on the Senate floor, despite the gun ban inside the Capitol. Her own party dismisses her as lacking the “level of substance, maturity or seriousness” required to govern.
* Republicans outside of VA: A coalition of right-wing Senators including the likes of Senators Ted Cruz (TX), Rand Paul (KY), and Mike Lee (UT) are throwing their support and money behind him.
* Big Republican donors: A group of wealthy Republicans, including a billionaire who gave $500,000 to his campaign last year, are pouring money into Freitas's campaign because they know he'll favor them.
To stop this coalition, the Democratic Party of Virginia is more focused than ever on protecting this seat. Unlike Freitas, can’t rely on outside funding and billionaires but we’re hoping we can rely on you. Will you join us to defend the Democratic majority in Virginia?

Democratic Party of Virginia
Friend.
The Republican Party held their national convention this week and it was even darker than we expected. For four days straight, every speaker they rolled out did nothing but praise Donald Trump and lie about the problems we face as a country. Their speakers pretended that COVID-19 wasn’t a problem anymore. They spread lies about Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. They used their official government positions to campaign for Trump -- what many past and current officials see as a blatant violation of the law.
The overall message of their convention was simple: Donald Trump doesn’t want to change anything. We know what that means. Four more years of Trump will mean four more years of the chaos and crises we’ve experienced so far. Remember what Michelle Obama told us during her speech at the Democratic convention: things can and will get worse if he’s reelected.
The Republican Party showed us this week that they’re nothing more than the party of Trump. We can’t let Trump’s chaotic presidency continue for another four years. Chip in now to help us win in November.

Joe Biden and Kamala Harris presented a hopeful vision of the future at our convention. They brought together Democrats, Republicans, and Americans of all backgrounds to unite behind a platform of affordable health care, an end to gun violence, environmental protection, and more. The Republicans didn’t even bother to write a platform this year. “Whatever Donald Trump wants” is their guiding principle.
While the rest of us deal with COVID-19, an economic recession, and a continuing crisis of racial injustice, Republicans insist that everything is great. They won’t solve these problems, they’ll only make them worse.
Republicans showed everyone this week why they’re unfit to run the country. And we need all hands on deck if we want to beat them in November. Our end-of-month deadline is coming up. Can we count on you to donate today to help us meet our goal of 1,500 new donors?

Friends --
We’re going to be frank in this email. We’re worried -- but we aren’t worried about you. We know that you’re going to vote for Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Mark Warner, and all the other Democrats running in Virginia this year. We’re worried about the “maybe” voters. The folks that only vote if they aren’t busy or who only go to the polls if they think the election is close.
We need your help to motivate and mobilize those folks. You know that there are folks who won’t go vote unless we remind them to -- and believe it or not, there are still people in this country (and Commonwealth) that are undecided who we can persuade.
Mobilization costs money. Field offices, staffers, digital tools, ads, and all the other little things that go into winning an election all cost money -- that’s why we’re asking you to donate today.
We count on your support every year to help us cross this finish line, and we’re right there again, folks. It’s time to get to work, make your vote count, and do everything you can to get Democrats elected this year.
I hope we can count on you to contribute.

TWO DAYS left to make a major impact.
Donate $10 now
Friend,
Two days isn’t much time -- but it’s enough to make a major impact on this election. There are still millions of Virginians who haven’t voted yet. And with polls showing super close congressional races, it will all come down to how many voters we can turn out in the next two days.
Will you chip in just $10 right now to help Democrats sweep Virginia on Tuesday?
Last-minute donations are crucial to our success on Election Day. Your $10 contribution today will go directly to:
* Recruiting volunteers for our voter turnout field program
* Calling and texting voters across the state who haven’t cast ballots yet
* Providing rides to the polls
* Running our voter protection program to make sure every vote is counted
* And much more!
Donate now to mobilize Virginia Democrats
Dr. Cameron Webb, Elaine Luria, and Abigail Spanberger are three outstanding Virginia Democrats who are in extremely tight congressional races. Whether they win -- whether we keep Virginia blue and hold on to our majority in the U.S. House -- depends on what we do in the next two days. We need to make a major impact. And we need your help to do it, friend.
Please chip in $10 right now -- and let’s go win this election!

In just five days we decide the fate of our nation. We've never needed you more than we need you now. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris belong in the White House. Cameron Webb, Elaine Luria, Jennifer Wexton, and Abigail Spanberger belong in Congress. Can we count on your donation to make sure that happens?

Whether it's fighting for access to broadband or affordable healthcare, Democrats have taken the lead and have proved that they will fight for their constituents, not special interests or their own agenda.

Friend,
Since I was elected, our Democratic majority in the House of Representatives has been hard at work delivering results for the people. We’ve passed hundreds of bills including crucial measures to fix our healthcare system, institute universal background checks for gun purchases, tackle climate change, and deliver better care for our veterans. I’m proud that as a first-term Representative, I have had five bills signed into law, including my bills to honor the victims of the Virginia Beach shooting and increase benefits for disabled veterans.
We've been able to make so much progress because of the Blue Wave that started in Virginia and carried us to victory, thanks to the Democratic Party of Virginia. They provided critical support for my campaign two years ago, and they are back to help again this year. That’s why I’m writing this -- to ask you to support our state party.

In Washington, partisan politics often gets in the way of making progress. Too many bills are blocked in the Republican Senate. That’s why we need to elect Democrats up and down the ballot this year. The Commonwealth of Virginia is an excellent example of what happens when we do.
Donate today to help the DPVA elect Democrats up and down the ticket!
Virginia shows the country what can happen when Democrats are in control. Our General Assembly has put a number of bills on the Governor’s desk that will drastically improve the lives of folks all over Virginia. From ratifying the ERA and protections for LGBTQ youth, to raising the minimum wage and giving public school teachers a much needed and well deserved raise -- Virginians are leading the way.
These changes wouldn’t have been possible without a strong state party supported by grassroots donors like you. Now we need to bring that kind of change to Washington. Virginia Democrats have made us a Blue Commonwealth that is lighting a path forward for the nation. Will you chip in to help us continue to show a way forward?
I hope you’ll join me in supporting the Democratic Party of Virginia.
Thank you for all your support,
Congresswoman Elaine Luria

Friend,
Bob Good may just be the worst Republican on the ballot in November, including Donald Trump. The bigoted Republican nominee in VA-05 is running his campaign as an anti-LGBTQ candidate.
We need to make sure he doesn’t represent Virginia in Washington -- our standing nationally as a Blue Commonwealth could depend on it. Donate today to keep Bob Good’s bigotry out of Washington!
On July 1st, Virginia became the first Southern state to have an LGBTQ discrimination bill on the books. It was a landmark bill that was passed by our new blue majority in the General Assembly, and something the Governor proudly signed into law.
Bob Good, apparently repulsed by Virginia’s progress and this new law, in particular, used it to try and recruit members of the clergy to his side. The New York Times ran an article on Sunday with a headline that read:
> A Virginia House Candidate Campaigns by Attacking ‘a Man Dressed as a Woman’
>  As Bob Good, an opponent of same-sex marriage, tries to rally Republicans with attacks on transgender rights, Democrats see an opening in the GOP held district.
When someone shows you who they are, believe them. Bob Good has never been shy about his shameful and dangerous beliefs. He’s promised to take them to Washington if we don’t stop him. Remember, this is a man who challenged an incumbent Republican Congressman who voted with Trump 94% of the time because he wasn’t conservative enough.
Bob Good doesn’t represent Virginia values. We need your help to keep him out of Washington. Please donate what you can today.

Friends --
These days, we’re all doing things differently to keep our communities safer and healthier: putting off travel plans, staying home as much as possible, and wearing face coverings in public. We’re also figuring out new ways to register voters.
Will you pitch in now to help us fund new strategies to register record numbers of Virginia voters online?
We launched an ambitious voter registration operation months ago, as part of our winning strategy. But when the pandemic started and we had to stop in-person efforts, the number of new registrations plummeted. Just take a look at this chart the Virginia Public Access Project just published:
New Voter Registrations in April: 22,442 in 2008; 29,193 in 2012; 20,460 in 2016; 5,467 in 2020
We could be on track to set a record low for new voters in 2020. As we head toward what’s likely to be the most important election of our lifetimes, that is simply unacceptable. So we’ve begun shifting our voter registration operations online -- but it’s not an easy or inexpensive process. We need your help to do it.
If you’re able, will you make a donation to support our new online voter registration strategy?
Friends, we all want to send Donald Trump packing in November. And we all want to elect more Democrats across the Commonwealth who will always work for our best interests. But to do that, we need to register a record number of new voters -- and we’re counting on your support to make it happen.
Donate to register more voters in Virginia

DPVA Key Race Alert,info@vademocrats.org,We have a nominee for VA-05! ✅,"Help us flip VA-05 BLUE!
Dr. Cameron Webb is our nominee for VA-05! HELP FLIP THIS KEY DISTRICT BLUE >>>
Friend,
There has been complete chaos among Republicans in VA-05. They ousted their current representative because he had the audacity to officiate a gay wedding. Then they put forward a wannabe Trump lackey who will put many Virginians at risk. But luckily, Democrats have an incredible candidate going up against all this mess. His name is Dr. Cameron Webb. Will you donate now to help flip this key district BLUE?
Dr. Webb ran a great primary campaign where healthcare and equality were his key issues. His message spoke to voters and it is time for us all to unite behind him to flip this congressional district from red to blue on November 3rd.
Flipping this district would also make Dr. Webb the first Black physician elected to Congress, and Virginia would be proud to send him to Washington. His election will be a major victory in the effort to keep the Democratic hold on the House and block Donald Trump’s re-election.
Dr. Cameron Webb has what it takes to win this race. But it won’t be easy. Virginia Republicans and the Trump campaign have hired thousands of staffers and are making millions of phone calls to get their base to vote. Help us catch up with them!
This is a major opportunity for Democrats in Virginia. Friend, Team DPVA is doing everything we can to make sure we elect Virginia Democrats like Dr. Webb on November 3rd and replace Donald Trump with Joe Biden in the White House. But we can’t do it without you. If you’re able to, will you chip in today?

Friends --
Wow! Did you see how high the turnout was for Virginia’s Democratic primary elections? It was nearly double what it was in 2016, at a total of 1.3 million!
We MUST keep this energy going and get Democrats to turn out in record numbers in November. Will you make a donation to help us lay the groundwork?
As exciting as it is to see this level of enthusiasm from Virginia Democrats, we can’t take it for granted. After all -- even this record turnout was just 21% of the electorate. It’s going to take hard work to generate the number of votes we’ll need to win in November. We have to:
* Register tens of thousands of new voters.
* Make hundreds of thousands of phone calls.
* Knock on doors all across the Commonwealth.
* Get the message out to every voter about why we need to elect Democrats to move Virginia -- and our country -- forward.
In short, we’ve got to make sure Democrats destroy previous turnout records for the general election -- because that’s what we’ll need to defeat Donald Trump. Will you pitch in now to help us do it?

Democratic Party of Virginia
Folks,
Last night, The Atlantic published an article about Donald Trump’s disdain for America’s military and those who protect this country at home and abroad. From skipping visits to military cemeteries to openly mocking American heroes as “losers” and “sucker,” Trump has made it crystal clear that he has no respect for the men and women who serve our country.
Some things are bigger than politics -- protecting our soldiers is paramount and respecting those who serve and made the ultimate sacrifice is foundational to our republic.
But Donald Trump has a history of disrespecting the people who stake everything to serve our country. He started his 2016 run for president by criticizing a Gold Star family. He openly mocked Senator John McCain for being a prisoner of war. And he hasn’t taken action against the Russian government in over 70 days since news broke about Russian bounties on the heads of American soldiers.
Donald Trump isn't fit for office. Plain and simple.
Joe Biden’s son Beau was a veteran. Joe knows what it’s like to worry about loved ones going into a warzone. The difference here couldn’t be more stark -- which is why we’re asking for your help in getting Joe elected. If you can, please donate so we can help Joe Biden lead this country with the grace and dignity that the office of the President of the United States demands and our armed forces deserve.

BREAKING NEWS: VA-05 has just been rated a TOSS-UP by UVA Center for Politics’ Crystal Ball! Help us flip it BLUE!
Friend,
KEY RACE ALERT: VA-05 has been a Republican district for a decade. But now the UVA Center for Politics’ Crystal Ball has changed their rating to TOSS-UP, which means we could finally turn it BLUE. And if we pick up this district, we will have a better chance of holding onto the House and defeating Donald Trump on November 3rd! Will you donate right now to help flip VA-05?
This won’t be easy.
We only have 24 days until Election Day -- and people are already early voting here in Virginia!
The Trump campaign, the Republican Party, and the outside groups backing them are pouring TONS of cash into our Commonwealth to make sure districts like VA-05 stay RED.
Friend, the entire team here at DPVA is working hard every day to support great Virginia Democrats up and down the ballot. But we can’t do it without your support. If you can, will you chip in right now to help us flip this key district and keep Virginia BLUE?

Friend --
We don’t need to tell you that this is a critically important election year. And we probably don’t need to remind you that the GOP is making major investments in races all across Virginia. They think they have a good chance of scoring big wins here -- so we need to prove them wrong!
This year, only 26 people from Aldie have chipped in to help Democrats fight back. We need to get that number up if we’re going to have a real chance of winning. Will you become the 27th supporter from Aldie and help elect Democrats across the Commonwealth?
Even during these difficult times, it’s encouraging to remember how far we've come, and what we can accomplish when we all work together. Remember: until last fall, it had been 27 years since Democrats controlled both houses of the General Assembly. Now, we’re one of just 15 states in the country to have an entirely Democratic government!
Friend, we have the numbers to win across Virginia -- but only if we all do our part to make it happen. Will you chip in now and become the 27th donor from your area to help Democrats win in November?

VA-07 Race Update (via VADems),info@vademocrats.org,“This may be one of the most closely contested races in the entire country.”,"Help us keep VA-07 BLUE!
Democratic Party of Virginia
Stephen Farnsworth, a political science professor at the University of Mary Washington: This may be one of the most closely contested races in the entire country.
HELP US KEEP VA-07 BLUE!
Friend,
ALERT: In 2018, we flipped VA-07 from red to blue. That contest was decided by just a few thousand votes. And once again, it may be one of the closest races in the country. If we want to keep the House -- and beat Donald Trump -- we CAN’T afford to lose this seat. Will you donate right now to keep VA-07 BLUE?
Stephen Farnsworth: The 7th District is a highly competitive district, that’s why both Democrats and Republicans are investing very large sums of money in that contest.
Winning this race won’t be an easy task. The National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) is putting a TON of cash into defeating Congresswoman Abigail Spanberger and toward supporting her pro-Trump opponent. And Donald Trump’s campaign is counting on flipping this district in order to help him pick up our Commonwealth’s 13 electoral votes!
Stephen Farnsworth: Virginia may not be getting the attention it received four or eight years ago, but the 7th District is one of three highly competitive congressional districts in Virginia.
Friend, all of us here at DPVA are working hard every day to support great Virginia Democrats, like Rep. Spanberger, up and down the ballot on November 3rd. But we have less than two weeks left -- and we can’t do it without your support. If you can, will you chip in immediately to help us protect this targeted district and keep it BLUE?

"Nick Scott, DPVA",info@vademocrats.org,Why what happened in Wisconsin is so important,"Lines a half-mile long in Wisconsin showed the nation a glimpse of what may be coming our way in November if we don't act.
Friends,
I was born and raised in Wisconsin. I spent years in and around Wisconsin politics. On Tuesday, the nation saw the worst version of voter suppression and frankly, that’s saying something.
Like many other governors - both Republican and Democrat - have done, Democratic Governor Tony Evers signed an executive order postponing their April 7th election; Republicans challenged the decision and took it to the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court voted (along ideological breakdowns) 5-4 against Gov. Evers and decided to force the people of Wisconsin to choose between their right to vote and their health and safety.
How does this relate to Virginia? Virginia needs to stay blue if there is any chance of electing a Democratic president who would put liberal judges on the Supreme Court. These justices will encourage voting and protect voters. Will you donate today to help elect Democratic officials that will ensure the safety of voters?
As president, Joe Biden will put justices in place that will defend Roe v. Wade, defend the rights of LGBTQ Americans, and restore parts of the Voting Rights Act that were gutted by conservative justices.
Republicans in Wisconsin have been able to stay in power because of voter suppression. They've gerrymandered their state legislature and bet that lower turnout would give them a win on Tuesday. Does that sound familiar, Virginians? Republicans are going to try these same tactics across the country in November -- they’re already fighting against vote-by-mail programs and doing their best to suppress voter turnout. Trump himself even admitted recently that the more people vote, the more Republicans lose. That's why we have to fight back.
Lines a half-mile long in Wisconsin showed the nation a glimpse of what may be coming our way in November if we don’t act. We need to start today to keep that from happening in our Commonwealth. Please donate now to help elect Democratic leaders up and down the ballot in November.

Friend,
2020 is just two days away, and we’ve got a LOT of work to do to re-elect the Virginia Democrats we sent to Congress in 2018. With your help, we’ve made great progress turning the Commonwealth blue since Donald Trump took office. But we can’t take anything for granted!
There are Republicans lining up in every single district to replace our Democratic representatives. We urgently need your help to protect these seats -- and the entire Democratic majority! Will you rush a donation before 2019 is over to help us do it?
All seven Democrats representing Virginia in the House just voted for both of the articles of impeachment against Donald Trump. They stood up to defend the Constitution and the rule of law against a president who is clearly intent on trashing both.
So now we need to have their backs as they seek re-election. But the Trump campaign set up their headquarters here -- they’re trying to win Virginia’s 13 electoral votes and erase the Democratic House majority in the process!
We can’t let it happen, friend. Will you rush a donation before 2019 comes to a close and help send our fantastic Virginia Democrats back to Congress in 2020?

TWO Congressional Polls Show Virginia Democrats in Virtual TIES
Donate $5 to help them WIN
Friend,
Since the primary in June we’ve gotten a lot of breaking news. We have not one, but TWO polls showing Virginia Democrats neck-and-neck with their opponents in major congressional races. We’ve got all the details below, but the bottom line is this: We NEED to make sure these seats are both BLUE after November 3rd -- but to do that we need to hit our end-of-month goal before Friday at midnight.
Can you pitch in S5 now to help make that happen?
In VA-05, Dr. Cameron Webb is within the margin of error of Republican Bob Good. Bob Good is a bigot who ran as an anti-LGBTQ candidate, supports abolishing birthright citizenship, and opposes abortion in ALL cases. Donate now to help us elect Virginia Democrat Cameron Webb and flip this district blue in November >>>
And that’s not all. Rep. Elaine Luria is in a tough race to keep VA-02 blue -- and a new poll shows her tied with her Republican opponent. Congresswoman Luria has a proven track record of bipartisanship, working for her constituents to deliver on her promises to fix our healthcare system, fighting for clean air and water for coastal Virginia, and improving the lives of veterans.
Now Scott Taylor is running against Rep. Luria by caving to Donald Trump and right-wing conspiracy theorists. If we lose this seat we risk backsliding on all the progress we’ve made. Pitch in now to help us keep fighting to reelect Rep. Elaine Luria >>>
With your help we can elect Dr. Webb, reelect Rep. Luria, and ensure seats across the state turn blue in November. But if we’re going to be able to declare victory in communities across the commonwealth this fall, we need your help now. Can we count on you to help us reach our critical $10,000 end-of-month goal? Even $5 dollars can have a huge impact on such close races.

Friend,
Just when we thought Donald Trump’s shameful divisiveness could not get any worse, he tweets this out:
Donald Trump tweet calling to liberate Virginia
This is the very height of irresponsibility. It’s encouraging angry, and armed, protests from Trump supporters all around the country. Many of the protesters are not wearing masks -- and are not keeping to the social distancing practices recommended by the CDC, which include standing at least six feet apart from others.
While Donald Trump is sending out reckless tweets, Governor Northam is working tirelessly to protect Virginians during these unprecedented times. It’s time to make sure Donald Trump doesn’t send another tweet from the White House in 2021. Will you rush a donation now to help get Trump out of office?
Donald Trump’s toxic rhetoric and general unfitness for the office he holds is nothing new. But this is crossing into dangerous new territory. Not only could these words potentially incite violence, they could put both the protestors and people around them in danger of contracting this deadly virus.
And what’s even worse, the Republican Party of Virginia (RPV) is openly encouraging him!
Just yesterday, the RPV put out a press release, openly condoning Donald Trump’s behavior and launching into a hyperpartisan and extremely disingenuous attack against our Governor Ralph Northam. Help us hold them accountable!
Governor Northam has been instrumental in protecting Virginians by promoting the social distancing and other safety measures that are necessary to help stop the spread of COVID-19 in our Commonwealth.
But Donald Trump’s Republican Party still chooses to spread hatred and divisiveness at every opportunity. Instead of prioritizing the safety of Virginians, they are clearly focused on scoring cheap political points with Trump and the base they share.
Friend, Donald Trump and Republicans are attacking the Virginia Democrats who are protecting us. Help us fight back -- and make sure they face consequences for their actions this November. Donate now to support Virginia Democrats!

"Andrew Whitley, DPVA",info@vademocrats.org,Two Deadlines,"Democratic Party of Virginia
Friends,
I’m asking you to donate to the Democratic Party of Virginia. Here’s why:
There are two massive deadlines for Virginia Democrats this week:
* Virginia’s voter registration deadline is tomorrow
* The last FEC deadline of the election is on Thursday
What we do before these deadlines will end up deciding elections all over the Commonwealth -- you and I both know that when more people vote, more Democrats win.
We need to register as many people as possible in the next 24 hours, and we need to mobilize everyone who registered to make sure they vote over the next 3 weeks.
That’s where you come in. I know that the victories we've had in Virginia these last four years wouldn't have happened without you and the rest of the staff, donors, activists, and volunteers who came together to build the blue wave that let us take the majority last year.
I’m asking you, once again, to come together with me and all the other Virginia Democrats to support the DPVA in this final push. Will you help support the DPVA by contributing now?
I appreciate all that you do to keep Virginia Blue!
Andrew Whitley,
DPVA Executive Director

Support the DPVA's Voter Protection fight.
Hi!
Nice to meet you! My name's Alyssa, and I'm the new Voter Protection & Expansion Director at the Democratic Party of Virginia. Put simply, it's my job to ensure that every eligible voter in Virginia is registered and able to vote and that every vote is counted. Though it's anything but a simple job!
After a 2018 Supreme Court decision allowed tens of thousands of voters to be purged from voter rolls, I decided to dedicate my work to protecting voters -- because there is nothing more essential to our democracy than the right to vote. If you agree, make a donation today to support the DPVA's voter protection programs and help us keep up the fight!
Donate now to support our important Voter Protection efforts
Here's a basic overview of all the things I'm currently working on:
> 1\. Expansion of Voting Rights
>
>  No eligible Virginian should have their vote stripped away from them. So I'm working to restore the voting rights for those who've been unfairly silenced and thrown out of the process. In 2020, we're going to follow up with voters who were wrongfully removed from the voter roll and those who have had their right to vote restored.
>
> 2\. Voter Education and Outreach
>
>  We need to engage young people to keep our democracy thriving. I work with college students and other young people to educate them on how to register to vote and why it's important.
>
> 3\. Year-Round Voter Hotline
>
>  People can call in any time of the year to ask questions about voting in Virginia. I make sure this important resource is staffed and ready with all the answers -- and we add more Hotline Volunteers closer to Election Day.
Donate now to help us keep up all this amazing work
As you can see friend, it's a challenging job -- but there's nothing I'd rather be doing. I'm proud to stand up to the people and institutions working full time to keep voters away from the polls and to invalidate the votes of people whose views they don't like. If you agree that the right to vote is worth fighting for, then will you please donate to the DPVA today so we can continue to stand up for voters across Virginia?
Thank you,
Alyssa Pooler
Voter Protection & Expansion Director at DPVA

Friend,
Last week, we broke the news that a right-wing super PAC, the Congressional Leadership Fund (CLF), is pouring nearly $2 million into Virginia to save GOP candidates Scott Taylor and Nick Freitas. These Virginia Republicans are all-in for Trump’s divisive rhetoric and harmful agenda -- and erasing all of the progress Democrats have made in Congress. Help us fight back.
CLF will be spending big bucks on targeting these seats, which are currently held by Congresswoman Elaine Luria (VA-02) and Congresswoman Abigail Spanberger (VA-07).
Flipping these districts was essential to bringing the big, Blue Wave into 2018. Here at DPVA, we’re working hard every day to keep these vulnerable seats blue on election night in November. But we need your help.
It won’t be easy. Donald Trump and his allies have set their sights on flipping Virginia back to red and have a huge war chest at their disposal. So we have to get started right now.
We know that many Virginians are struggling right now. So only if you’re able to, will you chip in today to help us hold onto these seats -- and to help stop these extremely well-funded efforts to elect Republicans across our Commonwealth?

Cory Booker,info@vademocrats.org,It's time to repair our divided nation,"I'm running for president because we need a leader who can repair the damage Trump has done and make justice and opportunity real for every American.
Hi,
This presidential election isn’t just about defeating Donald Trump. That may get us out of the valley, but it does not get us to the mountaintop. We’re in a struggle to restore our sense of common purpose and heal our deeply divided country.
On the campaign trail, the stories I hear are about the fact that in America -- from rural communities and factory towns to cities like the one I go home to and suburban communities -- we have a common pain, and to take on our biggest challenges, we must find our sense of common purpose.
That’s the only way we’ll beat Donald Trump -- by joining together, organizing together, and working together in common cause. We know from our history -- from the fight for women's rights to the struggle for labor rights to the civil rights movement -- that to take on our biggest challenges, we need to build big coalitions.
It’s why I’m asking right now if you’ll consider splitting a donation between my campaign and the Virginia Democratic Party.

I’m in this race because I’ve built those kinds of coalitions throughout my career -- during my time as mayor of New Jersey’s largest city I worked to build uncommon partnerships to usher in the greatest period of economic growth in generations, and as a U.S. Senator I recently led the passage of a major bipartisan criminal justice reform bill in a divided Congress. I have a proven track record of bringing people together to get things done for communities that have so often been left out and left behind.
And that’s how I will unite the party and build the coalition that will beat Donald Trump next year. I hope you’ll stand with me when the primary rolls around to Virginia on March 3rd.
I had the pleasure of visiting the Commonwealth back in September to campaign for Delegate Hala Ayala. We need to win back the White House, but it’s critical that we also support down-ballot Democrats at the state and local levels.
Please consider donating today to support our campaign and Virginia Democrats.
I’m running for president to build an America where we revive civic grace, where we extend a more courageous empathy to one another, and where nobody gets left behind.

“When somebody is the president of the United States, the authority is total. And that’s the way it’s got to be. It’s total.” \-- Donald Trump
Yesterday, during a White House press briefing about the coronavirus pandemic, Donald Trump said that he has total authority as president of the United States. That spits in the face of our nation’s founders who rose up against a tyrannical king almost 250 years ago. When they did so, they set a series of checks and balances in place so that there would never be an American King.
Donald Trump is not a king -- no matter what he thinks or his cronies tell him. Donate today to prove this “emperor” has no clothes.
We need to get this power-hungry, incompetent disgrace out of the Oval Office. If he wins in November, he will have the chance to stack the Supreme Court and will erode the very foundations of our democracy more than anyone thought possible in this day and age.
He has already abused the power of the presidency numerous times over the last three years. This is a man who put children in cages, banned travel from majority-Muslim countries, was investigated by Special Counsel Robert Mueller for Russian collusion during the 2016 election, and was impeached after strongarming the president of Ukraine for personal political gain. Trump has shown such disregard for the office he holds and the power it wields -- and now he wants more.
Donate today to protect our democracy.

Let us say this again. Donald Trump believes that the powers of the president are absolute. And we have got to mobilize to beat him. 244 years ago, Virginia led the way against a King. This year, we’re going to lead the way against a petulant, arrogant, vindictive president. We need you to ensure he doesn’t get a second term. We need to ensure his campaign is just like his presidency -- a dumpster fire. Donate today.

Friend,
The people of the 5th Congressional District deserve a great Congressman -- they deserve better than Bob Good. Will you rush a donation before our end-of-month deadline to help us elect Dr. Cameron Webb?
We're in the endgame here -- ""Get out the vote"" efforts started this morning. This is the last chance we have to talk to voters in the 5th to try and keep our Commonwealth blue. More than that, it's the last chance we have to keep homophobic bigot Bob Good out of Washington.
In some of our other districts, things are looking good. But the GOP establishment, conservative mega-donors, and dark money PACs have flooded the airwaves in our battleground districts to try and take back the 2nd and the 7th. And they've been fighting for their lives in the 5th district -- an important seat for them to protect if they have any hope of taking the House on Election Day.
Bob Good has, time and again, proven that he doesn't want to represent the people of VA-05, he wants to repress them. His anti-LGBTQ hatred is out there in the open. He doesn't want what's best for his potential constituents, he wants to impose his bigoted beliefs on them.
That isn't what good leaders do. That isn't what good representatives do. Virginians need something better than Good -- they need Cameron Webb.

Maybe you’ve heard: Virginia Republicans have nominated a slate of extreme and out-of-touch Trump sycophants for office all across the Commonwealth. The party’s still betting big that they’ll win -- and you know what? They actually have a chance. Not one, not two, but three congressional races in Virginia that are considered “toss-ups!” So this election really does all come down to turning out voters.
The good news is we’ve got a proven, winning voter mobilization strategy here at the DPVA. But we need your support to implement it in these final days before the election.

❏  Option 2: Assume someone else will give. -- Unfortunately, a lot of people pick this option. And if too many choose it this time, we’ll miss our FINAL fundraising goal before November 3rd. If this happens, we won’t be able to invest in key races -- and Republicans (including Donald Trump) could WIN here in our Commonwealth!

Only 20 DAYS until Election Day. Pitch in $20 to help Democrats win across Virginia.
Friend --
Approximately 1 million Virginians have already voted in this election. That’s encouraging news! But it’s still only the beginning.
With only 20 days until Election Day, we need to get to work now turning out millions more Democrats during this early voting period. Will you pitch in $20 to help us do it?
Friends, our voter turnout strategy works. Our staff and amazing, dedicated volunteers have helped get millions of Virginians to the polls over the years. And they’ll do it again this year -- but only with your support.
It takes hard work and resources to successfully turn out so many voters, and the pandemic presents new, daunting challenges. Plus, the Trump campaign and major GOP donors are fighting harder than ever to win back Virginia. We need your help to keep the blue wave rolling across the Commonwealth.
Will you pitch in just $20 -- one dollar for each day until Election Day -- to make sure we can turn out every single voter we need to elect Democrats all across Virginia?

CNN: With a war chest of $20 million at its disposal, the Republican National Committee's legal team has started to take action -- and is poised to do more -- against voting laws and policies that they view as unconstitutional and potentially damaging to the President's prospects of winning.
Friend,
Donald Trump and the Republican National Committee are gearing up for the biggest election battle since Bush v. Gore in the aftermath of the 2000 election. They already have a massive $20 million (and growing) war chest that they’ll use to try to restrict access to early voting and voting-by-mail in battleground states like Virginia.
We need your help to fight back against the clear and rampant voter suppression attempts. Please donate what you can today.

Trump has made it clear on his Twitter that he’ll do whatever it takes to try and delegitimize the election process, which is why we’ve had a Voter Protection team on the ground since October 2019 working day and night to prepare for anything Republicans throw at us.
These lawsuits are just the latest in a string of examples of voter suppression and intimidation from the GOP and conservative groups like it. We need to do everything in our power to stop this voter suppression by educating voters on how to get their ballots in on time.

Friend,
Just before 2019 ended we heard some downright troubling news…
A recent poll of Virginia voters found that Trump is competitive and within the margin of error against four of the top Democratic presidential candidates. In other words, the 2020 race is going to be close. No candidate has a definitive lead over Trump in Virginia yet.
We need to start building our resources now to keep Virginia firmly in the blue column. Can you pitch in?

Make no mistake about it, Virginia is going to be a battleground this year. Even though we just flipped the General Assembly, with Trump on the ballot the election will be unpredictable. And that means he could win battleground states like VA.
It’s no secret that Trump is itching to flip our Commonwealth. His re-election campaign is already heavily investing in VA with the Trump Victory Initiative, and he’s even placed his 2020 HQ in northern Virginia. They know what we know: Virginia is a battleground state.
But we don’t have to give Trump the win he so desperately wants. We don’t have to hand Virginia over to this president. We don’t have to turn back the clock on the recent progress we’ve made.
Are you in? Stand with us. Fight back. Donate now.

DPVA Rapid Response,info@vademocrats.org,NEW POLL IN VA-05!!,"Dr. Cameron Webb can flip the fifth. Donate now!
Folks,
We haven't seen an opportunity like this in the 5th Congressional District in a decade. In a recent poll taken since the primary on Tuesday, Dr. Cameron Webb is within the margin of error in a head-to-head against the GOP nominee, Bob Good. We've been saying that the 5th CD is in play all year, it just took some other national folks a while to realize what we've known for a long time: We can flip the fifth in 2020.
Donate to our Flip the Fifth Fund today to help us send Cameron Webb to Washington in November!
The difference between Dr. Webb and Bob ""not"" Good couldn't be starker. Dr. Webb would be one of the only Black physicians in Congress and served as a White House Fellow during the Obama Administration. He ran on his experience as a healthcare provider and policymaker. Bob Good ran as an anti-LGBT candidate who believes English should be the national language, wants to abolish birthright citizenship, opposes abortion in all cases -- even in cases involving assault or for the health of the mother -- and compared the Supreme Court's decision to legalize gay marriage to the Dred Scott decision.
What else can we say? Bob Good is a bigot and we need to keep him out of Washington D.C. Please donate if you know that his way of thinking has no place in our government.

We’ve got a major problem on our hands, friend.
Every year, the Virginia Department of Elections tracks how many new voter registrations registrars across the Commonwealth are processing. This year, we’re tracking 40% lower than last year. Why is this alarming news? Because an engaged electorate with high voter turnout is good for Democratic wins up and down the ballot.
We know the pandemic has made it much harder to reach out to unregistered voters. We can’t go door-to-door, so we need to ramp up our digital efforts. But we need your help to scale up our outreach. Will you chip in today?

Donald Trump and the GOP are investing disturbing amounts of time and energy into manipulating this upcoming election. From undermining the USPS, to sowing mistrust in absentee voting, they are trying to create confusion and suppress the vote to get what they want.
It’s vital that we get voter registrations up if we want to see Democrats win across the Commonwealth in November. Will you donate today to bolster these efforts?

Friend -- Betsy DeVos and the Trump administration are threatening to withhold funds from schools who do the responsible thing and open virtually in the fall. Forcing schools to open too soon will endanger our children, our families, and our teachers by increasing the chances of spreading the coronavirus.
While Virginia Democrats fight to reopen responsibly and beat this pandemic, Trump and the Republicans are actively making it harder to reopen and harder on parents and children.
Sign our petition to tell Betsy DeVos & Donald Trump to stop encouraging a reckless reopening of Virginia schools.

Friends --
The Congressional Leadership Fund (a major GOP Super PAC), and the National Republican Congressional Committee are pouring in millions of dollars to keep a Republican in Virginia’s 5th Congressional district.
Chip in now to combat GOP spending and flip VA-05 blue!
For the first time in a long time the GOP is at serious risk of losing this seat, so they’re spending tons of their outside money on attack ads. They know they can’t run ON anything so that’s the best they can do! But we have to make sure they don’t succeed. We need to step up our own fundraising efforts to fight back -- now!
Will you donate right now so we can push back against Republicans’ desperate attacks and flip VA-05 blue?
Friends, the VA-05 race presents an amazing opportunity to not only expand the blue wave across Virginia but to expand our Democratic majority in Congress. This seat is within our reach -- but only if we invest resources and effort to win it!
So can we count on you? Will you chip in now, before time runs out, to help us win VA-05 and keep Virginia and our country moving forward?

Dear friend,
Believe it or not, we’re nearly a quarter of the way through 2020! This year’s elections will decide the future of our nation and I, for one, want a Democrat in the White House. The Democratic Party of Virginia is vital to reaching that goal -- we’re the backbone for every major race that takes place in the Commonwealth and this year is no different.
We provide the infrastructure that allows campaigns to thrive and WIN both statewide and locally. We are preparing for a big fight this year, and there are no days off. And there's always the possibility that Trump won't leave the White House willingly unless he's defeated by a huge, undeniable margin. Donate today.

That’s where you come in. Will you join us today by donating to the Democratic Party of Virginia?
Virginians have seen why good government is needed and they’ve seen what can happen when someone unqualified takes the helm. We know we deserve better.
We are committed to getting Democrats elected up and down the ballot, but we can’t do it without you.

Friends --
This is my first cycle running the email fundraising program for the Democratic Party of Virginia, and there's never been a more difficult or important cycle where we’ve needed this program to be successful. But it's been enormously successful, because of supporters like you. That’s why I’m reaching out to say thank you.
Whether you’ve donated thousands or a couple bucks to these emails this year, it's helped us to not only stay afloat during a pandemic but continue to fund the programs that win us elections here in Virginia. Throughout the early days of the pandemic no one really knew what it meant for campaigns, organizing, and fundraising. Your support has meant a lot to me and the DPVA staff as a whole.
I grew up in a middle class family. Then my mother got sick and the housing market crashed. I remember being afraid of what would happen when we lost my childhood home. I know what millions of Americans are feeling right now and it’s why I’ve never asked anyone for more than they can give.
2020 is going to be a year that stands out in the history books; it will be studied for generations to come. We truly are at an inflection point in the history of our nation, and I’m thankful that we have you on our team.
Thank you,
Nick Scott,
Online Fundraising Director

Democratic candidates across Virginia have proven to be immensely qualified and ready to lead. We need them to fight for us, for our parents, children, and grandchildren -- but they can't fight for us unless we fight for them.
Early voting this year has been critical, with well over a million Virginians casting their ballots already. Will you donate here to help us mobilize more voters and make sure the voices of Virginians are heard on November 3rd?
Thank you for all of your support!

Friend,
A new poll of Virginia voters testing different general election matchups came out recently. And there are a few key takeaways:
1. Democrats in Virginia have proven to the voters that when Democrats win, good things happen -- and voters want to keep this blue trend going.
2. Republicans will start pouring even more money into Virginia to turn it red.
3. Democrats nationwide might start to think Virginia is safe.
The GOP is going to get scared by the poll numbers. There’s still plenty of time left until November, and they’re going to keep pouring money into Virginia to shift these numbers. Every Democrat on the ballot in November will feel the full force of this dark money pouring into Virginia. If we want to make this poll a reality, we’ll need supporters like you to chip in.

Friend --
I’m asking for your help today in supporting the Democratic Party of Virginia. It is imperative that we keep our eyes on our end goal in November -- sending Joe Biden to the White House, flipping the United States Senate, and keeping hold of the House of Representatives. If we’re going to do that, a strong state party is absolutely critical.
We know Donald Trump is personally targeting Virginia this election. He said it himself last week. If we’re going to be successful in November, we cannot be complacent. We’ve got to outwork the Trump-GOP campaign operation on the ground and compete in every corner of the Commonwealth. And frankly, that’s going to be tougher than ever as we continue to face the challenges of COVID19.
Friend, we need your help to make this important work possible. If you have the means, will you consider helping the DPVA meet its goal? We know this is a challenging time for many, and we truly appreciate your support.

Let's be clear about what’s on the ballot in November. We have the opportunity to put an end to the chaos of the Trump presidency. We can send our incredible Virginia representatives back to a Democratic majority in the House. We have a darn good chance of flipping the Senate, where we’ve got GOP leadership that's more interested in packing the courts with conservative judges than in helping our fellow Americans struggling to make ends meet. And make no mistake, here in Virginia where we have an election every single year, DPVA is building the ground game that will drive Virginia Democrats to victory for years to come, so we can continue the great work that has been going on in Richmond.
So please, if you’re able to make a contribution towards those efforts, do it today and help us keep Virginia blue this November.
Thank you for your support,

Friends,
We wanted you to be the first to know about a new poll that just came out in the 5th congressional district. It shows the race within just one point \-- with Dr. Cameron Webb at 46% and Bob Good at 47%. This poll shows us what we’ve known all along: The 5th district is a tossup that we can absolutely flip.
Every poll in this race has shown a razor-thin margin, and there’s even more good news with this one. Webb has gained five points since the June primary. Momentum is on our side, but we need grassroots supporters like you to get him over the finish line. Can you chip in today to help us flip the 5th?

Dr. Webb is running against Bob Good, a right-wing extremist who’s more focused on making sure churches can discriminate against LGBTQ Virginians than he is on helping residents of the 5th district get through the COVID pandemic and economic recession.
Good has been traveling around the district holding rallies without masks or social distancing, and running ads with the same kind of racial dog whistles we’ve seen from President Trump. Virginians are fed up with this kind of behavior, and we need to make sure they turn out for Cameron Webb.
The polls show this race is going to come down to the wire. We’re counting on you to help us flip this district. Can you donate today?

Friends --
Last week, a pro-Trump dark money group dropped about $2.3 million on misleading ads that attack Democratic lawmakers across the country -- including some here in Virginia. Well, we’re not having it. We’re fighting back -- but we need your help to do it.
Will you chip in to our Fight Back Fund right now to show Trump’s cronies whose side Virginians are on?
The attacks are more of the same: disgraceful attempts to convince Americans that Trump is a hero -- and any lawmaker who upholds their oath of office and votes for impeachment is wrong. It’s insulting to our Congressional representatives who are doing their constitutional duty and more importantly, it’s false. But what else do you expect?
We may not be able to stop these despicable attacks from Trump allies who are so shameful they hide their identities hide behind dark money. But we sure can fight them. It’s our responsibility, after all, to let voters know the truth about what Virginia Democrats stand for: integrity, honesty, and a commitment to our national interest at all levels of our government.
Will you donate to our Fight Back Fund so we can send a strong message to Trump’s allies that Virginia Democrats won’t be intimidated?

Federal workers fear another government shutdown
Tell President Trump:
Don’t shut down the government next week!
Friends --
Last year the federal government shut down for 35 consecutive days -- the longest period in history. Hundreds of thousands of Americans couldn’t go to work, worked while not being paid, or couldn’t access government services they needed, just because President Trump wanted to have his way on the unnecessary and wasteful border wall.
Last week Congressional leaders said they reached a tentative deal to avoid another government shutdown. But after funding for Trump’s border wall got frozen recently, there’s still a chance he could shut it down again and demand money for his pipe dream of a wall.
So we’ve drawn up a petition to tell Trump: Don’t you dare. Don’t shut down our federal government over funding for a pointless wall that the majority of Americans oppose.
Sign petition
Since we know that Trump rarely does the right thing of his own volition, we need as many people as possible to join us in demanding that the President act in the best interest of the American people.
Will you sign our petition right now telling Trump to keep the government open next week?
Thank you!

The coronavirus pandemic has changed everyday life for millions of people all over the country, including right here in Virginia. And it’s certainly changed the trajectory of the campaign season we are in and how we can get our message out.

To make it happen we need the support of Democrats from every corner of our Commonwealth.

But now in 2020, the stakes are even higher. We’re in a presidential election year -- and Virginia is a battleground state, with an EVEN partisan lean from FiveThirtyEight.

Friend,
First, Dr. Cameron Webb won his primary in VA-05.
Then, a poll came out showing that he’s within the margin of error in a head-to-head against the GOP nominee, Bob Good.
Now, the DCCC has announced that Dr. Webb will be part of their Red to Blue Program, which gives promising Democratic candidates in Republican-held districts support to help flip them blue! This great news proves that Dr. Webb has momentum on his side, and a real chance of winning.
Donate now to send Dr. Webb to Congress
But Virginia’s fifth district has been a Republican stronghold for a decade. And the Virginia GOP and the Trump campaign have already hired thousands of staffers to get out the vote. Even with the support of the Red to Blue program, this race is an uphill battle. We need all the help we can get to flip this district blue, send Dr. Webb to Washington, and expand our Democratic majority in Congress. If you’re able, will you pitch in right now to make it happen?

Friends,
Yesterday ended an incredible week for Democrats around the country -- we held the first-ever virtual convention, we nominated a historic ticket, and here in Virginia we saw record online engagement throughout the last four days. Now we need your help to keep that momentum going today and into next week -- the week of the Republican convention. Will you make a donation right now?
Throughout the convention, Democrats brought together people of different backgrounds, races, creeds, and political beliefs who shared one goal: saving the soul of our nation. Michelle Obama said it best: Donald Trump just isn’t cut out to be the president. We’re here to end the Trump era. Will you pitch in to help us do it?

We got our marching orders from nearly every speaker we heard from: We MUST put Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in the White House. But in Virginia, the job doesn’t end there. We need to reelect Senator Mark Warner. We need to send Representatives Luria, Scott, McEachin, Spanberger, Beyer, Wexton, and Connolly back to Washington. We need to flip the 1st and 5th districts and send Qasim Rashid and Dr. Cameron Webb to join them in Congress.
We have a massive job ahead of us. Voter registration is down 40% this year compared to 2016, and Republicans are pouring hundreds of thousands of dollars into flipping the 2nd and 7th districts red. We need your help more than ever before, friends. Please chip in today to fight for the soul of our nation and the future of our Commonwealth.
Here’s to the next 74 days,

Chris Bolling,info@vademocrats.org,Trump's house of cards,"Friend, the house of cards is coming down.
The investigations into Donald Trump’s many abuses of office have shown us, without a doubt, that Donald Trump deserves to be impeached by the House and removed by the Senate. I believe in House Democrats to do the right thing for our nation but I don’t trust Senate Republicans like Mitch McConnell and Lindsey Graham.
At the end of the day, the rubber-stamp Republicans in the Senate likely aren’t going to stand up to Trump despite the mountain of evidence that says they should. That means it will be up to us to defeat him at the polls next year. Regardless of who our Democratic nominee is, we’ll need to be prepared for a fight in 2020. Will you chip in today to help us get ready for the fight?

Next year, we’ll have to do what some elected officials won’t: use our votes at the ballot box to kick Donald Trump out of office in November. His path to victory runs through Virginia so we’re going to need to build a ground game early so the Democratic nominee already has a foothold here in our Commonwealth.
We can build the infrastructure needed to win in Virginia with your help -- but we need to start now. Make a donation today!

Democratic Party of Virginia
Friends,
Usually, we talk about Election Day. But in reality, it’s more than just one day -- it’s an entire Election Season. It starts today.
Long before Election Day arrives, we’re hard at work making sure that Democrats in Virginia will turn out in big numbers. Here’s just some of the things that are already happening:
* Starting tomorrow, an unprecedented number of absentee ballots will be mailed to voters across Virginia.
* Virginians will be voting every day from now until November 3.
* The deadline to register to vote is in just 25 days.
In other words, we’re officially in crunch time.
We’ve been preparing for this moment ever since Donald Trump was elected. Will you chip in today so we can help Joe Biden win Virginia and the White House?

Together, we can win.

DPVA HQ,info@vademocrats.org,Reproductive rights are on the line,"Virginia Democrats are fighting for them.
Tell VA Democrats you stand with them in the fight for reproductive and women's rights!
Friend,
On this day in 1973, the Supreme Court passed down the landmark Roe v. Wade decision, enshrining the right to an abortion into law. Since then, Democrats have worked to continue the progress on reproductive rights and women’s rights in general. Last week, we saw an enormous win here in Virginia when the new Democratic-led General Assembly passed the Equal Rights Act (ERA).
But the truth is, in the Trump era, our reproductive rights are on the line every single day. Will you pledge today to support reproductive rights by voting for Democrats in 2020?
Here’s why we need action on reproductive rights:
* Virginia still has a Republican-passed law on the books that requires women to have an ultrasound at least 24 hours in advance of an abortion -- a burdensome and unnecessary procedure.
* With two Trump-nominated justices on the Supreme Court, both chosen in large part for their anti-choice leanings, Roe v. Wade could be overturned at any time.
* We could end up with Alabama-style and Georgia-style abortion restrictions here in Virginia if we don’t take action.
Thanks to our Democratic majorities in the General Assembly, we finally have the chance to move in the opposite direction from these other states -- and pass legislation that protects the rights enshrined in Roe.
Virginia Democrats are ready for this fight -- but they need to know that you’re with them. Add your name if you are!
Thank you for all you do,
Team DPVA

VA Congressional Update,info@vademocrats.org,Scott Taylor is back (again),"We can't let him win.
Welcome to Scott Taylor & Donald Trump's Washington
Friend,
Does the name Scott Taylor ring a bell? In case you missed the recent news, the former Congressman decided to drop his Senate campaign against Mark Warner and instead run for his old seat in the second Congressional district.
This is the same Scott Taylor whose campaign allegedly committed what a judge called  “out-and-out fraud”  in 2018 when they forged signatures to try to get an independent candidate on the ballot. His campaign is still under criminal investigation by the way.
It’s the same Scott Taylor who has spent the entire year since he was fired by his constituents grandstanding and failing to get a job in the Trump administration.
It’s the same Scott Taylor who made  a sexist attack  on Congresswomen Abigail Spanberger and Elaine Luria when he called them  “girls with national security backgrounds”  in an interview when he launched his recent campaign.
Now Scott Taylor is trying to win his old seat back and defeat Representative Elaine Luria this year. Can you chip in to help us protect her seat?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:

DONATE $10
DONATE $25

DONATE ANOTHER AMOUNT
Even though his own constituents kicked him out of office in 2018, Scott Taylor and national Republicans are going to do everything they can to win that seat back this year. The National Republican Campaign Committee has listed this seat as one of their top targets, and Republican groups have already started running TV ads against Rep. Luria.
We can’t let Taylor win again, which is why we’re counting on you to step up early so we can protect this seat.
We might have sent Scott Taylor packing once, but this is going to be a competitive race no matter what. Donald Trump won the district in 2016, and the margin was close in 2018. With Trump on the ballot again, we need to do everything we can to make sure we have a successful voter turnout operation in the district so that we win up and down the ballot.
Scott Taylor thinks he can win his old Congressional seat back with Donald Trump’s help. Donate now to prove him wrong.
Thanks,
Team DPVA

Friend,
ALERT: Donald Trump and the Republican Party are trying to turn Virginia RED! Will you donate now to help us stop them?
The Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee (RNC) are already laying the groundwork for victory in key states, including our Commonwealth. And they have a LOT of cash to help them do it!
That’s why they are able to hire thousands of staffers -- and make millions of phone calls to get out the Republican vote. Help us catch up with them!
This means that we have to work that much harder to defeat Donald Trump here in Virginia and to hold on to the congressional seats (part of our big, Blue Wave in 2018 -- and essential to Democrats having taken back the House) which are now vulnerable.
Friend, the team here at DPVA is doing everything we can to make sure we take back the White House on November 3rd and elect Democrats up and down the ballot. But we need your help. If you’re able to, will you chip in today to help us keep Virginia BLUE?

2020 Poll Alert (via DPVA),info@vademocrats.org,Cameron Webb is within the margin,"We wanted to make sure you saw this:
Dr. Cameron Webb can flip the fifth. Donate now!
Folks,
We haven't seen an opportunity like this in the 5th Congressional District in a decade. In a recent poll, Dr. Cameron Webb is within the margin of error in a head-to-head against the GOP nominee, Bob Good. We've been saying that the 5th CD is in play all year, it just took some other national folks a while to realize what we've known for a long time: We can flip the fifth in 2020.
Donate to our Flip the Fifth Fund today to help us send Cameron Webb to Washington in November!
The difference between Dr. Webb and Bob ""not"" Good couldn't be starker. Dr. Webb would be one of the only Black physicians in Congress and served as a White House Fellow during the Obama Administration. He ran on his experience as a healthcare provider and policymaker. Bob Good ran as an anti-LGBT candidate who believes English should be the national language, wants to abolish birthright citizenship, opposes abortion in all cases -- even in cases involving assault or for the health of the mother -- and compared the Supreme Court's decision to legalize gay marriage to the Dred Scott decision.
What else can we say? Bob Good is a bigot and we need to keep him out of Washington D.C. Please donate if you know that his way of thinking has no place in our government.

2020 Election Update,info@vademocrats.org,Republicans are beating us in voter registrations and fundraising,"We need to turn this around now -- not in a few weeks.
Democratic Party of Virginia
Friend --
Turnout is how Democrats win in Virginia -- it’s how Virginia stayed blue in 2016, and it’s how we’ll beat Donald Trump again.
But with just 65 days to go, Republicans are beating us in both new voters registered and fundraising.
We need to turn this around now \-- not in a few weeks.
Donate $20.20 to help us close the registration gap, turn out our voters, and keep Virginia blue.
The pandemic means we can’t go door-to-door to reach unregistered voters, and that has us worried about turnout on Election Day.
We must increase voter registrations if Democrats are going to win the Commonwealth in November -- and it’s not just the presidential race, friend. Key congressional races around Virginia are at risk.
Our digital program is scaling as quickly as possible, and we’re limited only by our resources -- the more we have, the more voters we can reach. It's that simple.
Can you donate $20.20 today to register Democrats and keep VA blue?
Thanks,

CNN: With a war chest of $20 million at its disposal, the Republican National Committee's legal team has started to take action -- and is poised to do more -- against voting laws and policies that they view as unconstitutional and potentially damaging to the President's prospects of winning.
Friend,
The New York Times just released a groundbreaking report revealing years of Donald Trump's tax returns. Now we know why he wanted to hide them: He only paid $750 in 2016 and 2017! Let's see if we can raise more than that right now -- will you contribute $7.50 right now to help us kick Donald Trump out of office for good?
Trump is a failed businessman who lost the fortune that was left to him, was paid a bunch of money to play a billionaire on TV, and has posted huge losses in most of the last 20 years -- which allowed him to not pay ANY taxes for ten years.
He’s a liar and a cheat who has spent his career stealing from hardworking Americans. Someone like him -- who doesn’t pay their fair share to support our country -- doesn’t deserve to be in charge of it.
We deserve better than this, Virginia. If you agree, please donate $7.50 today to help us get Joe Biden in the White House and send Trump packing.

Friend,
The vice presidential debate -- Senator Kamala Harris vs. Vice President Mike Pence -- is coming up in 24 hours! If you’re able to, will you chip in right away to help us reach our pre-debate goal of $7,000?
We have just 28 days to go until November 3rd. And people are already early voting here in our Commonwealth!
The stakes in this election could not be higher. The presidency, the Senate, and the House are all on the line. We have the chance to replace Donald Trump and Mike Pence with Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. And we can send great Virginia Democrats back to Congress to help Democrats keep the House!
But it’s not going to be easy. The Trump campaign, the Republican Party, and the dark money groups who support them are all spending a TON of cash to flip Virginia back to RED \-- and to erase all of the gains we made in our Blue Wave of 2018!
We can’t let this happen. That’s why we’ve set a goal of raising $7,000 before tomorrow night's debate. Will you help us do it?
If we hit this goal, we can help make sure Joe Biden and Kamala Harris WIN Virginia’s 13 electoral votes.
And we’ll help our Democratic delegation return to Washington, flip control of the Senate, and ensure that Virginia stays BLUE!
But friend, we can’t do it without you. And the clock is ticking, FAST.

Team Warner,info@markwarnerva.com,"ethical, moral, and logical","Mark Warner for Virginia
Friend --
After failing to adequately protect Americans from the deadly COVID-19 virus, Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress are now refusing to help Americans through the economic crisis that has resulted from their failure of leadership.
Mark Warner and his Democratic colleagues in the Senate are working to pass the next round of COVID relief, which would extend the enhanced unemployment insurance beyond July. It would also help state and local governments pay essential employees like teachers, firefighters, and sanitation workers. Plus, this bill would ensure that small businesses get the relief they need. Thousands of small businesses — especially minority-owned businesses — have not yet received the relief loans they were promised.
Mark Warner is working hard to hold the Trump administration accountable and make sure every American gets the relief they need. Now, we’re asking for your help to make sure he stays in the Senate, fighting for us. If you have the means, will you chip in to help keep Mark in the Senate?
There’s a clear ethical, moral, and logical choice this November: electing Democrats up and down the ballot. The Trump administration and GOP-controlled Senate’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic left many Americans out in the cold. We have the power to make a change, but to flip the Senate blue, it’s crucial that we keep leaders like Mark Warner in the Senate.
Please, help us get back on track.
Thank you for your support.

Gerry Connolly for Congress
Hey, did you see the news?
Our grassroots movement to demand protection for the USPS is working! The Postmaster General just announced that he would postpone all proposed changes to the USPS until after the Nov. 3 election.
Of course, this sounds like great news, but we can’t breathe a sigh of relief just yet. Some of those changes, like getting rid of sorting machines, have already happened. On Saturday, the House is going to pass a bill to undo all of these changes and properly fund the USPS. But we need the Senate to pass it, and to do that we need your help. Sign on now to demand the Senate act and save the USPS >>
SIGN ON NOW
It’s safe to assume that Trump’s assault on the USPS will not end after this PR stunt. His willingness to manipulate and derail the upcoming elections truly knows no bounds. And the USPS is the critical institution that could make or break this upcoming mail-in election. Even beyond this election, the USPS must be protected so it can continue to provide essential services to millions of Americans, especially those who have limited mobility and need access to important goods like medicine, food, and paychecks.
We need Congress to act immediately to safeguard the USPS in order to both protect our elections and protect this important institution. Sign on if you agree >>

Millions Have Lost Health Insurance in Pandemic-Driven Recession
— The New York Times
Friend, this is unacceptable.
In just the first four months of the pandemic, more than five million Americans lost their health care coverage, many due to coronavirus layoffs. We’re still in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic. This is the worst possible time for Virginians and their families to be uninsured.
Mark Warner believes in making sure every Virginian has access to quality and affordable care. And it’s been a top priority of his in the Senate. To him, fighting for our health care means strengthening our existing laws, like the Affordable Care Act, working to lower the cost of health care and prescription drugs, and expanding access to those who need coverage.
Will you make a donation to Mark’s re-election campaign so he can continue protecting our health care in the Senate?
Mark has always defended our health care, and he understands that things are different during the pandemic. He’s passed legislation expanding telehealth options to Virginians so they can get the care they need from their own homes when possible, and he’s also working to ensure that folks can hang onto health care coverage they have through work.
Mark has defended the Affordable Care Act every chance he’s gotten. Meanwhile, President Trump and Republicans in the Senate are doing their best to dismantle the ACA in the midst of a global pandemic — without a proposed replacement. It’s critical that we re-elect Mark and regain a Democratic majority in the Senate to block any attempted repeal of the ACA.
If you’re able to, please contribute to Mark’s campaign. Let’s keep him in the Senate protecting our health care.

Team,
As Trump continues his assault on the USPS and our elections, the House is working today to save the postal service. Later this afternoon, we will pass a bill to shore up the finances of the postal service and roll back all of the sabotage moves from Donald Trump and his handpicked crony Postmaster Louis DeJoy.
On the other hand, the Senate is still on vacation. And they didn’t even pass any additional COVID-19 relief before they left! We did our job in the House by passing the HEROES Act THREE MONTHS AGO, which would provide that essential relief. Now, thanks to Mitch McConnell, Americans everywhere are still waiting on COVID-19 relief and too many are struggling to keep their homes, their jobs, and food on the table. Sign our petition now to demand the Senate get back to work and pass the HEROES Act now!

The HEROES Act invests in hazard pay for essential workers, housing assistance, unemployment benefits for those who lost their jobs, and so much more. But with every day that passes by, families around the country are pushed closer to hunger, homelessness, and economic insecurity.

Team,
President Trump’s immigration policies continue to hit rock bottom. The other day, we found out that the Trump Administration cannot find the parents of five hundred and forty five children they separated at the border.
And now, the Trump administration has gotten rid of due process for undocumented immigrants in an effort to expedite deporations all over the country.
That’s why we’re fighting back -- sign on to demand that President Trump stop his inhumane, expedited deportations NOW!

By eliminating court hearings for undocumented immigrants, ICE agents are now judge, jury, and prosecutor for these vulnerable immigrants. And experts say that these new rules could even put legal US residents at risk of detention or even deportation.
Clearly, just because an election is approaching, doesn’t mean President Trump has stopped his destruction of our country and values. We’re doing everything we can to kick Trump out of the White House (and you can support our Get Out the Vote Fund now!), but we cannot let the election distract us from holding him accountable NOW.

Friend —
We hope this email finds you and your loved ones safe and healthy. Our team is committed to sending these weekly updates to keep folks around Virginia up to date with what Mark Warner is focused on in the Senate.
Here’s what Mark is working on right now:
* After more than three and a half years of work, Mark and his colleagues in the Senate Intelligence Committee released the fifth and final volume of the Russia investigation, detailing contacts between the Trump campaign and Russian operatives during the 2016 election. Mark will continue to work with the Intelligence Committee to prevent foreign interference in our elections. Sen. Warner encourages everyone to read the report and to draw their own conclusions.
* Mark continues to seek answers from Postmaster General Louis DeJoy after changes made to USPS caused serious delays in mail to millions of Americans and created uncertainty around the feasibility of voting by mail. Although DeJoy says he will suspend his changes, more action needs to be taken to reverse what he has done.
* Joe Biden has been formally nominated as our candidate for president at the Democratic National Convention this week. Here's how Mark weighed in.
* Just because we're socially distancing doesn't mean we can't connect with our elected officials. Mark hosted his latest town hall on Facebook on Wednesday to answer questions about issues that matter the most to folks around the Commonwealth.
* Last week, Mark met with community leaders and health care professionals from Rockingham County and Harrisonburg for a socially distanced roundtable discussion regarding health care concerns and solutions during the coronavirus pandemic. Harrisonburg and Rockingham County have been hit hard during this pandemic, and Mark will continue to work to ensure all Virginians get the relief they need.

Friend, did you know that with a single donation, you can help
1. re-elect Mark Warner;
2. help elect Joe Biden; and,
3. boost down-ballot Virginia Democrats running in close races?
All of this can happen if we send Mark back to the Senate with a resounding victory! Can you donate today to re-elect Mark Warner, and flip more districts in the Commonwealth?
Let us explain more what we're talking about. Here's how this has happened in the past:
When Senator Tim Kaine won re-election in 2018, he won seven out of Virginia's 11 congressional districts. Democratic congressional candidates also won in those seven districts, but they fell short in the districts that Senator Kaine lost.
We expect this same pattern to repeat itself in the 2020 election. If Mark wins his race by a large enough margin, he can help boost down-ballot candidates in their own races, which is especially important in toss-up districts like VA-05, where Dr. Cameron Webb faces an extreme GOP opponent.
Our goal is simple: we're trying to do everything in our power to help Mark win his race, so down-ballot Democrats can also win their competitive races.
Will you help us reach our end-of-quarter (the last one before Election Day!) goal and help send Mark Warner back to the Senate?
Thank you for all of your support!

Content note: anti-LGBT+ sentiment, sexual assault.
Friend —
Mark Warner’s far-right GOP opponent is starting to roll out his endorsements, and — well, we’ll just let you read for yourself. Here are some of the stances held by Daniel Gade’s supporters, in their own words:
“The last thing in the world the black community needs is more destruction of the family, more attacks on the family, and that’s all this whole homosexual movement amounts to. It is a virulent, violent attack… It is the homovirus for the family.”
— E.W. Jackson, Gade supporter
“It’s those who are naive and unprepared that end up raped. Sorry. But I’m not going to be a statistic.”
— Amanda Chase, Gade supporter
Chase and Jackson are in “good” company — former Trump White House officials Sebastian Gorka and Sean Spicer have also voiced their support for Daniel Gade. The folks above support extreme views and are determined to roll back the progress we’ve made nationwide to make our country more equitable. And they all support Gade.
We have a lot more work to do to leave this country in a better place for our children and grandchildren, which means we can’t afford to take any steps backward.
Support Mark Warner’s re-election campaign to keep Virginia moving forward.
If you’re concerned about health care, climate change, racial justice, LGBTQIA rights, and a host of other issues, you should be concerned by the folks Daniel Gade is aligning himself with. We can protect the progress we’ve made in Virginia, but we’re going to need all hands on deck.
Bottom line: Daniel Gade’s endorsement list reads like a who’s who of folks who want to roll back progress in Virginia.
If you’re financially able, will you contribute to send Mark Warner back to the Senate so he can keep working hard for every Virginian?

Team Warner is committed to sending weekly updates to keep folks around the Commonwealth up to date with what Mark is working on in the Senate.
Here is just some of what Mark has been working on:
* Mark joined Rep. Elaine Luria and a group of veterans and military families for a virtual roundtable discussion of the challenges they face during coronavirus and beyond. Mark is committed to making sure that military families and veterans have adequate and affordable health care, including mental health resources, safe housing, and access to opportunities.
* After Twitter’s security breach this week, Mark called on the platform to release more information. Mark has a record of holding tech companies accountable, and said that “the ability of bad actors to take over prominent accounts, even fleetingly, signals a worrisome vulnerability in this media environment.”
* Mark proposed an employee retention credit as part of coronavirus stimulus funding, which would incentivize businesses to keep employees on their payrolls, and prevent furloughed workers from losing health insurance benefits.
* Mark announced this week that he is working on a new bill to expand economic opportunity in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, particularly for women-owned and Black and brown-owned businesses, to make sure that everyone has access to the federal grants and loans they need to financially recover.
* Mark discussed his Accessible, Affordable Internet for All Act, which would make a major investment in rural broadband nationwide. As we face a period of unprecedented demand for teleworking, distance learning, and telehealth, it’s critical that we address the digital divide. More than 700,000 Virginians lack access to affordable, reliable broadband, and Mark is determined to make a change.
* Last week, Mark joined Senate colleagues to introduce the 1619 Act to increase awareness and access to African American history in our schools, with educational programs and training opportunities for teachers using resources from the National Museum of African American History and Culture. Black history needs to be recognized beyond the month of February, as an important part of history curriculums in our schools.
Thank you for your support.

"Marcy, Team Warner Digital Director",info@markwarnerva.com,a quick ask,"Mark Warner for Virginia
We're just 5 days away from Election Day, friend!
I'm sure that your inbox is full of requests for last-minute donations, so I'll make this quick.
Here's my ask: can you chip in $5 to help us reach voters in these last 5 days?
Here's what the digital team can do with your contributions five days out from the election:
* Pay for the digital ads already reaching voters on social media, Snapchat, and on online news outlets.
* Expand the reach of our digital ads in these final days before the election to get out the vote in every corner of the Commonwealth.
We're setting turnout records in Virginia with more than 2 million votes already cast, but that doesn't mean we can let up on the pressure. We're working hard to make sure that we turn out as many voters as possible, and that means reaching folks where they are: on their phones and computers.
Chipping in $5 will help us reach more voters and make sure they have the tools to make their voices heard. Can we count on you?
Thank you,

Republicans in Virginia have raised over $12 MILLION.
Pitch in by our FRIDAY DEADLINE to fight back.
Friend —
Republicans in Virginia have raised over $12 million so far to defeat Mark and flip Virginia red. Republican PACs, special interest groups, and GOP donors are pouring money into the Commonwealth to support his GOP opponent and roll back the progress we’ve made in Virginia. If we’re going to keep Mark in the Senate fighting for us, we need your support now.
If you’re able, will you pitch in to help us meet our end-of-month goal?
Mark narrowly won his race in 2014 — by a less than a 1% margin. We’re now less than 100 days from Election Day 2020, and we can’t afford to take anything for granted, especially with the investment that the GOP is making in the Commonwealth this year. Mark can win and protect the progress we’ve made in Virginia, but we’re going to need all hands on deck.
We need to hit our end-of-month deadline on Friday to stay on track with our fundraising and make sure Mark wins big on Election Day. If you have the means, will you help us reach our goal?

Countdown to the end of month deadline
Donate before our end-of-month deadline
Friends —
This is the last end-of-month fundraising deadline of this campaign, and the stakes are high. This is our final chance to mobilize Virginia voters to make sure that we keep the Commonwealth blue on Election Day by electing Democrats up and down the ticket.
If you have the means, will you help us meet our fundraising goal before the end of the month?
Our team is working hard to make sure that we turn out as many voters as possible and elect Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Mark Warner, and all of our wonderful Congressional candidates. Whether America is able to move toward true equality in the years to come depends on the outcome of the election on November 3rd. Whether Mark Warner stays in the Senate fighting for us, or is replaced by a rubber stamp for the Trump Administration’s dangerous agenda depends on how we vote now.
Friend, there are only six days until Election Day, and to make sure we keep the Commonwealth blue, we’re going to need all hands on deck. That starts with re-electing Mark Warner, so he can continue to defend the progress we’ve made in Virginia.
Will you pitch in to help us to meet our last fundraising goal and reach as many voters as possible?

Mark Warner for Virginia HQ,info@markwarnerva.com,🚨BREAKING: Trump just endorsed Mark’s opponent 🚨,"It's official: Donald Trump just endorsed Daniel Gade against Mark.
Mark Warner for Virginia
Friend, it’s official:
DONALD TRUMP JUST ENDORSED
MARK WARNER’S OPPONENT
Contribute now to re-elect Mark Warner and protect the progress we’ve made in Virginia.
Virginians deserve better. We need an independent fighter in the Senate, someone who is loyal to his constituents. That person is not Daniel Gade.
President Trump and Daniel Gade are two peas in a pod. See for yourself:
* As coronavirus cases soared across the country, Gade said, “The president’s leadership on this has been great.”
* He joined the president in dismissing urgent guidelines from public health experts, saying, “Every time you put on your [[URL REDACTED]] is what tyranny feels like.”
* And, just like Trump, Daniel Gade opposes equal rights for LGBTQ+ Virginians, a woman’s right to choose, and Medicaid expansion, which would give more Virginians access to affordable health care.
* Gade has also pushed back on being a “rubber stamp” for the Trump agenda, but he’s already said that Trump’s Supreme Court nominee should be confirmed. Friend — that person hasn’t even been named yet, and Gade is already siding with Trump.
On every single issue, Daniel Gade is on Trump’s side — not our side. If he takes Mark’s seat in November, we won’t have a champion for every Virginian in the Senate — we’ll have a rubber stamp for Trump.
Pitch in to keep Mark in the Senate, working for us.
Thanks for your support. Together, we can protect the progress we’ve made in Virginia.

Mark Warner,info@markwarnerva.com,How I'm voting.,"Mark Warner for Virginia
Friends —
We need to talk about the Supreme Court.
The Senate Judiciary Committee just jammed through the nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett in a blatantly partisan, one-sided process less than two weeks before a Presidential election.
Let me be clear: I will be voting NO on Judge Barrett's nomination on the Senate Floor.
Protecting Virginians’ health care is at the top of my reasons for voting this way. The Supreme Court is set to consider the Trump administration's lawsuit to strike down the Affordable Care Act and its protections for people with pre-existing conditions, with no replacement, just a few weeks after the election. We simply cannot afford a Supreme Court Justice like Judge Barrett, who has openly attacked the ACA's constitutionality. And frankly, I can't think of a worse way to honor the legacy of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg than to replace her on the court with someone so openly hostile to the Constitution's protection of a woman's right to choose.
Justice Ginsburg was someone I respected and admired, and I know she was a role model for many Virginians. It is just shameful to see the future of the seat she held be determined by Donald Trump and Senate Republicans, instead of the American people.
But even if they deprive the American people of their say on this Supreme Court seat, the future of the Supreme Court is still on the ballot on November 3rd. It is absolutely critical that we flip the Senate and send Joe Biden to the White House. So we need to channel the pain and frustration that so many of us are feeling right now into action. That is how we honor Justice Ginsburg's memory and continue to pursue the notions of justice and quality to which she dedicated her life. With just 13 days until Election Day, I ask you to keep up the fight and join me in making our voices heard on November 3rd.
Sincerely,
Mark Warner

Friends —
We hope this email finds you and your loved ones healthy and safe. Our team is committed to sending these weekly updates to keep folks around Virginia up to date with what Mark Warner is working on in the Senate and his areas of focus.
Here's what Mark is working on right now:
* This week, Mark Warner announced the Department of Justice (DOJ) pilot program for the Ashanti Alert system, which was created by legislation he passed in 2018. After months of pressure from Sen. Warner on the DOJ, this life-saving program is at last being implemented. It would help states spread the word about missing persons who are too old for an Amber Alert, and too young for a Silver Alert, which is reserved for senior citizens.
* Mark Warner talked in-depth about his plan to help communities of color that have been disproportionately impacted by the coronavirus pandemic. Mark’s Job and Neighborhood Investment Act includes investment in Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) and Minority Depository Institutions (MDIs), a Neighborhood Loan Program to support small business lending to businesses serving low- and moderate-income and minority communities, and additional programs to strengthen MDIs and CDFIs, aimed at strengthening the relationship between these institutions and federal agencies like the U.S. Treasury.
* Mark Warner called for passage of his States Achieve Medicaid Expansion (SAME) Act, which would allow states (like Virginia) to further benefit from expanding Medicaid benefits, and to incentivize states that have not already expanded their programs to do so. Mark will continue to fight to expand Medicaid access; he argued that passing this expansion is critically important as the coronavirus pandemic continues and more than 5 million Americans find themselves having lost health insurance benefits tied to their employer.
* Mark Warner supported an amendment that would expand critical health care and benefits for Vietnam veterans suffering from illnesses after exposure to Agent Orange. This amendment has broad bi-partisan support, and would expand benefits for more than 22,000 veterans.
* Mark Warner called for aid for the U.S. Postal Service during the pandemic. Millions of Americans rely on the postal service for bills and payments, medication, and other essential services.
* Just because we’re physically distancing from one another doesn’t mean we can’t connect with our elected officials! Mark Warner held another virtual town hall this week with Rep. Bobby Scott to talk about the issues that matter to their constituents. Click here to view that town hall.
Thank you for your support.

Policy Team (Mark Warner for VA),info@markwarnerva.com,Survey: COVID-19 relief bill,"Will you please fill out our quick three-question survey?
Mark Warner for Virginia
Friends —
Mark Warner has been outspoken about the fact that Congress must pass and the President must sign another coronavirus relief package to help folks who are struggling during the coronavirus pandemic. Unfortunately, the GOP-controlled Senate has refused to pass a bill that would actually get resources to folks who need them — not just prop up corporations.
Mark Warner is focused on making sure that we’re taking care of Main Street, not just Wall Street, and that every Virginian is getting the resources they need to make it through this challenging time.
Now, he’s looking for your thoughts on a new relief bill. Will you please fill out our quick three-question survey?
Take the survey.
President Trump is flip-flopping on whether or not he wants a second relief bill — and the American people are paying the price. Recently, he even tweeted that he was instructing Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin to end all negotiations until after the election ... before intense criticism caused him to change his tune just a few days later.
The health, safety, and economic security of Virginians is a serious matter. Mark Warner won’t play politics with Virginians’ lives and livelihoods.
That’s why Mark wants to hear from folks like you. Please take his survey today and tell him your thoughts.
Thank you,

Mark Warner is working hard in the Senate to make life better for every Virginian. Our team will continue to send these weekly updates to keep folks around Virginia up to date with Mark’s priorities.
With just a few days until Election Day, here’s what Mark is up to:
* Mark visited with folks in Harrisonburg and thanked the community for getting the vote out early. He spoke about his support for the Affordable Care Act and the critical need for every Virginian to have access to fast and reliable broadband internet, especially during the pandemic.
* The Richmond Free Press endorsed Mark because of his work to protect the health care of more than 400,000 Virginians and preserving the Affordable Care Act, his legislation that would invest in low-income communities and businesses especially hit hard during the pandemic, and his efforts to prevent veterans suicide and protect military families.
* Mark spoke about his plans to push for more relief in the Senate during the pandemic, and how he makes protecting health care for Virginians and building back our economy his top priorities.
* As the pandemic continues to prove that the internet is a necessary utility and not a luxury, Mark spoke with community members in South Boston about his plan to continue with local, state, and federal governments to provide broadband access for everyone in Southside Virginia.
* Mark has always fought in the defense of Southwestern Virginians with pre-existing conditions and to ensure that everyone in Southwest Virginia has access to quality, affordable health care. With the threat of the repeal of the Affordable Care Act looming, a vote for Mark will ensure the protection of the health care of more than 400,000 Virginians.
* Mark stopped by Bibleway Cathedral in Danville and spoke to members of the congregation about his plans to refinance student loans, advocate for meaningful police reform and accountability in our justice system, and the importance of voting in this upcoming election.
* Election Day is just TWO days away! Creating the change you want to see in Virginia and in our country starts with making your voice heard on November 3rd. Make your plan to vote on Election Day at [[URL REDACTED]]

Mark Warner for Virginia
Friend,
Mark Warner is about to head onstage for his second debate tonight at Norfolk State University. Mark’s eager to share how he plans to continue the fight for racial justice in the Commonwealth, and across the nation, during Norfolk State’s inaugural U.S. Senate debate.
Debates are key moments in any race. They can halt a candidate’s momentum right in its tracks — or even help losing candidates quickly close the gap in the final few weeks. Will you pitch in before Mark steps on stage to keep this campaign moving in the right direction?
Heading into this second debate, our team isn’t taking anything for granted. Mark won by less than 1% in 2014, so we know it’s critical that we keep up the grassroots momentum as we head into these final weeks before Election Day.
The clock is ticking. Hundreds of thousands of Virginians are already voting and millions more will soon cast their ballots. This our chance to decide if we want to move the Commonwealth forward — we can’t afford to cede any ground.
If you can, please consider donating today to keep Mark in the Senate and safeguard progress in Virginia.
Thank you,
Team Warner
P.S. Be sure to catch Mark at the second debate tonight! Watch at 5 PM ET on Norfolk State University’s Facebook page.

There are just two days until Election Day. More than two million Virginians have already cast their ballots, but we need to make sure that we keep voter turnout up so we can send Mark Warner back to Washington and elect Democrats up and down the ballot.
Pitch in toward our $10,000 goal to help us mobilize voters over the next two days.
We’ve seen this before — high voter turnout in the Commonwealth won’t just help Mark win re-election — it’ll give Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and Virginia Democrats all the way down the ballot a boost. When you support our voter mobilization efforts you’ll be helping to start a giant blue wave that will wash across the entire Commonwealth.
Friend, we can’t leave anything to chance this year. We’re working nonstop in these final days to help Mark win his race — and to help other Democrats like Joe Biden and House candidates win theirs. But it will all depend on how many voters we can turn out between now and Tuesday.
Can you help us meet our goal so we can reach as many voters as possible before November 3rd?

Before the tuna melt and the emergence of the Two Slice Man, Mark Warner was the governor of Virginia. Under his leadership, Virginia was named the Best Managed State, the #1 State for doing business, the best state for public education, and made historic investments in expanding rural broadband. Beyond those accomplishments though, the campaign had an incredible logo.
We've gotten a number of requests to recreate the logo so folks can showcase how long they've supported Mark Warner. So, for Throwback Thursday this week, our campaign is taking it old school.

Mark Warner for Virginia
Friends —
Communities up and down the coast of Virginia have made it perfectly clear: Offshore drilling poses a threat to coastal communities.
When the Trump administration announced their plans to drill off the coast of Virginia, Sen. Warner rushed to bring together his colleagues from both sides of the aisle to oppose any new drilling. Drilling off Virginia’s eastern shore would disrupt fragile natural ecosystems, threaten important naval operations, stymie the work of NASA at Wallops Island, and cause outdoor recreation and aquaculture to suffer.
Sen. Mark Warner will continue to oppose expanded drilling proposals in the Senate to protect Virginia’s natural beauty and outdoor tourism industries.
Will you join him in signing our petition to oppose offshore drilling in Virginia?

The NRA thinks this rating will hurt me. But I’m proud of my ""F"" rating -- help me show them it’s a badge of honor by chipping in now so we can keep fighting back against the gun lobby!
CHIP IN NOW
The NRA is the most powerful gun lobby and it serves to increase profits to the gun industry -- regardless of the human cost. Despite the appalling toll of gun violence in our country, the NRA refuses to back down. Instead, they cut big checks to lawmakers to ensure that nothing but “thoughts and prayers” are offered to victims.
That’s why we need people in Congress who aren’t beholden to or afraid of the NRA. Contribute now to help me keep up my work fighting back against the NRA and securing gun violence prevention victories in Congress!

Gerry Connolly for Congress
Wow -- it’s hard to believe it. We set one of our most ambitious monthly goals ever last month…and we did it! We surpassed our August fundraising goals by activating 763 grassroots donors -- that’s almost DOUBLE our usual monthly average.
That means our campaign will be starting September off in a great place -- we’ll have the funds to educate voters in our district, spread the word about absentee voting, and be prepared for anything else that comes up in this crazy election season.
Your support for me and other Democrats empowers us to do the work that we all believe in -- from demanding racial justice, to rebuilding our economy, to protecting our elections, to holding the Trump administration accountable. Only by each of us stepping up, like so many of you have, can we turn the tide against the terrible and alarming direction that President Trump has been pushing our nation towards.
The election to finally end Trump’s presidency and reorient our country after four long years is coming up in just a couple months now. And the thought of Democrats taking this one for granted keeps me up at night. Because friend, our fight is not over yet. In order to ensure that we elect President Joe Biden, keep this seat blue, and strengthen our Democratic coalition, we must keep fighting every single day until November. I’m so thankful for and proud of your engagement last month, but we are NOT DONE YET.
So, can I count on you to support our campaign and give us a headstart on our penultimate month of fundraising by chipping in $11 now?

I’m just reaching out to make sure you saw this message from my wife. Re-reading this, I remember the pit in my stomach as we watched the election returns in 2014, realizing that it would be a closer race than we thought.

Mark Warner for Virginia
Washington Post: Warner has staked a legitimate claim as one of the more effective, constructive and genuinely bipartisan lawmakers in Congress.
Happy Friday, friend!
I’ve got some great news to share with you. The Washington Post Editorial Board just endorsed Sen. Warner for re-election.
I hope you’ll take a moment to read the endorsement below and consider making a donation to help our get-out-the-vote efforts so we can finish strong.
In 12 years on Capitol Hill, Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.) has staked a legitimate claim as one of the more effective, constructive and genuinely bipartisan lawmakers in Congress. In a place where grandstanding, pandering and interparty venom are nearly normal, Mr. Warner is frequently the grown-up in the room, a measured and substantive Democrat who has forged partnerships with key Republican colleagues. Virginians would do well to reelect him this year to a third term in the Senate, and we endorse him.

Gerry Connolly for Congress
Team,
I’m excited to say we officially have our Democratic ticket for President and Vice President of the United States! Both Joe and Kamala are deeply qualified, smart, empathetic and representative of the best our country has to offer. They have what it takes to not only beat Donald Trump and reverse the damage he has done to our country, but also create progress on the path to justice and equality for all.
Of course, we still have a challenging and uphill battle ahead of us -- especially with Trump doing everything he can to sabotage the election, including his unrelenting attempts to decimate the USPS.
Now, we’re only going to be able to win this election if each and everyone of us steps up, learns how to vote absentee, and VOTES! We the people have the power and we must use it to stop four more years of Donald Trump. So, will you sign on now and commit to vote in the upcoming election?
COMMIT TO VOTE
Let's be clear, it’s not just the issues that are on the ballot this November. Our very democracy is at stake. With four more years, Trump could cause untold and irreversible damage to the fabric of our nation, including our core institutions and principles. Electing Joe Biden and Kamala Harris (and Democrats at every level here in Virginia and beyond!) is the only way to save this country and also to ensure that we can expand affordable healthcare, fight for our climate, protect our DREAMers and unions, and provide more COVID-19 relief to our workers and small businesses.
We cannot afford four more years of the Trump administration. Sign the pledge and commit to vote now →
SIGN THE PLEDGE
Thank you for your support – onward to November!

Team,
Can you believe it? Early voting in Virginia has already begun -- that means important elections like mine, the one for the White House, and races up and down the ballot across the state are already being decided.
Watch this special video I created to encourage you, and the rest of Team Connolly, to vote and then chip in to help us get the vote out all across our district and the state!
WATCH THE VIDEO
I know, you’ve heard it before -- because it’s true: this is the most important election of our lifetimes. This is our last chance to remove Donald Trump from the White House before he utterly ruins our nation if given another term. By electing Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, we can protect Americans from the consequences of a mismanaged pandemic, and finally begin serious work to end climate change, implement racial justice, and of course -- save the USPS!
But it’s not just the White House -- maintaining our Democratic majority in Congress, and sending a progressive wave through local races is essential to accomplishing our Democratic agenda.
So, please, take a second and watch this video I made for you and then chip in a few dollars to help us get out the Democratic vote!
WATCH THE VIDEO AND CHIP IN
Thanks so much for all your support -- with your help, we’ll turn this country around.

Friend,
Tonight, Mark Warner will take the stage for his final debate with his GOP opponent. This is the People’s Debate, sponsored by the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP).
Tune in: watch the livestream on WTKR’s Facebook page, or check your local TV listings.
Mark is fired up and ready to talk about his record of building economic security and defending our health care in the Senate. Mark has the track record to prove he’ll protect our health care: he’s worked hard to defend the Affordable Care Act (ACA), lower the cost of prescription drugs, and expand access to medical services like telemedicine.
On the other hand, Mark’s opponent has already promised to be a rubber stamp for the Trump administration’s attacks on Virginians’ health care and called the ACA a “bad bill.”
There’s a clear choice — but we need your help to keep this campaign going strong.
Will you chip in to make sure that Mark can stay in the Senate, working hard for every Virginian?

Trump uses Rose Garden event for extended campaign-like attack on Biden
— Washington Post, 7/14/20
Pitch in now
Friends —
Unprecedented, despicable and embarrassing.
Yesterday, Donald Trump used the Rose Garden to hurl false attacks at Vice President Joe Biden at what was a campaign rally thinly disguised as a “news conference.” Trump took to a podium outside the Oval Office and ranted, rambled and hurled pre-scripted attacks on Joe Biden for nearly an hour.
Independent fact-checkers haven’t gotten all the way through the transcript yet, and they’ve already found 19 false or misleading statements in Trump’s Rose Garden rant.
Friends, we CANNOT allow these lies to go unchecked. We must all do our part to elect leaders up and down the ticket who will restore integrity and honesty to Washington. Mark Warner has been fighting to hold the president accountable from day one.
Chip in $19 for each of Trump’s false claims that have been uncovered so far.
What’s worse, Donald Trump made a mockery of the dignified setting normally used for official presidential announcements. We know he is upset because he’s had to cancel campaign rallies, but it violates White House protocol to launch campaign attacks against political rivals in speeches in the Rose Garden.
This November, let’s finally put an end to Trump’s lies and elect Democratic leaders like Mark Warner, who will restore integrity to Washington. If you have the means, will you support Mark’s re-election campaign?
Thank you,
Team Warner

Friend —
First, the GOP claimed that Virginia was a “battleground” state that they could flip back to red in the 2020 election.
Then, the Trump campaign opened offices all across the Commonwealth and raised millions of dollars in Virginia.
NOW, Donald Trump is tweeting that he’s “going to WIN” Virginia and planning campaign rallies in the Commonwealth.
Bottom line: The Trump campaign and the GOP are determined to win Virginia in November. We know better than to underestimate them. This team remembers Mark Warner’s last election — he won by less than 1%. We’re not taking anything for granted in this election.
We’re running up against our final end-of-quarter fundraising deadline before Election Day — and these fundraising numbers will be public.

Gerry Connolly for Congress
Team,
On Friday, our nation lost a trailblazing legend in the fight for justice. Ruth Bader Ginsburg broke down innumerable barriers for women and marginalized communities throughout her career. Her fearless resolve to move our nation forward has served as an inspiration to millions of Americans, myself included.
As some of you know, Justice Ginsberg and I shared not only a passion for progress but also a love for the opera, and I would see her from time to time at Wolf Trap. Two years ago my daughter and I were there and we got the chance to chat with her and tell her what a role model and hero she was for us personally and for so many others. This weekend, as I reflected on her passing with my family, I felt such gratitude for the chance to thank her in person.
Now, as we mourn, we must also join together to carry forth her legacy of upholding our highest democratic values. That means Justice Ginsburg’s seat should not be filled until the next president is sworn in! Sign on now if you agree →
SIGN ON NOW
But, unsurprisingly, the reaction from Republican leadership over the weekend has been absolutely callous and undemocratic as Trump and McConnell rush to replace Justice Ginsburg. Not only does this fly in the face of the precedent they set four years ago to ensure Supreme Court Justices are not appointed in the final months before an election, it also goes against Justice Ginsburg’s final wish just days before her death: ""My most fervent wish is that I will not be replaced until a new president is installed.”
Sign on now to demand the Senate respect Ginsburg’s dying wish and the voice of the American people by waiting until after the presidential swearing-in to vote on a new justice.
ADD YOUR NAME
I know, these last several months have been exhausting as we give everything we have to fight for the soul of our Democracy in the midst of unprecedented turmoil. So, I truly want to thank you, and the rest of Team Connolly, for continuing to join me in turning our collective anger, fear, or sadness into progressive action, especially in light of this grave loss -- I’m honored to have you by my side.

Hey there,
If we haven’t met yet, I’m Gerry’s campaign manager.
In a moment here, I’m going to ask you to chip in $11 to help us hold onto our Democratic majority in the House, keep Virginia blue, and flip the White House in 2020! Feel free to skip ahead and donate now \-- but I’m going to take a minute to stop and explain why we really need your support right now:
We know that right now, politics is the last thing on your mind. Coronavirus has upended all of our lives, our businesses, and even our political process. Out of concern for the safety and health of our staff, volunteers, and supporters, our campaign has suspended all in-person campaign events, canvassing, rallies, and fundraisers.
That’s right -- our campaign is now operating exclusively online. That means email and social media are some of the only ways we can stay in touch with you and raise money to fuel our campaign. We're responsible for ensuring Virginia is solidly blue on November 3rd, and we have to put together an aggressive campaign to keep leaders like Gerry in Washington fighting for you.
We understand that some people cannot afford to contribute during these times. But right now, online fundraising is the only way we can support critical campaign efforts. So if you’re able, please chip in $11 or another amount to our Digital Fund now!

Gerry has been on the frontline of the fight to protect the economic security and health of our families in the federal government's coronavirus response. He stood up to the administration’s indifference and inaction on this crisis, and their plan to create a slush fund for Trump to dole out to his wealthy friends.
This crisis has shown us exactly why we must hold the House, take back the Senate, and stop Trump’s divisive and anti-democratic agenda -- and folks, we ALL have to do our part.
The money we raise right now will dictate the choices we can make over the next several months. And honestly, what we have now won’t allow Gerry to make the impact we need. That’s why I’m reaching out to you today.
So, if you are able, help us keep Gerry in office and elect Democrats at every level by contributing to our Digital Fund today! With your help, we can keep our campaign operations going strong during these uncertain times -- helping elect more Democrats from across the nation and building towards big wins up and down the ballot in November!

Friends —
We hope this email finds you safe and healthy! Team Warner is committed to sending weekly updates to keep folks around the Commonwealth up to date with what Mark Warner is working on in the Senate. Below are some of Mark’s priorities and updates on legislation that we mentioned in previous update emails.
Here’s some of what Mark is focused on right now:
* As coronavirus cases spike nationwide, Mark joined Senate colleagues in sending a letter to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) urging several government agencies to reconsider bringing federal employees back to work sites prematurely. Mark believes that federal workers should have access to telework and other health protections.
* Mark joined Senators Gary Peters, Bob Casey, and Jacky Rosen in introducing the 1619 Act to increase awareness and access to African American history in our schools, with educational programs and training opportunities for instructors from the National Museum of African American History and Culture. Black history needs to be recognized beyond the month of February, as an important part of our history curriculums.
* Last week, Mark introduced the Accessible, Affordable, Internet for All Act, a bill to expand access to affordable high-speed internet. More than 700,000 Virginians don’t have reliable broadband internet access, and Mark has been focused on bridging the digital divide throughout his time in the Senate.
* In June, the Great American Outdoors Act passed the Senate with bi-partisan support. The bill, which also includes full funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF), could support 100,000 jobs across the country — 10,000 in Virginia alone — while providing the resources to address the maintenance backlog in our national parks.
➙  Up next: This bill has to pass in the House of Representatives before it goes to the President’s desk for signature.
Thank you for your support.

Team Warner,info@markwarnerva.com,Restore the Voting Rights Act,"Mark Warner for Virginia
Friend, this is unacceptable.
On August 6, 1965, the Voting Rights Act was passed to end discriminatory voting practices. This important law made sure that Black Americans and other voters of color were not denied their right to participate in our democratic process.
Unfortunately, this act was gutted by a 2013 Supreme Court decision, which allowed voter suppression to run rampant. This has taken the form of states enacting strict voter ID laws, purging voter rolls, shutting down polling stations, and more. And we’ve already seen hours-long lines to vote on primary day in Georgia and Kentucky this year.
This is making it harder for everyone to vote — especially people of color. Enough is enough.
In honor of Rep. John Lewis, who put his body on the line to secure equal voting rights for all — and with the most important election of our lifetimes just a few months away — it’s critical that Congress act NOW to block discriminatory voting practices.
Join us in demanding that Congress restore the Voting Rights Act immediately.
Thank you for your support.

Over one hundred million dollars raised: GOP Super PAC fundraising alarms Senate Democrats -- Hufpost
Friend —
We'll keep this short, because the headline above says it all.
A GOP super PAC has been pouring millions of dollars into keeping the Senate under Republican control. There's no way to sugarcoat that, but there is a way to make sure they don't succeed. We need to re-elect the Democratic senators we already have — folks like Mark Warner — to make sure we have a strong foundation as we build toward a blue Senate.
Chip in to re-elect Mark Warner, so we have a path to a blue Senate this year.
We can flip the Senate this year — but only if we're able to fight back against this late money. And a critical part of the strategy to win the Senate is re-electing Democratic senators who are already serving. If Mark Warner loses, our chances to flip the Senate evaporate.
If you can, please consider chipping in to keep Mark Warner in the Senate and preserve our path to a blue Senate.
Thank you!

Guess what everyone? There are now fewer than 50 days until Election Day -- and the end of this month will mark our FINAL end of quarter fundraising deadline before the election!
Last month we activated more online grassroots donors than any other month ever. And this month, as we approach that critical EOQ deadline, we're working to beat our record! But it's already the middle of the month, so if we're going to reach that goal we need 171 more donors TODAY!

If we don’t hit our mid-month goal today, it could put us in a difficult situation where we don’t reach our final end of quarter goal. That will impact critical last minute decisions like how much we can invest in digital ads, field, mail drops, bumper stickers, and yard signs. And at such a critical moment in this election cycle, those decisions could have a huge impact on our ability to educate and turn out voters before the November election.
That’s why it’s absolutely essential that we activate 171 more donors and hit our mid-month goal by midnight. So chip in $25 or whatever you can now and help us reach our goal!

Friends —
We’re 34 days away from Election Day on November 3rd. We’re in the home stretch, but that doesn’t mean we can afford to lose steam.
I remember 2014, when Mark Warner was projected to win handily — and the race was decided by fewer than 17,000 votes. I’m sure our whole team remembers that.
That’s why we’re doubling down on our efforts to make sure Virginians are registered and informed about how they can cast their ballots this year. We need to replicate the record Democratic turnout that we saw on Super Tuesday if we’re going to bring this home.
There is so much at stake: this election is our chance to get Donald Trump out of the White House and get this country back on track. Plus, we have a real path to the Senate majority, but that can only happen if we hang onto seats like Mark’s.
Can you chip in to help us keep Mark in the Senate and pave the way for a Democratic majority?
As I watched the debate last night, I had to remind myself to keep channeling the anger I feel at the mismanagement of our nation into action.
Right now, our country is being led by a President who doesn’t pay his taxes and won’t answer for thousands of American deaths on his watch. And Mark’s opponent supports him unconditionally — he appeared with Trump at his rally in Newport News, and he’s indicated he’d be just another rubber stamp for the Trump agenda if elected. We have the power to make sure that doesn’t happen.
We can’t let ourselves get discouraged — we’re almost to the finish line. Help us get there.
Chip in to keep Mark Warner in the Senate, fighting for us.
Thank you.

Friend —
I hope this email finds you well. I want to take a moment to thank you for being a member of Team Warner and to explain why hitting our mid-month goal this August is absolutely critical to sending Mark Warner back to the Senate.
With about 80 days to go until Election Day on November 3rd, our team knows it’s time to kick things into high gear. This campaign is different from any other I’ve ever worked on. The pandemic has forced us to shift events online and start talking virtually with voters. To do this, we’ve had to make big, unexpected investments in digital outreach, and it’s my job to make sure we have the money we need to pull it off.
To stay on track, we cannot fall short on even one fundraising goal. That’s why I’m asking for your help.
If you have the means, will you chip in today to help power Mark Warner’s re-election campaign to victory this November?
Another major challenge will be the unprecedented demand for mail-in ballots, and a current administration that seems dead set on blocking the U.S. Postal Service from getting the funding it needs. We’ve had to start helping people make their plan to vote earlier than ever before this year, which made us shift our field and outreach strategy.
Team Warner has been working tirelessly to connect with voters, make sure they have the resources they need, and check that folks feel comfortable with their options to cast their ballot this year. I’m amazed by the hard work that our staffers and volunteers have already put in to make sure we re-elect Mark Warner and elect Democrats up and down the ballot during this extremely challenging time.
Our organizers are doing their jobs, which means I’ve got a job to do too. As the finance director, it’s my responsibility to keep this campaign running smoothly by making sure our organizers have the tools they need to do their jobs.
So please, if you have the means, please chip in and help us meet our critically important mid-month goal.
Whether you’re able to give today or not, please know that donors like you are what keeps this campaign moving forward, and your support means the world to us. Thank you for supporting Mark Warner.

I was stunned when I saw the President of the United States threaten to postpone the November election. Even for Donald Trump, this is something new, something downright dangerous.
Trump tweet: With Universal mail-in voting, not absentee voting, which is good, 2020 will be the most INACCURATE and FRAUDULENT Election in history. Delay the election until people can properly, securely, and safely vote???
We cannot let this President use the pandemic as an excuse to undermine our American system of free and fair elections. From his repeated lies about safe and secure mail-in ballots, to his attacks on the Postal Service that will deliver them, and his open embrace of foreign interference, we know that is exactly what is happening before our eyes.
Here's the truth, friend. We are in a fight for our democracy. We must do everything we can between now and election day to get this President and his enablers out of office. That starts with keeping Virginia blue. It's virtually impossible to elect Joe Biden and flip the Senate if we don't.
That's why I have to ask you for your help tonight. If we are going to successfully execute our voter turnout operation and win this November, we have to hit our monthly fundraising goal. Chip in by midnight tonight and your contribution will automatically be doubled.

We hope this email finds you and your loved ones safe and healthy. Our team is committed to sending these weekly updates to keep folks around Virginia up to date with what Mark Warner is focused on.
Here’s what Mark is working on right now:
* Last week, Mark met with residents of Harrisonburg for a community check-up where Mark discussed how he is working to ease inequities across industries, including public health, education, and front line workers. Mark will continue to work to ensure all Virginians get the relief they need.
* Mark visited with community leaders in Abingdon to speak on the federal response to the coronavirus, expansion of broadband services for schools that are going virtual in the fall, and a greater need for telehealth services amid the pandemic.
* Of course, he made time to stop by Skeeter’s for their world-famous hot dogs!
* Mark visited Roanoke and the Blue Ridge Parkway to meet with tourism officials to discuss the Great Americans Outdoors Act. The bill will fund $1.1 billion in maintenance needs at Virginia National Parks and support as many as 10,000 jobs in Virginia.
* In a visit to downtown Lynchburg, Mark listened to the concerns of local leaders and organizers regarding broadband, CARES Act funding, and unemployment benefits. Mark knows the importance of broadband in rural Virginia, and he will work with his colleagues in Washington to provide funding to support this essential service in the next CARES Act bill.
* Mark spoke with community leaders about the future of a post-COVID economy in Winchester as he toured the Emil & Grace Shihadeh Innovation Center. With 10% to 20% of jobs lost as a result of the pandemic, Mark is working on how he can assist the new workforce generation in a digital world.
* Mark discussed issues related to the coronavirus pandemic and small businesses in Woodstock, Virginia. During the discussion, he talked with community leaders about the next round of CARES Act funding and how the pandemic has affected small businesses.
* Mark endorsed Dr. Cameron Webb, who is running for U.S. Congress in Virginia’s 5th District. With his years of service to central Virginia, and his expertise as a doctor and a lawyer, Dr. Webb's voice is one that is sorely needed in the halls of Congress.
* In a letter to prominent tech companies, Mark urged them to bridge the homework gap and help all Virginia students participate in distance learning this fall. As more educators and students prepare to go back to school virtually, Mark will continue to work to ensure virtual learning is equitable for all students in Virginia and across the country.
* Mark continued to press Postmaster General Louis DeJoy to answer for his attempts to weaken the U.S. Postal Service. Mark is doing everything in his power to ensure that all Virginians can count on USPS to deliver their medicine, pay their bills, and cast their ballots come November.
* Mark called on President Donald Trump to denounce his support of QAnon. With the release of the latest intelligence report detailing the Trump campaign’s contact with Russian operatives during the 2016 presidential campaign, Mark will continue to work on the Senate Intelligence committee to keep foreign interference out of our elections.

Politico: Trump gets some good election news: GOP voter registrations outpace Dems
Friends —
Right now, the GOP is outpacing Democrats in new voter registrations.
We know that the last thing anyone wants right now is bad news, but we’re less than 100 days out from Election Day 2020, and we can’t afford to let this trend continue.
This bad news comes on the heels of other frustrating developments:
* Donald Trump is leading Joe Biden in campaign donations from Virginia; and
* Mark Warner’s opponent has already raised over $1 million in his campaign to flip Virginia red.
All this means if Mark is going to pull out a victory in November we’ve got to seriously ramp up our own fundraising. Will you pitch in before our end-of-month deadline on Friday to help us register more voters, re-elect Mark, and keep Virginia blue?
Friends, we already know this election is going to look different — we’re still in the middle of a global pandemic. Thankfully, Virginians have the option to vote with a no-excuse absentee ballot, vote early in-person, or cast their ballot on Election Day. But expanded ballot access isn’t going to do any good if we don’t register folks to vote.
Now, more than ever, it matters who we put in charge of our country. We must elect leaders who will navigate the Covid-19 crisis responsibly, who will expand access to affordable health care, and who will help pull us through this economic crisis. The first step is getting as many folks as we can across the Commonwealth registered to vote.
Will you help us do it by chipping in by Friday’s end-of-month deadline so we can make sure that everyone is able to make their voice heard this November?
Thank you for your support!

Team Warner,info@markwarnerva.com,The Supreme Court and the ACA are on the ballot.,"Mark Warner for Virginia
Friends —
We’re just 22 days away from Election Day, and there is so much on the line this year.
We’re working hard to re-elect Mark Warner and other Democrats up and down the ballot who are dedicated to protecting the progress we’ve made in Virginia. But your vote this year is for more than just the people who represent us.
This election will decide what kind of country we are — and what kind of country we want to be. The future of the Supreme Court and the Affordable Care Act are both on the line.
This administration has made it clear that they’re more concerned with hanging onto power however they can — not with the wellbeing of the American people. They’re trying to push through a Supreme Court nominee just weeks before the election, when millions of Americans have already cast their ballots. And they’re doing their best to strip away health care coverage (including coverage for people with pre-existing conditions) in the middle of a global pandemic.
It’s critical that we elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to turn the tide in Washington. But there’s also a real path to turn the Senate blue this year, but to do that it’s absolutely critical that we hold the seats we already have — seats like Mark Warner’s.
If you believe we need to keep Virginia blue and keep our Commonwealth — and our country — moving forward, please consider supporting Mark Warner’s campaign.
Your donation is an investment in the future you want to see for Virginia. Thank you for your support.

Gerry Connolly for Congress
SIGN ON: Save the USPS from Trump! →
Friend,
I care deeply about the issues that are important to our community and feedback from supporters like you, and the rest of Team Connolly, is instrumental in guiding my policy agenda. So, thank you for taking our issue survey (if you missed it, you can still take it here)!
The resounding winners of our survey were “Standing Up to Trump” and ""Voting Rights."" I’m far from surprised these are your top concerns and I want you to know I'm already taking action.
Just last week, I was on Meet the Press talking about President Trump’s latest attempt to undermine our democracy. You can watch the full interview here:
Trump has pledged that he will not sign the next stimulus package because it gives much needed aid to the USPS. He came out and admitted that the reason he won’t save the post office is because if he stops Americans by voting by mail, he can win the election. We must call this what it is: blatant voter suppression.
And we must defend the USPS! Sign on to my petition right now to tell Congress that we need to save the USPS from Trump’s reckless ego.
SIGN ON: SAVE THE USPS!
Now, what Trump doesn’t understand is that the USPS does so much more than ensure Americans can complete their civic duty. The USPS ensures rural communities receive prescriptions, delivers social security checks to the elderly, and employs hundreds of thousands of dedicated postal workers.
We cannot stand by idly while a crucial institution is torn apart by Trump’s cronies -- including the campaign donor he put in charge of the post office. And we cannot allow Trump to sabotage a much-needed stimulus package for his own political gain.
My colleagues and I will not submit to Trump’s blackmail. The House passed legislation to fund the post office IN MAY. We will fight for a comprehensive relief package that eases the suffering of American families and protects critical institutions like the USPS -- but we need your support. Will you sign on to demand Congress hold strong on protecting the USPS and defending our democratic right to vote safely?
SIGN ON NOW!
Thank you -- I couldn’t do this without you, and the rest of Team Connolly!

Friend —
We've got 62 days until Election Day, and we're going to need to make sure we keep up the momentum we saw on Super Tuesday in Virginia. A record number of ballots were cast in the Democratic primary, and we need that kind of history-making turnout on November 3rd if we're going to elect and re-elect Democrats up and down the ballot.
So please, if you haven't already, make sure you're registered to vote. Whether you're planning to vote with a no-excuse absentee ballot, vote early in person, or vote on Election Day, it's so important that you have a plan to cast your ballot. You can check your registration status here: [[URL REDACTED]]
As we move forward, I know that nothing is guaranteed. I'm thinking back to 2014, when I won my race by less than 1%. But I'm feeling hopeful, and a lot of that has to do with support from folks like you who are on Team Warner.
I'm ready to keep rolling up my sleeves and putting in the work to make life better for everyone in the Commonwealth. Thank you for supporting me along the way. Let's go out and win on November 3rd.

Dear Friend —
Election Day is one week away. Do you have a plan to vote?
Election Day is November 3rd, and Virginians are already breaking records. More Virginians cast their ballots early this year than in 2016, but we’re not done yet. With more options to cast your ballot this year, it’s now easier than ever to have your voice heard.
There’s still time to vote early in person if you’d like — you have until October 31st. Whether you’re voting early or voting in person on Election Day, it’s crucial that you have a plan to cast your ballot. Head over to [[URL REDACTED]] for more information.
This election could be a crucial turning point for our country. We need to elect leaders who will navigate the COVID-19 pandemic responsibly, expand access to affordable health care, and build an economy that doesn’t leave anyone behind as we transition to an increasingly digital economy. We have the power to re-elect Mark Warner and elect Democrats up and down the ticket who will keep us moving forward. It all starts with your vote. Let’s continue to build on the momentum and push through this final week before the election!
Thank you for your support!

P.S. If you’ve already voted, THANK YOU! If you’re looking to help Team Warner continue our last big push before Election Day, pitch in to help us reach as many voters as possible in these final seven days.

Gerry Connolly for Congress
Wow, I almost can’t believe it: In August we broke the record for our most ever online grassroots contributions, and then in September we absolutely CRUSHED that record! Last month, 971 grassroots donors stepped up to support our campaign and ensure we have the funds we need to turn out every single Democrat in Virginia.
I’m ready to celebrate but, I'll be honest, my team is a bit concerned about those final numbers. We had set a goal of activating 1,000 grassroots donors and we missed it by just 29. It seems so small but my team knows every single vote will make a difference in November and every dollar will help us ensure Virginia stays blue and help take the Senate back and grow our House majority.
So, how would you feel about an extension? All we need is 29 more donors to step up TODAY and we can hit that goal and start our last month off strong!

We’re coming to the end of the month, and it’s critical that we hit our fundraising goal to send Mark Warner back to the Senate. I’m coming to you with some good news: Generous donors agreed to match every dollar we raise, up to $10,000! That means your donation will be doubled.

We can’t afford to fall short on our fundraising goals. We all know that the election is going to look different this year, and we need to make sure our team has the resources to adapt to virtual events and educate voters about their options to cast their ballot.
Plus, the last time Mark Warner was on the ballot, he won by less than 1%. Our team knows that we can’t afford to take anything for granted. With the Trump campaign and GOP donors pouring money into Virginia, we need to make sure we have the resources to reach every voter and keep Virginia blue in November.
We could not do this without you. Our team is what keeps us moving forward to support Mark Warner and Democrats up and down the ballot. Right now, I’m asking for your help to meet our July goal — and your impact will be doubled.

One of my favorite things about basketball is knowing you and your teammates are all in it together: that adrenaline rush from being down by one point, the motivation to keep the lead while you’re ahead, and the effort by every single player that it takes to win.
That’s how I’ve approached this election too. We’ve seen in Virginia that this is a team sport, and that success in the Senate race can boost down-ballot candidates in their own races, which is especially important in toss-up Congressional races.

Gerry Connolly for Congress
Team,
Last night, in an unprecedented and shockingly anti-democratic move, the Senate voted to confirm Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court. Donald Trump celebrated his new Supreme Court justice with a campaign rally (illegally hosted at the White House). He hopes she'll steal this election for him by throwing out enough Democratic ballots to overturn the people's decision.
We have just seven days to do everything we can to ensure an end to Trump’s presidency, flip the Senate, and start fighting COVID and rebuilding our economy the right way. We have to win an overwhelming victory so that no unelected judge can steal this election, and we have to win every Senate seat we can begin undoing the damage to our nation's highest court.
Now, Joe Biden, Gerry Connolly, and the entire Democratic slate are depending on YOU to make sure that happens. Can you chip in $20.20 right now to help us do everything in our power to prevent a bitter disappointment on Election Day?

Donate to keep Mark Warner in the Senate
Friends —
Donald Trump knew about the severity and deadliness of COVID-19 and kept this critical information from the American people.
Over 200,000 Americans have died on President Trump’s watch, but instead of focusing on the public health crisis at hand, he’s focused on his re-election efforts and downplayed the grave danger of coronavirus. What’s worse: Mark Warner’s opponent is praising Trump’s “great leadership” during the pandemic.
That’s not the kind of leadership that we need in Virginia — keeping critical health information from the American public shouldn’t be worthy of praise. It doesn’t matter what political party you’re part of. That’s why we need to re-elect Mark Warner, who has been leading the way on bipartisan coronavirus relief.
Can you chip in to make sure Mark stays in the Senate, working hard for every Virginian?
Mark is committed to helping Americans who are struggling through this unprecedented crisis by working to expand unemployment benefits and ensure that every American has access to affordable health care. He’s taking the pandemic seriously.
Mark’s opponent doesn’t see things the same way. Instead of recognizing coronavirus as the serious public health threat it is, he’s held indoor events where masks were not required and even compared wearing a mask to “tyranny.”
This election is about the kind of Commonwealth — and country — we want to be. If you believe that Mark Warner’s steady leadership is the right choice for Virginia, please consider chipping in to support his re-election campaign today.
Thank you for your support.

Of course, we’d love to think that Virginia was a “safe” blue state — but our team remembers Mark’s election in 2014, where he won by less than 1%. The polling in that race indicated that his seat was safe, but the election was decided by just 17,000 votes.
And you can bet that the GOP remembers that, too. That’s why they’re investing in the Commonwealth to help Donald Trump win here and help Mark’s opponent unseat Mark in the Senate.
We need to protect the progress we’ve made here. Right now, every dollar counts as we try to show Mark’s broad base of support across the Commonwealth. Can you help us reach our $10,000 fundraising goal by midnight?

As you know, I’ve been laser focused on holding Trump’s cronies accountable and flipping the Senate.
And right now there’s an opportunity for us to do both at once: My Commonwealth PAC, which focuses on electing progressives to critical offices, is teaming up with the Jaime Harrison for Senate campaign. Together, we have the power to kick Lindsey Graham out of the Senate and flip his seat from red to blue! →
JOIN US →
The current Republican-majority Senate has confirmed too many conservative judges, dragged their feet on critical COVID funding, and served as a rubber stamp to Trump’s hate-fueled agenda. Flipping the Senate this November is paramount to creating real change and Lindsey Graham, in particular, has been one of Trump’s closest henchmen. It’s time for him to go.
Jaime Harrison will bring moral integrity back to the Senate -- he understands working people’s needs and how to fight for them. I’m so glad to endorse his race -- will you join me in supporting Jaime and making 2020 the year we kick Lindsey Graham out?

Warner HQ,info@markwarnerva.com,the GOP is determined to win VA,"Mark Warner for Virginia
The Trump campaign is opening offices and raising millions in Virginia. Donate now to re-elect Mark Warner and keep Virginia blue
Friends —
We’ll be frank: the Trump campaign and the GOP are making inroads in the Commonwealth.
The Trump campaign is continuing to open offices and pour money into Virginia to re-elect Donald Trump and elect Republicans down the ballot — including Mark’s challenger, who promises to be a rubber stamp for the Trump agenda.
If you’re able, will you make a contribution to help re-elect Mark Warner and keep Virginia blue in 2020?
More than 56% of campaign contributions in Virginia during this election cycle have gone to Republicans. If we’re going to make a change in November by electing Joe Biden and taking back the Senate, we need to make up ground.
The GOP thinks that Virginia is a “battleground state” — and they’re determined to win in November. We know better than to underestimate them. Our team remembers that Mark Warner narrowly won re-election by less than 1% in 2014, and we’re not taking anything for granted in this campaign.
The election is only 55 days away. We need your help to catch up to the Trump campaign and make sure that we re-elect Mark Warner and elect Democrats up and down the ticket. Can you pitch in?
Thank you for your support.

Mark Warner for Virginia
Friend —
Mark Warner just finished his final U.S. Senate debate against his GOP opponent in Richmond. As we’ve seen in the previous two debates, Mark’s plan to trust the science when it comes to a coronavirus vaccine, address transparency and accountability in our criminal justice system with the Justice in Policing Act, and ensure Virginians succeed in our new tech-driven economy shows there’s a clear choice in who should be representing Virginia in the Senate: Mark Warner.
We’ve seen Mark’s opponent’s positions on the issues:
* He’s compared giving health care to 400,000 Virginians to giving a child a cookie.
* He’s said Trump has shown “great leadership” in handling the pandemic.
* He’s called masks “tyranny.”
* Just a couple weeks ago he was in the audience of a potential super-spreader rally blowing Trump kisses.
… and the list goes on.
We have the opportunity to protect the progress we’ve made in the Commonwealth and keep Virginia headed toward a brighter future, and Mark’s opponent has proven that he just doesn’t have what it takes.
If you have the means, can you make a contribution towards Mark’s re-election campaign and send him back to the Senate to work for every Virginian?
There are just 21 days until Election Day on November 3rd. We simply can’t afford to lose momentum — there’s too much at stake for Virginians.

Mark Warner for Virginia
Friend —
Here's our plan to make sure Virginia is blue all the way down the ballot: we have to turn out as many voters as possible.
We know, friend, it seems like common sense. But it's so important that we don't let momentum lag in this homestretch, which is why we're reaching out today.
Your donation to our GOTV efforts in the final stretch will help re-elect Mark Warner, and flip more districts in the Commonwealth. Can we count on you?
High turnout and strong support for Mark Warner's race doesn't just help this campaign — we expect it'll help elect Joe Biden and boost down-ballot Virginia Democrats who are running in close races. And with so much at stake in this election, we're not willing to leave anything to chance.
Here's how this has happened in Virginia in the past: when Senator Tim Kaine won re-election in 2018, he won seven out of VA's 11 congressional districts. Democratic congressional candidates also won in those seven districts, but they fell short in the districts that Senator Kaine lost.
If Mark wins his race by a large enough margin, he can help boost down-ballot candidates in their own races, which is especially important in toss-up districts.
Can you help us bring a blue wave to Virginia?
Thank you for all of your support!

Mark Warner’s first debate with his Republican opponent is about to air.
We hope you’ll join us for the debate — Mark is looking forward to discussing his proven track record of delivering results that make life better for every Virginian. During his time in the Senate, Mark has led the charge on coronavirus relief, worked to make affordable health care accessible, and pushed to ensure every Virginian can succeed in our new tech-driven economy.
Mark’s opponent Daniel Gade, on the other hand, wants to roll back the progress we’ve made in Virginia. He’ll be a rubber stamp for the Trump agenda. Virginia needs an independent fighter in the Senate, someone who is loyal to their constituents — that person is Mark Warner.
We’re less than 45 days away from Election Day, when we’ll have the opportunity to re-elect Mark, flip the Senate blue, and elect Democrats up and down the ticket. In order to keep Mark in his seat in the Senate we need your help.
Please consider contributing to help send Mark Warner back to the Senate — every dollar makes a difference.
We hope you will tune in with us tonight! Together, we can protect the progress we’ve made in Virginia by re-electing Mark Warner. If you can, please consider chipping in to keep Mark in the Senate and keep Virginia blue.

Friends —
Team Warner is working hard to make sure Virginians are prepared to cast their ballots safely this November. This means getting as many folks across the Commonwealth registered to vote as we can — high turnout could help Mark Warner and Democrats up and down the ballot.
This year, Election Day is going to look a little different. As we face a global pandemic, we know that Virginians are looking for ways to cast their ballots while keeping themselves and their loved ones safe. That means the high turnout we need may come from folks casting no-excuse absentee ballots by mail.
If you have the means, will you pitch in to help increase our voter registration and education efforts across the Commonwealth?
Virginia Democrats are embracing vote-by-mail: they cast more than 60,000 absentee ballots in last month’s primary. We’ve got to keep that momentum going into November — and we need your help, friend. Right now, we’re seeing that new voter registration is down across the Commonwealth. Voter registration was a staggering 68% lower in May 2020 than it was in May 2016.
We have the power to reverse this trend, but that means we need help from folks like you. Our team is working hard to make sure that every Virginian knows how they can cast their vote safely this November, because no one should have to choose between voting and protecting their health. Will you join us to help increase voting by mail in Virginia?

Mark Warner is working hard in the Senate to make life better for every Virginian. Our team will continue to send these weekly updates to keep folks around Virginia up to date with Mark’s priorities.
Here’s what Mark is working on right now:
* Mark announced his intent to vote against Judge Amy Coney Barrett’s nomination for the Supreme Court. It is clear that the Affordable Care Act is on the line with this nomination, and Mark will continue to work to protect coverage for those with pre-existing conditions.
* Mark’s bi-partisan IMPROVE Well-Being for Veterans Act has been signed into law. This legislation will provide funding for critical mental health resources for veterans, as a way of addressing the epidemic of veteran suicides.
* Supporters across the Commonwealth weighed in on the reasons they support Mark Warner. They cited his diligence in strengthening our national security, his willingness to work across the aisle to solve problems, and his work to build an economy that works for all Virginians.
* Mark warned of foreign efforts to influence American elections in a bi-partisan joint statement with Senate Intelligence Committee Acting Chairman Marco Rubio. Mark will continue to speak out about the spread of misinformation online and work to ensure that our elections are fair and free of foreign intervention.
* Mark continues to lead the charge to make sure everyone has access to quality, affordable, health care. Joined by his Senate colleagues, Mark asked the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of the Treasury to research the impact of repealing the Affordable Care Act. If struck down by the Supreme Court, more than 20 million Americans could lose access to health care.
* Election Day is nine days away. Whether you plan to vote early in-person, mail in a no-excuse absentee ballot, or vote in-person on November 3rd, the first step is visiting [[URL REDACTED]] to make your plan to vote.

Friend —
Election Day is 117 days away, but as we face a global pandemic and see long lines for primary elections across the country, it’s time to start thinking about how you’ll cast your ballot.
Our team is working hard to make sure that every Virginian is able to safely cast their ballot — no one should have to choose between their health and exercising their right to vote. For some, that might mean voting by mail, and for others, that might mean voting in person early or on Election Day. We’re committed to making sure that folks know their options and are able to cast their ballots with confidence.
Mark Warner’s doing his part in the Senate by supporting the Natural Disaster and Emergency Ballot Act and the VoteSafe Act to expand early voting and vote-by-mail to ensure that folks across the country have the kind of expanded voting options that we now have in Virginia. He also joined Senate colleagues to urge the U.S. Treasury to provide assistance to the U.S. Postal Service — a critical service for many Americans and an important part of making sure mail-in ballots reach folks.
We need help from you, too! Here are three things you can do right now to protect ballot access and make sure you’re ready for Election Day.
1. Make sure you’re registered to vote and request your absentee ballot. If you’re a Virginia resident, you can do this on the VA Department of Elections website (and you can request an absentee ballot while you’re at it)!
2. Become a citizen co-sponsor of the VoteSafe Act. Led by Sen. Kamala Harris, this bill would expand early voting and vote-by-mail access across the country, allowing folks to vote safely.
3. Reach out to three friends to start talking about their plan to vote this fall. We have four months until the election, but it’s never too soon to make your plan!
Bottom line: Expanding our voting options doesn’t take away anyone’s right to cast their ballot in person if they choose. It adds options for those who may not feel safe or may not be able to visit their polling place by expanding early in-person voting and making voting by mail more accessible.
Thank you for your support.

Team,
Can you believe it? Early voting in Virginia has already begun -- that means important elections like mine, the one for the White House, and races up and down the ballot across the state are already being decided.
Watch this special video I created to encourage you, and the rest of Team Connolly, to vote and then chip in to help us get the vote out all across our district and the state!
WATCH THE VIDEO
I know, you’ve heard it before -- because it’s true: this is the most important election of our lifetimes. This is our last chance to remove Donald Trump from the White House before he utterly ruins our nation if given another term. By electing Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, we can protect Americans from the consequences of a mismanaged pandemic, and finally begin serious work to end climate change, implement racial justice, and of course -- save the USPS!
But it’s not just the White House -- maintaining our Democratic majority in Congress, and sending a progressive wave through local races is essential to accomplishing our Democratic agenda.
So, please, take a second and watch this video I made for you and then chip in a few dollars to help us get out the Democratic vote!

Hi friend.
I think the subject line says it all here — we’re 10 days away from Election Day, and I’m about to ask you to consider chipping in $10 to Mark Warner’s campaign.
You might be asking yourself: “What can $10 do if we’re just 10 days away from Election Day?”

And you’re letting us put more money behind the ads that are already working for us online — which means we can reach more voters in these critical final days before the election.
So, if you’ve seen an ad for Mark Warner in your newsfeed over the last couple of months, I hope you’ll consider chipping in $10 to make sure your neighbors and friends can see them too.
Thank you for everything you’ve done — and everything you will do — to support this campaign. We couldn’t do this without your support.

Mark Warner for VA,info@markwarnerva.com,No one is above the law.,"That hasn't stopped President Trump from flagrantly disregarding the Hatch Act.
Mark Warner for Virginia
Friend, we already knew that Donald Trump feels that he’s above the law. He’s demonstrated it time and again.
Last week, he continued the pattern during the Republican National Convention, turning the White House into a cheap prop for his re-election campaign.
Picture of the White House lawn during the RNC with Trump reelection propaganda.
It wasn’t just the President. He’s packed his administration with others who believe they’re above the law:
* Secretary of State Mike Pompeo gave a convention speech from Jerusalem, where he was traveling on the taxpayer’s dime.
* First Lady Melania Trump addressed the Republican National Convention from the Rose Garden.
* Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf staged an official naturalization ceremony as part of the televised convention.
There’s a reason why neither party has ever used the White House as the backdrop for their convention: it’s against the law.
A 1939 law called the Hatch Act made it a crime for government employees to do political work at taxpayer expense, and it bars the President from ordering federal workers to engage in political activity like, for example, throwing a political convention on the White House lawn.
It’s disgraceful, friend. With Senate Republicans enabling his lawless behavior, it’s clear the President believes he is above the law.
We need to send a message that laws and ethics still matter. To do that, we need to run this lawless President and his enablers out of town and flip the Senate blue. That starts with re-electing Mark Warner. Can you pitch in to Mark’s campaign and help us send a strong message on Election Day?

Mark Warner for Virginia
Friends —
You’ve likely been hearing a lot about how the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) is in trouble. This isn’t a scare tactic; I want to quickly make the case for Congressional action to protect USPS before I ask you to sign a petition.
I know there’s a little bit of a disconnect here — I’m the digital director for Mark Warner’s re-election campaign, and I’m asking you to support snail mail. I might spend most of my time online, but I still rely on the Postal Service.
The Postal Service isn’t something we can afford to lose, even in the digital age. It processes 182 million pieces of first-class mail every day. A lot of those pieces of mail are medication, bills, bill payments, and other critically important documents.
We depend on the Postal Service, even if we don’t think about it every day. During this time of unprecedented physical distancing, the postal system is providing a vital service to thousands of Americans who want to stay in touch with loved ones. And come November, many more Americans may want to use this system to safely cast their ballots by mail.
Saving the Postal Service does more than keep us connected — it keeps people employed. The U.S. Postal Service employs 600,000 folks across the country, and now their employment hangs in the balance. These hardworking people could lose their jobs unless Congress acts quickly to help the Postal Service.
Now that you’ve heard the case, will you consider signing our petition to protect USPS?
Thank you for hearing me out, and for your continued support.

Mark Warner for Virginia
Hi, friend —
The U.S. Postal Service is under attack by the Trump administration.
Postmaster General Louis DeJoy has done everything in his power to undermine a service that millions of Americans rely on: removing mailboxes, cutting staff overtime hours, and getting rid of mail sorting machines.
For the last few weeks I’ve been hearing from constituents who were bearing the brunt of these changes to USPS. I heard from folks who were told they were late on bills they never received, and folks who were waiting on important medications. I also heard from folks who wanted me to do more to protect this critical service.
So, here’s what I’m doing: I’m calling on Postmaster General Louis DeJoy to resign.
From what I’ve heard from Virginians and what is being reported across the nation, it’s clear that he’s not the right person for the job. We need someone in that post who will do right by the American people and who understands that the role of the postal service is to serve — service is even in the name.
If you’re with me, please sign onto my petition calling for DeJoy’s resignation.
Millions of people across the country rely on the postal service for their medicine, to pay their bills, and come November, to cast their ballots. I’ll do everything in my power to make sure you can keep relying on this critical service.

Happy Halloween everyone!
Halloween is a celebration of all that is scary. But what’s truly terrifying is what could happen if we lose this election. Reproductive rights, gay marriage, racial justice, environmental reform, healthcare access, and so much more are on the ballot.
That’s why we’re spending this Halloween working to get out the vote here in Virginia before Election Day on Tuesday. Can we count on you to chip in right now to make sure these fears don’t become reality?

Mark Warner for Virginia
Friend, did you know that with a single donation, you can help
1. Re-elect Mark Warner
2. Elect Joe Biden
3. And boost down-ballot Virginia Democrats running in close races?
All of this can happen if we send Mark Warner back to the Senate with a resounding victory! Can you send a donation today to re-elect Mark Warner and flip more districts in the Commonwealth?
Let us explain more what we’re talking about. Here’s how this has happened in the past:
When Senator Tim Kaine won re-election in 2018, he won seven out of VA’s 11 congressional districts. Democratic congressional candidates also won in those seven districts, but they fell short in the districts that Senator Kaine lost.
We expect this same pattern to repeat itself in the 2020 election. If Mark wins his race by a large enough margin, he can help boost down-ballot candidates in their own races, which is especially important in toss-up districts like VA-05, where Dr. Cameron Webb faces an extreme GOP opponent.
Our goal is simple: We’re trying to do everything in our power to help Mark win his race, so down-ballot Democrats can also win their competitive races.
Will you help us in this final stretch and make sure we send Mark Warner back to the Senate?
Thank you for all of your support!

Lisa Collis,info@markwarnerva.com,My husband Mark,"Mark Warner for Virginia
Friend,
I remember those nerve-wracking moments, sitting with my husband Mark as the results rolled in on election night 2014. That race was a lot closer than anyone anticipated — Mark won by less than 1%. We all know the stakes are even higher this year, and that’s why I’m asking for your help in these final weeks before Election Day.
As we all face this pandemic together, I know Mark is the public servant Virginia needs right now. As Governor, and now as Senator, I've watched him navigate tough negotiations through difficult days to make life better for Virginians. If there's a way for Mark to solve a problem or help folks in need, it's just about impossible to get him off the phone until it's done. I'm a little biased, but I think that's the kind of leadership that we need now more than ever.
These are challenging times, but my husband still believes there are brighter days ahead for our country and our Commonwealth. That’s Mark. Always thinking about the future and trying to bring people together around the things that unite them.
With so much at stake in this election, we can’t afford to take anything for granted. Early voting is already underway in Virginia, so I’m asking for your help to make sure we re-elect Mark, keep Virginia blue and flip the Senate.
Will you make a donation to help keep Mark in the Senate, serving Virginians?
Thank you for your support.

Mark Warner Campaign HQ,info@markwarnerva.com,drug companies have gotten away with too much for too long,"Mark Warner for Virginia
Friend —
In Mark Warner’s new TV ad, he takes on drug companies that keep jacking up the price of prescription drugs like insulin.
Watch Mark’s new ad and, if you can, help us keep it on the air around the Commonwealth.
This is a deeply personal issue for Mark. His daughter was diagnosed with juvenile diabetes at the age of nine. Mark knows that far too many Virginian families are struggling just to buy lifesaving drugs — like insulin — for their own kids.
That’s wrong. As Mark says in the ad:
“Drug companies have gotten away with too much for too long. I will continue to work to make affordable health care a reality for all Virginia families.” — Mark Warner
In the Senate, Mark has introduced legislation to get runaway prescription drug costs under control and to finally allow the government to negotiate for lower prescription drug prices.
We need to get this message out to as many Virginians as possible from now until Election Day. Since early voting has already started in Virginia, there’s no time to waste.
If Mark’s ad resonates with you, please consider helping us reach more Virginians with this important message.
Thank you for your support.

There's an ominous pattern in Virginia politics. Democrats win, then Republicans sweep in the next election:
2008: Mark leads ticket with 31 point win, Obama carries VA, VA Dems pick up two House seats; 2009: McDonnell wins VA by 17%, Republicans sweep statewide offices; 2013: Democrats win Governor's office and retake all statewide offices; 2014: Mark wins by less than 1%, Republicans carry 7 of 11 VA House Seats
After sending an incredible slate of Democrats to Congress in 2018, we can't afford to let this pattern repeat itself in 2020.

Friends —
We hope this email finds you and your loved ones safe and healthy. Our team is committed to sending these weekly updates to keep folks around Virginia up to date with what Mark Warner is focused on in the Senate.
Here’s what Mark is working on right now:
* Our nation’s parks will get some much-needed relief for crucial repairs thanks to the passage of Mark's Great American Outdoors Act, which was signed into law earlier this week. Now that this bill is the law of the land, our national treasures will receive funds for repairs that have been put off for years and will provide hundreds of thousands of jobs for Americans.
* Mark spoke with military spouses about the issues they face during these challenging times. Many of our military families face uncertainty when it comes to employment, and Mark will fight to ensure that active duty military and their families are protected by making a plan to increase testing and tracing of the coronavirus.
* Mark expressed his concerns about data privacy for a contact tracing app expected to launch in Virginia this month. The app uses Bluetooth technology to notify other devices that have also downloaded the app of a potential exposure to the coronavirus. Mark has been a leader in the Senate on coronavirus-related data privacy issues, sponsoring the Public Health Emergency Privacy Act, a bill to ensure the collection, retention, and use of data from screening tools is limited to combatting COVID-19.
* Mark voted for the annual defense authorization bill, known as the NDAA, which passed with strong bi-partisan support. The NDAA guarantees funds for the construction of two Virginia submarines, which will support shipyards in Hampton Roads and boost the local economy.
* Mark and Senator Tim Kaine cosponsored the Real Economic Support That Acknowledges Unique Restaurant Assistance Needed to Survive (RESTAURANTS) Act this week. This bill will give $120 billion to restaurants that are struggling due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. It will also help with the re-employment of 11 million restaurant workers.
* Mark continues to push for safe and healthy conditions in privatized military housing. Last year, his Ensuring Safe Housing for our Military Act was signed into law as part of the annual defense bill. That bill also included legislation Sen. Warner supported creating the first-ever “tenants bill of rights” for military families. Earlier this year, he traveled to Fort Lee to meet with military families and keep the pressure on the military and private contractors to implement these reforms. Mark will continue working to make sure military families live in safe homes, free from mold, pests, and other hazards.
* Mark joined his Senate colleagues to push for an extension of paid and sick leave for federal contractors and subcontractors until December 2021.
* Mark is fighting for gig economy workers with the Mixed Earner Pandemic Unemployment Assistance Act of 2020 that he introduced with Senator Tina Smith (D-MN). This legislation will make sure that Americans who rely on a mix of traditional (W-2) and independent employment income receive financial relief made available under the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) Program.
Just because we’re physically distancing from one another doesn’t mean we can’t connect with our elected officials! Sen. Warner is hosting a conversation about the Great American Outdoors Act for his constituents around the Commonwealth on Saturday, August 8th at 2:15 PM. Sign up here.
Thank you for your support.

As Mark Warner continues to work hard for every Virginian, our team is committed to sending these weekly updates to keep folks around Virginia up to date with what Mark is focused on in the Senate.
Here’s what Mark is working on right now:
* Mark’s bi-partisan IMPROVE Well-Being for Veterans Act is headed to the president’s desk to be signed into law. This bill will provide critical mental health resources to veterans, some of whom may be in crisis. Mark recognizes that the high rate of veteran suicides is a national tragedy, and is focused on making sure that servicemembers have the tools and resources they need to begin the lengthy healing process when they return from deployment.
* As early voting begins around the country, Mark is pushing the intelligence community to release more information about foreign interference in our elections. Although they are more equipped to counter attacks than in 2016, Mark believes a well informed American electorate is our best defense in keeping our elections fair.
* Mark asked the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) to study the impact of increased use of subcontracted and contingent workers to perform tasks previously done by full-time employees. Mark is concerned that the effects of increased subcontracted workers limits paths for upward mobility in the U.S. workforce.
* On Wednesday, Mark participated in the first Virginia Senate debate against his GOP opponent. Mark discussed his proven track record of delivering tangible results for the Commonwealth, and charted a path forward to ensure we protect progress in Virginia and ensure every Virginian has a fair shot at success. His opponent, on the other hand, proved to Virginians that he will just be another rubber stamp for Donald Trump’s agenda if elected.
> — The next debate will be at Norfolk State University on October 3rd.
* On Thursday, Mark participated in a town hall discussion on gun violence prevention with Rep. Jennifer Wexton, Lori Haas, Senior Director of Advocacy at The Coalition to Stop Gun Violence and Shannon Watts, Founder of Moms Demand Action. Click here to watch the recording, and make sure to “Like” Mark’s campaign page on Facebook to stay informed about upcoming town halls and other events.
* Voting has started in Virginia! Mark cast his ballot last Friday. If you’re not yet registered to vote, there’s still time! Go to [[URL REDACTED]] to check your registration status and find out where you can vote in your locality.

Friends —
We just passed a huge milestone — more than a million votes have been cast in Virginia!
Virginians are already turning out in record numbers to cast their ballots in this election. Whether you’re planning to vote early by mailing in a no-excuse absentee ballot, to vote early in-person, or to vote in-person on Election Day on November 3rd, it’s so important that you make your voice heard this year.
Friend, it’s not too late to get in on the early voting action. Due to an outage on the Virginia Department of Elections’ website yesterday, the deadline to register has now been extended to 11:59pm on Thursday, October 15. Even if you’re pretty sure that you’re registered, it doesn’t hurt to check again to guarantee that your voice is heard in this election. Head over to [[URL REDACTED]] to make sure that you’re registered and make your plan to vote.
There’s so much on the line in this election. We have the power to elect Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Mark Warner, and Democrats down the ballot. But to do that we’re going to need to match the record turnout we saw on Super Tuesday.
Make sure you make your plan to vote, and if you’ve already cast your ballot, thank you!
Let’s get out there and win!

Mark Warner for Virginia
Friends —
I'm sure this isn't the only email in your inbox letting you know that we're 100 days away from the November election. I hope you'll take some time to read about our strategy for Mark Warner's re-election campaign.
I am going to ask for your support to keep this campaign moving forward, but first I want to take a moment to congratulate our team on the hard work they've done and explain the path forward we've charted.
Working with the Virginia Coordinated Campaign, we've already reached impressive levels of voter contact, including:
* Over 2 million text messages exchanged with Virginia voters;
* Over 2,000 virtual events across the statewide organizing campaign;
* Over 100,000 phone calls made to Virginia voters;
* And over 700 volunteers activated to elect Democrats up and down the ticket.
But I know that to win this Fall, we need some help to keep the momentum going.
There's no doubt about it: 2020 looks different. We're facing a global pandemic. Instead of rallies and parades, our team has pivoted to online events, virtual town halls, and voter communication over text and by phone instead of face-to-face.
And, looking forward to November, I know folks are concerned about how to safely cast their ballot. We've adjusted our voter education efforts to include more information about all of the options to vote in Virginia, whether that's with a no-excuse absentee ballot, early in-person, or in-person on Election Day.
I remember Mark's 2014 campaign — he won by less than 1%. That's why we can't take anything for granted, especially during this massive shift in campaign strategy. I am so proud of this team for rising to the challenge. Now, I'm asking for your help to keep this campaign moving forward.
Here's that ask I promised at the top of the email: if you support Mark and want to protect the progress we've made in Virginia, will you contribute to Mark's re-election campaign if you have the means?
I've said it before, but it bears repeating: supporters like you are what keeps us going, Friend. I appreciate you taking the time to read more about our path forward.
Thank you for your continued support.

Folks can cast their ballots:
* By mail with a no-excuse absentee ballot;
* In-person during early voting; or

As November 3rd gets closer, we want to follow up. Will you answer a short survey about your plan to vote?

Tim Kaine and Mark Warner at a campaign rally together.
Friend,
We all know that Virginia is in good hands with Mark Warner as our senior Senator.
I’ve had the opportunity to know and work with Mark for the better part of 30 years, and I can tell you that his leadership, honesty, and commitment to fighting for what’s best for every Virginian make it an honor to serve alongside him.
This has been a tough year for all of us. I know that, and Mark knows that. And this election looks a lot different than any other in my lifetime. It's also the most important of our lifetimes, which is why I'm asking you to dig deep today. Will you pitch in whatever you can to keep Mark in the Senate and elect Democrats all the way down the ticket?
We’re coming down to the home stretch in this election. With less than 30 days until Election Day on November 3rd, and millions of votes already cast in states across the country, now is the time to keep pushing. And I’ll tell you what: We cannot take a single vote for granted. I remember the election in 2014, as I’m sure many of you do — polls told us Mark had a comfortable lead, and he ended up narrowly winning by less than 17,000 votes.
I don’t want to lose my friend Mark in the Senate. If you have the means to make a contribution to support Mark and Democrats across Virginia, I’d really appreciate it.

What I’ve always admired about my friend Mark is his willingness to roll up his sleeves and work until the job is done. Whether it’s working for years to pass sweeping legislation to protect our national parks and fully fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund, fighting to lower the cost of prescription drugs, or looking for innovative ways to create job opportunities in Virginia, his track record shows that he gets things done.
Early voting is well underway in Virginia, and I’ve already cast my vote for Mark. I’m ready to send him back to the Senate and keep this Commonwealth blue. I hope you’ll consider doing the same so we can continue to work together toward a brighter future for Virginia.
Thank you, friend.

Gerry Connolly for Congress
Recently, I’ve been thinking a lot about how our community can honor Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
That’s why I’m calling on George Mason University’s Scalia Law School to be renamed the Scalia-Ginsburg Law School. Will you join me by adding your name to this petition now?
SIGN ON
I believe Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg deserves the same kind of respect and long-lasting legacy that the late Justice Scalia received. Justice Ginsburg was a titan of law, a courageous trailblazer, and a dedicated public servant. She’s been a role model to women and men for generations -- and we must do her legacy justice.
By renaming the school, we can not only preserve RBG’s legacy, we can also promote diversity of thought at this public university while continuing to honor Justice Scalia. Will you join me in demanding that we add Ginsburg’s name to the Scalia Law School? Together, our voices can have a greater impact.

Gerry Connolly for Congress
Team,
For two years Gerry and House Democrats have been fighting to get Donald Trump’s tax returns released. Last night the New York Times confirmed why that fight is so important: Trump paid $750 in federal income taxes as President, and has hundreds of millions of dollars in loans he has PERSONALLY guaranteed coming due. We deserve a President who answers to the American people and pays his fair share in taxes, not a tax cheat like Donald Trump loyal only to his unknown creditors.
A House majority is more important now than ever. Donald Trump has made it clear he’s going to try and contest the 2020 results anywhere he can, including in the House. We need to increase our majority to make sure he can’t win there.
So, in just a couple short days, when September ends and our fundraising records for the entire quarter go PUBLIC, those records need to make a statement. Can you chip in now so we can show Republicans the strength of our grassroots fundraising army on our final quarterly report before the November election?
This will be our LAST quarterly fundraising deadline before the big election in November (in VA early voting has already begun) -- so it’s critical that our report looks stronger than ever. That’s right, we’re trying to beat last month (when we set a record for our most ever monthly online grassroots donors!) by raising 1,000 donations and we just need 215 more -- So, will you be one of them?

Team,
2020 has been a devastating year for so many of us -- a deadly and disruptive pandemic threatens all of us, calls for racial justice have never been louder, and in the background lurks the terrifying threat of climate change. But I’m not sitting on my hands -- I’m taking action. That’s why I’m proud to support the THRIVE Agenda -- a set of comprehensive progressive ideals that works to solve all of these obstacles at once and build America back stronger.
This is exactly the type of action our country needs right now. So, can I count on you to show your support for the THRIVE Agenda by signing on as a citizen cosponsor?
SIGN ON
The THRIVE Resolution lays out the Democratic party’s progressive economic vision -- it will create millions of good jobs by investing in our infrastructure and clean energy, build back worker’s rights and union strength, invest in minority communities, combat environmental injustice, and avert a climate catastrophe.
But in order to get this critical agenda passed in Congress, we need to show overwhelming support from Americans from across the country. That’s why I’m counting on you to show your support and keep the pressure on Congress to take action on the THRIVE Agenda by signing on now!

Did you get this email from Gerry? We wanted to make sure you didn’t miss the NRA’s latest ratings of Gerry’s work in Congress. Spoiler -- he got an F!
Let us be clear, Gerry and the rest of the team are thrilled about failing the NRA’s agenda -- because the NRA serves one purpose: increase profits to the gun industry, regardless of the human cost. Let’s show the NRA how excited we are about our failing score -- chip in to prove to the NRA how backwards their agenda is.

Not only are we happy to receive an ""F"" from the NRA, we’re not surprised either. Gerry has been fighting tooth and nail to do the opposite of the NRA’s bidding -- he’s working hard to keep guns out of the wrong hands and ban weapons that have the capacity to end thousands of lives in just seconds. Because this country has seen far, far too many innocent lives taken by a single person with a gun in the span of just minutes.
If we’re going to end the public health crisis that is gun violence in our country, we’ll need common sense gun reform champions, like Gerry Connolly, in Congress. Contribute now to support Gerry’s work fighting back against the NRA and securing gun violence prevention victories in Congress!

Mark Warner for Virginia
Leaked GOP Memo: The Senate Majority is at Risk. From The Guardian.
Friend,
Mitch McConnell is worried. Senate Republicans know their majority is in danger, and they're doing everything they can to hang on to power. That's why they're trying to force through a Supreme Court nominee to replace the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg — breaking their own precedent, set in 2016.
And it's why their leaked memo calls on Republican mega-donors to spend big to defeat Democrats this fall.
It’s clear that Donald Trump sees Virginia as a path to expanding the electoral map and helping the GOP hang on to power. That's why the President is targeting Virginia with a big rally tonight. He's already tweeting that he predicts a ""BIG"" Republican victory from the top of the ticket down to Mark Warner's race.
Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell have a good reason to be worried — we have momentum on our side. On Super Tuesday, a record number of Democrats cast their ballots in Virginia. But we can’t take anything for granted. We need to keep that momentum going all the way to Election Day to secure victory for Joe Biden, Mark Warner, and Democrats all the way down the ticket.

Despite the pandemic, Mark Warner is working around the clock to reach voters from every corner of the Commonwealth, but he needs our help to win this November and ensure we have a Democratic majority in the Senate next year.

Friends —
As Mark Warner continues to work hard to make life better for every Virginian, our team is committed to sending these weekly updates to keep folks around Virginia up to date with what Mark is focused on.
Here’s what Mark is working on right now:
* Mark visited community leaders in Pulaski during his community check-up tour, and talked with them about local redevelopment. Mark is working hard to make sure that communities in every corner of Virginia have the resources they need to make it through this difficult time.
* The Brady Campaign endorsed Mark for re-election. They praised him for being a champion for gun violence prevention in the Senate, and Mark is committed to creating actionable solutions to keep our country safer.
* Mark called Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe’s decision to suspend in-person intelligence briefings “outrageous”. Withholding these oversight briefings hampers Congress’ ability to monitor foreign interference in our elections, and the American public has a right to know. Mark Warner will continue working to protect our elections and keep them free of foreign interference.
* Heading toward Election Day on November 3rd, we are facing a poll worker shortage. To combat this, Mark is calling on states to allow lawyers to volunteer as poll workers on Election Day in exchange for Continuing Legal Education (CLE) credits.
* In Winchester, Mark called for another round of urgently needed coronavirus relief for the Northern Shenandoah Valley. The pandemic has taken a toll on their economy, and Mark wants more assistance for the unemployed and small businesses.
* It’s already September, which means that early voting in Virginia starts in just a few weeks. If you haven’t already registered to vote, now is the perfect time to do so: [[URL REDACTED]]

Mark Warner for Virginia
Friend —
Thanks for tuning into the first Virginia Senate debate with us tonight. After watching Mark Warner and his opponent lay out their policies, one thing is very clear: We need a strong leader in the Senate for Virginians, and that person is Mark Warner.
Tonight, Mark underscored his proven track record of delivering tangible results for every Virginian. Throughout the coronavirus pandemic, Mark has been a national leader, bringing together a bipartisan group of legislators to provide the economic relief that Americans needed, ensure public schools will remain funded, and protect our democracy from foreign and domestic threats.
Make no mistake: The future of the Supreme Court and the Affordable Care Act are on the ballot in this election. With questions about what kind of country we want to be hanging in the balance, Mark’s GOP opponent failed to make a clear case for his candidacy, and articulated views that are out of step with Virginians.
There was a clear contrast between Mark’s opponent, who promises to be a rubber stamp for the Trump agenda, and Mark’s commitment to Virginia values and track record of independent leadership.
We’ve made a lot of progress in Virginia — this election is about making sure we protect that progress and build a stronger Commonwealth and country. As we continue to press on with less than 45 days until the election on November 3rd, we need your help to keep Mark’s seat in the Senate.
Can we count on a contribution from you to flip the Senate blue, and put our country back on track?
We’re so close to the finish line, and we need folks like you to help us keep up the momentum until Election Day.
Thanks for your support!

Dear friend —
Election Day is two weeks away. Do you have a plan to vote?
We’ve got more options than ever to cast our ballots this year in Virginia. And whether you’re planning to vote by mail, vote early in-person, or vote in-person on Election Day, it’s important that you do get out and vote.
Studies show that folks are much more likely to actually get out and vote if they have a plan. So if you haven’t thought about how you’re going to cast your ballot yet (we get it, you’re busy!), head over to [[URL REDACTED]] to get started.
One thing to note: if you’re planning to vote by mail with a no-excuse absentee ballot, the deadline to request your ballot is this Friday, October 23rd at 5:00 PM ET. If you’re planning to vote early in person, you’ve got more time — early voting in person goes until October 31st this year.
No matter how you’re planning to vote, or who you’re planning to vote for, the most important thing is that you do cast your ballot. Your vote is your voice. It’s your chance to speak out for the change you want to see in the Commonwealth and in the country.

Mark Warner for Virginia
Friend —
You’ve been hearing from our team a lot about our voter mobilization efforts, and I’m writing today to let you know just how important it is that we turn out as many voters as possible in this election.
High turnout and strong support for Mark Warner’s race doesn’t just help this campaign — we expect it’ll help elect Joe Biden and boost down-ballot Virginia Democrats who are running in close races. And with so much at stake in this election, we’re not willing to leave anything to chance.
Your donation to our GOTV efforts will help re-elect Mark Warner, and flip more districts in the Commonwealth. Can we count on you?
Let me break it down: When Senator Tim Kaine won re-election in 2018, he won seven out of VA’s 11 congressional districts. Democratic congressional candidates also won in those seven districts, but they fell short in the districts that Senator Kaine lost.
I expect this same pattern to repeat itself in the 2020 election. If Mark wins his race by a large enough margin, he can help boost down-ballot candidates in their own races, which is especially important in toss-up districts like VA-05, where Dr. Cameron Webb faces an extreme GOP opponent.
Our goal is simple: we’re doing everything in our power to help Mark win his race, so down-ballot Democrats will also win their competitive races.
Will you help us in this final stretch and make sure we send Mark Warner back to the Senate?
Thank you for all of your support!

Friend —
Thank you for watching the second Virginia Senate debate with us tonight. Mark Warner continues to show that he will keep delivering on his promise to make life better for all Virginians.
Mark’s opponent by contrast has shown us that, to him, leadership means rolling back the progress we’ve made in Virginia.
* First, Mark’s opponent praised Trump’s “leadership” during the coronavirus pandemic.
* Then, he said he’d back Trump’s Supreme Court nominee — before he even found out who that person was.
* Finally, last weekend, Trump endorsed Mark’s opponent at his Newport News rally.
We have a lot of work to do in order to provide justice for all Americans in this country. Virginia needs leaders like Mark Warner, who are willing to roll up their sleeves and develop policy that will create real change, not hateful division. With your help, we can keep Mark in the Senate, creating more opportunities for everyone.

Cory Booker,info@markwarnerva.com,One way to give our kids better health care,"Mark Warner for Virginia
Folks —
I’m writing to you today to let you know about a bill that I’m working on with my friend Mark Warner.
Health care — including access to affordable prescription drugs — is a fundamental right. Mark and I are on the same page about that. Unfortunately, children from low-income families who are participating in the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) aren’t getting the lowest possible prices for medicines they depend on. That’s just plain wrong.
So Mark and I introduced the Fair Drug Prices for Kids Act, which would bring those prices down. There’s no reason that we should pay more for the medicines our kids depend on, and this bill fixes that while improving care for the more than four million children nationally enrolled in a standalone CHIP program.
I might have given Mark a hard time about his terrible cooking skills, but I’d never give him a hard time about his dedication to the people of Virginia. Mark cares about making things better for every Virginian, from lowering the price of prescription drugs to making sure the economy works for everyone.
Mark knows that no matter how long you’ve held your seat, you have to hold yourself accountable to your constituents and constantly prove yourself worthy of people’s support. That’s why he’s campaigning his heart out, even in these unprecedented times. We’re both on the ballot this November, and both of our campaigns are scaling up to make sure that we reach every possible voter.
If you’re in a position to do so, please consider making a donation to support Mark’s and my re-election campaigns.

Friends —
We hope this email finds you and your loved ones safe and healthy. Our team is committed to sending these weekly updates to keep folks around Virginia up to date with what Mark Warner is focused on in the Senate.
Here’s what Mark is working on right now:
* This week, Mark introduced the bipartisan GET CARES Act with Sen. Tim Scott. This bill encourages Americans to safely resume preventative care and treatment. Since the coronavirus pandemic started, routine health care and cancer screenings have fallen by 68 percent nationally. Regular checkups can help with early detection of preventable diseases.
* Last week, on a call with military families, Mark discussed the fact that almost one-fifth of active military families in Virginia are food insecure. Mark is committed to removing barriers to accessing healthy and affordable food for our military families, including widening eligibility for military families to receive Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits.
* The cost of 4.1 million children’s prescriptions would be reduced under Mark and Sen. Cory Booker’s new bill, the Fair Drug Prices for Kids Act. This legislation will lower prescription drug costs for states, making them more affordable for the children who need them.
* Mark raised concerns about delayed mail delivery in Virginia. In a letter to Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, Warner urged DeJoy to “rescind any policy changes that are contributing to delays in mail delivery.” The U.S. Postal Service (USPS) is a critical service for millions of Americans who rely on the mail for prescriptions, bills, and letters from loved ones. Mark will continue to work to make sure USPS has the funding needed to continue its service.
* Mark worked with his colleagues across the aisle to urge Senate leaders for long-term relief for the millions of Americans who struggle with student loan debt. Under the CARES Act, more than 8 million people were ineligible to receive the six months of interest-free relief on their student loans.
Thank you for your continued support.

Gerry Connolly for Congress
Hey Team,
It’s been a busy month to say the least -- from being called back to vote on emergency USPS legislation, to fighting for COVID relief for Virginia families, to leading questioning of Trump’s crony USPS Postmaster General.
But this work is crucial -- especially as we work to block Trump’s attempts to manipulate the upcoming election. I will continue doing everything in my power to ensure that our elections are fair, to protect every American’s right to vote, and to prevent Trump from winning a second term using illegal voter suppression tactics.
But now, in order to keep fighting, I’ll need your support. We have a major fundraising deadline tonight -- and we still need 39 more grassroots donors to step up. Can I count on you to chip in so I can keep fighting to save our democracy?

Team,
Tonight is the first presidential debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. I’m looking forward to seeing President Trump held accountable for everything from tax fraud, to his botched COVID recovery plan, to the decimation of core governmental institutions like the USPS and EPA, and his exacerbation of America’s deepest and most painful divides.
But it’s not just on Biden’s shoulders to defeat Trump, it’s on ALL OF US -- that means you, and the rest of Team Connolly! Before the debate begins, here are two key actions you can take to support not only Joe Biden but every single Democrat on the ballot here in Virginia:

Mark Warner,info@markwarnerva.com,Now *this* is scary,"Mark Warner for Virginia
Folks, there are just three days left until the most important election of our lifetimes.
Most people don’t know this, but Halloween is my favorite holiday. I love getting dressed up and passing out candy to the kids trick-or-treating on our street. This year, instead of thinking of Halloween festivities, I’m thinking about early voting ending today and the final push ahead of the election on November 3rd. I’m also thinking about something really scary: the possibility of another four years with the Trump administration in power.
We’ve come a long way during this campaign. As the Commonwealth grappled with the coronavirus pandemic, we built a campaign unlike any that I’ve ever been a part of so that we could safely connect with voters across Virginia. The resiliency Virginians have shown during this crisis is nothing short of inspiring. I can’t thank you enough for showing up for me and for this campaign even as our Commonwealth and country faced serious challenges.
We’ve seen some really challenging times over the last year: a global pandemic that has killed more than 200,000 Americans, record unemployment amidst a sharp economic downturn, and a president running the country with incompetence and cruelty, instead of leading with compassion and courage. We have a chance to make real change in this election on November 3rd, and it starts with electing (and re-electing) Democrats up and down the ticket to keep Virginia blue.
I’ve fought to make health care more affordable, protect people with pre-existing conditions, and create an economy that works for all Virginians, and let me tell you: there’s nothing scarier than the thought of not being able to do that for another six years in the Senate. I promise to keep fighting as hard as I can — I’m ready to roll up my sleeves and put in the work to make life better for everyone in the Commonwealth.
If you can, please consider pitching in to get us across the finish line. Here’s the donation link: [[URL REDACTED]]
Thank you for your support during these difficult times. You’ve been with me since the beginning; now let’s cross the finish line.

If you're like me, you were appalled watching Donald Trump in the debate last night and embarrassed for our country. Refusing to condemn white supremacy, discrediting election results and calling for voter intimidation, and mocking Joe Biden's family -- unfortunately, the list goes on and on. Trump showed just how desperate he is. Well, I can't take another 4 weeks of this, let alone 4 years. We have to win this election and win up and down the ballot around the country.
HELP US KICK TRUMP OUT!
Democratic majorities in the House and Senate and Joe Biden in the White House will mean more COVID relief, saving the USPS, real action to stop climate change, and commonsense gun reform. But we can't win those majorities without your help. Our campaign has a major fundraising deadline TONIGHT. And if we fall short of our goal of raising 1000 grassroots donations, it could mean halting critical campaign operations necessary to turn out Democratic voters and win big across Virginia.

* While Congressional Republicans try to tear apart the social safety net to line the pockets of the super-rich, Gerry’s standing shoulder-to-shoulder with our middle-class families.
* While the far-right denies climate science and auctions off our public lands, Gerry’s the Co-Chairman of the largest caucus in the House dedicated to protecting the environment.
* And whenever Trump attacks our fellow Americans because of what they look like, who they love, or how they pray, Gerry has always stood strong.

* Mark participated in his final debate against his GOP opponent in Richmond on Tuesday. Mark once again delivered a winning performance, sharing his plans to strengthen Virginia’s economy and combat the coronavirus.
* Mark released his latest campaign ad, “Virginia is Everything.” Since his time as governor, Mark has been committed to making sure that every Virginian has a fair shot at success, and will continue to focus on creating solutions for the challenges our country faces.
* With fewer than 20 days until the election on November 3rd, Mark spoke out against the President’s refusal to commit to accept the results of the election and ensure a peaceful transfer of power.
* Mark received endorsements from five public sector labor groups, highlighting his commitment to Virginia workers and his long record of supporting our career public servants.
* Mark spoke with WFIR News Talk Radio about expanding broadband access for Americans, an issue that has been exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic. Mark will continue to work to ensure that every Virginian — and American — has access to reliable, affordable broadband.
* With outdoor seating becoming limited due to the colder weather and vibrant restaurant scenes in danger, Mark continued pushing for federal assistance to help restaurants stay afloat and keep their workers on the payroll during the pandemic.
* Mark and Rep. Abigail Spanberger greeted early voters in Henrico last weekend, and encouraged those who can to vote early. More than one million Virginians have cast their vote in this critical election, and if you can, make a plan to vote early from now through the last day on October 31st.
* Early voting is underway in Virginia — more than a million Virginians have already cast their ballots! There’s still time to cast your ballot early; early voting goes until October 31st. If you’d like to cast your ballot by mail with a no-excuse absentee ballot, the deadline to request that ballot is October 23rd. Visit [[URL REDACTED]] to learn more about your options to cast your ballot this year.
Thank you for your continued support.

Hey Team,
Can you believe it’s already almost the end of August? That means we have a big fundraising deadline coming up in a few days, and only two more months before the big November election. Last month we just barely hit our goal and we cannot afford to be complacent this month, so we’ve set an even more ambitious goal of activating 750 grassroots online donors. And, right now, we just need 164 more donors -- will you be one of them?

Last week, Gerry led the questioning of USPS Postmaster General DeJoy -- who has been decimating the USPS by killing overtime, trashing mail sorting machines, and making other changes to the institution designed to reduce its efficiency.
Gerry has taken a leadership role in saving the USPS because he knows how important it is to the lives of millions of American and the security of our elections. And we’re so grateful to have a fighter and champion in Gerry -- someone who will fight as hard as he can for what he knows is right. That’s why it’s so important we reach our fundraising goal this month and power this campaign into November. Chip in to make sure we can re-elect Gerry so he can continue standing up for Americans everywhere!

“No one is above the law,
not even the President, and especially not the President.”
— Senator Mark Warner
Keep Mark in the Senate working for us
Friends:
Donald Trump has raked in more than $17 million through his hotels since he was elected — from his own presidential campaign and the Republican National Committee. This latest use of the presidential office for personal gain is just further proof that Trump believes he’s accountable to no one — especially not to the American people.
A big reason for that is congressional Republicans have stood by silently for four years, refusing to hold President Trump accountable. That’s why it’s so imperative that we take back the White House and the Senate this November. That can’t happen unless we re-elect Mark Warner and keep Virginia blue.
Chip in now to re-elect Mark
Not even a pandemic surging across the country is enough to stop the President from using his position to enrich himself. Second-quarter filing data shows that Trump’s joint fundraising committee with the RNC, “Trump Victory,” forked over another $400,000 to Trump hotels in March to treat RNC donors to a private Mar-a-Lago retreat.
Friends, there may be nothing we can do to make Republicans honor their constitutional obligation to hold the President accountable. What we can do is make sure this is Mitch McConnell and Senate Republicans’ last year in the majority. As Mark faces his toughest re-election yet, we need your help to hold this Democratic Senate seat and flip the Senate. If you’re able, will you chip in now to keep Mark in Washington fighting for us?

Mark Warner,info@markwarnerva.com,moving forward,"Mark Warner for Virginia
Friend,
Today is one of those days when I had to stop and ask, how did we get here? We are just days away from emergency unemployment benefits expiring for millions of Americans who have lost their jobs due to COVID-19. How did we end up in the middle of a pandemic, with the Senate seemingly incapable of helping our fellow Americans who are struggling to deal with the economic consequences of the virus?
It's been 123 days since the Senate passed the last coronavirus relief bill, the CARES Act, and it doesn't appear we're any closer to the next steps in the coronavirus response. I wish I could provide inside knowledge or some hope that things will come together at the last minute. Unfortunately, it appears my Republican colleagues have wasted those 123 days — unable to find agreement among themselves, let alone with the President, or with the Democrats whose votes they'll need to pass any bill.
Let me be clear about something: this is not just the usual Washington dysfunction. I've never had a problem owning up when I thought my party was in the wrong. But my Democratic colleagues and I have been working these past 123 days, putting forward policy proposals, like my Paycheck Security Act, which would guarantee paychecks for laid-off workers — or my Neighborhood Jobs Act, which would make sure communities of color don't get left behind in the eventual economic recovery. Unfortunately, every single good idea we've had runs into a brick wall when it gets to the Republican Senate, which is predisposed to obstruction and paralyzed by a lack of leadership from the President.
The reason I'm telling you all this is because I want to convey to you that it is as bad as it seems. Or, to put it another way, we aren't exaggerating just how high the stakes are this November as we try to flip the Senate and send this President packing. You may have seen some polls recently that give us some reason for hope. Hope is good, but it's not an excuse to become complacent. We were all burned by overly optimistic poll-reading in 2016. I'm also thinking back to my 2014 Senate race, when all the polls said I was fine, but the race came down to a razor-thin margin on election night.
With the stakes so high this November, I want you to think about what you're willing to do to elect Democrats up and down the ballot. I've had six years since my last re-election and three and a half years since Donald Trump's election to think about this. My campaign is taking nothing for granted. We are working hard to reach every voter, in every part of the Commonwealth, and to build a turnout operation that will keep Virginia blue.
In order to flip the Senate and send Joe Biden to the White House we've got to put in the work, and I'm asking you for your help to make sure it happens. We have under 100 days to go until Election Day, and any drop-off in fundraising will jeopardize our campaign plan to educate and mobilize voters.
So I am personally asking you today for your help in hitting our end-of-month fundraising goal. If you've been thinking about whether or not to make that first contribution, now is the time. Please, friend, will you make your first contribution to help us hit this can't-miss fundraising goal?
Joe Biden has rightly said that this election is a battle for the soul of our nation. And I think I've conveyed in this note that it is also a battle for the health of our people and our economy. We cannot forget what we are fighting for: an end to the nightmare caused by this virus, and an economy that comes back stronger and more equitable. That's what I'm fighting for in the Senate and on the campaign trail. Please give whatever you can to make sure we can keep up that fight and win this November.
Sincerely,
Mark Warner

By now, you know that Mark Warner is up for re-election in Virginia. He’s focused on connecting with voters, even during the pandemic, through virtual town halls and socially distant events. And he’s working hard to make sure that every Virginian has the resources they need to make it through the coronavirus pandemic.
Mark has also spent his time in the Senate working to lower the cost of prescription drugs and make health care more affordable, expand rural broadband access, make sure our veterans and military families have the resources they need, and build an economy that works for everyone.
Mark has proven he’s ready to roll up his sleeves and work hard to make the future brighter for every Virginian. Now, we need your help to make sure that he wins re-election and can protect the progress we’ve made in Virginia.
Will you give Mark Warner your personal endorsement in his campaign for the U.S. Senate?
Nothing in this race is guaranteed — Mark won his race in 2014 by less than 1%, and he’s not taking anything for granted. That’s why we’re collecting personal endorsements to show support for Mark in every part of the Commonwealth.
Thank you for supporting Mark!

Exciting news: Joe Biden has just announced his pick for vice president. With Kamala Harris joining the ticket, the ballot is set.
Now, it’s time to kick the campaign into high gear, and make sure we get folks out to vote for Democrats from Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, to Mark Warner, and all the way down the ticket.
We had record turnout on Super Tuesday in Virginia, and we’ve got to keep the momentum up all the way to Election Day if we’re going to send all of our great Democratic candidates to Washington. The path to a blue Senate runs right through Virginia — but to make the flip, it’s absolutely critical that we re-elect Mark. Help us keep the momentum going — pitch in to support Mark Warner.
As we look forward to Election Day, there’s a clear path toward making a real change. We have the power to send Joe Biden to the White House, re-elect Mark, and elect Democrats down the ballot. But we’re going to need your help.
If you have the means, will you chip in to make sure we keep Virginia blue in 2020?
Thank you for your support — we have 84 days until Election Day, and we’re going to make each one of them count.

Mark Warner is working hard in the Senate to make life better for every Virginian. Our team will continue to send these weekly updates to keep folks around Virginia up to date with Mark’s priorities.
Here’s what Mark is working on right now:
* In his latest campaign ad “It Has To End,” Mark addresses the tragedy of veteran suicide. Seventeen veterans commit suicide a day — and more than 60 percent of those veterans have never interacted with the Veterans’ Administration. Mark is leading a bi-partisan effort to make sure that our veterans have access to the health resources (including mental health resources) that they need.
* Mark continues to press for accountability and transparency standards on social media platforms in the final weeks before the election on November 3rd. In a letter to CEOs of social media companies, he calls out failure to reign in organic spread of misinformation online.
* A Senate version of Rep. Gerry Connolly's Chai Suthammanont Remembrance Act was introduced by Mark. The bill would require every federal agency to develop a detailed plan to protect their employees if they are required to return to work during the coronavirus pandemic. Mark will continue to work to protect essential workers during the pandemic.
* Mark is working to make sure that restaurants have the funding they need to continue running. As the weather gets colder, restaurants are worried about the longevity of their business, with vital public health restrictions still in effect.
* Mark met with the presidents of the University of Mary Washington and Germanna Community College to discuss the challenges these institutions are facing during the COVID-19 pandemic. Colleges and universities have struggled with a lack of clear guidance on how to reopen safely, and Mark is focused on making sure that schools have the resources they need to provide for students during this time and beyond.
* In a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Mark urged the U.S. Department of State to secure H-2B visas for seasonal seafood workers. Seafood is a half-billion-dollar economy in Virginia, and Mark will work to ensure that small, seasonal Virginia seafood companies won’t have to face financial hardship due to difficulty securing these visas.
* Facebook announced their ban on accounts, pages, and groups associated with the right-wing conspiracy theory group QAnon in order to prevent the spread of misinformation on their platform. Mark has been consistent in pressuring Facebook to follow through with their preventative measures and weighed in on the decision.
* Voter registration ends in Virginia on October 13. Now is the time to check your registration at [[URL REDACTED]] while there’s still time. It takes less than five minutes and once you are registered, you can participate in early voting ahead of Election Day on November 3rd.
Thank you for your continued support.

Team,
If you're like me, you were appalled watching Donald Trump in the debate last night and embarrassed for our country. Refusing to condemn white supremacy, discrediting election results and calling for voter intimidation, and mocking Joe Biden's family -- unfortunately, the list goes on and on. Trump showed just how desperate he is. Well, I can't take another 4 weeks of this, let alone 4 years. We have to win this election and win up and down the ballot around the country.
HELP US KICK TRUMP OUT!
Democratic majorities in the House and Senate and Joe Biden in the White House will mean more COVID relief, saving the USPS, real action to stop climate change, and commonsense gun reform. But we can't win those majorities without your help. Our campaign has a major fundraising deadline TONIGHT. And if we fall short of our goal of raising 1000 grassroots donations, it could mean halting critical campaign operations necessary to turn out Democratic voters and win big across Virginia.
We still need to bring in 116 more grassroots donations before midnight tonight. Can we count on you to pitch in one of those donations NOW?

Friends —
As you might know, early voting started today in Virginia. This morning, I went to the voter registration office in Alexandria and cast my ballot.
Mark showing off his I Voted sticker
I decided that I wanted to cast my vote early in person, but the great thing about voting this year in Virginia is that we have options.
Thanks to our General Assembly, this year Virginia voters can:
* Cast their ballot early in person
* Use a no-excuse absentee ballot to vote by mail
* Or vote in-person on Election Day on November 3rd
The first step is making sure that you’re registered to vote. You can check your voter registration status and review your options to cast your ballot at [[URL REDACTED]]
No matter how you’re planning to vote this year — whether you’re voting early in person, like I did, or whether you’re voting by mail or in person on Election Day — it’s so important that you vote.
This election is about who we are — and who we want to be — as a country. I hope you’ll make your voice heard in this election.
Thank you,
Mark Warner

I am so inspired by the folks in Virginia. We’re facing an incredibly challenging time — a global pandemic, a reckoning with racism in our country, and a rapidly changing economy. But, as I’ve checked in with folks across the Commonwealth, I’ve seen resilience and dedication to protecting the progress we’ve made.
This campaign has felt different from any other; we’re not able to connect in the same ways. One of my favorite parts of campaigning is getting to hear directly from voters, and I have to admit that I’ve been missing the usual parades and large rallies. Still, whether it’s been on Zoom or during socially distanced events, the dedication to keeping Virginia blue is palpable. And I am so grateful for your support — for me, and for Democrats up and down the ticket.
We had record turnout in Virginia on Super Tuesday, and I know that we can match it based on the enthusiasm I’ve seen from folks in every corner of the Commonwealth. In Virginia, we say this every year, but it’s really true this time: This election is one of the most important in our lifetimes. It’s about what kind of country we are — and what kind of country we want to be. No matter how you’re planning to vote this year: by mail with a no-excuse absentee ballot, early in-person, or in-person on Election Day, it’s so critical that you do cast your ballot. And once you’ve made your plan to vote, check in with your friends to make sure they know how to make their voices heard too.

I feel it every day, but I don’t say it enough: I love this team. Thank you for being a part of it. I am so grateful for your support and so thankful you’re on this journey with me. If you believe in keeping Virginia blue and have been thinking about supporting the campaign, now is the time. We’ve got fewer than 40 days until Election Day, and we’re counting on your support in the home stretch.

Mark Warner continues to work hard to make life better for every Virginian. Our team is committed to sending these weekly updates to keep folks around Virginia up to date with what Mark is focused on in the Senate.
Here’s what Mark is working on right now:
* Last night, Mark participated in his second debate against his GOP opponent at Norfolk State University. In this debate, Mark discussed how he will keep delivering on his promise to provide racial equity, coronavirus aid, and a stronger economy for all Virginians.
> — The next debate will be in Richmond on October 13th.
* Mark released a new ad this week, highlighting the importance of broadband access. Coronavirus did not create the digital divide in Virginia, but it highlighted how much more needs to be done to make sure everyone has access to affordable, accessible broadband. Mark has been working on this issue since his time as governor, when he oversaw the biggest investment of fiber optic cable to date at that time. In the Senate, he continues to advocate for investments in expanding broadband access across the Commonwealth and across the country.
* As the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress continue to attack the Affordable Care Act, Mark continues to work to ensure that Virginians with pre-existing conditions can keep their coverage. No one should have to worry about their health insurance coverage — especially in the middle of a global pandemic.
* Mark is calling on the Senate to wait until a new president is elected to confirm a new Supreme Court Justice to replace Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Voting is already underway in Virginia and in states across the country, and Mark believes the winner of the presidential election should decide who fills the vacancy.
* This weekend, Mark traveled to Gloucester and Norfolk for socially distanced meet and greet events with Gloucester and Mathews Democrats and Jody Wagner to discuss issues that matter the most to members of the community.
* Mark is pressing the U.S. Department of Justice to inspect two Virginia correctional facilities due to unsafe conditions caused by the coronavirus pandemic, and will continue to track the health and safety of staff and incarcerated individuals.
* Voter registration ends in Virginia on October 13. Now is the time to check your registration at [[URL REDACTED]] while there’s still time. It takes less than five minutes and once you are registered, you can participate in early voting ahead of Election Day on November 3rd.
Thank you for your continued support.

As Mark Warner continues to work hard to make life better for every Virginian, our team is committed to sending these weekly updates to keep folks around Virginia up to date with what Mark is focused on now that the Senate is back in session this week.
Here’s what Mark is working on right now:
* Mark voted early in Alexandria on Friday, September 18. No matter how you’re planning to vote this year, the first step is making sure you’re registered. Head over to [[URL REDACTED]] to check your registration status and find out how you can cast your ballot.
* In a letter addressed to the CEOs of telecom companies such as AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon, Mark requested a temporary suspension of overage fees and data caps. As students participate in virtual schooling due to the pandemic, limited bandwidth severely hinders their learning during an already stressful time.
* Mark is sounding the alarm about Russian misinformation being spread on social media. As Election Day draws nearer, he warns that Congress isn’t doing enough to pass election security legislation in order to combat misinformation. Mark is doing all that he can to keep our elections fair and free of foreign interference.
* This week, Mark’s campaign launched a full Spanish campaign website and released a new Spanish language radio ad, “Conozco.” Take a look!
* The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is proposing cutbacks to the Lifeline Program for low-income consumers, which gives millions of Americans discounts on broadband access. In a time when an unprecedented number of Americans are relying on internet access for virtual learning, telehealth, and to work remotely, Mark is demanding that the FCC continue to provide affordable broadband in low-income communities during the pandemic. He will push for more broadband legislation in the next COVID-19 relief package.
* The U.S. House of Representatives passed The IoT Cybersecurity Improvement Act, legislation that sets minimum security standards for devices connected to federal networks. This marks a major step forward in Mark’s work to close the “glaring gap in cybersecurity infrastructure” over the past three years.
> — Up next, the bill goes to the Senate, where Mark hopes it will be voted for approval.
* Mark continues to demand that Postmaster General Louis DeJoy reverse the changes made to the United States Postal Service in order for Americans to maintain consistent access to medication during the pandemic. The results of his decisions have resulted in delays of life-saving prescriptions.
Thank you for your continued support.

Mark Warner,info@markwarnerva.com,about Roger Stone,"Mark Warner for Virginia
Friends —
Last night, Donald Trump commuted the federal prison sentence of his longtime friend and advisor, Roger Stone, saying he was the victim of a ""witch hunt.""
This is about Trump protecting Trump. Here are the facts: Roger Stone worked with hostile foreign agents to damage one presidential candidate and help the other. The candidate being helped was Trump, and Trump accepted the help. When Roger Stone got caught, he lied. And when Roger Stone was punished, Trump let him off the hook.
Enough is enough. We need to take back leadership from the Republicans.
No one is above the law, and this is corruption plain and simple. We need to get this President out of the White House and flip the Senate on November 3rd. To do that, we need to flip at least three Senate seats and hang on to the seats we have. That's why my race is so important.
The path to a blue Senate runs right through Virginia. Right now, we need your help to make it happen.
If you have the means, will you support my re-election campaign?
Thank you for your support. Together, we can turn the tide.

Feel free to skip ahead and donate now \-- but I’m going to take a minute to stop and explain why we really need your support right now:
We know that right now, politics is the last thing on your mind. Coronavirus has upended all of our lives, our businesses, and even our political process. Out of concern for the safety and health of our staff, volunteers, and supporters, our campaign has suspended all in-person campaign events, canvassing, rallies, and fundraisers.
That’s right -- our campaign is now operating exclusively online. That means email and social media are some of the only ways we can stay in touch with you and raise money to fuel our campaign. We're responsible for ensuring Virginia is solidly blue on November 3rd, and we have to put together an aggressive campaign to keep leaders like Gerry in Washington fighting for you.
We understand that some people cannot afford to contribute during these times. But right now, online fundraising is the only way we can support critical campaign efforts. So if you’re able, please chip in $11 or another amount to our Digital Fund now!

Gerry has been on the frontline of the fight to protect the economic security and health of our families in the federal government's coronavirus response. He stood up to the administration’s indifference and inaction on this crisis, and their plan to create a slush fund for Trump to dole out to his wealthy friends.
This crisis has shown us exactly why we must hold the House, take back the Senate, and stop Trump’s divisive and anti-democratic agenda -- and folks, we ALL have to do our part.
The money we raise right now will dictate the choices we can make over the next several months. And honestly, what we have now won’t allow Gerry to make the impact we need. That’s why I’m reaching out to you today.
So, if you are able, help us keep Gerry in office and elect Democrats at every level by contributing to our Digital Fund today! With your help, we can keep our campaign operations going strong during these uncertain times -- helping elect more Democrats from across the nation and building towards big wins up and down the ballot in November!

Donald Trump is holding a campaign rally in Newport News tomorrow night.
With early voting already underway in Virginia, Trump is clearly targeting Virginia and predicting a Republican victory in November. Make no mistake: Trump thinks he can turn the Commonwealth red. His well-funded Trump Victory initiative continues to hold grassroots organizing events across the Commonwealth, in an effort to flip Virginia red and erase the progress we've made.

As the coronavirus (COVID-19) remains a concern in Virginia, we want to update you on the work Mark Warner is doing in the Senate to deal with the outbreak and share some health precautions we all should take to protect our communities.
Mark is working hard to make sure that Virginians and folks across the country are kept safe. As he works to pass laws to protect us in the Senate, we’ve got to do our part in our own communities. That means following the Centers for Disease Control’s coronavirus guidelines, including washing your hands often and avoiding sharing personal items and beverages. It’s hard to be apart from those we love, but the steps that we take to practice social distancing now could be critical in slowing and ending the spread of COVID-19.
Help us spread the word — not the virus. Here are two actions you can take right now to make sure that your friends and family are well-informed and that you’re up to date on the latest coronavirus news:
* Follow sources of reliable information. We recommend following the CDC and Virginia Department of Health for up-to-date health information. We will also be posting the latest news about cases in Virginia and resources for Virginians through the Team Warner Twitter and Facebook accounts.
* Forward this email to 3 people. We’re committed to keeping this list informed about the latest coronavirus news in the Commonwealth and will be sending updates at least once a week.
We will get through this together if everyone does their part to slow and stop the spread of the virus. We will continue to provide regular updates to this list.

Because we were actually able to hear the candidates speak this time, we could finally watch Joe hold Trump accountable for the hundreds of thousands of Americans lost to COVID-19, paying more taxes to China than the United States, and his plan to end coverage for people with pre-existing conditions.

Friend,
There’s a lot on the ballot this year.
Virginians are faced with the choice to protect the progress we’ve made in the Commonwealth and continue to move our country forward, or allow Republicans to drag us backward. The way I see it, we just can’t afford to lose the strides we’ve made over the last few years to make Virginia more equitable for everyone.
Look, the election is just 18 days away on November 3rd. We’ve got a lot of work left to do and we’re in the homestretch. We need all hands on deck to elect folks like Dr. Cameron Webb in VA-05, and protect our great freshman representatives in districts like VA-07 and VA-02.
That’s why I’m turning to you, friend. We have the power to keep Virginia blue and keep our Commonwealth — and our country — moving forward. But we’re counting on folks like you.
Will you split a donation between my campaign and the Democratic Party of Virginia (DPVA)?
We’re in crunch time now, and every dollar makes a difference toward electing Democrats up and down the ballot. I’m not just saying that: your donations help us keep ads on the air, support voter outreach, and pay for digital ads in every corner of the Commonwealth. When you make a donation, you’re investing in the future you want to see for Virginia.
If you believe, as I do, that the best days for the Commonwealth and for our country lay in front of us, please consider chipping in to support me and your Democratic Party here in Virginia. If you can, please consider supporting Virginia Democrats.
Thank you for all of your support! Let’s bring this home.

Mark Warner for Virginia
Friend —
We know you're getting a lot of emails right now, so we'll keep this short.
Here's what you need to know: President Trump just attacked Dr. Fauci.
Trump called Dr. Fauci a ""disaster"" and ""an idiot,"" blaming his own mismanagement of the coronavirus pandemic on Dr. Fauci and claiming that if he had followed Fauci's advice, more Americans would have died. He even went as far as to say that the only reason he hadn't removed Dr. Fauci from the White House Coronavirus task force was because he knew he'd face negative press coverage for doing so.
Then Trump tried to backpedal during the final debate, saying he wasn't ""knocking him"" — but we know the truth.
Mark Warner has made his position clear: he's committed to listening to the science and to consulting public health officials and all of the available data when making decisions about the coronavirus pandemic. No backpedaling necessary — just a consistent, science-based approach. He trusts Dr. Fauci and he will continue to make decisions based on data as we navigate this pandemic.
If you want to keep Mark Warner's steady leadership in the Senate, please consider chipping in to his re-election campaign.
Thank you for your support.

Friends —
Election Day is going to look different this year.
We had record turnout for the presidential primary on Super Tuesday, but since then the world has changed. Folks in the Commonwealth and across the country are rightfully concerned about the coronavirus pandemic and the long lines we've already seen to vote in person in primary elections.
While Mark Warner does his job in the Senate to make sure our elections are free of foreign interference and pushes to make sure that people across the country have access to early voting and vote-by-mail, Team Warner is working hard to get the word out about how to vote safely in November. Will you support our voter registration and turnout efforts?
Our team is running voter registration trainings with folks across the Commonwealth, educating folks on how to check their registration status and request their absentee ballot, and making sure that people know their options as we head toward Election Day. Whether folks choose to vote by mail, vote early in person, or vote on Election Day, we want to make sure every Virginian is empowered to safely cast their ballot.
No one should have to choose between their health and casting their ballot, nor should they have to wait hours to vote.
It seems like we're a ways off, but November is right around the corner. Especially with increased health and safety precautions, it's critical that we start the work to get folks registered and ready to vote. We could really use your support — are you in?
Thank you for your support.

Gerry Connolly for Congress
Hey there,
Did you see Donald’s email? It may seem like we have about two months until the election, but the reality is that because of COVID-19 many voters will be voting absentee and will be receiving their absentee ballots as early as September. Plus, the recent USPS scare means many voters will be returning their ballots ASAP.
That means crunch time is NOW for our campaign as we work to ensure that voters are informed on how to vote this year, as well as educating them on the importance of re-electing Gerry Connolly. So, can we count on you to chip in $20.20 now to make sure we have the resources we need to re-elect Gerry?

Friend,
I’ve been running the numbers and thanks to your support, we’ve already gotten 610 grassroots donors towards our August goal of 750 donors! But we still have a long way to go, and the month will end in just a couple of days -- Can Gerry count on you to chip in $11 and make sure we reach our goal by August 31st?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
DONATE $11 NOW
Now, with the end of August approaching, we’re already less than 100 days from the November elections. But because of the pandemic, unprecedented numbers of voters will begin casting their votes here in Virginia in less than 20 days. That means our time to put out digital ads, send out mailers, and get out the vote has been cut extremely short.
There are only a handful of weeks left until voters need to request their ballots and send them in, and we need to make sure as many of them as possible have the information they need to vote for Gerry Connolly. That’s why we simply can’t afford to fall short of our goal this month. Chip in NOW to make sure we have the resources we need to re-elect Gerry Connolly and ensure Virginia goes blue across the board!

As Mark Warner continues to work hard to make life better for every Virginian, our team is committed to sending these weekly updates to keep folks around Virginia up to date with what Mark is focused on now that the Senate is back in session this week.
Here’s what Mark is working on right now:
* With less than 60 days until Election Day on November 3rd, Mark is pressuring Congress to take legislative action against foreign interference in our elections. He wants to ensure we are protected from targeted attacks on social media, and is working to push legislation including the Foreign Influence Reporting in Elections (FIRE) Act and the Honest Ads Act for more transparency in digital advertising and foreign interference in political campaigns.
* Virginians are hurting because of changes made to the U.S. Postal Service under Postmaster General Louis DeJoy. Mark is demanding that DeJoy reverse changes to operations at USPS that have caused delays to critical medications and other important mail. Mark will continue to pressure DeJoy to reverse these changes and keep the agency running smoothly, especially in the lead-up to the general election.
* During a roundtable discussion at Smithfield Foods, Mark talked with business owners about their financial struggles during the pandemic. Mark is committed to getting these businesses the relief they need to survive the pandemic and emerge stronger.
* Mark joined Rep. Abigail Spanberger and leaders of Chesterfield County Public Schools to discuss the challenges they face as they prepare for reopening schools and virtual learning. Mark will work to support schools and students across the Commonwealth during the coronavirus pandemic.
* Labor Day usually means the beginning of politics in Virginia — but Mark was glad not to miss out on the annual Buena Vista Labor Day tradition as it went virtual this year. Mark sent his warm wishes in a video to celebrate the tradition.
* Earlier this week, Mark and Senator Tim Kaine hosted a Facebook Live town hall to answer questions about coronavirus relief and other issues facing Virginians during the pandemic. If you missed the live broadcast, click here to view, and be on the lookout for more town halls as we get closer to Election Day on November 3rd.
Thank you for your continued support.

Mark Warner,info@markwarnerva.com,We need a real change,"Mark Warner for Virginia
Dear friend —
Folks are saying this a lot these days, but it's true: we're living through an extremely challenging time.
We're facing three crises right now: a global pandemic that has already killed more than 170,000 Americans, systemic racism in our justice system, and record unemployment numbers.
We have a sitting President who has made known he might not accept the election results, and whose administration has set out to undermine the U.S. Postal Service — a service millions of Americans rely on. And that's just in the last few months in a four-year pattern of incompetence and cruelty.
Instead of providing real answers to the American people, Republicans in the Senate seem determined to make matters worse by stalling coronavirus aid and delaying meaningful criminal justice reform. I know my constituents are looking for answers — and frankly I was hoping for more actual leadership from the administration. It's become clear that we're just not going to get it while Republicans control the Senate and the White House.
We need a real change — we need leaders who listen as much as they talk and are ready to bring real solutions to folks across the country.
And we have a chance to make that real change in this election. I believe it's one of the most consequential of our lifetimes — and I'm not just saying that because I'm on the ballot. We have the opportunity to replace Donald Trump with Joe Biden, and elect (and re-elect) Democrats up and down the ticket.
There's a real path to flipping the Senate this year, and I know that my seat plays a big role in that. It just isn't possible to take back control of the Senate if we don't hang onto the seats we've already got.
So if you have the means, please consider making a contribution to help me keep my seat in the Senate and keep working for the people of Virginia.
For everything you've done and everything you will do, I deeply appreciate your effort and support.

Friend —
Service members who make the ultimate sacrifice to keep our country safe aren’t “losers” or “suckers.” They’re heroes.
I was outraged to hear President Trump disrespect Americans who died in combat— but I wasn’t surprised. We’ve known that President Trump’s understanding of patriotism and service is lacking. We’ve heard him disrespect prisoners of war, mock war heroes, and attack Gold Star families. It seems like he doesn’t understand the sacrifice that these brave people and their families have made for our country.
We should all honor that sacrifice. That’s why I spent my time as Governor and as Senator working to make sure that members of our military have the physical and mental health resources they need during and after their service. I’ve fought to make sure that Gold Star families have the benefits they’re entitled to. And I’ve worked with military families to hold private housing corporations accountable for living conditions in military housing. And I’ll continue to work hard to make sure our service members, veterans, and military families are cared for.
The sacrifice that members of our military and their families make for our country is great — and deserves great respect.

Team Warner,info@markwarnerva.com,About AG Barr.,"Attorney General Barr has proven he's unfit for office. It's time for him to resign.
Mark Warner for Virginia
Friends —
It’s happening again.
Attorney General Bill Barr is abusing his power and acting as Donald Trump’s personal lawyer. Instead of fulfilling his sworn duty to work in the best interest of the American public, Barr is directing the Department of Justice to defend the President in a private lawsuit at taxpayer expense.
Enough is enough. Mark Warner has said it before and it’s more important than ever — it’s time for A.G. Barr to resign.
We need to act. Add your name to our petition demanding Barr’s resignation.
We know this isn’t the first time Barr has put his loyalty to President Trump ahead of the American people. Barr directed the Justice Department to drop the criminal case against Donald Trump’s first national security adviser Michael Flynn. Even after Mark Warner pressured the Administration to release intelligence proving that Flynn lied to the F.B.I. and that he was under investigation for a very good reason, Barr continued to protect Donald Trump instead of pursuing justice.
And earlier this summer, Barr ordered peaceful protesters to be forcibly cleared from in front of the White House — all for a photo op for Donald Trump. Time and time again, he has proven he’s more committed to protecting President Trump and his associates than fulfilling his duty to the American people.
Bottom line: Barr is unfit for office. His resignation is past due.
Sign our petition demanding Barr’s resignation.
Thank you for your support.

Meeting our August end-of-month fundraising goal is absolutely critical to making sure that we re-elect Mark Warner — and we’re so close! Can you help us meet our goal and start this last stretch of the campaign off strong?
For the last day of our end-of-month fundraising push, generous supporters are matching every donation, which means your contribution goes twice as far.
countdown clock to midnight
Will you pitch in now to help Mark meet his fundraising goal by midnight?
Election Day is coming up fast — in just 64 days, we have the chance to chart a new path forward with new leadership in the White House and Democratic majorities in the House and Senate. But to make that dream a reality, we’ve got to re-elect the Democratic Senators who are already working hard for us in Washington, folks like Mark Warner.
Mark has been working hard to keep front line workers safe, to help small businesses stay open, and to make sure Virginia’s schools are funded, no matter if their classes are in person or online. But with time running short, he needs your help to win re-election so he can keep fighting for all Virginians.
Can Mark count on your support? Until midnight, your donation has double the impact.

I’m writing to you today to talk to you about my friend, Mark Warner. I know that Mark cares about making things better for every Virginian — it’s a value that we share.
Mark has proven that he knows how to listen to his constituents and then roll up his sleeves to make sure the government works better for us. He’s dedicated to getting this pandemic under control so we can get our economy back up and running, to making sure folks have access to affordable health care and prescription drugs, and to making sure there’s opportunity no matter where you live in the Commonwealth. Mark’s focus is ensuring everyone gets the fair shot they need to succeed.
Mark also knows that being an elected official is about holding yourself accountable to your constituents and constantly proving yourself worthy of people’s support. He’s fighting hard for re-election this year — and I have his back.
We’ve got a real shot to make a change in our leadership in Washington — by taking control of the Senate and turning the 5th district blue for the first time since 2010. But it’s going to take some help from folks like you.
Can we count on you to be part of that change? If you have the means, please consider splitting a donation between Mark’s and my campaigns today.

The future of the Supreme Court is on the ballot in November, friend.
Right now, the Senate is our last line of defense against Donald Trump stacking the Supreme Court with a 6-3 conservative majority. We need strong leaders like Mark Warner who are willing to fight to prevent the President from ramming a nominee through before Election Day — against the express wishes of both Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the American people.
Keep Mark in the Senate. Keep the Supreme Court out of Trump's hands. Pitch in now!
Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump are trying to push their Supreme Court nominee through just weeks before the election, breaking the precedent their own party set in 2016.
And if we do succeed in pushing the vote until after Election Day, we need Mark’s vote in the Senate on the eventual nominee. Mark’s GOP opponent has already promised he’ll be a rubber stamp for whoever Trump chooses — he made that promise without even knowing the nominee.
Virginians deserve more than a rubber stamp, and America deserves more than Trump’s plot to push through a nominee in the last days before the election.
Contribute today if you can. Help Mark Warner remain in the Senate, fighting for us and our democracy.

Gerry Connolly for Congress
Team,
I just got out of a House Oversight hearing where I led the questioning of USPS Postmaster General DeJoy -- DeJoy has spearheaded efforts to destroy the USPS in recent months, guided by President Trump.
Now, let me be clear: This is an emergency. The USPS is a critical institution of our government and Americans everywhere depend on its services. I have been sounding the alarm for months and I will not allow this crown jewel to fall -- especially during a critical election season.
In today’s hearings, the postmaster general admitted that his USPS changes would cause significant delays to mail delivery. And upon my questioning it became clear he lied to Congress, and to the American people, when he previously told the Senate under oath that he had not had contact with the Trump campaign. Today we saw that this postmaster is not only incompetent and corrupt, but he has committed perjury! He simply cannot be trusted to run the USPS.
That’s why we’re taking action. I am proud to say that on Saturday, the House passed an emergency bill that would block DeJoy’s changes to the USPS while also securing funds to support its services during this pandemic. Other industries have received billions. It’s time the USPS was given what it needs and deserves to make it through these tough times.
So, if you haven’t already, I’m asking you to join me in calling on the Senate to pass our bill to save the USPS before our elections and before it’s too late →
ADD YOUR NAME
Thanks so much -- together we’ll save the USPS!

With the coronavirus still threatening communities across the Commonwealth and across the country, we’ve had to find new ways to connect with voters to keep all of Mark’s constituents safe.
This campaign brought us more Zoom calls than we’ve ever thought possible. And Mark has also found ways to meet with folks in their communities to hear more about the issues that matter to them — it’s just meant that more events are happening outside, or at a distance. He’s been all over the Commonwealth to hear from community leaders about the challenges they’re facing and the changes they’d like to see.
Mark toured the Emil and Grace Shihadeh Innovation Center in Winchester and talked with educators about the importance of investing in technology and career training.

Did you see this video Gerry released a few days ago? It outlined everything that’s at stake this election and why it’s so important that each and every one of you VOTE -- and our whole campaign team has been working to register and mobilize Democratic voters.
Today, on National Voter Registration Day, will you chip in $20.20 to make sure we have the resources we need to mobilize voters across Virginia and beyond?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
DONATE $20.20 NOW
With Justice Ginsburg’s devastating passing last week, the potential consequences of this election are only intensifying -- and turning out every possible Democratic voter is essential to avoiding these consequences. By getting out the progressive vote across Virginia, we can help elect a new President, flip the Senate, maintain our Democratic control in the House, and secure the future of the Supreme Court for generations.
But that essential work can only be done if masses of grassroots progressives (that means YOU all!) support campaigns like ours and help us send a blue wave to every district and state in the nation. So make a stand and chip in NOW!

Mark Warner for Virginia
Friends —
You read that right — Mark Warner’s GOP opponent is holding a major, high-dollar fundraiser at the Trump National Golf Course, in the middle of a pandemic.
For those of you keeping score at home, that’s the same golf course that President Trump likes to golf at after he finishes up tweeting for the morning.
This is just more tangible proof that Daniel Gade is setting himself up to align with Trump in every way.
Gade really seems to believe what he’s said repeatedly on the campaign trail — that Trump is doing a “great job” handling coronavirus. Gade equated wearing a mask to “tyranny,” and in his mind that’s not hyperbole — he’s falling in line with Donald Trump’s dangerous pattern of downplaying the serious health risk of coronavirus. All while praising Trump for his handling of the virus and further enriching him with a lavish fundraiser at his golf course.
Virginia needs a leader who takes public health crises seriously and will spend their time leading by example — not going against the advice of public health professionals. We need a leader like Mark Warner, who led the charge to expand unemployment benefits, protect families facing eviction, and provide low-interest loans for small businesses during the pandemic.
So let's show Daniel Gade that Virginians are backing science and reason and supporting Mark Warner — let's raise $5,000 before his fundraiser starts tonight.
Can you join us in supporting Mark Warner and sending a strong message that Mark's the right choice for Virginia?
Thank you for your support.

We hope folks are staying safe and healthy during this challenging time. Team Warner is committed to sending weekly updates to keep folks around the Commonwealth up to date with what Mark Warner is working on in the Senate.
Here's just some of what Sen. Mark Warner has been working on:
* This week, Mark introduced the Accessible, Affordable, Internet for All Act, a bill to expand access to affordable high-speed internet. More than 700,000 Virginians lack access to reliable broadband internet, and Mark has been focused on bridging the digital divide throughout his time in the Senate.
* Mark took on Senate Republicans who blocked his legislation to make sure our elections are fair and free of foreign interference, and continues to advocate for election security legislation. He originally introduced the Foreign Influence Reporting in Elections (FIRE) Act because he believes that if a foreign power offers election assistance, you shouldn't say, ""thank you"" — you should call the FBI.
* Mark joined Senator Tim Kaine in calling on the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to stop transferring people in their custody during the coronavirus pandemic following a spike in COVID-19 cases at a facility in Farmville, VA.
* This week, Mark offered two amendments to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA): a bi-partisan amendment to address white supremacy in our armed forces, and an amendment to increase oversight of privatized military housing. Mark has previously passed a law to address unsafe military housing conditions, and included this provision in the NDAA to keep the pressure on Congress to ensure that servicemembers and their families have acceptable living conditions.
* Last week, Mark and his Senate colleagues passed the Great American Outdoors Act with broad, bi-parstian support. The bill, which also includes full funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF), could support 100,000 jobs across the country — 10,000 in Virginia alone — while providing the resources to address maintenance backlog in our national parks.
* Mark is an original co-sponsor of the Justice in Policing Act, led by Senators Kamala Harris and Cory Booker, and continues to speak about systemic racism in our country and the need for concrete reform in Virginia and across the country.
Thank you for your support.

We have a plan to take back the Senate — and it starts by protecting the folks who are already there.
Republicans are laser-focused on six races: Doug Jones in Alabama, Gary Peters in Michigan, Jeanne Shaheen in New Hampshire, Tina Smith in Minnesota, and Cory Booker in New Jersey. Losing even one of these seats will seriously threaten our chances of winning back control of the Senate.
Chip in to help us re-elect Democratic Senators and flip the Senate.
This isn’t just about Mark Warner’s re-election race. Across the nation, the GOP is targeting Democratic Senators who are up for re-election, looking out for every chance they can get to keep control of the Senate and block any hope of progress. Our path to victory in November must include re-electing these incredible Democratic Senators.
Here’s the bottom line: these Senators are folks who show up every day determined to make things right for their constituents and all Americans. And right now, they need our help to keep their seats. If there’s any hope of flipping the Senate, it starts with these six Senators.
We simply can’t do it without them. And they can’t do it without you.
If you have the means, please consider chipping in to send these leaders back to Washington.

So far this month, you’ve received emails from Joe Biden, Lisa Collis, and Tim Kaine asking for your help to send Mark Warner back to the Senate. Mark is committed to continue the work he’s already started: making health care more affordable for every Virginian, protecting health care coverage for those with pre-existing medical conditions, and creating an economy that works for all Virginians. We’re less than two weeks away from an election that can change the tide for Virginia and the country. And these folks have been reaching out to you, team, because it’s crucial that we keep leaders like Mark in the Senate fighting for a brighter future.
If you have the means, please consider pitching in to keep Mark Warner in the Senate, fighting for us.
We can’t take anything for granted. At this point in 2014, our team was confident that Mark would win his election. He did win — but that race was decided by just 17,000 votes. That’s why we’re kicking things into high gear right now. It takes a lot of resources to keep this campaign running, and even $5 makes a difference.
Thank you once again for your unwavering support for Mark Warner. We couldn’t do this without you.

Team,
While our nation is still reeling from the loss of American hero Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Trump and McConnell are already rushing to replace her on the Supreme Court.
This is wrong on so many planes. Sign on to DEMAND that Trump listen to Justice Ginsburg’s dying wish and not fill her seat until the next President is sworn in! →
SIGN ON NOW
Our concerns with Amy Coney Barrett aside, the hypocrisy of McConnell’s decision to hold a vote on this nominee is mind boggling. When there were nine months left until the election to replace President Obama, McConnell refused to allow a vote on his Supreme Court nominee, saying the people needed to decide.
Now, with just 37 days until the election, McConnell seems to have completely forgotten his own conviction to LET THE PEOPLE DECIDE!
Together, we have the power to stop this madness -- add your name to demand Trump and McConnell respect RBG’s final wish that the American people have a say in her replacement and no nominee be confirmed until after the next president is sworn in!

Friends —
Mark Warner is doing everything he can to help Virginians stay safe, healthy, and financially secure during this challenging time. He understands that people are frustrated with the government’s response to this national crisis — and he wants your feedback on what needs to be done differently.
The president failed to take the pandemic seriously and still has not offered any national strategy to combat it and protect us. Then, when House Democrats voted to give us a second round of financial relief back in May, the GOP-controlled Senate dragged its feet taking any action and left millions struggling.
We have a chance to make a change in our government on Election Day. But Mark understands that struggling Virginians can’t wait for an election — they need help right now.
So will you tell Mark what you think he should fight for right now to help Virginians through this difficult time?

Mark Warner for Virginia
Friends —
Last night, we lost a brilliant legal mind, a true trailblazer, and a role model for so many in this country. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was a giant — someone who spent her life fighting for the most vulnerable among us and working toward true equality for everyone in this country. I am thinking of her family, and the many people who looked up to her and loved her, during this challenging time.
Justice Ginsburg is gone, but her legacy remains.
We see it here in Virginia, when we see women among the graduating classes at Virginia Military Institute. And we see it in all of the people who were inspired by Justice Ginsburg to continue her work of breaking down barriers to make way for a more just society.
Justice Ginsburg said that some of her favorite opinions to write were dissenting opinions. In a way, she has left us our to-do list in her dissenting opinions: fix the Voting Rights Act, close the pay gap in our country, and ensure that people are able to make reproductive health decisions for themselves.
Shortly before her death, Justice Ginsburg said it was her fervent wish that a new Supreme Court Justice not be confirmed until a new President was elected. It is my desire to honor that wish as part of honoring who Justice Ginsburg was and what she meant to this country.
As we look at our path forward, it's clear that this election will be about who we are — and who we want to be — as a nation, and about preserving the progress we've made to make this country more fair and equal for all. And it will be about charting our path forward, because there is certainly still work to be done.
May her memory be a blessing and a call to action for all of us.

Mark Warner for Virginia
Friends —
Today, the Senate Intelligence Committee released our fifth and final report on Russian interference in the 2016 election.
Many of my constituents have asked me about this particular report, so I wanted to take some time to break down our findings and provide context.
I will be frank about what we found. There were a stunning number of contacts between members of the Trump campaign and Russian government operatives.
This report is the result of three years of bi-partisan work, hundreds of interviews with witnesses, and millions of documents. I’m proud to be a leader on the committee that produced it.
The document we just released is nearly 1,000 pages. It is the most comprehensive look into the ties between the 2016 Trump presidential campaign and Russia that has been done to date, and it details a grave counterintelligence threat to our elections.
I believe the report speaks for itself. That is why I encourage everyone to take a careful look at Volume 5 — at the documented evidence of extensive and absolutely unprecedented interference in our electoral system by Russians and their operatives on behalf of then-candidate Donald Trump — and to draw their own independent conclusions.
This cannot happen again. Our elections should be fair and free of foreign interference.
Unfortunately, that was not the case in 2016. I will continue to fight for strong electoral protections in the Senate. The lessons learned from this report should serve as a blueprint for how to protect our democracy, and our executive branch, Congress, and the American people should heed the warnings in this document.

Mark Warner for Virginia
Friend —
I’ve been going through some old pictures as we put together ads for this campaign, and I came across this one of me as a senior in high school.
Looking back, I guess I had that red, white, and blue thing going on even back then. But in high school, I didn’t know that I wanted to be your Senator — I just knew that I wanted to get stuff done and to make a difference.
My parents weren’t political — but they were involved in our community, and they raised me to be the same way. It was less about the red team versus the blue team, and more about how we could all work toward the common good. I’ve tried to carry that lesson with me throughout my political career, working across the aisle to come to solutions that move us all forward.
If you believe, as I do, that we’ve got to get back to working together so that everyone has a fair shot at success, will you consider chipping in to help send me back to the Senate?
We’re in the home stretch, and every little bit does make a difference. I appreciate your support, and I look forward to continuing to work together. The best days for Virginia — and for our country — lie ahead of us.

Mark Warner for Virginia
Friend,
In Virginia, we like to say that every year is the most important election, but this year, that’s really true. This election is about who we are — and who we want to be — as a Commonwealth and as a country.
With more than a million votes cast already in the Commonwealth, one thing is clear: Virginians are ready to vote.
With that in mind, will you take our one-question survey about why you’re voting in this election? If you’ve already voted early in person or by mail, we’d like to hear from you too!
Thank you for your support!

Mark Warner for Virginia
Friends,
Democrats have been gaining ground in the Commonwealth — and making some meaningful change! We’re hoping to keep the blue wave going, but it’s important that we keep in mind that Virginia is not solidly blue. As Team Warner charts a plan to Election Day, we’re remembering the past.
We can’t take a single vote for granted. In 2014, Mark Warner won his Senate election by less than 1%. That’s why we’re so focused on laying the groundwork now for a successful Election Day this November.
CHIP IN NOW TO HELP MARK WIN RE-ELECTION
With the election less than four months away we’re working overtime to get the word out about all the ways Mark Warner has helped move Virginia forward in the Senate. His priorities include:
* Making health care more affordable, including lowering the cost of prescription drugs, and protecting coverage for those with pre-existing medical conditions;
* Leading reforms to military housing, to make sure that those who pledged to serve our country have safe and affordable housing;
* Supporting job training centers across the Commonwealth so no one has to leave Virginia to find a world-class job;
* Working to pass a bill that would ensure our elections are fair and free of foreign interference;
* And continuing to work with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to make sure that Virginians have the support they need during the coronavirus pandemic.
While Mark is working hard in the Senate, the Trump campaign and the GOP are making huge investments to turn Virginia red on Election Day. Real Clear Politics has even rated Virginia a “tossup” in the 2020 presidential election. It’s critical that we reach as many voters as possible across the Commonwealth in the next four months to secure strong victory.

Friends,
This is a grassroots campaign. It always has been. And as you can see, Mark Warner has support coming from every corner of the Commonwealth.

Can you add Aldie to our map by making a donation today?
With just 44 days until the election on November 3rd, we can’t afford to let Mark’s momentum slow.
Mark won his 2014 election by less than 1% — our team is not taking anything for granted in this campaign. From the very beginning, Mark wanted to run a campaign for every Virginian, and widespread support for his campaign from across the Commonwealth is proof that folks know he’s working hard for every Virginian.
So, will we see your name on the map next?
Thank you for being a key part of this campaign.

Folks —
I know you've been hearing from our team a lot this week, and I wanted to let you know why. Yes, we're coming up against the end of the month, and there's a goal we need to hit. But it goes deeper than that.
I remember 2014, when Mark Warner won his election by less than 1%. That's within the margin of error. Going into Election Night, polls told Team Warner we were way ahead and had nothing to worry about — but that wasn't true.

If we're going to bring home a win in November, we simply can't afford to be complacent or take anything for granted. That's why we're pushing so hard to meet our July fundraising goal. We're working overtime to get the word out about Mark's work to make health care more affordable, to support job training centers across the Commonwealth, and to ensure Virginians have the resources they need during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
While Mark is working hard in the Senate, the Trump campaign and the GOP are making huge investments to turn Virginia red on Election Day.
We're ready to fight with everything we've got. And to keep going, we need your support. If you have the means, would you consider supporting Mark Warner's re-election campaign?

Hi, friend!
I’m Marcy, the digital director for Mark Warner’s campaign. As we get into the final stretch of campaign season, I’m sure your inbox is full of requests from causes that you care about. I wanted to take a minute to explain why these emails are so critically important to our campaign.
So much of our campaign funding comes from our email program.
It’s a really critical piece of our fundraising strategy, and the money this program brings in helps us reach voters like you, all across the Commonwealth. My goal for this month is to make sure our team has the funds needed to reach as many voters as possible across the Commonwealth before November 3rd. And to do that, we need help from folks like you.
So, if you have the means, please consider chipping in to help Mark’s campaign end on a high note.
As we take health precautions to keep Mark’s constituents safe during this campaign, digital work has become even more important, as we do our best to reach Virginians where they are — whether that’s in their newsfeed or on the sidebar of a news article. $5 really does a difference when it comes to our digital program — it helps put more money behind digital ads that are working to expand the reach of our message.
If you take anything away from this email, know that real people are writing these (and reading the responses!) and that we’re grateful for everyone on Team Warner. Thank you for everything you do to move us forward — none of this work would be possible without you.
— Marcy, Team Warner Digital Director

Mark Warner,info@markwarnerva.com,Let's talk about USPS,"Mark Warner for Virginia
Friend —
I wanted to take a few minutes to write to you about the Post Office.
The U.S. Postal Service has been in the news a lot over the past few months, between President Trump’s misleading comments on mail-in voting, to cuts being made to our postal service by the Trump administration appointee who is now leading the agency.
Let me be frank: USPS was never meant to be a huge moneymaker for the federal government. It was created more than 200 years ago to serve the American public — service is in the name.
Millions of folks across the country rely on the U.S. Postal Service to receive their Social Security checks, get important medicine, and stay in touch with their loved ones. And come November, many more Americans will use this system to safely cast their ballots by mail. Beyond the critical services it provides, the U.S. Postal Service also employs 600,000 folks across the country, and questions about funding means their jobs hang in the balance.
We’re going to need Congressional action to fix this. If you feel the same way I do about protecting the Post Office, I urge you to sign onto this petition to show your support.
USPS isn’t something that we can do without, even in the digital age. I will continue to advocate in the Senate to make sure the postal service has the funding it needs to continue to serve the American people. That’s a promise.
Thank you for your support.

Gerry Connolly for Congress
Hey Team, today is Labor Day, a day we set aside to celebrate the labor movement, and all American workers. And this year, that cause is more important than ever.
COVID-19 has upended our labor force -- tens of millions of Americans have lost their jobs, some are adjusting to a new, virtual workspace, and others continue to go to work everyday, risking their lives to keep our great nation running.
To all our workers, America owes you a great debt. And it is time to ensure that every worker in our country is afforded the dignity, respect, and rights that they deserve -- that means a living wage, hazard pay, unemployment benefits, affordable healthcare, and more.
I know this is an incredibly difficult time for many. It’s why I am more committed than ever to defend and uplift our working class families. I am proud to be a strong voice advocating for our country’s working families in Congress, and I’ll never stop stepping up to support our workers.
I’m grateful to those who continue to keep our country running, even during a pandemic. And I’m thankful for those who, throughout history, have fought for fairer, safer workplaces so that we all may benefit. Today, let’s honor the sacrifices American workers have made and continue to make. Tomorrow, let’s get back to work protecting them and their rights.
Friends, Happy Labor Day to you and your family! Be safe.

Mark Warner,info@markwarnerva.com,Listening to the data when reopening our schools.,"Mark Warner for Virginia
Friend —
Everyone wants schools to fully reopen for in-person instruction, but we need to acknowledge that the challenge facing our schools — and our country — is unprecedented.
Instead of offering the responsible, measured leadership the American people need right now, President Trump and Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos are threatening to force schools to fully reopen for in-person instruction, even if local jurisdictions have deemed that unsafe.
Secretary DeVos is being willfully ignorant about the crisis we’re facing. She claims “there is nothing in the data that suggests it would not be appropriate to have kids in school,” as the Trump administration insists that all public schools reopen as usual this fall. But the data shows that coronavirus cases are hitting record-highs across the nation, and are still on the rise.
COVID-19 cases in the U.S.
Let me be clear: if we do this wrong, it’ll hurt our communities, our economy, and set our country back. So I’m doing something about it.
Tomorrow, I'm introducing a bill to make it absolutely clear to Donald Trump, Betsy DeVos, and anyone else in the Trump administration who would use the health and safety of our children as a bargaining chip: schools should open when local officials determine it's safe to do so. They should not reopen on the Trump administration's political schedule.
I want to make one other point clear here. The communities who feel the impact of this callous move by the Trump administration hardest are the school districts who are already struggling to afford the safety measures recommended by public health officials. I’m talking about low-income communities and communities of color, who are already being hit hardest by the coronavirus pandemic.
We can’t afford to leave any of our children behind, and reopening too soon puts children, educators, and all those who work in our schools at risk. We can’t afford to get this one wrong.
Thank you for your support.

Friend —
At the end of this email, I'm going to ask you to consider supporting Mark Warner's re-election campaign, but first, let me explain why.
I want to thank everyone who has made a donation — this week, this month, this year. Thank you for showing your continued support for Mark and for the entire team that's kept us going through these unprecedented times.
As I look forward to Labor Day, I'm thinking about how, normally, Mark and our team would be running around the Commonwealth: shaking hands in Buena Vista, participating in Bobby Scott's cookout, and talking with Democratic committees across Virginia.
This campaign has been anything but normal — our country is facing really challenging times. Keeping Mark's constituents safe and healthy has meant that things look different this year: the vast majority of our events have gone online, and we've had to rethink how our field team is contacting voters and getting them information on how to safely cast their ballot.
Our team is working hard to make up the difference — and I'm so proud of our progress. We are determined to press forward and spread Mark's message to folks across the Commonwealth, while keeping our team and Mark's constituents as safe as possible.
In moments of uncertainty like the ones we've faced this year, we need leaders like Mark, who are willing to roll up their sleeves and work until the job is done and every Virginian has the resources they need. Mark is fighting in the Senate to address all of the crises facing our country: coronavirus, record rates of unemployment, and systemic racism, while laying the groundwork to make sure that everyone has the ability to safely cast their vote come November.
We need your help to re-elect Mark and keep Virginia blue in 2020. I know that many folks in the Commonwealth and around the country are facing hardship, but I'm asking that you consider supporting real leadership for Virginia if you have the means.
Any amount you can give today will help us meet our critical end-of-month goal and make a difference in the campaign to re-elect Mark Warner.
Thank you so much for your support.

Friend —
Earlier this week, Mark Warner announced he will participate in three debates ahead of the 2020 Senate election.
* The Northern Virginia Chamber of Commerce and NBC4 Washington Debate is the traditional debate for top-of-ticket general elections in Virginia, and was held most recently in 2018 between Senator Tim Kaine and Corey Stewart.
* The Norfolk State University Debate in Norfolk will be the first debate hosted by Norfolk State University, and will focus on racial justice issues.
* The People’s Debate is hosted by AARP (American Association of Retired Persons) and WTVR (CBS6 in Richmond).
These debates are a critical chance for Mark to share his vision for the Commonwealth with voters and discuss the work he’s done to benefit all Virginians. Mark has worked hard to protect and expand access to health care and deliver lasting economic relief to Virginians struggling during the Covid-19 crisis, and remains committed to building an economy that works for everyone.
We know that nothing in this election is guaranteed — Mark won his election in 2014 by less than 1%. As we look forward to Election Day, we are so grateful for this strong grassroots network. We have the power to make a change in November and flip the Senate blue, but to do that it’s absolutely critical that we send Mark back to the Senate. If you have the means, will you please consider contributing to Mark’s re-election effort?
This isn’t the end of conversation with Virginia voters — Mark is looking forward to participating in other forums and roundtable discussions ahead of the election, and will continue to hold virtual town halls for his constituents.
We are so grateful for your support. Thank you.

Blue Virginia 2020 (via MarkWarnerVA.com),info@markwarnerva.com,the GOP has their sights set on Virginia,"Mark Warner for Virginia
This is BIG, friends: now that Mark Warner's opponent has secured the GOP nomination, the Republican Party of Virginia is officially calling the Commonwealth a “swing state.”
They’re determined to roll back the progress we’ve made in Virginia by re-electing Donald Trump and replacing Mark in the Senate. With the Trump Victory Initiative and GOP donors pouring money and other resources into the Commonwealth, we’re going to need all hands on deck to turn the tide and elect Democrats up and down the ballot.
Pitch in to re-elect Mark Warner and keep Virginia blue!
With the President personally targeting Virginia, we have to take this seriously. In fact, right now the Trump campaign is currently outraising the Biden campaign in Virginia.
And for Team Warner, this is personal. Mark won his 2014 election by less than 1% — so we’re not taking anything for granted. There are no guarantees in this race, and we’re ready to put everything we have into making sure that we send Mark back to the Senate.
We need to fight for every single vote, every single day from now until Election Day on November 3rd! Will you help us keep Virginia blue?

Hi friend —
I just wanted to make sure you saw my last note.
We're less than 50 days away from Election Day on November 3rd, and we're coming up against a critically important fundraising deadline.
Can you chip in today to help us reach our $10,000 goal before midnight tonight?
It's support from folks like you that keeps this campaign going — and will help us send Mark Warner back to the Senate in November. Thank you for your support.

Mark Warner for Virginia,info@markwarnerva.com,less than 1%,"we can't take anything for granted
Mark Warner for Virginia
Friends,
Democrats have been gaining ground in the Commonwealth — and making some meaningful change! We’re hoping to keep the blue wave going, but it’s important that we keep in mind that Virginia is not solidly blue. As Team Warner charts a plan to Election Day, we’re remembering the past.
We can’t take a single vote for granted. In 2014, Mark Warner won his Senate election by less than 1%. That’s why we’re so focused on laying the groundwork now for a successful Election Day this November.
CHIP IN NOW TO HELP MARK WIN RE-ELECTION
With the election less than three months away we’re working overtime to get the word out about all the ways Mark Warner has helped move Virginia forward in the Senate. His priorities include:
* Making health care more affordable, including lowering the cost of prescription drugs, and protecting coverage for those with pre-existing medical conditions;
* Leading reforms to military housing, to make sure that those who pledged to serve our country have safe and affordable housing;
* Supporting job training centers across the Commonwealth so no one has to leave Virginia to find a world-class job;
* Working to pass a bill that would ensure our elections are fair and free of foreign interference;
* And continuing to work with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to make sure that Virginians have the support they need during the coronavirus pandemic.
While Mark is working hard in the Senate, the Trump campaign and the GOP are making huge investments to turn Virginia red on Election Day. It’s critical that we reach as many voters as possible across the Commonwealth in the next three months to secure strong victory.
We need your help. If you have the means, will you support Mark Warner’s re-election campaign?

Team Warner,info@markwarnerva.com,weekly update,"Mark Warner for Virginia
If you would like more information about how to slow and stop the spread of COVID-19, take a look at these resources from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC).
Friends —
We hope this email finds you and your loved ones safe and healthy. Team Warner will keep sending these weekly updates to keep folks around Virginia up to date with what Mark Warner is working on in the Senate. Between the Great American Outdoors Act passing in the House, and Mark introducing bills to support low-income and minority communities during the coronavirus pandemic and expand common sense gun reforms, it's been a busy week. Let's break it down.
Here's what Mark is focused on right now:
* This week, the House of Representatives passed the Great American Outdoors Act with bi-partisan support. The bill includes full funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) and will support 100,000 jobs across the country (10,000 in Virginia alone!) while providing the resources to address maintenance backlogs in our national parks. Mark has been working on this bill for the last three years; it passed in the Senate with bi-partisan support in June.
→ Up next: This bill heads to the President's desk for signature.
* Mark Warner introduced the Jobs and Neighborhood Investment Act to help low-income and Black and brown communities that have been disproportionately impacted by the coronavirus pandemic withstand the outbreak and emerge even stronger. The bill includes investment in Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) and Minority Depository Institutions (MDIs), a Neighborhood Loan Program to support small business lending to businesses serving low- and moderate-income and minority communities, and additional programs to strengthen MDIs and CDFIs, aimed at strengthening the relationship between these institutions and federal agencies like the U.S. Treasury.
* This week, Mark Warner and Senator Tim Kaine introduced the ""Virginia Plan"" to expand the progress that Virginia has made on common sense gun reforms nationwide. Thanks to our General Assembly, the Commonwealth has taken action to end gun violence; it's time for Congress to act.
* Mark Warner called to continue unemployment benefits as the coronavirus pandemic continues. Mark said that not extending these benefits while folks are still out of work due to the outbreak would be ""a disaster.""
* Mark Warner joined Senators Tim Kaine, Ron Wyden, and Jeff Merkley in co-sponsoring the Preventing Authoritarian Tactics on America's Streets Act, following reports of unidentified officers deploying unjustified and unconstitutional intimidation tactics on protesters in Portland, Oregon. This bill would protect the constitutional rights of peaceful protesters.
* Mark called for Congress to be briefed by the F.B.I. on possible disinformation threats around the upcoming election. Mark is committed to ensuring our elections are fair and free of foreign interference, but to do that the Senate needs to work with all of the available information.
* This week, Mark Warner introduced a bill to prevent Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos or anyone in the Trump administration from denying funding to schools who do not fully reopen in person in the fall. We can't afford to leave any of our children behind, but reopening too soon puts children, educators, and all those who work in our schools at risk. Reopening decisions should be made on the recommendations of public health professionals, local officials, and all available data.
Thank you for your support.

"Bruce, Team Warner Campaign Manager",info@markwarnerva.com,Virginians: TODAY is the last day to request your vote by mail ballot.,"Request your ballot by 5:00 PM
Mark Warner for Virginia
Friends —
If you’ve been putting off requesting your vote by mail ballot, this is your last chance.
The deadline to request your no-excuse absentee ballot in Virginia is tonight at 5:00 PM ET. Whether you plan to vote by mail or vote in-person, the first step is making a plan. Head over to [[URL REDACTED]] to get started.
I want to give you a little insight into how we’re looking at this deadline as a team. As of today, over 690,000 vote by mail ballots have been returned, but there are thousands of requested ballots that have yet to be cast. In 2014, Mark’s narrow victory was decided by fewer than 17,000 votes — that’s why it’s so important that everyone’s voice is heard in this election. Those ballots that haven’t been returned yet could be the deciding factor for Mark keeping his seat in the Senate this year.
That’s why our team is focused on chasing down every last potential voter that has requested a ballot but not yet returned it — and that means phone calls, text messages, and digital reminders. Making sure that every vote is counted takes time and money, and we’re ready to work until the job is done. We could use some help, though!
Can you chip in today to ensure we have the funds to reach out to these voters?
With only 11 days left until Election Day on November 3rd, it’s critical that everyone gets the opportunity to have their voices heard. No matter how you’re casting your ballot this year, your vote gives you the power to re-elect Mark Warner, flip the Senate blue, and make substantial change in this country.
Thank you for your continued support. We could not do this without you!
— Bruce, Team Warner Campaign Manager
P.S. We’re so close to the finish line, and we can’t do it without you. If you’ve cast your vote early, THANK YOU! If you’re looking for a way to stay involved in the lead-up to Election Day, consider a contribution to help us continue our voter turnout efforts in these last few days before the election.

Mark Warner for Virginia
We must protect and fund the U.S. Postal Service.
Add your name if you agree
Friend —
Millions of Americans rely on the U.S. Postal Service every day to receive their Social Security checks, pay their bills, get important medicine, and stay in touch with their loved ones. It’s an absolutely essential service.
And this November, many more Americans will rely on the postal service to safely cast their ballots in the November 3rd general election.
Recent cuts made by the Trump administration threaten the postal service’s ability to keep providing the reliable, efficient service that Americans count on. The administration is now trying to backtrack, claiming that they’re solving a problem of their own making by reversing these senseless cuts. Words are not enough.
We need Congress to go back to Washington and take immediate action. Will you join Mark Warner in calling for immediate congressional action to protect the postal service?
We’re living in unprecedented times. A year ago, no one anticipated that we’d need to weigh protecting our health and casting our ballot. USPS and mail-in ballots provide a safe alternative in many states — but only if the post office has the funding it needs to keep delivering the mail reliably and on time. The Trump administration’s back and forth on postal service policy has cast doubt on the ability of the agency to fulfill its duties. That cannot stand.
Cancer patients depend on the post office for their medicine. Small businesses depend on the post office to pay bills on time. And every American must be able to depend on the USPS to securely deliver millions of ballots in time to be counted in this critically important election.
Add your name now to join Mark Warner’s call for immediate action.
Thank you,
Team Warner

Team,
Yesterday, we had the honor of seeing our future Vice President, Senator Kamala Harris, take on VP Pence in an intense debate.
In the face of Pence’s blatant lies and fear mongering, Kamala showed herself to be a person of strength, compassion, and competency -- traits that have been absent from the White House for quite some time.
My campaign is working night and day to turn out Democrats across Virginia so we can get Joe and Kamala to the White House (and elect Dems at every level!) -- Now, can you chip in to make sure we succeed?

Trump and Pence have destroyed this country -- from butchering the COVID response, to ending negotiations for a federal stimulus, to decimating essential institutions like the USPS and EPA, and so much more.
Yesterday’s debate proved that Kamala Harris is the decisive, smart leader we need at the helm of this country, alongside Joe Biden. With your support, we can make sure they have that opportunity. Chip in NOW to ensure Democrats hold the House, flip the Senate, and win back the White House!

Mark Warner for Virginia
Friend —
There’s more at stake in this election than just who we’re sending to Washington to represent us.
President Trump just released a list of folks he’d like to appoint to the Supreme Court — a bevy of conservatives who have all publicly said they support rolling back Roe v. Wade. Allowing Donald Trump to have control of the Supreme Court would chip away at reproductive freedom. Americans deserve a court that will vote fairly on the issues that impact our communities — not one that’s been weaponized.
Make no mistake: The Supreme Court is on the ballot on November 3rd.
The progress we’ve made in this country was hard-won, and we can’t afford to give Trump another four years in office to continue to undo the strides we’ve made. It’s absolutely critical that we turn the tide.
We need to re-elect folks like Mark Warner and elect Democrats up and down the ballot to protect the progress we’ve made. Can you chip in and help us?
Mark is committed to protecting the right of every American to make deeply personal choices about reproductive health for themselves — that's why he voted against anti-choice bills in the Senate earlier this year. Mark will always protect reproductive rights and defend against any attacks to chip away at those rights.
We have a real path toward a change in Washington this year. We can flip the Senate blue and replace Donald Trump and Mike Pence with Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. But to make that a reality, we’re going to need everyone to vote — and we’re going to need to hold seats like Mark’s.
Thanks for your continued support.

Mark Warner for Senate 2020,info@markwarnerva.com,Doing the math,"Mark Warner for Virginia
Friend —
FiveThirtyEight’s recent polling analysis shows there’s a “real chance” of picking up Democratic Senate seats this November and taking leadership back from Republicans.
If we want to make this goal of a blue Senate a reality, it’s critical that we hold onto the seats we already have by re-electing leaders like Mark.
Here’s how the math works out: Right now Republicans have a 53-47 Senate majority. Since the Vice President is the tie-breaker vote in the Senate, Democrats have to flip three seats and win the vice presidency, or flip at least four seats without the vice presidency. We also have to re-elect all of the Democratic Senators on the ballot this fall. That’s why Mark's re-election campaign is so critical — and why we’re asking for a contribution today.
The path to a Democratic majority runs right through Virginia, and it’s critical that we keep up the fight to re-elect Mark, and elect Democrats up and down the ballot this fall. Please consider chipping in $5 or whatever you can to keep Mark in the Senate.
Thank you for your support.

We’re just 16 days out from Election Day, friend.
Make no mistake: We’re in a battle for the soul of our nation, and winning in Virginia is critical to making sure that we get Donald Trump out of the White House, so we can start building our country back.
Here’s the thing, though. Winning the White House isn’t enough to make the kind of change we need to see in this country. It’s so important that we have a Democratic majority in the Senate as well. And to do that, it’s absolutely necessary to hang onto the seats we already have — seats like Mark Warner’s. I’ve seen the way that Mark has worked during this pandemic and during his entire time in public service to make sure that people have what they need to thrive. We need more folks like him representing us.
Can you donate $10 — or whatever makes sense with your budget — to help send Mark back to the Senate and send me and Kamala Harris to the White House?
Building this country back better is going to take a lot of hard work. I know that Mark is ready to roll up his sleeves and work until the job is done — that’s why I’m so eager to get him back in the Senate.
When we put our minds to it and put in the work, we can make great change happen in this country. And I’m asking you to stand with me and with my friend Mark and help get both of our campaigns to the finish line.
Friend, will you split $10 between my campaign and Mark’s campaign to help us in the homestretch?

Friend —
I’m sure you’re getting a lot of emails from folks trying to hit their end-of-quarter deadlines, so I will keep this as brief as possible. I’m going to ask you to chip in to support Mark Warner’s re-election campaign as we head into the final stretch of this election, but first let me explain why.
I’ve been on this team for a while now, and I’ve seen how hard Mark works. He’s the kind of guy who will roll up his sleeves and work until the job is done, whether he’s working across the aisle to make sure that Virginians have the resources they need to face the coronavirus pandemic or working to expand rural broadband coverage to make sure everyone has a fair shot to work and learn. His goal has always been to make sure that everyone in the Commonwealth has equal access to opportunities and the resources they need to succeed — no matter what their ZIP code is.
As the finance director, I’ve gotten to see firsthand just how many Virginians are putting their trust in Mark Warner. We’ve seen campaign contributions from every corner of the Commonwealth, and we are so grateful for your support.
This campaign is fueled by grassroots donors, and it’s vitally important that we continue to hit our fundraising goals so that we can finish this race strong. That’s why some generous donors have agreed to match your donation to help us reach this critical end-of-quarter goal, which means that your contribution counts as double right now. Can you chip in while we have our dollar-for-dollar match active?
If you’ve been thinking about chipping in, now is the time. Your money will go twice as far! We’re less than 40 days away from Election Day, and this team is committed to continue to connect with voters and make sure that everyone turns out to keep Virginia blue.
We can’t do it without you — can you help us meet our fundraising goal?
Thank you for all of your support!

Team,
In the midst of the Trump administration’s thuroughly incompetent COVID-19 strategy, Dr. Fauci has emerged as the sole national expert that America can reliably depend on for science-backed advice and guidance around the pandemic crisis.
Over and over again, Dr. Fauci has bravely refuted Trump’s false claims about COVID-19. But now, Trump is attempting to push Dr. Fauci out -- he’s been cut out of public White House events around the pandemic and Trump has hired his own coronavirus advisor who has been described as the “anti-Fauci.”
Team, we need your help to show the Trump administration that the American people need and depend on Dr. Fauci -- and we will not allow Trump to push Dr. Fauci out as he has so many other public servants. Sign on now to tell Trump: stop the attacks on Dr. Fauci NOW!

It’s obvious that President Trump still doesn’t know the first thing when it comes to COVID-19. Just check out what he said about Joe Biden:
Mask-wearing is one of the best proven methods to reduce the spread of COVID-19, and Americans everywhere are adjusting to this new garment -- yet Trump has repeatedly refused to wear it and discouraged others from doing so as well. It’s clear: we can’t trust Trump on COVID-19, and we can’t trust his administration. That’s why Dr. Fauci is so important. Without him, America would be flying blind.
Sign on now to PROTECT Dr. Fauci and demand Trump stop the attacks on this trusted national expert →

Thanks so much for your support, friend!

Just wanted to make sure you saw my last note, friend.
There’s so much at stake between now and Election Day on November 3rd. We’re in the midst of an ongoing global pandemic, a changing economy, and a national reckoning with systemic racism.
This election is about what kind of country we are — and what kind of country we want to be. Casting your ballot this year isn’t just about protecting the progress we’ve made, it’s about rebuilding our country and our economy after the damage that this pandemic and four years of Donald Trump’s failed leadership have wrought. I believe we have what it takes to keep Virginia blue and turn the tide in our country, but I need your help.
So if you’re with me, can you chip in a few dollars to keep this campaign moving forward? I can’t do this without your support.

>  I am so inspired by the folks in Virginia. We’re facing an incredibly challenging time — a global pandemic, a reckoning with racism in our country, and a rapidly changing economy. But, as I’ve checked in with folks across the Commonwealth, I’ve seen resilience and dedication to protecting the progress we’ve made.
>
>  This campaign has felt different from any other; we’re not able to connect in the same ways. One of my favorite parts of campaigning is getting to hear directly from voters, and I have to admit that I’ve been missing the usual parades and large rallies. Still, whether it’s been on Zoom or during socially distanced events, the dedication to keeping Virginia blue is palpable. And I am so grateful for your support — for me, and for Democrats up and down the ticket.
>
>  We had record turnout in Virginia on Super Tuesday, and I know that we can match it based on the enthusiasm I’ve seen from folks in every corner of the Commonwealth. In Virginia, we say this every year, but it’s really true this time: This election is one of the most important in our lifetimes. It’s about what kind of country we are — and what kind of country we want to be. No matter how you’re planning to vote this year: by mail with a no-excuse absentee ballot, early in-person, or in-person on Election Day, it’s so critical that you do cast your ballot. And once you’ve made your plan to vote, check in with your friends to make sure they know how to make their voices heard too.

Friends —
Mark Warner’s Republican opponent Daniel Gade is joining Donald Trump in sowing misinformation about voting by mail. And make no mistake about it: This is an effort to make it harder for folks to vote, especially since we’re still in the middle of a pandemic. He’s made unsubstantiated accusations about voting by mail at least twice already.
Can you chip in now to help re-elect Mark Warner?
As coronavirus cases continue to rise in Virginia and across the country, experts agree that voting by mail offers a safe and secure way to participate in elections without risking the spread of COVID-19. Earlier this year, Virginia passed a law allowing no-excuse absentee voting. That means that everyone has the ability to vote by mail in the November 3rd election if they choose.
Even though Daniel Gade has repeatedly parroted Donald Trump’s false claims that voting by mail is fraudulent, it seems he’s saying one thing but doing another. Ahead of the June primary, his campaign website featured a form for Virginians to request their mail-in ballot to cast their vote for Gade.
It’s clear that Daniel Gade will not represent our best interests in Washington. We need to send Mark Warner back to the Senate so he can continue to work for all Virginians — and be honest about his priorities with them. If you’re able, will you pitch in now to help send Mark back to the Senate?
Thank you,
Team Warner
