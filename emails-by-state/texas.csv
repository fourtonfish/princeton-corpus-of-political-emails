Gilberto Hinojosa,yellowdog@txdemocrats.org,re: republican death panel,"Hi,
Republican Texas Supreme Court Justices are forcing Texans to put their lives on the line to vote during this pandemic.
This is a dark day for our democracy. The Republican Texas Supreme Court is wrong to force the people of Texas to choose between their health and their right to vote. They would have Texans die, just so they can hold on to power.
Voters should have the ability to vote-by-mail during a pandemic if they feel their health is in danger. Every single justice who ruled today should be ashamed of themselves. They are the new Republican death panel.
We will continue to fight like hell to protect every eligible Texan's right to vote and have their voices heard by their government.
As for the Texas Supreme Court, elections matter. We have one coming up quickly. I can guarantee that we will work every single day to ensure those Republicans -- Nathan Hecht, Jane Bland, Jeffrey Boyd, and Brett Busby -- are voted out of office. They put the voters of Texas in danger. We will not allow them to take this election away from the people.
If you're ready to take back the Texas Supreme Court and elect Justices who will defend your right to vote, will you rush a $7 contribution to the Texas Democratic Party? Your support is vital to our success in November:

Glen Maxey,yellowdog@txdemocrats.org,re: vbm,"Hi,
I know we're always asking you for help and I know that flooding your inbox is a frickin' pain.
But this is really important. I've been doing this for a long time and I know that without a doubt that elections are won and lost because of vote by mail.
That's why this old man is asking for your help. Because I know that without your help, we won't have the resources to send seniors and disabled Texans their vote-by-mail applications.
We've set a huge goal of sending 925,000 applications and we need to fully fund our Vote-by-Mail Fund by this Friday to do it. Reaching this goal means that we can send 14,210 Texans their applications in Denton County. It also means that we're sending a message to Trump Republicans that Texas Democrats are running a strong grassroots campaign that will win.
We know that 925,000 vote-by-mail applications is a hell of a goal, and I know we can do it with your help. Can you make a $7 contribution to our Vote-By-Mail Fund so we can send 21 Texans their application? It's absolutely critical to us winning in 2020.
If you've saved payment info with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
$7 = 21 applications
$25 = 75 applications
$50 = 150 applications
$100 = 300 applications
$250 = 750 applications

Kamala Harris has been fighting for us all her life, and I can't wait to watch her on the debate stage tonight.
We've waited for this moment for a long, long time. Tonight, it's finally here. For the first time in HISTORY, an amazing woman of color will take center stage in the fight for our nation's second highest office. Millions of Americans will be cheering tonight as Kamala smashes that glass ceiling to bits.

Kamala stands for ALL of us. Just like Joe Biden, Kamala Harris embodies the kind of leadership we need right now: experienced, empathetic, compassionate, and steady. This is the team that will put our communities first, contain the coronavirus, build the economy back better, and unite our country so we can move forward. That's what's on all of our minds as we head into tonight's debate.
That could not be farther from the response of the current administration, and right now, our families are suffering because of it. For eight months, Trump, Pence, and Trump Republicans have left us to face this virus alone. They don't care about Texans and they could not have made it more obvious. We are living and breathing the consequences.
It's why we know beyond a doubt: our future hinges on electing Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and Democrats up and down the ballot.
For the next 27 days, we have to fight like hell to get them there.

With voting right around the corner, we are preparing for the final, critical push in our campaigns: Get Out the Vote.
We must call and text every single Texas Democrat to make sure they know where to go vote, and when. Here's why this matters so much:
This election is incredibly close. Yes, people throw that around all the time, but we are talking one or two votes per neighborhood close. One or two votes. Those couple extra phone calls, those few extra people who make it to the ballot box because you helped them -- that's how we get this done.
Sign up today to phonebank from home, be a part of history, and turn Texas blue:

The phonebank will begin with a training, so whether you're a seasoned volunteer or a first-time caller, don't worry, we will get you all the information you need. Don't miss out!

Olivia Stitilis,yellowdog@txdemocrats.org,become a community captain today,"Hi,
I wanted to send you a quick update about what our organizing team is up to as coronavirus continues to wreak havoc across Texas. Last week, we launched our volunteer Community Captains program. To do as much good as possible during this time, we need all hands on deck.
This is simply a volunteer role for anyone that feels compelled to be connected with others seeking to do more to help in the times of coronavirus. No one is more qualified than anyone else to be a community captain.
Right now, senior citizens are silently suffering from this pandemic, whether that means their limited mobility is exasperated or they're worried about their loved ones catching the virus. This week we are calling on community captains to help us run wellness checks for our senior citizens and follow up on vote-by-mail applications.
As a community captain, you're doing more than just calling senior citizens: you will work with county parties to offer support, resources, and encouragement during such an unnerving time for everyone. Sign up today to get started:

Two weeks ago, I emailed you to introduce myself and our new statewide organizing program. A lot has changed in the past two weeks. However, our mission stays the same.
When I wrote that we will ""redefine what it means to organize in Texas,"" I meant it. We will not sit on the sidelines while our communities are left feeling scared, confused, and isolated. In an effort to bring Texas Democrats together, our organizing team has developed numerous programs to help unify Texas.
ConnectTexas is our new community hub, where we will inform, empower, and connect Texans no matter where they live or where they are from.
We will be hosting community check-in calls across all 254 counties in Texas and need a diverse and committed coalition of Community Captains.  Community captains will be leading the charge to connect Texans. As one of our most dedicated Democrats, we need you to be a community captain. Can we count on you?
Yes, I will be a community captain
We will also be hosting online community forums and virtual organizing meetings, virtual and tele-town halls and workshops, daily remote organizing opportunities, such as texting, making calls, hosting, and so much more!
Together we will weather this storm and ensure that every Texan remains engaged. Through organizing, we will take back a piece of what COVID-19 took from us.

Subject: re: I'd like to introduce myself
Hi,
My name is Olivia Stitilis and I'm your new organizing director at the Texas Democratic Party. I'm honored to take on this role because right now the stakes have never been higher. Texas is the biggest battleground state. We know this is our moment to change the future of our country.
That's why the Texas Democratic Party will run a statewide organizing program that redefines what it means to organize in Texas. With the March 3 primary behind us, we've just entered the next phase of our organizing program.
Through innovative, relational and constituency driven organizing tactics, we will engage, train and mobilize volunteers in every corner of the state. We will expand the electorate, elect Democrats up and down the ticket in November, and create a lasting volunteer infrastructure that catalyzes community change beyond 2020.
Our organizing will be guided by clear values and united around a culture that puts volunteers and community members first, is informed, but not burdened by the past, and approaches every day and every interaction as an opportunity to organize.
We will invest early in places that traditionally have been forgotten or left behind. Our team will work collaboratively with the communities we serve, approach new situations with humility, and be transparent with our goals.
So, let's rise to this challenge together.
Right now, our biggest organizing priority is to recruit at least one new volunteer leader for every county. Before I go, I have to ask you. Can you take our Volunteer Survey to tell us a bit about yourself, what your skills are, and what we can do together to turn Texas blue?
Take The Survey
Organize everywhere,

We're weeks away from the biggest election of our lifetimes. That's why we need to get every single eligible voter registered before then -- because we need every single vote to defeat Donald Trump.
Next week is Texas Voter Registration Week and we're hosting a week of action to reach out to 1 million unregistered Texans and we can't do it without you.
Voting starts in 49 days. We must have the necessary conversations with our neighbors about why voting is so important and how they can get registered.
So, I'm asking. Can I count on you to sign up for a phonebanking shift today? We need 1,500 Texans to sign up for a shift today. This is how we take back our state and block the Republican path to the White House:
Sign up for a shift

Sign me up!
Hi,
Kamala Harris is set to be the next Vice President of the United States -- this is huge, y'all! She will not only be the first woman Vice President but also the first woman of color.
I can't wait to vote for her and Joe Biden, who will fight every day for hard-working Texans. This is our moment, and they are counting on us to have their backs.
That's why we're recruiting thousands of Texans to work the polls this fall and protect our right to vote.
Election workers are the first line of defense against voter suppression -- fighting for every eligible Texan to cast their ballot. Here are just a few reasons why you should apply:
* Help fight voter suppression,
* You'll make sure no eligible voter is turned away,
* Training will be provided, and you'll be supported every step of the way,
* And, you get paid!
Sign me up!
On November 3, we need tens of thousands of election workers all across Texas. It's going to be a long day and a tough fight -- but if you can stick it out from 6 that morning till 8 that night, we need you.
When we win Texas and elect Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and MJ Hegar, it'll be because of people like YOU who showed up for our communities and didn't back down. We are fighting for every single vote. Sign up today to join us.
Thanks,
Rose Clouston

Brittany Switzer,yellowdog@txdemocrats.org,I wanted to share a few stories with you,"Hi --
Every day, Texans are sharing their stories with us about how the coronavirus has changed their lives. We read each and every one of them because the only way we are going to get through this crisis is by continuing to build community.
I wanted to share a few of them with you that deeply touched my heart. I hope that their courage to share their own stories will inspire you to share your story with us:
""I've been practicing social distancing. I fully expect to get COVID-19 at some point. My main concern is to do my part to flatten the curve so healthcare providers won't be overwhelmed."" - Angie
""My wife and I were both in retail. We are now both laid off with no promise to return to our former jobs. We applied immediately to receive unemployment benefits, but the Texas Workforce Commission says we are not entitled because they have no record of our earnings. We have pay stubs and assurances from our employers that we are entitled. TWC only provides a phone number to get corrections, but they are not accepting calls."" - Stephen
""I'm 70 years old and I have a health condition that makes me high risk. I watched this problem develop and prepared myself. I have been deeply touched by the kindness of friends who check on me and will bring me groceries when I need them."" - Carol
""I work in a call center environment. I am 65 years old with underlying health conditions and my daughter advised me to work from home, unfortunately we don't have that option at my job. I am using my vacation time right after that runs out more than likely I will be out of a job. I stayed home being safe enjoying my loved ones. I know God is in control and I pray."" - Gloria
""My concern that I might become exposed to the virus by a customer and then bring it home to my spouse or my mother. I asked my employer to give me an indefinite leave, last week ... We do not receive paid sick leave. So basically my safety net will be used up within a week."" - Ken
""We feel blessed to have a home where we are safe and comfortable. There are so many whose lives have been turned upside down. Hopefully, we will continue to be encouraged to stay home and not be required to go back to work and possibly get sick and expose others."" - Doris
Listening to and telling these stories is essential. I appreciate you taking a moment to read these stories. Now more than ever, we must be willing to fight for people we don't know. So many people are out of work, worried about how they will pay bills, and on the front lines of this crisis.
We're all in this together. That means lifting up everyone's story.
So, I hope you'll take some time out of your day today to share your story with us:
share your story
Thank you so much for everything you do. It means so much to us during these times.

Manny Garcia,yellowdog@txdemocrats.org,let's turn Texas blue together,"Hey,
We need to know how many vote-by-mail applications we can send to Texas voters by Friday.
The truth is, for years, Republicans have been doing everything they can to make it harder for Texans to vote. Every year, the Texas Democratic Party has been there to help voters hurt by Republican voter suppression. That's why our vote-by-mail program is so important and why we need your help.
We need to send 925,000 applications and we still have 461,736 left to fund. This is the biggest vote-by-mail program the Texas Democratic Party has ever done.
Fully funding our vote-by-mail program will be the difference between victory and defeat. You have never let us down before. I know if everybody chips in a bit, we can reach this goal together. So today, I'm asking for your help to meet this challenge:
Can you make a $7 contribution so 21 Texans can receive a mail ballot application?
If you've saved payment info with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
$7 = 21 applications
$25 = 75 applications
$50 = 150 applications
$100 = 300 applications
$250 = 750 applications
Chip in more
By helping more Texans vote-by-mail, we're closer to a Democratic victory in 2020. It is so important that we are all in this together.
Thanks -- now let's get to work,
Manny Garcia
Executive Director, Texas Democratic Party
The only way we will take back our state is if we all work together. We need to fund 925,000 vote-by-mail applications by this Friday. Can you rush a $7 contribution to fund our vote-by-mail program?
Yes, I'll chip in

Olivia Stitilis,yellowdog@txdemocrats.org,I'd like to introduce myself,"Hi,
My name is Olivia Stitilis and I'm your new organizing director at the Texas Democratic Party. I'm honored to take on this role because right now the stakes have never been higher. Texas is the biggest battleground state. We know this is our moment to change the future of our country.
That's why the Texas Democratic Party will run a statewide organizing program that redefines what it means to organize in Texas. With the March 3 primary behind us, we've just entered the next phase of our organizing program.
Through innovative, relational and constituency driven organizing tactics, we will engage, train and mobilize volunteers in every corner of the state. We will expand the electorate, elect Democrats up and down the ticket in November, and create a lasting volunteer infrastructure that catalyzes community change beyond 2020.
Our organizing will be guided by clear values and united around a culture that puts volunteers and community members first, is informed, but not burdened by the past, and approaches every day and every interaction as an opportunity to organize.
We will invest early in places that traditionally have been forgotten or left behind. Our team will work collaboratively with the communities we serve, approach new situations with humility, and be transparent with our goals.
So, let's rise to this challenge together.
Right now, our biggest organizing priority is to recruit at least one new volunteer leader for every county. Before I go, I have to ask you. Can you take our Volunteer Survey to tell us a bit about yourself, what your skills are, and what we can do together to turn Texas blue?
Take The Survey
Organize everywhere,

Manny Garcia,yellowdog@txdemocrats.org,support our grassroots movement.,"Hey --
Can you believe what we're accomplishing, and we're only 28 days into the new year? That should tell you the kind of work we're doing to flip Texas and take our victory all the way to the White House.
The truth is that the strength of our movement comes from the number of people knocking on doors, calling voters, and investing in our state party. Your small-dollar donations go towards critical efforts that will turn Texas blue up and down the ballot. The investments that we make right now fund important programs like the biggest voter registration program in our history, expansive voter protection efforts, our second Staff the Movement Academy, and so much more.
Defeating Trump means building a coordinated effort as big as Texas, and we're able to do it because of you. Republicans are freaking out because they know we're registering millions of voters and strengthening our Democratic coalition in our fight to take back Texas.
So I need to ask: Can you activate your 2020 Texas Democrats membership with a $7 -- or whatever you can afford -- so your state party can hit our $90,000 end-of-month fundraising goal? No amount is too big or small:
If you've saved payment info with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Express Donate: $7
Express Donate: $10
Express Donate: $25
Express Donate: $50
Express Donate: $100
Or, donate another amount
I'm proud that we've built our movement on donations of $7, $10, and $25. Investments right now will determine the outcome of this election.

Gilberto Hinojosa,yellowdog@txdemocrats.org,[BREAKING] More allegations of illegal conduct and bribery by indicted Texas Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton,"Hi,
In a bombshell report, former top aides for Indicted Texas Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton alleged, among other violations of the law, that Paxton took bribes and abused the power of his office.
Indicted Texas Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton is the top law enforcement official for the state. Yet, he has proven for years that he cannot follow the law himself. Ken Paxton is an admitted lawbreaker. He's been investigated by the Texas Rangers, and currently on trial for criminal securities fraud. Now, he faces additional bribery and illegal conduct allegations from his own top aides.
I need you to step up. I see you haven't donated to Texas Democrats this year. You may have been waiting for the right moment to contribute. The most important thing you can do right now is chip in $7 right now:
If you've saved payment info with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Express Donate: $7
Express Donate: $10
Express Donate: $25
Express Donate: $50
Express Donate: $100
Or, donate another amount
Paxton is the co-chair of Lawyers for Trump and most recent prior chair of the national Republican Attorney General's Association. Paxton also leads the Republican lawsuit to repeal the Affordable Care Act in the middle of the biggest pandemic in modern American history.
Texans are tired of Republican corruption and lawlessness that festers under their unchecked power. Indicted Ken Paxton's actions have been criminal, and the consequences are dire for the people of Texas.
Texans deserve new leadership and they are demanding change. To bring change, every Texan must vote Democratic up and down the ballot in November. We're not only in a battle to stop the pandemic and save our state but to save our entire democracy.

Paul Begala,yellowdog@txdemocrats.org,thank you.,"Hi, I'll get right to it.
I've spent my whole career analyzing elections and I'll put this simply: Texas is the biggest battleground state. This election is going to be close.
In 2018, Texas Democrats almost flipped our state. This year, this election could come down to less than a percentage point. That's why I am emailing you today.
The Texas Democratic Party needs your support. Right now, they're hosting their biggest fundraising drive so far this year. Today, they need 1,653 grassroots contributions to hit their goal.
Republicans will use our fundraising to measure the strength of our movement and our ability to turn Texas blue. They would love nothing more than for us to come up short. I know you aren't going to let that happen.
We will crush this goal. I know that together, we will block the Republican path to the White House for generations. Can you rush in a contribution of $7 today to our Turn Texas Blue Fund?

Gilberto Hinojosa,yellowdog@txdemocrats.org,re: before dinner,"Hi,
Trump thinks that he can stop Americans from casting their ballot by defunding the postal service.
Trump thinks he can win this election if fewer people show up to vote. We are 80 days out from the most important election of our lives. Every single vote counts -- including millions of mail ballots.
He isn't ready for our movement.
We will not let him sabotage this election.
We will stop him by sending 815,000 vote-by-mail applications to Texas voters. We are making sure Texans have their applications in hand early so they can send their mail ballot in early.
We will stop Trump if we can send every single one. Right now, we need to raise $14,662 to our Vote-By-Mail Fund before midnight to be able to send the remaining 29,324 Texans a mail ballot application.
That is why I have to ask -- can you make your first contribution of $1 or whatever you can to close this gap?
If you've saved payment info with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
$1 = 2 applications
$25 = 50 applications
$50 = 100 applications
$100 = 200 applications
$250 = 500 applications
Chip in more
We are fighting for every single vote to elect Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and Democrats up and down the ballot. When we flip the White House and turn Texas blue, it'll be because of people like you who fought for justice.
We must protect our democracy.
Adelante,
Gilberto Hinojosa
Chair, Texas Democratic Party
The only way we will take back our state is if we all work together. We need to fund 815,000 vote-by-mail applications by midnight tonight. Can you rush a $7 contribution to fund our vote-by-mail program?
Yes, I'll chip in $7

Manny Garcia,yellowdog@txdemocrats.org,"It's National Voter Registration Day, Texas!","Hi,
Today is National Voter Registration Day, y'all!
That means it's time for you, your friends and family, and every Texas Democrat you know to make sure they are registered at their current address or get registered to vote.
Here's why this is so important. We all know what the past four years have been like, and the damage Trump Republicans have done to our families and communities. We know it won't stop unless we do something about it.
Right now, Texans have the chance to stop Donald Trump and the Republican establishment. We have 38 electoral votes to cast. If Texas chooses Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, there's no way Trump can win. However, it's going to take every single vote.
We need to have people in power who fully represent us, who are listening to us, and the way to make that happen is voting. Check your voter registration right now. You can start the process online at [[URL REDACTED]], it's easy:
1. Visit [[URL REDACTED]] and fill out the online form.
2. Then, we will send you your pre-filled voter registration form, with a prepaid and pre-addressed envelope.
3. All you have to do is sign it and put it in the mail.
Confirm your voter registration status
Then, ask 5 friends to check their voter registration by sharing [[URL REDACTED]] on your social media. Make sure to tag them:
Share on Facebook
Post on Twitter
The voter registration deadline is October 5. Time is running out, so don't wait on this. The change in the system can't come unless we have people in power who care about us. It is on us to get out there and elect them.
Thanks -- now let's get to work,

Hola,
¡Hoy se celebra el Día Nacional de Registro de Votantes!
Por eso, le pido que confirme que esté registrado con su dirección actual lo más pronto posible y que ayude a sus familiares a hacer lo mismo.
Los últimos cuatro años, hemos sufrido demasiadas catástrofes a las manos de Trump y del partido republicano. Tenemos el deber de levantar nuestra voz para exigir un gobierno que le dé prioridad a nuestras familias.
Ahora, tenemos la oportunidad de derrotar a Trump y terminar su presidencia. Texas otorga 38 votos al Colegio Electoral. Si Texas elige a Joe Biden y a Kamala Harris, Trump no puede ganar.
Necesitamos representantes que nos apoyen y que nos escuchen. Si queremos que ganen los Demócratas en todos los niveles del gobierno en noviembre, necesitamos que todos los Demócratas voten. Confirme su registración ahora mismo. Puede iniciar el proceso en línea al [[URL REDACTED]], simplemente:
1. Vaya al [[URL REDACTED]] y llene la forma de registración.
2. Después le enviaremos su forma de registración por correo. Llevará toda su información e incluirá también un sobre de devolución pagado.
3. Firme la forma, póngala en el sobre de devolución, y envíela por correo.
Confirme su registración para votar
Después, comparta [[URL REDACTED]] por sus redes sociales para pedir a 5 amigos que confirmen su registración. No se le olvide etiquetarlos:
Compartir en Facebook
Poner en Twitter
El último día para registrarse es el 5 octubre, así que no espere hasta el último momento. Si queremos un futuro mejor, necesitamos un gobierno que proteja a nuestras familias. Para que esto suceda, todos los Tejanos elegibles tienen que participar en nuestra democracia.
Nos vemos,

Manny Garcia,yellowdog@txdemocrats.org,The campaigns we NEED to win to carry Texas,"Hey --
In a moment, I'll explain why Texas is so ready to turn blue. But first, I'll cut right to the chase.
Can you split a donation between the Texas Democratic Party, MJ Hegar's campaign, and the campaigns of Rep. Colin Allred, Rep. Lizzie Fletcher, and targeted red-to-blue Congressional races across Texas?
If you've saved payment info with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Express Donate: $7
Express Donate: $10
Express Donate: $25
Express Donate: $50
Express Donate: $100
Or, donate another amount
Now, I hope you'll give me a moment to explain why Texas is ready to turn blue. For a long time, we've had the raw population to be a blue stronghold -- but national groups have held back on investing in flipping the state, and Republicans have put countless obstacles in front of our way to obstruct people's ability to have their voice heard at the ballot box.
But we've put in the work -- and over the past several years, we've seen HUGE leaps forward:
In 2016, we became a single-digit state for the first time in two decades.
Then, in 2018, Beto came within three points of unseating Ted Cruz.
Now, in 2020, we're poised to fully flip the state and elect incredible Democrats up and down the ticket. Not only is Joe Biden consistently polling up over Donald Trump: Texas has a U.S. Senate race that's within single digits, and we have more Congressional targets here than any state in the country.
When Democrats compete everywhere, at every level, we win -- and we make big gains. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are pulling Texas up at the top of the ticket, and grassroots supporters like you are powering campaigns down the ticket -- and THAT will be the force that carries Joe and Kamala over the finish line in November, turning Texas blue for the first time in a generation.
But in order to win, we need your help. Your donation today will be split between the Texas Democratic Party and the campaigns we NEED to win to carry the state:
* MJ Hegar, running for U.S. Senate
* Rep. Lizzie Fletcher (TX-07)
* Rep. Colin Allred (TX-32)
* Sima Ladjevardian, running in TX-02
* Wendy Davis, running in TX-21
* Sri Preston Kulkarni, running in TX-22
* Gina Ortiz Jones, running in TX-23
* Candace Valenzuela, running in TX-24
Split a donation between the Texas Democratic Party and these fantastic Democratic candidates today.

Express Donate: $7
Express Donate: $10

Texans are ready for change. With our diverse and growing population, it's up to us to connect with voters and get them all the information they need to show up and vote. Then, we can win.

When Republicans are celebrating a two-point lead in Texas, you know they're in trouble. And they know it, too.
Yesterday, Fox News highlighted a new poll saying, ""Biden's lead in Texas vanishes, now trails Trump by 2 points."" What's remarkable about that is it might be the first time in decades Fox News admitted we're on the verge of taking back Texas.
Even Fox News knows how close this race is. Joe Biden has been neck-and-neck with Donald Trump for months now. Texas is the biggest battleground state. With voting starting in just 35 days, we need to make the most of this.
We can pull back ahead and deliver 38 electoral votes to Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in November. It's going to take every single one of us to do it. Chip in your first $7 to the Texas Democratic Party so our movement can hit our mid-month fundraising deadline:

Subject: we're resilient.
Hi,
Wanted to share a few of my thoughts with you.
We're going to feel the effects of this pandemic for years to come -- and there's going to be so many vulnerable communities who will have to spend years picking up the pieces.
Despite the circumstances, I'm so proud of the way people are coming together para la comunidad. Our Party is founded in hope, in perseverance, in mutual love and respect. I see young people offering to do grocery runs for their at-risk neighbors, making face masks for their friends and loved ones, and connecting virtually in ways I've never seen before.
I believe it is our responsibility to keep doing what we can to build a better, stronger future for our country and the world. We're a resilient community and nothing can replicate the tenderness and empathy we're showing one other.
I'm proud of the work Democrats are doing from the local level to Congress to prevent the coronavirus from getting worse and centers relief efforts on helping workers and families.
Democrats are fighting to secure additional funding for hospitals, testing, PPE, and workers on the frontline. We are working to provide more relief to unemployed workers, small businesses, families, and frontline health care workers, and provide badly needed funding for hospitals. Your Texas Democratic Party is fighting to protect our democracy and make sure voters don't have to choose between their lives and their right to vote.
I know times are hard right now. We must keep marching forward.
Millions of Americans are depending on us.
If we want a world where future generations can thrive after this pandemic, we need to build a better future. No contribution is too small. I'm personally asking, can you make your first $100 contribution of 2020 before our end-of-month fundraising deadline?

Seeing all this makes me hopeful for the future, because younger generations are going to be the ones to carry our sheer force, will, and determination to build a brighter, better future after all of this is over.
Stay safe and well,

Manny Garcia,yellowdog@txdemocrats.org,[BREAKING] Texas Republican House District 28 Candidate Gary Gates is a Credibly-Alleged Child Abuser,"Child abusers are unfit to serve in the Texas Legislature.
\-- Deeply disturbing news from the emergency Texas House District 28 election broke that Republican opponent Gary Gates abused his children.
Court documents stated, ""Gates children had been given throw-up medicine (ipecac) for eating food they should not have eaten, and children were required to skip their next meal if they stole food."" Gates also ""spanked"" his children with ""a belt or board.""
Gary Gates' alleged actions are sickening.
Child abusers are unfit to serve in the Texas Legislature. Period. This goes beyond politics and partisanship. This is a vote about what's right and what's wrong.
There are only three weeks until election day -- and early voting starts January 21 -- in Texas House District 28. We need leaders we can trust, who will protect all of us -- our children, parents, grandparents, everyone.
We must keep this child abuser out of our Texas Legislature. Can we count on you to stop him?

Wow, this week was nothing short of extraordinary.
I was already a bleeding heart liberal, but this week's speakers and panelists echoed everything our party works towards and more. They are fighting for the same values the Texas Democratic Party holds so near and dear. This week has truly inspired me to make sure I'm doing everything I can for my community -- that includes you.
And I know that our senatorial candidates are doing whatever they can to fight for you, too. Tonight we're going to be streaming our U.S. Senate Debate with MJ Hegar and Royce West. I'm just as excited as you are to watch my future senator because I believe in a world where my elected official will fight for a fair shot for all. After all, that's why I'm a Texas Democrat.
That's why I'm reaching out to you today, . We need all hands on deck right now. Biden is tied with Trump right now in Texas, and we need you to get us over the finish line in November. Raise your hand to volunteer with us today -- from phonebanking to texting, no task is too small:

Cliff Walker,yellowdog@txdemocrats.org,hey do you have a minute?,"Hi,
Wanted to drop you a note about a few things that have been on my mind since I left my polling place this weekend.
I was proud to play my small but monumental part in creating a better Texas -- for my friends, my neighbors, my state, and myself. We all have a part to play in this election.
I cannot thank you enough for being a part of our movement.  I know we can beat them and take back our state, because we are building a powerful movement and we are building it together.
While we're organizing, Republicans are plotting to stop us and they're getting millions from their wealthy insider donors. If we want to take back our state and change our country, we're going to need to build the biggest organizing program this state has ever seen. I know this team is up for the challenge.
So with about a week to go until Election Day, I need to ask:
We need to raise $75,000 before our critical end-of-month deadline, our last deadline before Election Day. Can you rush your first $7 contribution of the year before our end-of-month deadline?

Gilberto Hinojosa & Dr. Carla Brailey,yellowdog@txdemocrats.org,"Today, Trump announced he will try to push through the nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to the U.S. Supreme Court.","Hi,
Healthcare is on the ballot in November.
Today, Trump announced he will try to push through the nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to the U.S. Supreme Court. Despite overwhelming public support for voters to have a say in the next Supreme Court justice, Donald Trump blew through precedent, the so-called 'McConnell Rule' and Ruth Bader Ginsburg's own dying wish to see the next president select her replacement.
If Trump is successful, healthcare will be dismantled for millions of Texans while millions more will lose protections for pre-existing conditions in the middle of the deadliest pandemic in United States history. This is dead wrong.
Donald Trump is losing. He knows he is losing. Mitch McConnell knows they are losing. So they are doing anything they can to cling to power. The people should choose the next Supreme Court justice, not Donald Trump and his Senate lapdogs like John Cornyn and Ted Cruz.
We must elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to ensure that the rights and livelihoods of so many are protected. We must organize, fight, and win -- block by block, neighborhood by neighborhood.
From healthcare to reproductive rights to voting rights to immigrant rights to so many other items that affect our everyday lives, 2020 is the most consequential election of our lifetime. Can you chip in your first $7 of 2020 to keep Judge Barrett away from Washington and make sure the next Supreme Court Justice is named by Joe Biden:

Or, donate another amount
In the meantime, we must urge the Senate not to confirm Trump's tainted selection. Four years ago, John Cornyn and Ted Cruz both adamantly stated that a Supreme Court nominee should not be selected during a presidential election year. If they go back on their word and rush through a nominee, we must fight them at every single turn.
We must hold these elected officials accountable, and in Trump and Cornyn's case, make this nomination hurt at the ballot box.
It's time for a Supreme Court that does not represent the minority party's views. It's time for a Supreme Court that upholds the law and ensures that millions of Americans have the rights' they are guaranteed in our Constitution.
Now is not the time to give up. Now is the time to keep going:

Hi,
The right to vote is the foundation of our democracy, and we must do everything we can to protect and expand that right, instead of bringing our democratic process to a halt.
We have had conversations with election administrators, local county officials, state legislators, and Texas Republicans because protecting our democracy is incredibly important. Conversations with Texas Republicans fell apart last night because Republicans have no plan.
Republicans would rather stall and hope things just go back to normal -- which is not a plan.
The lawsuit we just filed will protect access to vote by mail for any person who does not want to risk their health or their family's health during the coronavirus pandemic. No Texan should have to worry about risking their health in order to exercise their right to vote.
We must do everything we can to guarantee access to the ballot box for individuals who are practicing social distancing and self-quarantining. Current law says you can vote-by-mail if you are disabled and we believe COVID-19 puts the health of all of us at risk.
We must act before it's too late.
Adelante,

This year, Texas Democrats came together like never before. I'm deeply thankful for your support. Whether you were one of the more than 7,000 people who chipped in to power this movement or attended one of the more than 6,000 events Democrats hosted or both, Texas is the biggest battleground state because of you.
Next year, we will continue fighting, day in and day out, to turn Texas blue. How are we going to win next year? You guessed it -- we're going to keep building the biggest organizing program in Texas history.
###  Protecting & Expanding the Vote
More than 2 million Texans are expected to register to vote for the first time in 2020. We're launching our year-round voter protection hotline with a team who will be ready to answer any voter's questions. We are in court to reverse the Republican ban on mobile voting. We aren't done yet, we have big voting rights news to announce soon.
###  Organizing Every Community
We're going to have 1,000 field organizers and canvassers on the ground in 2020. We've hired new staff to engage every part of our Democratic coalition -- including our AAPI, African-American, Latinx, LGBTQ, and Disability communities and narrowing the gap in our rural communities. We must and we will knock, dial, text, and connect digitally with every community in Texas. (We're hiring! Check it out.)
###  Training Activists & Campaign Staff
We have a full-time training director and training team. Our Staff the Movement program has already trained 57 campaign staff and we're expecting to train another 60+ campaign staffers to work on campaigns here in Texas. Our online learning platform has already served thousands of activists and will serve thousands more. Plus, in-person trainings to support everyone.
We have a plan to win. We need to reach our fundraising goals before our midnight deadline tonight to keep our plan on track. Can I count on you to activate your 2020 Texas Democrats membership right now?

Hi,
Today, our vote-by-mail lawsuit goes in front of the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals. We're in court right now fighting to expand vote-by-mail so that every Texas voter can cast their ballot safely.
If we win, every Texas voter -- regardless of age -- will have the option to cast their ballot by mail. That's why I'm asking for your help today.
Right now, we are in court to protect voting rights. If you agree every voter should be able to vote by mail, can you rush your first $7 of 2020 or whatever you can today to our voter protection fund?

Voting is a fundamental right. It's what makes us a democracy. Every eligible voter should be able to cast their ballot freely, fairly -- and safely. During this pandemic, that means having the option to vote by mail. But right now, Texas Republicans are clamping down on vote-by-mail and asking us to make a heartbreaking choice: risk our health to exercise that right or sit this election out.
We are fighting tooth and nail, and we need your help to take this fight as far as we must.
Trump Republicans know when we come out to vote, we will vote them out. So they're using every dirty trick in the book to keep us away from the ballot box. They have failed at every step to protect our families, and this is one more way they are selling us out because it's the only way they can stay in power.
Texas Democrats will not stop protecting our right to vote. Can we count on you to chip in $7?

First: Thank you. Because of your hard work, we've hit every voter expansion goal we've set -- from sending out almost a million vote-by-mail applications last month to reaching out to 1.2 million unregistered Texans in just one week. We are registering record numbers of voters and we are going to win because of your unwavering support.
Second: the work is not done yet. The voter registration deadline is just three weeks away -- that's only three weeks to register every single Texas Democrat we can and drive up our numbers so we flip Texas blue.
There's no do-overs with this one. After October 5, we won't be able to register more Texans. So I'm asking for your help today while there's still time.
We've got $8,276 to go to meet our mid-month fundraising deadline tonight. Can you rush your first $7 to the Texas Democratic Party for our voter registration fund today?

George Takei,yellowdog@txdemocrats.org,Game Over,"Hi,
In these troubled times, we could all use a big dose of hope. So picture this: Imagine a prize so big we would lock in the White House not just for a term, but for a generation.
Texas is that prize. When we Democrats win its 38 Electoral College votes, it's game over.
And we will win.
I've been following politics for over sixty years, and what I see happening in Texas is monumental. The population is getting younger and more diverse. Texans are demanding leaders who act in the interest of the people. And the polls are tight. Texas is within reach not later, but now. A win there would end Trump, and the complicit GOP.
Texas Democrats are fighting every single day to elect leaders who will serve the people of Texas, mobilize their communities, and bring people together. And they need your support.
This week, as a part of the Texas Democratic Convention, Texas Democrats are spearheading their biggest fundraising effort to date, all with the goal of turning Texas blue and changing the course of history. In order to reach their goal, they need 5,138 more donors today!
Can you help them meet their goal by making a contribution, right now, to support their Turn Texas Blue Fund?

Hi,
I've got an announcement the size of Texas, but first I want to introduce myself.
My name is Rose Clouston, and I am the new Voter Protection Director at the Texas Democratic Party. I have spent my career expanding voters' access to the ballot box and in 2020, I wanted nothing more than to dedicate myself to protecting voters in the biggest battleground state.
With that said, I wanted to be the first to tell you:
In partnership with Stacey Abrams' Fair Fight, Texas Democrats have launched the most expansive voter protection initiative in Texas history.
We are going to make it easier for folks to vote. Our program includes:
* A full-time voter protection team,
* A year-round voter assistance hotline where voters can get the information they need to register and vote (our dedicated team can be reached at 844-TX-VOTES),
* [[URL REDACTED]] our online voter information hub where voters can learn more about voter registration, voter participation, or voter protection,
* A voter protection council made up of hundreds of Democratic volunteers devoted to voter protection efforts,
* A poll-watching program, and more.
We're fighting for you because every eligible voter in Texas has the right to participate in our democracy. Now, I have to ask: Can you spread the word on social media?

Gilberto Hinojosa,yellowdog@txdemocrats.org,So much is on the line right now. Thank you for everything you're doing.,"Hi,
Wow, we just had an incredible month here at the Texas Democratic Party, and I wanted to take a minute to say thank you.
So much is on the line right now. We are ratcheting up our efforts every single day -- fighting tooth and nail to flip Texas and defeat Donald Trump.
This month was a glimpse of just how far we can go when we work hard. In August, we blew past every ambitious goal we set. That's squarely thanks to you.
Here are just a few things our movement accomplished last month:
* We contacted more than 3.5 million voters, bringing voters on board and moving us that much closer to tipping the balance.
* We mailed more than 818,000 vote-by-mail applications and more than 250,000 voter registration applications.
* We launched a massive push to register 1 million new voters \-- the biggest voter registration effort in Texas Democratic Party history.
* We reached every grassroots fundraising goal we set, powering our ground game on every front.
That's a whole lot of work by dedicated folks like you, and it's paying off. More and more outlets -- including 538, The Economist and NBC -- list Texas as a ""toss-up."" It's clear that Texas Republicans are running scared.
But don't get me wrong -- the work doesn't stop here. This election is life-or-death. With razor-thin margins, Election Day is 62 days away. If we get this right these next two months, we will flip Texas. I'm asking you to stay focused, stay the course, and keep contributing however you can -- whether it's chipping in a donation or signing up for that next phonebanking shift.
I am fired up for these next two months, and I'm looking forward to seeing you out there with us in the fight.
Adelante,

Gilberto Hinojosa,yellowdog@txdemocrats.org,another legal update:,"Hi,
Here is the list of people making you choose between your right to vote and your health during the middle of this pandemic:
Nathan L. Hecht (Up for re-election in 2020)
Paul W. Green (Up for reelection in 2022)
Eva Guzman (Up for reelection in in 2022)
Debra Lehrmann (Up for reelection in 2022)
Jeffrey S. Boyd (Up for reelection in 2020)
John Phillip Devine (Up for reelection in 2024)
Jimmy Blacklock (Up for reelection in 2024)
Brett Busby (Up for reelection in 2020)
Jane Bland (Up for reelection in 2020)
Leave it to the all-Republican Texas Supreme Court to put out 45 pages of opinion and give no guidance to voters about who can vote by mail during a pandemic -- even after one of the Texas Supreme Court justices under the age of 65 contracted coronavirus last week.
This is reflective of Texas Republican leadership that long ago failed to serve Texans' needs and interests. Karl Rove just announced that he's going to gather billionaire and special interest money to defend the all-Republican Texas Supreme Court in this election. He knows what we know -- this election is going to come down to the wire.
Though yesterday's ruling wasn't what we were hoping for, we've never been the Party that gives up. We're going to keep fighting until every eligible Texan can vote safely. We will take this all the way to the [United States] Supreme Court, if necessary.
Protecting the right to vote is our responsibility. To turn Texas blue in 2020, Texas Democrats are committed to making sure Texas voters have access to the ballot box, even during a public health crisis. That's why despite all this, we still need you in this movement with us.
If Ken Paxton thinks that this ruling will slow us down, he's got another thing coming. We need your continued support of our Voting Rights Litigation Fund to keep going. Can you make a $7 contribution right now?

This week has been amazing.
As we watch the Democratic National Convention and listen to the incredible women leading our party today, I could not be more thrilled that we finally have a Black and Indian American woman at the top of the ticket. I hope you are as inspired as I am by Kamala Harris.
We will elect Kamala Harris as not only our first woman Vice President but also the first woman of color.
Women are the backbone of the Democratic Party, and we have carried our entire nation forward. It's long past time to see ourselves represented in our country's highest office, and when Kamala Harris shatters that glass ceiling, it's going to be felt in the lives of women everywhere.
Kamala Harris will fight for us -- alongside the many incredible Democratic women on the ballot this fall. They need us by their side. I'm all in for Kamala. That's why I'm asking, can you rush your first $7 contribution of 2020 right now to elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris?

Subject: re: estimated 2,600,000 unregistered Democratic voters
Hi,
You know Texas is the biggest battleground state. A question that I get a lot as your Texas Democratic Party Data Director is, ""how are we going to turn our state blue?""
The rapidly emerging Democratic coalition in Texas has set the stage for historic Democratic gains at the ballot box. We know we must register and engage a new electorate that is more progressive and represents the diversity of our great state.
That's why I am excited to share our voter registration plan with you today.
Texas Democrats' Voter Registration Plan
Your Texas Democratic Party is focused on registering the estimated 2,600,000 unregistered Texans who are likely to vote Democratic. Here's how we are going to do it:
* Mail hundreds of thousands of voter registration applications to unregistered voters across the state,
* Deploy 1,000 field organizers and canvassers on the ground, Launch a year-round voter assistance hotline,
* Build machine-learning-based models to quickly identify and mobilize new Democratic voters,
* Hire dedicated staff to engage every part of our Democratic coalition -- including our AAPI, African-American, Latinx, LGBTQ+, youth, and Disability communities,
* And narrow the gap in rural committees.
I've run the numbers. I know we can take back our state. Now, we need you to make an investment in our voter registration program.
We're kicking off our first voter registration mailing, similar to our vote by mail program, and we must raise $10,000 by the end of this week to send the first of many voter registration card mailings. So, can I count on you to chip in $7 so we can mail 14 Texans a voter registration card?
If you've saved payment info with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
$7 = 14 registration cards
$25 = 50 registration cards
$50 = 100 registration cards
$100 = 200 registration cards
$250 = 500 registration cards
Chip in more
I am so proud of everything we've done to mobilize Democratic voters.  I cannot thank you enough for everything you've done to power our movement. I hope you'll make your first donation to the Texas Democratic Party so your name on our voter registration investors list.
Best,
Lauren Pully

Cliff Walker,yellowdog@txdemocrats.org,This is how we do it,"Hi,
Every once in a while, we get the chance to make some history. Regular Texans like you and me. And right now, in Texas, that opportunity is banging down each and every one of our doors.
Millions of us have waited for four excruciatingly long years to cast our ballot. Now, the time has finally come to cast a history-making vote. And not just for me. I'm voting so that I can look my nieces and nephews in the eye and tell them I did everything I could to change their future. So that years down the road, they will live in a world full of promise and compassion and justice and hope -- a world that all of us, together, managed to save.
The stakes are that high. And now, it's in our hands.
If we win Texas, we will not only save our country, but make history as the state that singlehandedly blocked Trump's reelection. All the signs are showing we can win this. However, it is going to take EVERY SINGLE VOTE. We will not have a single vote to spare. Every eligible Democratic voter must do whatever it takes to cast the ballot to which they are rightfully entitled.
Make your plan to vote or share voting info with your friends and family today -- make sure to tag them:

If you've already voted, the absolute most important thing you can do is get the folks in your life to go vote, too. And get them to go vote now. It's just a couple of votes, you might think -- but when all of us do it, we will build a tidal wave and sweep this election.
This is how we win this -- we have to leave everything on the battlefield come Nov. 3.
In the fight,

Hi,
More than 191,000 Americans have died from the coronavirus, including nearly 14,000 Texans. Another 6.3 million Americans have contracted COVID-19. Right now, it is estimated that 18 million Americans are unemployed, including 3.4 million Texans who have filed for unemployment since March.
Today, as failed Texas Republican Governor Greg Abbott is set to host a press conference attempting to distract away from his failed coronavirus response, the Texas Democratic Party is calling on Governor Abbott, John Cornyn, and Republicans across Texas to sign the Texas First Pledge.
This is what the Texas First Pledge says:
Texas First Pledge
The Texas First Pledge to put an end to the political bullshit and put Texans first:
* I'll defend the millions of Texans with pre-existing conditions and condemn the lawsuit that would rip health care away during a pandemic.
* I'll defend our public health by following the recommendations of medical experts and scientists when it comes to responding to the COVID-19 pandemic.
* I'll defend regular Texans' ability to recover from the pandemic by focusing relief on small businesses and supporting expanded unemployment relief.
* I'll defend Texas children's right to a safe, quality education.
* I'll defend the brave Americans who served in our armed forces by condemning anyone who calls them ""suckers"" and ""losers"".
* I'll defend the safety and security of our communities by condemning those who spread racism, violence, and fear.
If you are fed up with bootlicker politicians and ready for leaders who dare to fight for our Texas values, we need you to demand Greg Abbott, John Cornyn, and Republicans sign the Texas First pledge:

Dr. Carla D. Brailey,yellowdog@txdemocrats.org,We are rising up,"Hi,
We're really doing this. Four days from now, Texas is going to be blue. And because of that, today, we're getting a visit from none other than Senator Kamala Harris herself.
I could not be more thrilled that Kamala Harris is in Texas today. Black women are the backbone of the Democratic Party and it means everything to have an incredible Black woman at the top of the ticket. It means even more that she's here in Texas, at the eleventh hour -- because she knows how much our state matters and how close we are to flipping Texas and saving our country.
Kamala Harris is in town because she and Joe Biden see what we do: that Texas is literally inches away from turning blue. It's been thirty years since a Democratic vice presidential candidate came to Texas this late in the game. However, this should not be a surprise to a single one of us, because we have felt in our core just how powerful our movement is at this moment.
The energy in our community right now is truly something else. These last three weeks, Texans SMASHED records to go out and vote -- we are that fired up to save our country and send Joe Biden and Kamala Harris into the White House! We are wringing the work out of ourselves and we are seeing the results. The whole country is watching Texas and we are rising up. We are saying ""enough"" to the harm Trump Republicans have caused. We are stepping forward to reclaim our future.
This is the absolute final stretch. Today is the LAST day of Texas early voting -- and after that, we've got one last shot to rake in every last vote we possibly can on Election Day. This is it. And we need your help.
Together, we're going to carry this campaign across the finish line. I'm asking for your help right now to win this election -- for our families, our communities, and all of us. Rush $7 before our midnight end-of-month fundraising deadline; every dollar will help tip the scales:

We unveiled [[URL REDACTED]], our new and expansive online platform to help Texans register to vote from the safety of their homes during the time of the coronavirus.
[[URL REDACTED]] provides an innovative voter registration form that users can fill out online. We then send every voter that completes the form at [[URL REDACTED]] a filled out application with a postage-paid envelope pre-addressed to the voter's county voter registrar.
All the voter has to do is sign the pre-filled application and then put it in the mail.
Our platform allows voters the opportunity to register to vote without having to risk their health in the time of a pandemic.
Are you registered to vote? Use our simple tool to confirm, update, and register to vote today:
Register to vote
[[URL REDACTED]] is just one facet of our path to victory, which takes into account the more than 2 million unregistered likely-Democratic voters. The goal for our combined registration efforts is to support registration for upwards of 1 million new voters.

Manny Garcia,yellowdog@txdemocrats.org,"re: 2,600,000","Hey --
We're doing some big things right now, and we're barely 15 days into the new year! There are about 2,600,000 unregistered voters in Texas who are likely to vote Democratic if registered. That's why we're launching a voter registration program unlike any other in Texas history by:
* Investing in cutting-edge data programs to turn out new voters,
* Deploying 1,000 field organizers and canvassers on the ground to register voters in person,
* Adopting a digital approach to voter registration through our online hub, [[URL REDACTED]]
* Mailing hundreds of thousands of voter registration cards,
* And so much more!
We're so close to hitting our first Voter Registration Fund goal of $10,000. We know Republicans are watching everything we do. They're freaked out because we have a plan and a path to win.
Now, I need you to make a $7 contribution so we can send 14 Texans a voter registration card. We're only $3,211 away from our goal. Can I count on your support?
If you've saved payment info with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
$7 = 14 registration cards
$25 = 50 registration cards
$50 = 100 registration cards
$100 = 200 registration cards

Together, we made Texas the biggest battleground state and we aren't done yet. Let's show our strength as Democrats and hit this voter registration goal.

Kamala Harris,yellowdog@txdemocrats.org,keep up the fight,"Hi,
This administration's corruption was clear long before Donald Trump even set foot in the Oval Office. But nothing has underscored his inability to lead quite like this administration's response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
People are out of work, hungry, suffering and dying. The United States has more than 4.2 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 and more than 150,000 people have died. The situation is dire and is getting worse -- but it didn't have to be this way. The truth is, one man is responsible: President Donald Trump.
More and more polls show that we have a real shot at ending our national nightmare in November -- to get Trump out of office and elect Joe Biden. We also have a real shot at flipping the biggest battleground state in the country: Texas.
That's why I'm asking you to join me in supporting the Texas Democratic Party today. If we turn Texas blue, we can guarantee we've blocked Donald Trump's path back to the White House.
Rush your first $7 donation of 2020 right now to help block Trump's path to the White House and turn Texas blue.

Thanks to the hard work of thousands of grassroots activists, Texas has been trending more and more blue with each election -- and now, Donald Trump and Joe Biden are neck-and-neck in the Lone Star State.
But let me be clear: winning in November isn't just about electing Joe Biden. We must elect Democrats up and down the ballot who will fight on behalf of working people.
If we flip Texas, we have a real shot at sending MJ Hegar to work alongside me in the Senate; expanding the Texas Democratic delegation in Congress; flipping the Texas House; and electing more Democrats down the ticket. The impact of these victories would be felt for years.
The Texas Democratic Party has a plan to win in November, and I'm proud to support their efforts. Help turn Texas blue by adding your first $7 donation of 2020 today.

Hey,
Did you ever want to go backstage at Seinfeld and meet the cast and the writers and see what was really going on?
Well, you can't because the show's been over for a very long time.
But you can join Jason Alexander, Larry David, myself, and special guests as we talk about the show about nothing, and hang out and shoot the shit all in an effort to turn Texas blue tomorrow.
It's hosted by Seth Meyers. So that's something. I love Seth Meyers. I'd tune in for that. Tell you the truth.
We call it our Fundraiser About Something. And when you donate, you'll get to see and hear us yakking away. You'll also be chipping in to flip the presidency, the Senate, and to protect Texas from gerrymandering for the next decade. So yeah, that's something all right.

Brittany Switzer,yellowdog@txdemocrats.org,re: real quick,"Hey -- real quick:
Our first quarterly fundraising deadline of 2020 is tomorrow. I know these are challenging and uncertain times. The coronavirus has completely changed everything.
I know our work must continue because Republicans' response to the coronavirus has been disorganized and chaotic. Their lack of leadership is hurting people. We must vote Trump and Cornyn out in November. That is clear.
Part of how we're going to do that is by registering 2.6 million new voters. I need your help to keep our voter expansion program running. I'm worried we won't hit our March Voter Registration Fund goal. For every $1 you are able to donate, we can send 2 Texans a voter registration card.
We might not be able to knock doors or hold in-person events right now. We can still mail Texans a voter registration card and follow up with them over the phone about registering to vote.
If we're going to elect leaders who fight for healthcare, paid sick leave, and lower prescription drug costs, we need to hit this voter registration goal. Any amount you are able to give will make a huge impact.
That's why I'm asking, can you rush a $7 contribution so we can mail 14 Texans a voter registration card?
If you've saved payment info with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
$7 = 14 registration cards
$25 = 50 registration cards
$50 = 100 registration cards

Cliff Walker,yellowdog@txdemocrats.org,all the more important,"Hi, I'm going to ask you to chip in to our March Voter Registration Fund but first I wanted to share my thoughts with you.
To state the obvious, the world as we know it has changed a bunch in the past few weeks. Just a few weeks ago, we were hiring up for the biggest organizing program in Texas Democratic Party history.
We had made our first round of organizing hires, and were prepared to start knocking doors to register voters. Now, like many of you, our team is sheltering at home to protect ourselves, the people we care about, and countless others we don't know who will suffer if we don't flatten the curve.
But just because we can't organize the way we planned doesn't mean we're powerless.
One morning ritual that motivates me for the day is reading and reciting the quote by John Wesley:
""Do all the good you can, by all the means you can, in all the ways you can, in all the places you can, at all the times you can, to all the people you can, as long as ever you can.""
Right now, there are countless people out there who are scared, anxious for what the future holds for them and their families, and unsure that they'll have the resources they'll need to get by. They're the reason why doing nothing is not an option.
We have had to get creative and adapt. And we've adjusted our organizing plans to offer something desperately needed by not just our voters and activists right now, but every person on the planet: community.
As the Party mobilized after Hurricanes Harvey, Katrina and Rita to provide services to Texans, we're shifting our whole organizing effort to strengthen the social fabric of our communities and better help folks access information and resources, even while keeping a physical distance.
That led us to create and launch  ConnectTexas, an online hub connecting folks who want to be part of something bigger, a diverse community of regular people sharing ideas and taking the actions we can to support each other as we forge through this moment. By leading with empathy, helping people connect, and getting creative about supporting folks however we can, we're going to build a community from neighborhood to neighborhood.
Finally, I want to say that we are not, must not, will not lose sight of what we need to get done in November. If anything, it's become painfully clear how important it is that we flip the Texas House and hold Greg Abbott accountable for his negligence, that we kick John Cornyn's ass out of office, that beat Donald Trump so decisively that neither we nor our children ever have to go through this kind of avoidable horror ever again.
Flipping Texas is going to take registering more voters, and one of our best strategies is still effective right now: registering voters by mail. Actually, getting people registered while we should be staying home and taking care of ourselves has made our registration by mail program all the more important.
We know that in order to make a change and put in place leadership that is better prepared to deal with public health threats like this one, we must engage, support, and register a new electorate that reflects our progressive values and represents the diversity of our great state.
Our collective success depends on you. If you're able, help us keep on track and meet our March Voter Registration Fund goal by giving what you can.
Can you send a $7 contribution so we can mail 14 Texans a voter registration card?

Express Donate: $7
Express Donate: $10
Express Donate: $25

If there's a silver lining in this big, dark, grey cloud, it's that more folks are realizing that we're truly all in this together. If there was ever an all-hands-on-deck moment during our lives, it's right now. We're going to ask you more than we ever have. Not just to chip in what you can -- but to give your time, and to do what you can to take care of yourself and help others in our community.
I know we're going to come out of this moment stronger. What gives me hope is that I know you're in this fight with me.
Hopefully,

Rose Clouston,yellowdog@txdemocrats.org,want to introduce myself,"Texas Democrats have launched the most expansive voter protection initiative in Texas history.
Hi,
I've got an announcement the size of Texas, but first I want to introduce myself.
My name is Rose Clouston, and I am the new Voter Protection Director at the Texas Democratic Party. I have spent my career expanding voters' access to the ballot box and in 2020, I wanted nothing more than to dedicate myself to protecting voters in the biggest battleground state.
With that said, I wanted to be the first to tell you:
In partnership with Stacey Abrams' Fair Fight Action, Texas Democrats have launched the most expansive voter protection initiative in Texas history.
We are going to make it easier for folks to vote. Our program includes:
* A full-time voter protection team,
* A year-round voter assistance hotline where voters can get the information they need to register and vote (our dedicated team can be reached at 844-TX-VOTES),
* [[URL REDACTED]] our online voter information hub where voters can learn more about voter registration, voter participation, or voter protection,
* A voter protection council made up of hundreds of Democratic volunteers devoted to voter protection efforts,
* A poll-watching program, and more.
We're fighting for you because every eligible voter in Texas has the right to participate in our democracy. Now, I have to ask: Can you spread the word on social media?

Texas Democrats are fighting to make sure this next election -- the most important in our lifetime -- is free, fair, and accessible. This is the fight of our generation.

Subject: re: razor's edge
Hi,
Another new poll came out this weekend showing Democrats on the razor's edge of flipping Texas. Key takeaways from the Dallas Morning News poll include:
* Biden and Trump tied in the state of Texas (43-43).
* Biden leading among independents in Texas by 15 points (43-28).
* Texans support the ability to vote-by-mail by a resounding 58-23 split, including more Republicans supporting this common-sense measure than opposing.
* John Cornyn earning at-most 37% of the vote (abysmal for an incumbent whose been in Washington the past twenty years)
* Texas Democrats holding a lead over Texas Republicans in the battle for the state House.
Across the state of Texas, Texans are demanding change. They understand that Texas Democrats are fighting to keep our families safe, increase access to healthcare, provide responsible leadership in this time of crisis, and create an economic plan that looks out for working Texans.
Texans are looking for leaders like Joe Biden who will fight for their fair shot to get ahead.
We will win the White House, take out John Cornyn, flip several competitive Congressional seats, break the supermajority in the Texas Senate, take back the Texas House, and win hundreds of local elections across the state of Texas. Our time is now.
Our time is now. We must keep our momentum going. That's why I need you to rush your first $7 contribution of 2020 to our rapid response fund today:

Last night, Joe Biden officially accepted the Democratic nomination to become the next president of the United States.
In just a moment, I'm going to tell you why this means so much personally to me. First, I have to ask: can you chip in $7 or whatever you can so we can deliver our 38 electoral votes to Joe Biden and Kamala Harris?

As a proud Texas Democrat, I could not be more thrilled or more ready. Out of the crisis we are living in as a nation, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are the leaders we need to bring us together and help us build back better.
For too many of our friends, neighbors, and children, the 'American Dream' our parents and our grandparents fought so hard for is no longer within reach. That's because Trump's Republican Party doesn't care about governing or about our families. They only care about power. Enough is enough. Together, Democrats are going to put an end to this horrific chapter in American history.
As Joe Biden said last night, ""America's history tells us that it has been in our darkest moments that we've made our greatest progress. That we've found the light. And in this dark moment, I believe we are poised to make great progress again. That we can find the light once more.""
Democrats fight for a fair shot because we believe that the United States can still be the land of opportunity that gave hope to so many of our ancestors. Led by Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and every single one of us in our Democratic community, I know that we will get there again, because we will never stop fighting until we do.
As this historic Convention comes to a close, now is the time to come together and put everything we've got into sending Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to the White House. Can you rush your first $7 of 2020 to help elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris as our next president and vice president?

We have 19 days left to win this election. That's nothing. That's a blip.
The urgency this year is not on November 3, or the weekend before -- it's right this second. More than a million Texans have already voted. We are fighting RIGHT NOW to get every last Texas Democrat out to vote.
If we succeed, we win this election. It's that simple. And the way we make it happen is every single one of us fighting -- like our lives are on the line -- to get Texans to the polls.
We have the plan, but we need your support to execute it. We need to raise $6,472 by MIDNIGHT. Rush $7 to our Get Out The Vote Fund today:

Gilberto Hinojosa,yellowdog@txdemocrats.org,a dark day for our democracy,"Hi --
Today is a dark day for our democracy.
The evidence was overwhelming and irrefutable. Trump betrayed our democracy, our national security, and our entire country. No party, no president, no member of Congress is above the law. The House was right to impeach Trump.
It is the solemn duty of the Senate to seek justice, deliver a full and fair trial, and uphold the Constitution. We watched as Republicans, led by Mitch McConnell and John Cornyn, acquitted this corrupt president and administration.
Let's be clear: Donald Trump abused the power of the presidency, and John Cornyn actively worked to cover up the president's corruption.
We must defeat Donald Trump and John Cornyn. Trump cannot win the White House without Texas. We cannot win Texas without you. So, I'm asking:
Can you rush a $7 contribution to your Party right now so we can defeat Trump and Cornyn?

Today's victory for DREAMers is a victory for us all. DREAMers are our doctors, nurses, brothers, sisters, fathers, mothers, neighbors, and members of the military. The U.S. Supreme Court reiterated that DREAMers are here to stay.
Our diversity is America's greatest strength. Our DREAMers have always deserved the same protections as anybody else and now they will get the protections they deserve. We applaud the Supreme Court for making the right decision. The United States is a nation built by immigrants. DREAMers embody American values and contribute to the strength and resilience of the United States every single day.
Now, we must elect Joe Biden, a Democratic United States Senate, and expand our Democratic House majority. DREAMers deserve their right to remain in America codified into law. Sign up to volunteer right now so we win in November:

Pete Buttigieg,yellowdog@txdemocrats.org,"We can end this era of chaos, cruelty and division","Friends,
In these final weeks before the election, we must do everything we can to defeat Donald Trump -- but that's not where our work stops. It's imperative that we lift up and elect Democrats down the ballot, from the U.S. Senate to the school board.
That's why I'm reaching out today to ask you to please make a contribution to the Texas Democratic Party. Texas is the biggest battleground state in the country. If the state flips in November, we will effectively block Trump's path to the White House -- and we'll elect strong, progressive leaders up and down the ballot.
Please add a donation of $7 to the Texas Democratic Party today to help deliver the Lone Star State for Joe Biden and elect Democrats up and down the ticket.

It is imperative that we elect a new president, and I'm confident that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will provide the leadership we need on the most important issues affecting my generation -- including our country's gun violence epidemic and the existential threat of climate change.
But we can't treat the presidency like it's the only office that matters. We must win local elections, too, and elect candidates who are proposing meaningful, bold policies that will help working families get ahead.
Texas is prime for flipping down-ballot seats. Texas congressional races have been named 'ground zero' for 2020 -- and Texas Democrats are only 9 seats away from flipping the Texas House.
This is our opportunity to build something larger than ourselves, and I hope you'll join me. If you can, please contribute $7 to help the Texas Democratic Party elect strong progressive leaders up and down the ballot.

Texas Democrats' Voter Registration Plan
Your Texas Democratic Party is focused on registering the estimated 2,600,000 unregistered Texans who are likely to vote Democratic. Here's how we are going to do it:
* Mail hundreds of thousands of voter registration applications to unregistered voters across the state,
* Deploy 1,000 field organizers and canvassers on the ground, Launch a year-round voter assistance hotline,
* Build machine-learning-based models to quickly identify and mobilize new Democratic voters,
* Hire dedicated staff to engage every part of our Democratic coalition -- including our AAPI, African-American, Latinx, LGBTQ+, youth, and Disability communities,
* And narrow the gap in rural committees.

Gilberto Hinojosa,yellowdog@txdemocrats.org,it's been one year since the shooting in El Paso,"One year ago today, tragedy struck our beloved El Paso community when a white supremacist terrorist armed with guns and ammunition stepped foot into a Wal-Mart and tragically ended 22 innocent lives. The shooter posted a manifesto shortly before committing the massacre in which he cited a 'Hispanic invasion,' using rhetoric often spouted by Republicans, like Donald Trump, Greg Abbott, and Dan Patrick, to justify his hateful act.
It's been one year since the shooting in El Paso and nearly one year since the tragedy in Midland-Odessa, and Texas Republicans remain no closer to taking measurable steps to ensure the lives of our families, friends, and neighbors are not lost to gun violence. Hate, racism, and xenophobia still remain entrenched in the Republican Party that we see today and Republicans continue to stall any legislation that would end gun violence or white supremacist hate.
Much like we saw with the murder of George Floyd, white supremacy has plagued American society throughout our country's history. Despite the legal milestones that have furthered racial equality, white supremacy is instilled in our institutions and many of our Republican elected officials, through their endless rhetoric inspire white supremacists day in and day out.
It's time to prioritize the safety of the people of our great state and confront the gun violence atrocities our communities have suffered. Everyone in our state should have the right to live a life free from gun violence and racial hatred. Republicans have demonstrated time and time again that they care more about the NRA than the lives of the people they were elected to protect.
We will elect Joe Biden as President and Democratic leaders across the state who will end gun violence and stop white supremacist violence once and for all. To do that, we need you to check your voter registration right now:
register to vote
Thoughts and prayers aren't enough. Everyone in our state has the right to live a life free from gun violence and racial hatred. Let's make that future a reality.

Brittany Switzer,yellowdog@txdemocrats.org,re: stories,"Hey -- Every single day, Texans are sharing their stories about how coronavirus is affecting their day-to-day.
Amplifying our voices is how we feel heard, and it's how we hold Republicans accountable for their mismanaged response to the pandemic. While most are hard to read, it's important that we read them because it's how we stay connected to our community.
Stories like Ann, who was laid off right before the pandemic swept the nation:
""The impact is economic. I was laid off shortly before the pandemic. My two young adult daughters are struggling even more. One is a private cello teacher that works hourly through public schools that are now shut down. The other runs a YMCA aftercare site that is shut down. I am not afraid of the virus, I am afraid of how I will survive economically/financially.""
Or Sheldon, who had to witness firsthand how hospitals are struggling:
""I was placed in quarantine 9 days ago which was suspected to be a case of coronavirus. The test proved it was not. I was in the hospital for 4 days. I saw firsthand the struggle the hospital staff was going through as they tried to deal with the very fluid protocols. They were already struggling with a lack of supplies. Perhaps the Lt. Gov. needs to focus on doing what needs to be done to care for our healthcare providers, rather than just suggesting residents of Texas just be left to die.""
Or Barry, who lives in fear for the safety of their family:
""My wife is 66 years old and works at Walmart. It bothers me that she thinks she has to work when she knows she's around people that could give her the coronavirus. But feels obligated to do her job. I'm worried about my kids in Denton and in Fort Worth. My grandson's birthday is being called off until later on. I'm retired and it's mainly being depressed and worried all the time. Not feeling strong about our leadership to handle this crisis.""
Many people are fearful for their loved ones, worried about how to pay for rent, anxious about finding food to feed their families -- these are all very real issues for many in our community.
That doesn't mean that we give up. On the contrary, we're in this together. I can't tell you how many people I've seen step up to the plate, from offering to go grocery shopping for their high-risk neighbor to making handmade PPE masks for their loved ones.
I hope you'll take some time out of your day today to share your story with us too. Standing as a unified community means lifting each other up, including our voices:
Share your story

Gilberto Hinojosa,yellowdog@txdemocrats.org,quick update,"Hi, I wanted to give you a quick update on our lawsuit to protect access to vote-by-mail for any person who does not want to risk their health or their family's health during the coronavirus pandemic.
Today after a lengthy evidentiary hearing, a state district Judge signals that the Texas Democratic Party will win our lawsuit against the state of Texas allowing all eligible voters the opportunity to request a mail-in ballot.
The right to vote is the foundation of our democracy. As public health officials began speaking to the severity of the coronavirus pandemic, the Texas Democratic Party knew our elections here in Texas needed to be modified.
We must make sure every eligible voter can cast their ballot without risking their health. In Wisconsin, we saw the debacle that ensues when voters are prevented from mailing their ballots during a pandemic. Republicans are already trying to force Texans to vote in person and put our lives in danger.
Our voting rights have been under attack for decades, long before the coronavirus pandemic reached the borders of our state. We know Republicans will say and do anything to make it harder for people to vote. We cannot allow this public health crisis to be the death of our democracy when it is taking so many of our loved ones.
Make no mistake: Texas is the biggest battleground state and Republicans will do anything to steal this election. We must be ready to fight back.
So, I'm asking: please contribute $7 to our voter protection program so we will be ready for whatever Republicans try to throw at us?

Our state is better off when more Texans participate in our democracy. Voting by mail is safe, secure, and accessible. It allows more voters to participate in our democracy, and it's a commonsense way to run an election, especially during a public health crisis.

Cliff Walker,yellowdog@txdemocrats.org,Opportunity,"Texas is a jump ball in this election.
Hi,
Texas is​n't ""the future"" of the Democratic Party. Texas is ""now​.""​ ​​More and more outlets -- including 538, The Economist and NBC -- ​are calling Texas a ""toss-up."" And ​every recent poll shows that Texas is a jump ball at the presidential level.​ ​
That's why Texas Republicans are running scared. Their major ​funders -- both in-state and outside groups -- are stepping up to pour millions into the state to try to drown us out​, scare voters​ and block our momentum.
We can't let them.
Rush a $7 donation to the Texas Democratic Party today to ensure we have the resources we need to deliver Texas to Joe Biden and Kamala Harris -- and elect Texas Democrats down the ticket. We need to raise $49,092 to reach our end-of-month fundraising goal, can you chip in?

Express Donate: $7
Express Donate: $10
Express Donate: $25
Express Donate: $50
Express Donate: $100
Or, donate another amount
Now, look, I'll be honest: Texas has never been the darling of outside Democratic groups. We've ​always ​had to carve our own path -- being as scrappy and creative as possible, and relying on grassroots donors like you, Sheamanti, to power our movement.
At the start of the year, we had great ambitions to run a massive in-person organizing operation. But you know what they say about the best-laid plans! Once coronavirus reached our country, it became clear that we needed to ​adapt our strategy completely.
Thanks to your help and support, we were able to ​pivot and not skip a beat.
We've called more than ​a million voters. Texted more than 1.5 million voters. Mailed more than 818,000 voter registration cards and more than 250,000 National Change of Address ​voter registration​ applications​ in just the past two weeks​. And this team has reached every grassroots fundraising goal we've set.
Now, with just 69 days until Election Day, you know the Republicans are going to pull out all the stops. That's why we can't afford to take our foot off the gas. Not for one second.
Add your first donation of $7 or more to help our team at the Texas Democratic Party reach our end-of-month fundraising goal.

Gilberto Hinojosa,yellowdog@txdemocrats.org,we're resilient.,"Hi,
Wanted to share a few of my thoughts with you.
We're going to feel the effects of this pandemic for years to come -- and there's going to be so many vulnerable communities who will have to spend years picking up the pieces.
Despite the circumstances, I'm so proud of the way people are coming together para la comunidad. Our Party is founded in hope, in perseverance, in mutual love and respect. I see young people offering to do grocery runs for their at-risk neighbors, making face masks for their friends and loved ones, and connecting virtually in ways I've never seen before.
I believe it is our responsibility to keep doing what we can to build a better, stronger future for our country and the world. We're a resilient community and nothing can replicate the tenderness and empathy we're showing one other.
I'm proud of the work Democrats are doing from the local level to Congress to prevent the coronavirus from getting worse and centers relief efforts on helping workers and families.
Democrats are fighting to secure additional funding for hospitals, testing, PPE, and workers on the frontline. We are working to provide more relief to unemployed workers, small businesses, families, and frontline health care workers, and provide badly needed funding for hospitals. Your Texas Democratic Party is fighting to protect our democracy and make sure voters don't have to choose between their lives and their right to vote.
I know times are hard right now. We must keep marching forward.
Millions of Americans are depending on us.
If we want a world where future generations can thrive after this pandemic, we need to build a better future. No contribution is too small. I'm personally asking, can you make your first $7 contribution of 2020 before our end-of-month fundraising deadline?
If you've saved payment info with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Express Donate: $7

Stay safe and well,

You're going to hear a LOT about ""momentum"" in the weeks leading up to the election -- who's got it, who doesn't, and what it means for the campaigns you're following closely.
Right now, the momentum is on our side. A brand-new poll showed that my campaign is running just ONE POINT behind John Cornyn. The Democrats running in key Congressional districts across Texas are surging. Up and down the ballot, Democrats are running to win.
But momentum doesn't mean jack without the work to back it up.
We need a record number of Texans to vote in this upcoming election -- even in the face of a global pandemic. Fortunately, there's something you can do RIGHT NOW to help make that possible. The Texas Democratic Party is running their largest vote-by-mail program to date, with a goal of sending over 815,000,000 vote-by-mail applications to Texans across the state.
We need your help to send 815,000 Texans their vote-by-mail applications. 493,862 Vote by Mail Applications funded. Deadline: MIDNIGHT
If you're able, please add a $1 contribution to the Texas Democratic Party's Vote-By-Mail Fund so they can send 2 Texans their application.

On this day 100 years ago, women fought for the right to vote and won. This fight wasn't over then. And it isn't over now.
Today is about the suffragettes who championed the 19th Amendment. The Black women who marched during the Civil Rights movement. The women who faced all odds to build a better country for all of us. Many of them, their stories never told.
Today is also about us continuing their fight.
We're on the verge of making history, again. Kamala Harris is set to become not only the first woman vice president but also the first woman of color. From the State House to the White House, we need representation that reflects who we are: diverse in every way, from all walks of life.
Kamala Harris, MJ Hegar, Chrysta Castañeda, Judge Amy Clark Meachum, Judge Elizabeth Davis Frizell, Judge Staci Williams, Judge Tina Clinton, Justice Gisela Triana, Kathy Cheng, and many more incredible women will be a voice for our communities. The strength and diversity of our movement isn't just going to win this election -- it's going to power the change we need from our elected officials and push us toward a more just future for all.
I know you're not done fighting until we break every single glass ceiling and that is why I need your help today. Can you rush a $7 contribution right now so we can elect women up and down the ballot?

MJ has proven herself to be a formidable campaigner and a relentless advocate for health care, while Senator Cornyn has proven himself to be an unpopular and out-of-touch incumbent who deserves to lose his seat.
Between now and November, Texas Democrats will work day in and day out alongside MJ to win. But, we can't win big in Texas without you.
This election, everything is on the line. So I'm asking: Will you split your first $7 contribution of 2020 between MJ Hegar and the Texas Democratic Party?

Gilberto Hinojosa,yellowdog@txdemocrats.org,"Re: All-mail elections because of COVID-19, Read my letter to the Texas Secretary of State","Hi,
Moments ago, I sent a letter to the Texas Secretary of State demanding all mail-ballot elections for the May 2 and May 26 elections.
Under the current and projected conditions involving COVID-19, it does not seem viable for Texas to hold meaningful elections in May without universal vote-by-mail. An all-mail election, in which county election officials mail a ballot to every registered voter, is the only option that guarantees Texans' right to vote while also protecting public health.
Add your name as a citizen co-signer: Demand the Texas Secretary of State switch to all mail-ballot elections for the May 2 and May 26 elections:
add your name
This goes beyond party or politics, this is a matter of right and wrong. The Secretary of State's office must act before it's too late. Time is of the essence.

I know things aren't easy right now. I can't stop thinking about my family, my friends, my neighbors, and every single one of you.
Everything seems uncertain right now, but what I do know is that this moment calls for real leadership. We need leaders who put families, workers, and our healthcare first. We are fighting for a brighter future. We are working harder than ever to elect leaders who will prioritize healthcare, workforce policies, and unemployment resources for the people of Texas.
That's why we must keep mobilizing, energizing, and registering more Texas Democrats -- because that's how we will win in November. By registering Texans to vote, we elect Democrats from the schoolhouse to the White House.
That is where our March Voter Registration Fund comes in. This fund supports our voter registration programs and for every $1 you are able to contribute, we can send 2 Texas a voter registration card. This will lift our eventual nominees and candidates to victory in November.
We need your help. Things aren't easy right now. If you're able to help hit our midnight fundraising deadline, you'll be putting this team in the best position possible to win across our state.
We can't do this without you,. Chip in $7 right now, so we can send 14 Texans a voter registration card:
If you've saved payment info with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:

Gilberto Hinojosa,yellowdog@txdemocrats.org,[IMPORTANT] Register to vote,"Hi --
Fifty-five years ago today, a great Texan, President Lyndon Baines Johnson, signed the Voting Rights Act into law. It was a historic and hard-fought victory by Civil Rights leaders and activists all over the country, including Martin Luther King Jr. and John Lewis.
Before this landmark legislation, racial discrimination -- poll taxes, literacy tests, and state-sanctioned violence kept Black and other minority would-be voters from the booth. While we celebrate the scale and magnitude of the Voting Rights Act, we realize that our work is far from over.
We must restore the Voting Rights Act, expand vote by mail, and fully fund our elections systems. Above all, we should be making it more convenient for eligible Americans to cast their ballot.
Since the Voting Rights Act was gutted by the U.S. Supreme Court, Trump and Texas Republicans have taken every opportunity to make voting more difficult for Latino, Black and other voters that the VRA was created to protect. One of the reasons voting is harder in Texas than it is elsewhere is because we lost the protections of the Voting Rights Act in 2013.
That is why, today, I am calling on you to get registered to vote or update your registration. It only takes a few minutes:
[[URL REDACTED]]
Texas Democrats know that our democracy thrives when more people participate, not less. That's why in partnership with Stacey Abrams' Fair Fight Action, the Texas Democratic Party created:
* Our biggest voter protection program in history;
* Launched our year-round, multi-lingual 1-844-TX-VOTES voter assistance hotline;
* Empowers voters to register to vote, vote by mail, and more at [[URL REDACTED]];
* And has taken Republicans to court to protect voting rights.
We will continue to fight to preserve the legacy and promise of the Voting Rights Act until every eligible Texan can cast their ballot.

It's not too late to become a Turn Texas Blue contributor.
$7 before midnight is all I'm asking. That's it. Here is why your donation is so important:
Our state party is funded by grassroots donors. That means they depend on you to run [[URL REDACTED]], an online platform to register voters during COVID-19, they depend on you to run their year-round voter assistance hotline 1-844-TX-VOTES, they depend on you to build their online community hub ConnectTexas, and so much more.
I know that they are just getting started. So back to that $7.
Our Texas Democratic Party only needs 2,238 Texans to hit their midnight Turn Texas Blue goal. So if you add $7 and someone else adds $7 and 2,238 people add their contribution -- then we will Turn Texas Blue.
That's why I have to ask: Can you make a $7 contribution to our Turn Texas Blue Fund? We're 2,238 contributions away from reaching our midnight goal:
If you've saved payment info with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:

Brittany Switzer,yellowdog@txdemocrats.org,fwd: Right this moment,"Hey -- real quick:
Did you see this? The MOST important election you or I are EVER going to live through is happening right now. We are fighting for *every single vote* and you know as well as I do that we cannot afford to lose this. However, we cannot win it without your help.
If we get every last Texan to the polls, we WILL win this and save our entire country in the process. Three MILLION more Texans are registered to vote than in 2016 -- that's more than enough to tip the balance, but we have to make sure they actually vote. The way we do that is with our Get Out The Vote efforts -- where we push as many people as we possibly can to come out and cast their ballot.
Get Out The Vote is going to decide this election. However, we are up against our FINAL mid-month fundraising deadline, and we need to raise $49,789 to make this the all-out blitz it has to be.
We have less than three weeks to give this our absolute best shot. It's going to take time, money, and support from the people who care most. So I'm asking: can you chip in your first $7 to our Get Out the Vote Fund before our midnight deadline?

Subject: Right this moment
Hi,
The most important election of our lifetimes is here, and it's going to be decided in Texas.
Texans are voting NOW. Literally, right now -- and in droves. Just yesterday, we saw the biggest Day One voter turnout in Texas history. And from the look of it, Texas Democrats are showing no sign of letting up.
Y'all, this is it. We've got just under 3 weeks to get this done. We've worked for years for this moment. The time to be firing on all cylinders is NOW -- not November 3, not the weekend leading up to it, but today, right this minute.
Texans know exactly what the stakes are. Every single one of us is living and breathing the consequences of this failed presidency and all the Texas Republicans who closed ranks around Trump while selling us out. Because of that, more Texans than ever are coming out, voting blue, and ushering in a new era where our government truly represents us.
We have the numbers. We have the fire. But it's up to us to share that sense of urgency with and encourage millions of Texans to come out to the polls and cast their ballots. Whether we do that successfully will decide this election.
Today, I'm asking you to step up again and help bring this home. If you're ready to make your first donation, this is when it matters most. We are making a massive push to get Texas Democrats out to vote, but we need to raise $50,391 by midnight tomorrow to do that. Can you chip in another $7 or whatever you can to our Get Out The Vote Fund?

Glen Maxey,yellowdog@txdemocrats.org,re: how to be a state convention delegate without attending your county convention,"Real quick: In following CDC guidelines, we are limiting county/senate district conventions to minimally required business. We are encouraging anyone who would like to be a delegate to the state convention to sign up online here, and not attend their county/senate district convention on Saturday.
Hi,
To reduce risk, the majority of Saturday's county conventions will be conducted Pro-forma. This means the convention chair will call to order and motion on delegate selection to the state convention and resolutions, then immediate adjournment.
If you would like to be a state convention delegate, register to be a state convention delegate, regardless of attendance at your county convention this Saturday:
REGISTER HERE
Because these conventions are requesting that you NOT attend in person, when you fill out the registration you share the two pieces of information that would have been confirmed at your in-person convention:
* Want to be a state delegate? Then check the state delegate box in registration.
* Of the presidential candidates who won national delegates on Super Tuesday, who is your preferred candidate?
* (Biden, Sanders, No Preference - Statewide)
* (Bloomberg, Warren - Certain Senate Districts)
Please do this expeditiously!
Let's fight like hell,
Glen Maxey

Gilberto Hinojosa,yellowdog@txdemocrats.org,¡Feliz mes de la herencia hispana!,"Hi,
¡Feliz mes de la herencia hispana!
From now until October 15, people across the country will be celebrating Hispanic Heritage Month -- a chance to recognize our Latino community and the profound contributions of Latino Americans.
My grandparents, who fled a revolution in Mexico, came to this country hoping their children and grandchildren would have a better life and worked hard every day to make that a reality. That's a familiar story for Latino families across our country. Whether we are immigrants ourselves or our families have been here for generations, our community has transformed our great state of Texas and our country for the better.
Over the decades, I've watched my fellow Texans work tirelessly to shape a more just, inclusive future for their children, and all of us. The state we know and love would be unrecognizable without the dreams, vision, hope, and hard work of our proud Latino community.
It's also been a painful four years for us. From day one of Donald Trump's presidency, our community has been under attack. Now, we say ""ya basta."" Texas is more than 40% Latino. We have incredible power as a community, and our voices will make the difference in this election. This week, we're making a huge push to get Latino voters registered to vote. We need your help to do it.
When Latino voters speak loud and clear this fall, we will flip the White House. However, we only have 20 days until the voter registration deadline. The clock is ticking on our work. We need to raise $20,587 by MIDNIGHT TONIGHT to fund our Latino voter registration efforts fully. Can you rush your first $7 of 2020 today to our voter registration fund?

Gilberto Hinojosa,yellowdog@txdemocrats.org,Our future is not up for grabs.,"Hi,
Everything is on the line in this election, and we need to fight right now because our lives depend on it.
It's on us to do everything in our power to make sure that come November 3, Texas elects Joe Biden as the next president of the United States.
Amy Coney Barrett's appointment is illegitimate and every single one of us has the right to be furious. Trump Republicans appointed a right-wing extremist judge who runs counter to the will and views of the vast majority of Americans.
They did it smack in the middle of an election where millions and millions of us have already cast our votes. And they did it for the sole purpose of repealing the Affordable Care Act so they can cheat millions of people out of their fundamental right to healthcare.
The only way to counter this is to fight back right now at the ballot box. The Republicans who did this do not represent Texas. In eight days, when the votes are counted, they will know that for a fact.
This just raised the stakes in an election that was already the most important of our lifetimes. Everything -- from healthcare to immigrant rights to reproductive justice to LGBTQ rights -- all of it is on the line. This is your last chance to donate before the election and help us win. Rush $7 to our Get Out The Vote operation before our midnight end-of-month deadline:

That's what we need to remember as we get right back up and get back in the fight. Every single one of us is fighting on the side of light and we are fighting harder than we ever have before.
We are about to send Joe Biden to the White House on Texas's 38 electoral votes and send a message across the country and around the world: our communities are not up for grabs.
Our future is not up for grabs. We are the ones who decide what matters and fight every day to protect it. And we are the ones who will win this at the ballot box.
What we've built is unstoppable. For the first time in decades, Texas is inches away from going blue. This is ours to win.

Chrysta Castañeda,yellowdog@txdemocrats.org,I'm running in what could be the most important environmental race in the country in 2020,"Hi,
I'll get right to it: I'm running in what could be the most important environmental race in the country in 2020 -- the race for Texas Railroad Commission -- and I need your help to win.
Split your first $7 donation of 2020 to help flip the most important environmental race in the country and elect Texas Democrats up and down the ballot.
If you've saved payment info with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:

It might surprise you to learn this, but the Texas Railroad Commission has ZERO to do with railroads. This agency actually oversees all oil and gas drilling, one of the largest drivers of the Texas economy.
Right now -- at this very minute -- oil companies are literally lighting energy on fire, wasting our natural resources.
As an engineer who came from a family of engineers, I'll be blunt: I like it when things make sense. Andto me, that doesn't make any sense at all.
The Texas Railroad Commissioner's number one job is to prevent waste and protect our natural resources. And the current Republican commissioners aren't doing their job. That's why I'm running.
If I'm elected in November, I'll actually enforce the laws on the books that protect Texas' air and water.
I can't win this race alone. Texas Democrats are building a massive coordinated campaign to deliver Texas to Joe Biden, elect MJ Hegar and help Democrats up and down the ticket -- myself included -- flip critical seats from red to blue. If we're going to win, I need your help.
Can I count on your support? Split your first $7 donation of 2020 between my campaign and the Texas Democratic Party today.

Texas is the biggest battleground state in the country, and if we work together, I know we can flip this seat and protect the environment for all Texans.
Thanks for your support,

Manny Garcia,yellowdog@txdemocrats.org,recap,"Hi,
Wow -- what an amazing month we've had so far.
To recap: Poll after poll showed Biden tied with Trump in Texas, we have been fighting in court to protect Texans' right to safely vote by mail during a pandemic, and we're gearing up for our historic virtual Texas Democratic Convention.
Everything is changing right now.
We're watching our state turn blue. It is because of your dedication to this movement -- our movement -- even during times of crisis. We know that this vision won't happen overnight, and that's why we're putting in the work every single day.
The truth is: one thing hasn't changed. Dark-money Republican PACS are still pumping money into this state to attack Democrats. Both Karl Rove and David Koch are trying to stop us because they know once Texas flips, Republicans will never see the White House again.
So if we're going to win and make history together, we really need a lot of donations today. Right now, we're coming up short of where we hoped to be.
If you made one $7 contribution and that was multiplied by the thousands of Texas Democrats on our mailing list, we can show the power of our movement is stronger than dark-money super PACs. Can you make a contribution?
If you've saved payment info with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Express Donate: $7
Express Donate: $10
Express Donate: $25
Express Donate: $50
Express Donate: $100
Or, donate another amount
We will win the White House, take out John Cornyn, ​expand our Texas congressional delegation, ​set the agenda in the Texas Senate, ​flip the Texas House, and elect hundreds of local Democrats across the state.
Thanks -- now let's get to work,

Manny Garcia,yellowdog@txdemocrats.org,checking in,"Hey --
This pandemic is testing every single one of us. Times are tough, but we won't back down.
I wanted to give you an update on where your Texas Democratic Party is at before the month ends. This team isn't going to stop until we turn Texas blue. A lot has changed. However, our mission stays the same. We are still focused on the core goals of our Party: organizing our communities, supporting Democrats running for office, and expanding the vote.
This crisis has made it clearer than ever before that we must elect leaders who will put workers and our public health first. That brings me to our work to expand the vote.
We know that in order to win in November, we must register and engage a new electorate that is more progressive and represents the diversity of our great state. There are more than 2 million Texans we could register this year. We have just over 6 months to do it.
Our success depends on meeting our March Voter Registration Fund goal. Our success depends on you, and your generous support during these challenging times.
So I have to ask, can you chip in $7 so we can send 14 Texans across the state a voter registration card?
If you've saved payment info with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
$7 = 14 registration cards
$25 = 50 registration cards
$50 = 100 registration cards
$100 = 200 registration cards
$250 = 500 registration cards

Voting is how we will win and you are part of the equation. Let's send people across Texas a voter registration card.

For about 33 cents, you can help your hell-raising granny get a ballot by mail for the whole year of 2020. That's what it costs us to send her a vote-by-mail application for every election the whole damn year. That's a bargain.
But, wait, there's more!
For $7, you can send a ballot by mail application to every Democratic grandparent in Dickens County. For $178, you can ""adopt"" Cooke County, kind of like investing in the neon concession in Las Vegas.
Your party has a critical deadline coming up Friday at midnight -- they must send 925,000 Texans their vote-by-mail applications. Can you make a $7 contribution to the Texas Democratic Party so we hit this important goal? We gotta send all 925,000 applications:
If you've saved payment info with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
$7 = 21 applications
$25 = 75 applications
$50 = 150 applications
$100 = 300 applications
$250 = 750 applications

Granny doesn't like Donald Trump and never will, so sponsor a ballot-by-mail applications in her honor.
Just thought you'd want to know.

The only way we will take back our state is if we all work together. We need to send 925,000 vote-by-mail applications and we only have 283,161 left to fund by Friday at midnight. Can you rush a $7 contribution to fund our vote-by-mail program?

On Friday, Republican Texas Supreme Court justices formed the new Republican death panel by forcing Texans to put their lives at-risk in the middle of a pandemic. This is nothing short of outrageous and gross negligence on their part.

Subject: re: republican death panel
Hi,
Republican Texas Supreme Court Justices are forcing Texans to put their lives on the line to vote during this pandemic.
This is a dark day for our democracy. The Republican Texas Supreme Court is wrong to force the people of Texas to choose between their health and their right to vote. They would have Texans die, just so they can hold on to power.
Voters should have the ability to vote-by-mail during a pandemic if they feel their health is in danger. Every single justice who ruled today should be ashamed of themselves. They are the new Republican death panel.
We will continue to fight like hell to protect every eligible Texan's right to vote and have their voices heard by their government.
As for the Texas Supreme Court, elections matter. We have one coming up quickly. I can guarantee that we will work every single day to ensure those Republicans -- Nathan Hecht, Jane Bland, Jeffrey Boyd, and Brett Busby -- are voted out of office. They put the voters of Texas in danger. We will not allow them to take this election away from the people.
If you're ready to take back the Texas Supreme Court and elect Justices who will defend your right to vote, will you rush a $7 contribution to the Texas Democratic Party? Your support is vital to our success in November:

Cliff Walker,yellowdog@txdemocrats.org,a few thoughts,"Hi,
We are reeling. This is a difficult message to write. Words are not enough to ease the hurt or unwind the tightness in the chest. The press is going to spill a lot of ink debating the nature of the protests and often forgetting the reasons why and the ultimate aims. But to quote Reverend Barber, these protests are the guttural screams of people who are not being heard, who are exhausted from having their dignity downgraded, who are being killed along with the soul of this country. Nearly all are saying they are committed to nonviolence but they are no longer committed to non-action.
The protests continue in the midst of a historic pandemic and an economy in a near depression. It's as though we've been shaken by an earthquake, hit by a tsunami, and struck by lightning, all in the middle of an inferno.
The challenges are monstrous and are a persistent threat to our bodies, our minds, our hearts, and our world -- and with little or no relief in view.
But we are not powerless. Our biggest problems are political. So are the solutions.
I take comfort in the understanding that we have real power to effect real change. If we truly believe, then it is time to fix our gaze and steady our aim. This is the literal fight of our lives.
The word ""political"" is often hurled as an insult. I disagree. Some believe our cracked system is so broken that there is no hope for it. I cannot allow myself to believe that. Our democracy belongs to us. Not equitably now, nor has it ever been so. But the door is cracked enough for us to kick it open.
There are millions to let in. We often talk about being the biggest battleground state, and that the eyes of the nation are upon us. But a powerful majority of our 30 million fellow Texans are looking towards us for leadership as well. It is an awesome responsibility.
They want us to fight to purge the evils in our system. While we can and should scream, we must still encourage each other not to deny our own power out of disgust and despair.
We fight here in Texas because we believe it's the most important state to do our work. It has long been a tough nut to crack. That is even truer now.
The past 48 hours have been some of the longest in memory. The past 7 days have at times brought me to tears and left me nauseous. We should be under no illusion that the next 156 days will be easier. The tough truth is that the next few months might be some of the hardest of our lives. The power structure in place will not give up easily. They will lie and cheat to keep their grip on power for just a little while longer.
New leaders are being forged by this moment. Each and every one of you has a critical role to play, but the burden is not yours to bear alone. We are a team and we have a righteous cause. If we stick together and support each other, we will make history.
This has never been just a job for me. It has been my life. To create something new and good. I know I am far from alone.
We are fighting for more than a notch on a scoreboard. We are fighting for our lives. For those whom we love. For the liberation of all peoples.
And finally, after we have screamed, and grieved, and marched; after we have dialed, and texted, and inspired the majority we need to win; we can look back with pride at what we have won, with gratitude for everything we survived and hope for what we will build next.
With hope and love,

Gilberto Hinojosa,yellowdog@txdemocrats.org,we'll never stop fighting,"Hi,
Today, the United States Supreme Court denied a stay of our vote by mail lawsuit before the primary runoff elections.
We are disappointed that the Supreme Court did not weigh in now and provide needed relief and clarity for voters ahead of the primary runoff. Now, thanks to Republican Governor Greg Abbott, Attorney General Ken Paxton, and the all-Republican membership of the Texas Supreme Court, only some voters will be permitted to vote by mail during this primary election.
The case proceeds on in other filings before the U.S. Supreme Court and the Fifth Circuit and therefore, hope remains that the federal courts will restore equal voting rights in time for the November elections.
We will not stop fighting for the rights of voters.
If we're going to turn Texas blue, we have to fight harder than we ever thought possible. We can't do this without you. Can you rush a $7 contribution to our voter protection fund?

Dr. Carla D. Brailey,yellowdog@txdemocrats.org,Juneteenth,"Hi,
Juneteenth is an incredibly important holiday -- some would call it our own version of Fourth of July -- for it celebrates Black's resiliency and reminds us how far we've come and how much further we have to go in our pursuit for liberty, justice and equality. President Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation became official on January 1, 1863. However, that news didn't arrive until June 19, 1865 in Galveston, Texas. It took more than two years for freedom to reach all Americans. That's almost 900 days of Texas slaves not knowing they no longer had to provide their free labor or adhere to a slave master.
Just because our ancestors were freed legally on that hot June day, it didn't mean they were equal. And to this day, we're fighting for liberty, justice and equality for all. That's why we are still mobilizing and protesting for the very thing our ancestors fought for -- the pursuit of happiness for all Black lives. Because no one is free until all of us are free.
When we say Black Lives Matter, we don't mean that they only matter now. Our lives have always mattered. From the Civil Rights Movement to the recent days of protesting on the streets for George Floyd and so many others, when our community comes together we pave the way for future generations and all Americans. We do the work now so that our children can enjoy a prosperous and equitable future. We speak loudly so the voice of democracy can be heard in a way that all people have a fair shot at living a quality life.
Though we're tired, frustrated, and grieving, decade after decade demonstrate we're a resilient people. That's ultimately what Juneteenth is all about -- celebrating our talents, achievements, and progress while remembering all the struggles our ancestors had to endure and reminding our great land of thee, in the words of Langston Hughes, ""[We], too, sing America"" -- just take a closer look at our history.
I'm proud to be a Black woman, mom, daughter, niece, and friend. I stand with my brothers and sisters because we will persevere. We are going to continue to resist discriminatory and racist practices by speaking truth to power, kneeling for injustice, and voting for progressive change! We've done it for hundreds of years, and there's nothing stopping us now, and a hundred more years if necessary.
And as Black Democrats we've shown our loyalty, dedication and commitment in supporting the efforts of our Party. We hope to continue celebrating beyond today and after November as the bluest battleground state in the nation!
We must keep pushing America towards democracy to mandate it fulfills its promise of liberty, justice and equality for all Americans.
Together, Texas Democrats, we celebrate and thanks again for everything you do,
Dr. Carla Brailey
Vice Chair, Texas Democratic Party
P.S. Join us and the Texas Young Democrats Black Caucus for our Juneteenth virtual happy hour!

Manny Garcia,yellowdog@txdemocrats.org,Fwd: We are going to elect Joe Biden in November.,"Are you with us?
Hey -- Did you watch the debate last night?
Here's one thing I know for damn sure -- we are going to elect Joe Biden in November, and last night, it was clear why. Joe Biden puts American families first. He's listening to us, and Texans trust him to fight for us -- enough to flip the biggest battleground state.
""Just make sure you understand: you have it in your control to determine what this country is going to look like the next four years. Is it going to change, or is it four more years of these lies?""
\-- our next President, Joe Biden
Joe Biden has what it takes to turn Texas blue. Trump Republicans have sold out and short changed our communities for far too long. Last night, Trump gave his most blatant racist dogwhistle yet -- telling white supremacists across America to ""stand by."" Enough is enough. Texans are demanding change. We are ready to elect leaders up and down the ballot who will fight for our families instead of kicking us down.
However, Joe can't do it without us. You have been laying the groundwork to flip Texas for weeks, months, and years. Over the next five weeks, we have to fight even harder. We have to talk to more voters, campaign more aggressively, and pull for Texas more than ever before. Everything comes down to this.
At MIDNIGHT TONIGHT, we're hitting our final end-of-quarter fundraising deadline before this election. We need to power an all-out, statewide, massive push to bring in every last possible vote. Can you chip in your first $7 donation of 2020 and give Texas Democrats the edge we need to win?

Hi,
My name is Olivia Stitilis and I'm your new organizing director at the Texas Democratic Party. I'm honored to take on this role because right now the stakes have never been higher. Texas is the biggest battleground state. We know this is our moment to change the future of our country.
That's why the Texas Democratic Party will run a statewide organizing program that redefines what it means to organize in Texas. With the March 3 primary behind us, we've just entered the next phase of our organizing program.
Through innovative, relational and constituency driven organizing tactics, we will engage, train and mobilize volunteers in every corner of the state. We will expand the electorate, elect Democrats up and down the ticket in November, and create a lasting volunteer infrastructure that catalyzes community change beyond 2020.
Our organizing will be guided by clear values and united around a culture that puts volunteers and community members first, is informed, but not burdened by the past, and approaches every day and every interaction as an opportunity to organize.
We will invest early in places that traditionally have been forgotten or left behind. Our team will work collaboratively with the communities we serve, approach new situations with humility, and be transparent with our goals.
So, let's rise to this challenge together.
Right now, our biggest organizing priority is to recruit at least one new volunteer leader for every county. Before I go, I have to ask you. Can you take our Volunteer Survey to tell us a bit about yourself, what your skills are, and what we can do together to turn Texas blue?
Take The Survey

Glen Maxey,yellowdog@txdemocrats.org,this old man needs your help,"Hi,
When it comes to voting this November, our seniors and disabled Texans deserve better than what the Republicans are allowing and you and I shouldn't stand for it!
It doesn't take a genius to see that Donald Trump, Greg Abbott and the Republicans in charge have royally screwed up their response to the COVID pandemic.
(Hell, it wasn't that long ago that Lt. Governor Dan Patrick was saying senior citizens should be willing to die from the virus to ""save the economy."" [[URL REDACTED]] can't make this stuff up.)
Now, Republicans are back playing their favorite game: trying their damndest to suppress the vote. But this time, the stakes are literally life and death -- because Donald Trump and the Texas GOP want to make it HARDER for people to vote safely by mail during a global pandemic.
You know what we say to that? HELL no. Our team at the Texas Democratic Party is fighting back by running our largest vote-by-mail program to date. We've set a massive goal of sending over 815 thousand vote-by-mail applications to Texans across the state -- it's a really steep goal, but I know that we can get there if enough people step up and pitch in.
Elections are literally won and lost because of vote-by-mail. That's why this old man is asking for your help today.
We know that 815,000 vote-by-mail applications is a hell of a goal, and I know we can do it with your help. Can you make a $1 contribution to our Vote-By-Mail Fund so we can send 2 Texans their application? It's absolutely critical to us winning in 2020.
If you've saved payment info with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
$1 = 2 applications
$25 = 50 applications
$50 = 100 applications
$100 = 200 applications
$250 = 500 applications

I know that flooding your inbox is a frickin' pain, but this is really important. With all eyes on Texas, we need to use every tool in our toolbox to try and run up the score across the state.
Because once Texas goes blue, the Republican path to the White House will be blocked -- and we'll save the whole damn country.

Dr. Carla D. Brailey,yellowdog@txdemocrats.org,Notorious,"Hi,
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg paved the way for so many of us and showed us what it means to dedicate your life in service of your ideals. Supreme Court Justice, women's rights advocate, trailblazer, and icon, Justice Ginsburg fiercely loved our country, our Constitution, and our pursuit of a more perfect union. Advancing women's rights is one of the biggest unfinished works from the past century, and few did more to advance the rights of women and girls than Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
Many of us are still reeling today from the news of her passing. I know folks in our community are feeling this keenly -- I am too. Today, we are grieving an icon. We are also entering a scary next chapter in our country's Supreme Court. I'd be wrong not to acknowledge the fear we are feeling. So I wanted to take a moment to reach out and remind you that we are not alone in this.
Justice Ginsburg became known for her dissents -- speaking out against her colleagues' conservative decisions on voting rights to a woman's right to choose. She did it for us. Justice Ginsburg famously said, ""Real change, enduring change, happens one step at a time.""
She placed her trust in us: that we would finish the fight she started. Our work right now is to carry her legacy forward. Every day, countless people in our community do just that -- pouring everything they have into the fight for justice. Our community is our greatest hope. We are here for each other, we are shoulder to shoulder in this work, and we will move forward together.
If you want the chance to change things, get in the fight, now more than ever. Keep each other close, support the folks working for justice in your community -- and get organized, whether that means calling voters across the state or having the tough, essential conversations at home.
Justice Ginsburg defied every obstacle and left the mark of a titan on the fight for justice. The best thing we can do to honor Justice Ginsburg is to keep pushing forward.
Thanks for being with us in the fight,
Dr. Carla Brailey

Manny Garcia,yellowdog@txdemocrats.org,checking in,"Hi, I'm writing to you from my kitchen table. The kids are running around, and they ain't bored yet. For now, they're glued to their video games.
I wanted to check in on how you and your family are doing right now. We're all faced with the unknown.
It's important we uplift the stories of Texans who are being hurt by the coronavirus and the President's dangerous response to this pandemic.
I'm thinking of the people who are sick. I'm thinking of the families, like my own, who are wondering when their children will be able to return to school and how they are going to continue their education while their children are at home. I'm thinking of the workers who have lost their jobs or had their hours cut to zero. I'm thinking of the people who are wondering how they will pay their bills.
I wanted to let you know that your Texas Democratic Party is here for you.
Our mission has always been guided by the core principle of caring for our families, our neighbors, and our country -- fighting for a fair shot to get ahead. That mission continues and is more important today than ever before. We know that when people unite for the greater good, anything can be done.
We want to hear your story and learn how this pandemic is affecting you, your family, and anyone that is close to your heart. Will you share your story with us?
Share your story
None of us are alone, because we are all part of this amazing Texas Democratic community -- even if we're not physically together. We are here for you. Let's speak out together and make our voices heard.

You can still make a MAJOR difference in this election. Between today and tomorrow, we need to get thousands more Texans out to vote blue -- this is the difference between winning and losing! Sign up right now and don't miss out:
Count me in!
Look -- imagine you take that phonebanking shift, and you help 15 people get out to vote. Then, as the votes roll in tomorrow night, imagine we win that county by 15 votes -- electing local Democrats and maybe even putting Joe Biden over the top.
This election will come down to a few votes per precinct across the state. Every call could be the one that tips the balance. Sign up right now to win this election for all of us!

Gina Calanni,yellowdog@txdemocrats.org,so close,"Hi,
I'm writing you today to ask you to help get more Texans their vote-by-mail applications. Before I do that, I want to explain why your $7 donation is so important.
When I ran for the Texas House as a Democrat in District 132 last year, after the polls had closed, and I waited for results to come in, I kept waiting... and waiting... and waiting.
Our race remained in limbo. Even though we were ahead, it was too close to call.
When all the votes were finally counted, I beat my Republican opponent by only 113 votes. We won by one of the slimmest margins in the Texas House.
The Texas Democrats vote-by-mail program made the difference between my victory and defeat. Without their vote-by-mail initiative, I wouldn't be where I am today. More importantly, we wouldn't have been able to restore funding to our neighborhood public schools, end surprise medical billing, and protect your voting rights in this past Texas Legislative session.
We're so close to flipping the Texas House. I need your help to do it. So, I'm asking:
Your Texas Democratic Party needs to send 925,000 vote-by-mail applications. Can you make a $7 contribution to the Texas Democratic Party so they can send 21 Texans their application?
If you've saved payment info with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
$7 = 21 applications
$25 = 75 applications
$50 = 150 applications
$100 = 300 applications
$250 = 750 applications
Chip in more
It's hard to believe 2020 is almost here. Everything we do right now puts us one step closer to flipping the Texas House and I can't thank you enough for everything you do.
Together, we can make this happen!
Gina Calanni
Texas State Representative, House District 132
The only way we will take back our state is if we all work together. We need to send 925,000 vote-by-mail applications and we only have 376,623 left to fund by Friday at midnight. Can you rush a $7 contribution to fund our vote-by-mail program?

Chip in now
Hi,
I know you've probably gotten a TON of election emails by this point in the week.
Hopefully, they're pretty inspirational. And more likely than not, they all say more or less the same thing: our entire future is on the line right now. Go vote and help us get others voting too.
You know what? They're right. We've lived through four years of Donald Trump. We know exactly how bad it can get and we know we can't stand a single minute more.
In five short days, we have the chance to end this disaster. When Texas goes blue, the White House will follow. However, this is not only the most critical time in this campaign -- it's also when the going gets the most tough.
We have one massive final hurdle to clear. And that's why -- at great risk of flooding your inbox -- I'm making one more appeal to you today.
This is our very last chance to bar the door to Trump's reelection and I need you pulling with us 100%. Our strategy at this point is simple -- get every eligible Texan out to vote -- and if we do it, we'll win. We need to raise $22,674. Can you chip away at that balance and rush $7 or whatever you can before our end-of-month fundraising deadline?

We are so, so close. Millions of Texans have already cast their vote for Joe Biden.
This is our moment.
The most important thing we can do right now is keep pushing with all our might.
Let's win this thing!

Gilberto Hinojosa,yellowdog@txdemocrats.org,Hard working families hold this country together. We need to have their back.,"Hi,
American workers have been knocked down. Unemployment is at Great Depression levels. Millions of Americans have lost their jobs and health insurance, others face reduced work hours and furlough. The once-proud landscape of our Texas workforce has been disrupted by Trump's incompetence and failures managing the coronavirus crisis's economic fallout.
This Labor Day, many workers are left with only doubt. They wonder how they will put food on the table and when they will see their next paycheck. Meanwhile, bills continue to pile up higher and higher.
As in the past, it rings true today; labor unions' efforts have made the lives of all Americans better during the tough times our country has faced. Texas Democrats are proud to fight alongside our brothers and sisters in labor to build an economy that brings back jobs and benefits for all Texans, not just corporations and billionaire donors.
Workers of the world are the ones who have been hurt the most during this pandemic. It's time we invest in their future. We can't just go back to the way things were before the virus -- we have to build back better, and create millions of good-paying, union jobs.
This is what's on the line in this election. Hard working families hold this country together, and we need leaders like Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, MJ Hegar, and Democrats up and down the ballot who will put working Texans first. We are closer and closer to making that happen. Can you chip in your first $7 of 2020 to help get us there?

Manny Garcia,yellowdog@txdemocrats.org,re: 382,"Hey --
Did you see this new Quinnipiac Poll?
* Joe Biden and Donald Trump are tied,
* John Cornyn with a 37%-36% approval/disapproval split, (down 4 points since September),
* Six in ten Texans supporting vote-by-mail in the middle of a pandemic, and
* Greg Abbott with middling coronavirus approval numbers and an overall approval rating down 5 points since September.
Across our state, Texans are demanding change. They understand that Texas Democrats are fighting to keep our families safe, increase access to healthcare, provide responsible leadership in this time of crisis, hold police accountable, and create an economic plan that looks out for working Texans. Texans are looking for leaders who will fight for their fair shot to get ahead.
The polls released the last few weeks continue to reaffirm that Texas is the biggest battleground state in the country. Voters are increasingly entrusting Democratic leaders with the future of their communities. Republicans have proven utterly incapable of managing in times of crisis, and that has hurt them up and down the ballot.
This is our moment. Thanks to the strength of our candidates and our commitment to fighting for each and every Texan, Texas Democrats are poised to win up and down the ballot.
We need 382 Turn Texas Blue donors to reach our goal today. Can you rush a $7 contribution to our Turn Texas Blue Fund before our midnight deadline:

I cannot express how thankful I am for your support. It gives me hope to know that we have people like you on our side.
Everything we've done through the years has brought us to this moment. Our movement is growing across the state and that can be seen in the sheer number of Democrats who voted in the Texas Primary.
Winning this election will require people from different communities, from different backgrounds, from different faiths, and from different generations to talk with their friends, family, and neighbors about the stakes in November.
When we win Texas, it will be because of the millions of Texas Democrats like you who knocked on a few more doors and chipped in a few dollars when you could. We know Republicans will be watching everything we do. They are in denial about how rapidly our state is changing. We're going to keep going.
All eyes are on us right now. We can't stop. Can I count on you to chip in for the first time today? Make your first contribution here:

It is so important to uplift that work and the incredible women leading this movement, whether it's our kickass slate of candidates, staff, or the volunteers powering this movement on the ground.
As Kamala said:
""I do believe the future is bright. It will be because of your leadership, and it will be because we fight for each person's [[URL REDACTED]] we get engaged in this election. Because you have the ability -- through your work, and through eventually your vote -- to determine the future of our country, and what its leadership looks like.""

Texas is turning blue because of you. This team has more than earned a blowout party and that's exactly what we're going to have. Like we say in politics -- the team that's having the most fun wins!

MJ Hegar,yellowdog@txdemocrats.org,grateful for YOU,"Hi there,
As your Democratic nominee for U.S. Senate, I stand on the shoulders of giants. My campaign couldn't be where it is today -- neck-and-neck with John Cornyn, an 18-year incumbent of the U.S. Senate -- without courageous Texas Democrats like Barbara Jordan and Ann Richards and so many others who courageously paved the way.
But, most of all, I'm grateful for YOU and all my friends at the Texas Democratic Party. Texas is only a battleground state because you've treated it like one. You've done the incredibly hard work of laying the foundation for candidates like me to win and help flip Texas blue. I just know it: 2020 is our year.
In the face of the global COVID-19 pandemic, the Texas Democratic Party has built a new path to victory, and they're going to run the largest coordinated campaign in our state's history to elect Democrats up and down the ballot. We need all hands on deck if we're going to pull this off. So what do you say -- are you in?
Can you rush your first $7 contribution of 2020 to help my friends at the Texas Democratic Party reach their end-of-month fundraising deadline and run the largest coordinated campaign in Texas history.

Texas Democrats are working overtime to elect Joe Biden; send John Cornyn packing; expand our Texas congressional delegation; shatter the supermajority in the Texas Senate; flip the Texas House; and elect hundreds of local Democrats across the state.
Together, through the largest, most ambitious coordinated campaign in Texas history, we're going to:
* Motivate voters who sometimes miss an election, making sure they get out to vote in the upcoming election
* Persuade Texans who are fed up with Donald Trump to vote for Democrats
* Protect access to the ballot and making it easier to vote
That's no small feat. If we're going to get this done, it's going to take a LOT of hard work -- but I know you're up for it.
This election isn't just about sending me to the Senate -- we need to deliver Texas for Joe Biden, defend the Democratic majority in Congress, and elect Democrats up and down the ticket. With so many opportunities at every level, we need to make sure the Texas Democratic Party reaches every fundraising goal they set from now until the election.
Add your first $7 contribution of 2020 right now to help the Texas Democratic Party reach their end-of-month fundraising goal.

As elections across the country continue to get delayed or outright canceled, the time is now for Texas election officials to take the threat of the Coronavirus seriously. They must find alternative methods to ensure every Texan has the opportunity to vote.
There's no time to waste. Demand the Texas Secretary of State switch to all mail-ballot elections for the May 2 and May 26 elections. Add your name as a citizen co-signer to our letter to the Texas Secretary of State:

Subject: Re: All-mail elections because of COVID-19, Read my letter to the Texas Secretary of State
Hi,
Moments ago, I sent a letter to the Texas Secretary of State demanding all mail-ballot elections for the May 2 and May 26 elections.
Under the current and projected conditions involving COVID-19, it does not seem viable for Texas to hold meaningful elections in May without universal vote-by-mail. An all-mail election, in which county election officials mail a ballot to every registered voter, is the only option that guarantees Texans' right to vote while also protecting public health.
Add your name as a citizen co-signer: Demand the Texas Secretary of State switch to all mail-ballot elections for the May 2 and May 26 elections:
add your name
This goes beyond party or politics, this is a matter of right and wrong. The Secretary of State's office must act before it's too late. Time is of the essence.
Adelante,
Gilberto Hinojosa

I know times are tough right now. There's so much happening and I know what's getting me through it all is having my family around me, a family that includes you. Right now, bringing Texas Democrats together is extra important, because we're just 43 days away from turning Texas blue. This year's Johnson-Jordan Dinner is going to be big.
The Johnson-Jordan Dinner honors the legacies of President Lyndon B. Johnson and Congresswoman Barbara Jordan -- icons of our Democratic movement in Texas.

I've been blown away by the enthusiasm and support of this community. The number of people voting in the Texas Primary was amazing and we're on track to raise more online from grassroots donations than any previous February.
If we're going to turn Texas blue, we can't slow down. We have to show big organizing and big fundraising numbers. There are very powerful Republican special interests trying to stop us. They're scared of what we're building. I know you don't back down from a challenge.
We're only $3,121 away from our end-of-month fundraising goal. (That's it!) So I have to ask: can you make your first $7 contribution before our midnight deadline?

Glen Maxey,yellowdog@txdemocrats.org,Need a Vote-by-Mail application? Request it by tomorrow and we'll send you one!,"Hi,
There is still time to request a vote-by-mail application through the Texas Democratic Party, but you've got to do it by TOMORROW. So get moving, folks!
Elections are won and lost by vote-by-mail. I've been singing its praises for a long, long time, and today, I'm mailing in my ballot, just like I have in every election for as long as I've been eligible to.
However, this is the big one. Texas can't take four more years of Donald Trump. Neither can I, and by the sounds of it, neither can you. If we flip this state, there is no way Donald Trump can stay in the White House. That's just simple math. However, to make this happen, we are going to need every last vote in Texas. That's where voting by mail comes in \-- let's make sure every eligible Texan can get their vote cast and counted.
Just like they say on an airplane, once you've put on your oxygen mask, then help those around you. Same with voting by mail. Help your parents, grandparents and elderly neighbors! Get them an application and make sure they put it in the mail by October 16th!
Now look, there's a process here. First, you send in your application. We recommend you do this by October 16th. Once it's reviewed and approved, you'll get your ballot in the mail. If you want to request that we mail you an application, you've got to do it by TOMORROW.
To be eligible to vote by mail, you must fall under one of these categories:
* Individuals 65 and over on Election Day
* Individuals who are sick or have a disability
* Individuals who are confined in jail without a felony conviction
* Individuals who will be outside of their county during Early Vote AND Election Day
If that's you, request your application! The entire country is counting on us -- so don't wait! Request your vote-by-mail application today:
Request my vote-by-mail application
Look, who doesn't want to vote for Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and Democrats up and down the ballot from the comfort of your living room? Whether you are signing this ballot at your kitchen table or on your front porch, it is going to feel real, real good to send in that vote and be one more Texas Democrat bringing this election home.
Let's fight like hell,
Glen Maxey

The most corrupt president in U.S. history has demonstrated to the American people just how incapable he is of leading our country through a crisis.
Donald Trump misquotes Texas Democratic Party Chair Gilberto Hinojosa
In fact, Donald Trump went as far as misquoting my statement in a recent New York Times story in his effort to deflect any responsibility. Let's be clear: I spoke openly and honestly about Donald Trump's failures because the American people deserve to know what real leadership looks like.
Texas Democratic Party Chair Gilberto Hinojosa quoted in recent New York Times article
Democrats across the country are showing the leadership we all desperately need, while the president continues to lie, tweet, and ignite chaos. If these last four years have proven anything, it's that we need a leader who will protect and fight for everyone.
That's what we're fighting for. Leaders who will expand healthcare, fight for paid sick leave, and make sure folks don't go broke because of a health crisis.
The American people are experiencing a public health crisis and the president has only created more chaos. Enough is enough. We're only a few months away from Election Day and it's time we elect real leadership. So I have to ask, Can you rush a $7 contribution so we can defeat Trump in November:

Glen Maxey,yellowdog@txdemocrats.org,This is our last chance to register Texans.,"Everything we've worked for is riding on this.
Hi,
We are 50 days away from flipping Texas.
Now, without dwelling too much on my age, I can tell you -- I've been waiting for this for a long time. Texas is turning blue because folks like you said HELL NO to Trump Republicans and you've been putting in the work to back it up.
I'll put it simply: there are more of us than them. When Texans come out to vote this fall, Democrats will win. Texas Republicans know it, and they are terrified which is why they've been dumping PAC money left, right, and center as a lifeline to vulnerable Republicans.
However, I'm not under any illusions: we are fighting for every last vote in this state. With millions of unregistered Democrats out there, voter registration is our secret weapon. However, we only have 21 days left to register Texans before the deadline. So, I need your help.
We all know how high the stakes are. During this pandemic, John Cornyn, Greg Abbott, and Republicans across the state have shown us their true colors beyond a doubt: they are more concerned with looking out for Donald Trump than protecting Texas families. Texas Republicans aren't here for us, and they deserve to be voted out.
This is our last chance to register Texans, and everything we've worked for is riding on this. We need to raise $54,877 dollars to our voter registration fund before our mid-month September 15 fundraising deadline. Can you rush your first $7 of 2020 to our voter registration fund today?

Lauren Pully,yellowdog@txdemocrats.org,"re: estimated 2,600,000 unregistered Democratic voters","I am excited to share our voter registration plan with you today.
Hi,
You know Texas is the biggest battleground state. A question that I get a lot as your Texas Democratic Party Data Director is, ""how are we going to turn our state blue?""
The rapidly emerging Democratic coalition in Texas has set the stage for historic Democratic gains at the ballot box. We know we must register and engage a new electorate that is more progressive and represents the diversity of our great state.
That's why I am excited to share our voter registration plan with you today.
Texas Democrats' Voter Registration Plan
Your Texas Democratic Party is focused on registering the estimated 2,600,000 unregistered Texans who are likely to vote Democratic. Here's how we are going to do it:
* Mail hundreds of thousands of voter registration applications to unregistered voters across the state,
* Deploy 1,000 field organizers and canvassers on the ground, Launch a year-round voter assistance hotline,
* Build machine-learning-based models to quickly identify and mobilize new Democratic voters,
* Hire dedicated staff to engage every part of our Democratic coalition -- including our AAPI, African-American, Latinx, LGBTQ+, youth, and Disability communities,
* And narrow the gap in rural committees.
I've run the numbers. I know we can take back our state. Now, we need you to make an investment in our voter registration program.
We're kicking off our first voter registration mailing, similar to our vote by mail program, and we must raise $10,000 by the end of this week to send the first of many voter registration card mailings. So, can I count on you to chip in $7 so we can mail 14 Texans a voter registration card?
If you've saved payment info with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
$7 = 14 registration cards
$25 = 50 registration cards
$50 = 100 registration cards
$100 = 200 registration cards
$250 = 500 registration cards

I am so proud of everything we've done to mobilize Democratic voters.  I cannot thank you enough for everything you've done to power our movement. I hope you'll make your first donation to the Texas Democratic Party so your name on our voter registration investors list.
Best,
Lauren Pully

Wendy Davis,yellowdog@txdemocrats.org,we must win in November,"Hi,
In just a moment, I'm going to ask you to make a contribution to the Texas Democratic Party's Vote-By-Mail Fund. But first, I'd like to explain why your donation matters so much -- especially now.
As you know, Texas Republicans have spent decades trying to chip away at our state's voting rights with tactics like extreme voter ID laws and gerrymandering. And now, during a global pandemic that's ravaging our country and has left more than 160,000 Americans dead, Texas is one of the few states that's actively fighting to make it harder to vote by mail in the 2020 election.
Governor Greg Abbott, Attorney General Ken Paxton and the rest of Texas Republicans have doubled down on their baseless rhetoric around vote-by-mail, and Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick even called it ""laughable"" that people are afraid to vote in-person during a pandemic.
Let me be clear: forcing people to choose between voting or exposing themselves to the coronavirus isn't just cruel -- it's flat-out dangerous. Fortunately, there's something you can do right now to fight back.
The Texas Democratic Party is running their largest ever vote-by-mail operation this fall, with a goal of sending 815,000 vote-by-mail applications to Texans across the state. Elections are won and lost by vote-by-mail, so it's critical that this program is fully funded. I'm reaching out today to ask if you'll be a part of these efforts to help 815,000 Texans vote safely by mail in 2020.
We need your help to send 815,000 Texans their vote-by-mail applications. 628,398 Vote by Mail Applications funded. Deadline: MIDNIGHT
Can you add a $1 contribution to the Texas Democratic Party's Vote-By-Mail Fund? Your donation today will allow them to send 2 vote-by-mail applications to Texans across the state.
If you've saved payment info with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
$1 = 2 applications
$25 = 50 applications
$50 = 100 applications
$100 = 200 applications
$250 = 500 applications
Chip in more
We must win in November: the very future of our country depends on it. And it's definitely not going to be easy. But trust me on this, because I know a thing or two about tough odds: we CAN get this done.
It's no exaggeration when I say that Texas is the biggest battleground state in the country -- and when we win in November, it will be due in large part to supporters like you who have worked tirelessly to turn Texas blue.
Thanks so much for your support.
Wendy Davis
Democratic nominee for Texas Congressional District 21
The only way we will take back our state is if we all work together. We need to fund 815,000 vote-by-mail applications by this Friday. Can you rush a $7 contribution to fund our vote-by-mail program?
Yes, I'll chip in

Brittany Switzer,yellowdog@txdemocrats.org,how are you?,"Hey --
I know this has been a hard year for us all. We have all struggled, whether that be from loneliness, sickness, or current events. These negative feelings can manifest themselves in our bodies and minds. I know being this close to the election has a lot of us worried. Waiting to see if Texas puts Joe Biden over the top.
So I wanted to take a moment to reach out and ask, how are you doing today? As well as, lead us through a short mindfulness exercise.
I'm going to ask you to close your eyes and think about: Where are you going to be on election night. Who are you going to be with? What are you going to do when Texas turns blue?
Close your eyes and take 10 deep breaths, and think about your election night:
1\.
2\.
3\.
4\.
5\.
6\.
7\.
8\.
9\.
10\.
I hope this email has put you at ease and inspired you to take action, so we make the election night you just imagined become reality.
If it has, here are three actions you can take right now that will help get us over the finish line:
Donate $7
Volunteer!
Ask your friends to vote
Hope you have a great rest of your day,

Gilberto Hinojosa,yellowdog@txdemocrats.org,our path to victory,"Hi,
About one year ago, Texas Democrats released our updated path to victory for the remainder of the 2020 Election cycle, highlighting our innovative organizing strategies, digital advertising investments, and our plans to expose Trump Republicans for their leadership failures at the federal and state level.
We've revisited our plans to adapt how we're campaigning during the COVID pandemic, but the goals and the opportunities are no less big and bold.
Now with less than 100 days until Election Day, we are releasing our revised plan to win with the kind of forward-thinking that has already made Texas the biggest battleground state in the country.
Our investments in digital organizing and ramping our team up to become the largest digital and organizing staff in Texas Democratic Party history will allow us to win up and down the ballot in November.
A few highlights from our Path to Victory:
* A commitment to a seven-figure digital advertising spend as we get closer to November.
* Support efforts to add 2 million voters to the rolls through traditional, distributed digital, and constituency organizing.
* Contact our most loyal base -- the 1.5 million Black registered voters in Texas to promote registration and mobilization.
* The development of an online Rapid Response team to counter any disinformation coming from Trump Republicans.
* The creation of the largest coordinated digital and distributed organizing program in Texas Democratic Party history.
* A state of the art voter protection team to curb any Republican attempts to stop Texans from voting.
We have our plan, however, our final sprint is far from over. Together, we will elect Joe Biden, MJ Hegar, Chrysta Castañeda,  and Democrats up and down the ballot, and we need your help to get it done.
Together, we will win -- this is our moment. So I must ask, can you rush your first $7 contribution of 2020 before our end-of-month midnight fundraising deadline?

Hi,
In just 8 days, we can set the agenda in the Texas Senate and block Dan Patrick's right-wing agenda. That's why I'm asking for your help today.
Texas is on the verge of turning blue. We are inches away from not only sending Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to the White House, but also electing a landslide of state-level Democrats to fight for our communities every single day.
The Texas Senate is ground zero in that fight.
Right now, we need to flip only one seat to break the Republican supermajority in the Texas Senate. One single seat. That means no more Dan Patrick setting a rotten, anti-Texas agenda, and pushing through harmful policies with zero pushback from weak Texas Republicans. It means we can pass legislation that actually serves Texans.
We are so close. In my 12 years as a state representative, I've never seen anything like this. Our community is fighting tooth and nail to win this election -- heading to the polls, bringing our friends and neighbors, and doing every last thing in our power to take back Texas.
The core of this movement is you. This team has put in the work for years to get us where we are today. Now, we need to pull together and push our state across the finish line.
I'm running for Texas Senator in District 19, to give my home community a real voice where it matters most. Help us win this election and block Dan Patrick in the Texas Senate. Split $7 between my campaign and the Texas Democratic Party today:

Hi,
Y'all, it's a pretty good day to be a Texas Democrat. And considering how rough it's been at times, I'm sitting here soaking it up.
This election is ours to win. All the signs point to it -- record-shattering voter turnout, months of neck-and-neck polls, hundreds of thousands of Texans working night and day to change the course of history. NBC News just said we're a toss-up. Millions of people across our country are standing with us and cheering us on.
The world is watching, Texas. And they damn well should be. We are the one state that can single handedly end Trump's reign of terror. However, we've only got six days left to do it.
Which is why I need your help to give 'em hell.
If we get every Texan to the polls, we will win this thing -- but it's going to take a massive, massive amount of horsepower. That means we need you pulling for us -- not tomorrow, not next Monday, but RIGHT THIS SECOND. We need to raise $46,792 to fund our Get Out The Vote operation. Can you chip in $7 or whatever you can by our midnight end-of-month deadline?

Have you seen the latest numbers? In five out of the last six polls, Biden beats Trump in Texas:
Morning Consult, August 2020
Joe Biden: 47% Donald Trump: 46%
Dallas Morning News/University of Texas at Tyler, July 2020
Joe Biden: 46% Donald Trump: 41%
Quinnipiac, July 2020

Fox News, June 2020
Joe Biden: 45% Donald Trump 44%
PPP, June 2020
Joe Biden: 48% Donald Trump: 48%
Texas is the biggest battleground state. And we've got Trump Republicans running scared, because they know if Democrats win Texas, they'll block the Republican path to the White House.
We have the momentum to win. Together, we're going to defeat Donald Trump, take out John Cornyn, ​send more Texas Democrats to Congress, ​take back the Texas House, and elect hundreds of Democrats in communities across the state.

Today, we are launching our first round of general election digital ads. Yep, that's right -- voting starts in just 22 days. So I cannot stress this enough: we need your support NOW.
TEXAS DEMOCRATIC PARTY GENERAL ELECTION DIGITAL ADS
Look, here's where we are at: there is a real chance that Texas will send a Democrat to the White House. We're in such good shape because Texans are fed up with Trump Republicans, and people like you, have been putting in the work. However, everything is riding on these next six weeks.
We cannot do another four years of Donald Trump. We can't slow down now, we have to kick into high gear.
The margins are going to be incredibly thin this fall, and we are fighting for every single vote to tip that balance. We're using digital ads to reach every new voter we can and make sure everyone on our side casts their ballot.
I need your help to make sure these ads reach as many Texans as possible. So, I'm asking: can you rush $7 or whatever you can to our digital ads fund to keep our ads in front of voters?

Texas Democrats,yellowdog@txdemocrats.org,the incredible Black leaders speaking at our Texas Democratic Convention,"Everywhere we turn, we see images that make us fearful for our country. We see a corrupt failure of a leader instigating violence and refusing to protect Black Americans, while celebrating our suffering over Twitter from the comfort of the White House.

Well, y'all, we're in the thick of it. Mail ballots are starting to come in. In three short days, early voting opens and Texans will start heading to the polls. And the stage is set for us to make a little history: in this week's poll, Joe Biden has a one-point lead on Trump in Texas. We are within the ""margin of hustle."" All we need to do is execute and we will win this thing and take that lead all the way to the White House.
Being on a campaign always feels like being caught in a whirlwind, but it's right about now that everything goes into overdrive.
The way things are looking, this team should be proud as hell of what we've built so far. We are on the cusp of FLIPPING the biggest battleground state in the country. Let that sink in for a minute. We are really about to turn Texas blue. That's because of YOU. Because of YOUR incredible heavy lifting. Not just this fall, but for months, for years, and for decades for some of us. And we're going to save the whole country because of it.
Now is when we put everything we've been building to the test. All of the work we have done comes down to the next 24 days. This is the most critical phase of this campaign: Get Out the Vote.
We are fighting for every single vote to flip Texas and make Donald Trump a one-term president. We can't do it without you.
If we get every last Texas Democrat to the polls, we will win Texas and save our country.

This is it. There's just one week left of early voting. We have nine days left to drive up our numbers to defeat Donald Trump. We need every Democrat in Texas to get out there and vote.
The past two weeks, Texans blew past our previous records for early voting turnout. The numbers are on our side. Momentum is on our side. However, the margin of this election is going to be razor-thin. And every one of us knows it: everything is on the line.
By voting early, you can make absolutely sure that come Election Day, your vote is already in the bank. Then, get your friends and family to do the same. If every single one of us puts in the work, we will rake in every last possible vote and elect Democrats across Texas.

Brittany Switzer,yellowdog@txdemocrats.org,we're launching something big,"Hey -- real quick:
From day one of the coronavirus crisis, Governor Greg Abbott refused to take the lead and mandate common-sense policies to curb the spread of the virus.
He was late in shutting down Texas, closing schools, and increasing testing and passed off the responsibility of governing to overwhelmed and understaffed county and local leaders.
Texas had a record 5,489 new cases yesterday and has had 12 straight days in a row with rising coronavirus hospitalizations.
Today, the Texas Democratic Party launched digital ads exposing Abbott's abysmal record on keeping Texans safe during this coronavirus pandemic. The record-breaking number of COVID-19 cases today and the fact that Texas has seen 12-straight days of record hospitalizations is because of Greg Abbott's failure to lead.
Let's elect more Texas Democrats!
Texans are suffering. We're seeing the catastrophic results of Abbott's failures.
We have to be in this fight together and we need your help to keep these ads up. No contribution is too small. I'm personally asking, can you make your first $7 contribution of 2020 so we can continue to expose Republican misinformation?

Did you hear about this yesterday? In a bombshell story by the Texas Tribune, indicted Texas Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton, Republican Governor Greg Abbott, and Republican Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick all have voted by mail.
The revelation comes after all of them have publicly come out against the Texas Democratic Party's lawsuit to expand vote by mail options to those under the age of 65 who don't want to risk their lives due to the coronavirus pandemic.
I wish I could say that I'm shocked but this is the norm for Texas Republicans. There's one set of rules for them and their donors, and another set of rules for working Texans. Texas Democrats will continue to protect our fundamental right to vote and the integrity of our elections.

Manny Garcia,yellowdog@txdemocrats.org,fwd: big news,"Hi,
Did you see this email from this morning? To win Texas, we need to build an organizing team as big as our great state. That means we need all hands on deck.
We're so thankful for the Democratic National Committee's investments in our organizing program. Our movement is growing bigger every day. After all, Texas is the biggest battleground state!
While we celebrate this amazing news, we can't rest. Republican special interests are pouring money into Republican bank accounts. What we've faced so far is nothing compared to what is coming.
We're so close to reaching our critical end-of-month fundraising goal. Can we count on you to chip in your first $7 contribution before our end-of-month deadline, our last deadline before Election Day?

Today, Texas Republican Governor Greg Abbott admitted that cases in Texas are spreading at an ""unacceptable rate.""
Under Abbott's failed leadership, Texas has now seen ten days in a row with rising cases and hospitalizations in Texas.
For months, Texas Democrats warned Republican Governor Abbott that rushing back into the way things were before the coronavirus without listening to medical professionals and scientists would be deadly.
In every single way, by every single metric, Governor Abbott and Texas Republicans have failed Texans.

Gilberto Hinojosa,yellowdog@txdemocrats.org,re: Families First Coronavirus Response Act,"Hi,
The American people need a well-coordinated, whole-of-government, fully-funded response to keep them safe from the coronavirus pandemic. That's why last night, House Democrats introduced the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, which includes:
* Free coronavirus testing for everyone who needs a test, including the uninsured;
* Paid emergency leave with both 14 days of paid sick leave and up to three months of paid family and medical leave;
* Enhanced Unemployment Insurance, a first step that will extend protections to furloughed workers;
* Strengthened food security initiatives, including SNAP, student meals, seniors nutrition and food banks;
* Clear protections for frontline workers, including health care workers and other workers who are in contact with those who have been exposed or are responsible for cleaning at-risk places;
* Increased federal funds for Medicaid, as states face increased costs.
It's imperative to the health of this country that both the House and Senate to pass this important bill. Learn more about the Families First Coronavirus Response Act and why we need this legislation now:
check it out
This is a national crisis. Congress must ensure the government has the resources needed to combat this deadly virus and keep Americans safe. We're focussing on people's health, not on political games right now. Republicans need to do the same.

Cliff Walker,yellowdog@txdemocrats.org,Right this moment,"Hi,
The most important election of our lifetimes is here, and it's going to be decided in Texas.
Texans are voting NOW. Literally, right now -- and in droves. Just yesterday, we saw the largest Day One voter turnout in Texas history. And from the look of it, Texas Democrats are showing no sign of letting up.
Y'all, this is it. We've got just under 3 weeks to get this done. We've worked for years for this moment. The time to be firing on all cylinders is NOW -- not November 3, not the weekend leading up to it, but today, right this minute.
Texans know exactly what the stakes are. Every single one of us is living and breathing the consequences of this failed presidency and all the Texas Republicans who closed ranks around Trump while selling us out. Because of that, more Texans than ever are coming out, voting blue, and ushering in a new era where our government truly represents us.
We have the numbers. We have the fire. But it's up to us to share that sense of urgency with and encourage millions of Texans to come out to the polls and cast their ballots. Whether we do that successfully will decide this election.
Today, I'm asking you to step up again and help bring this home. If you're ready to make your first donation, this is when it matters most. We are making a massive push to get Texas Democrats out to vote, but we need to raise $50,391 by midnight tomorrow to do that. Can you chip in another $7 or whatever you can to our Get Out The Vote Fund?

Dr. Carla D. Brailey,yellowdog@txdemocrats.org,Kamala has broken barriers,"Hi,
I am FIRED UP about our Democratic ticket -- and as a Black woman and a proud graduate of Howard University and member of the Divine 9, I can't tell you how thrilled I am that Joe Biden picked Kamala Harris to be our next Vice President.
Kamala has broken barriers throughout her career. The daughter of immigrants, she was the first African-American and first woman to serve as California's Attorney General, and only the second Black woman and first South Asian-American senator in history.
And when we win, not only will Kamala be our first woman vice president: she'll be the first Black woman and woman of South Asian descent. To put it plainly: Kamala is a trailblazer in every sense of the word, and she's a bold leader that our country can count on to help us chart a new path forward.
Our team at the Texas Democratic Party is committed to fighting our hearts out to elect Kamala, Joe Biden and Democrats up and down the ticket in November. So what do you say? Are you with us?
Add your first $7 donation to the Texas Democratic Party. Your contribution will help us fight to elect Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and Texas Democrats up and down the ballot.

Or, donate another amount
Black women are the backbone of the Democratic Party -- and I am so proud to see our fight, our struggle and our joy reflected back at us when Kamala speaks on the national stage.
But trust me -- the next 65 days are going to be a fight. She is already being hit with racist attacks from Donald Trump and his crew. We're going to have to work harder than ever to get Kamala and Joe over the finish line.
And while we're at it, we're working tirelessly to turn Texas blue -- including sending MJ Hegar to the Senate, expanding Texas' congressional delegation and flipping the Texas House.
It's going to take all of us. If you're with us in this work, please add your first $7 donation today to help us reach our end-of-month fundraising goal.

Manny Garcia,yellowdog@txdemocrats.org,wait 'til you hear about this,"Hey --
We caught wind that the Koch-backed super PAC will start funneling money into Texas as they've never had before. In fact, they are planning to spend on more races in Texas than any other state in the nation.
Of course, Republican billionaire super PACs are gearing up for a big spend against us. Polls this week showed Donald Trump losing Texas to Joe Biden, John Cornyn is underwater, and Texas Democrats taking back the Texas House.
The polls show that because our state party does things differently. There is so much to be proud of when we look at our state party. We're hosting virtual organizing events. We're holding townhalls. We're funded by small-dollar grassroots donors.
That's why we need to be ready to counter this Koch-backed super PAC.
No matter how big or small, each contribution sends a powerful message that Koch-backed super PACs can't buy this election. Make a $7 contribution to our rapid response fund right now:

Sender: Gina Calanni
Subject: so close
Hi,
I'm writing you today to ask you to help get more Texans their vote-by-mail applications. Before I do that, I want to explain why your $750 donation is so important.
When I ran for the Texas House as a Democrat in District 132 last year, after the polls had closed, and I waited for results to come in, I kept waiting... and waiting... and waiting.
Our race remained in limbo. Even though we were ahead, it was too close to call.
When all the votes were finally counted, I beat my Republican opponent by only 113 votes. We won by one of the slimmest margins in the Texas House.
The Texas Democrats vote-by-mail program made the difference between my victory and defeat. Without their vote-by-mail initiative, I wouldn't be where I am today. More importantly, we wouldn't have been able to restore funding to our neighborhood public schools, end surprise medical billing, and protect your voting rights in this past Texas Legislative session.
We're so close to flipping the Texas House. I need your help to do it. So, I'm asking:
Your Texas Democratic Party needs to send 925,000 vote-by-mail applications. Can you make a $7 contribution to the Texas Democratic Party so they can send 21 Texans their application?
If you've saved payment info with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
$7 = 21 applications
$25 = 75 applications
$50 = 150 applications
$100 = 300 applications
$250 = 750 applications

It's hard to believe 2020 is almost here. Everything we do right now puts us one step closer to flipping the Texas House and I can't thank you enough for everything you do.
Together, we can make this happen!

Texas State Representative, House District 132
The only way we will take back our state is if we all work together. We need to send 925,000 vote-by-mail applications and we only have 99,416 left to fund by tonight at midnight. Can you rush a $7 contribution to fund our vote-by-mail program?

Glen Maxey,yellowdog@txdemocrats.org,The horizon is here.,"Hi,
This is making an old man [[URL REDACTED]] I don't cry often. A record setting number of mail ballots, more than 3 million newly registered voters since 2016 who are overwhelmingly young people and people of color.
Texans broke records for turnout on the first day of early voting. That's right! Hundreds of thousands of Texans couldn't wait a second longer to vote Donald Trump out of the White House.
People were in line at 5 AM. Lines were out the door when the polls opened at a single early voting location. It was like people buying tickets to a rock concert or the Super Bowl, but better: they lined up to save Texas, save our country and save the world.
This election is a referendum on Trump's abject failure of a presidency. By the looks of it, Texans are resoundingly choosing to end this disaster. And with 38 electoral [[URL REDACTED]], let's just say we're going to make a Texas-sized statement.
Yep, you heard me. We're flipping Texas!
We've come this far because people like you believed in Texas when nobody else did. You saw the potential, and you saw the cost of Republicans running us into the ground. You poured heart and soul into a vision, somewhere on the horizon, of a Texas that serves TEXANS; not corporate lobbyists, not listless GOP incumbents, but the folks at the heart of this state.
Well guess what y'all -- the horizon is here.
We have three weeks left to give this everything we've got. We know we have the numbers to win this, but to get us over the line, we have to get every last Texas Democrat to come out of the woodwork and VOTE.
Our future is on the ballot and in our hands. We need you to keep believing in Texas and bring us over the line. We have $38,752 to go by MIDNIGHT TOMORROW to fund everything we're doing to win this election. Can you rush $7 or whatever you can to our Get Out the Vote Fund right now?

Hi,
I wanted to be the first to tell you -- y'all crushed our first voter registration goal. We've raised $11,126 for voter registration.
That's why we are setting a NEW voter registration goal of $17,500.
Our 2020 voter expansion program is the biggest in Texas history, and donors like you power it. We are in this together, and that's pretty damn cool if you ask me.
I cannot state the importance of this voter registration goal. Republicans are watching everything we do -- including Karl Rove, who is dumping money into Republican bank accounts.
We must show some big numbers and generate as many donations before tomorrow. We must keep these Republicans shaking in their boots because we aren't playing around.

Hi,
Texas is​n't ""the future"" of the Democratic Party. Texas is ""now​.""​ ​​More and more outlets -- including 538, The Economist and NBC -- ​are calling Texas a ""toss-up."" And ​every recent poll shows that Texas is a jump ball at the presidential level.​ ​
That's why Texas Republicans are running scared. Their major ​funders -- both in-state and outside groups -- are stepping up to pour millions into the state to try to drown us out​, scare voters​ and block our momentum.
We can't let them.
Rush a $7 donation to the Texas Democratic Party today to ensure we have the resources we need to deliver Texas to Joe Biden and Kamala Harris -- and elect Texas Democrats down the ticket. We need to raise $49,092 to reach our end-of-month fundraising goal, can you chip in?

Now, look, I'll be honest: Texas has never been the darling of outside Democratic groups. We've ​always ​had to carve our own path -- being as scrappy and creative as possible, and relying on grassroots donors like you, to power our movement.
At the start of the year, we had great ambitions to run a massive in-person organizing operation. But you know what they say about the best-laid plans! Once coronavirus reached our country, it became clear that we needed to ​adapt our strategy completely.
Thanks to your help and support, we were able to ​pivot and not skip a beat.
We've called more than ​a million voters. Texted more than 1.5 million voters. Mailed more than 818,000 voter registration cards and more than 250,000 National Change of Address ​voter registration​ applications​ in just the past two weeks​. And this team has reached every grassroots fundraising goal we've set.
Now, with just 69 days until Election Day, you know the Republicans are going to pull out all the stops. That's why we can't afford to take our foot off the gas. Not for one second.
Add your first donation of $7 or more to help our team at the Texas Democratic Party reach our end-of-month fundraising goal.
In the fight,
Cliff Walker
Deputy Executive Director, Texas Democratic Party

Dr. Carla D. Brailey,yellowdog@txdemocrats.org,this is our chance,"Hi,
In just under 100 days, we have a chance to do something that hasn't been done in decades: we have a chance to turn Texas blue and deliver our 38 Electoral College votes to a Democratic president.
Winning in November isn't just about beating Donald Trump and electing Joe Biden. We have a real shot at getting John Cornyn out of the Senate; ​expanding our Texas congressional delegation; ​setting the agenda in the Texas Senate; ​flipping the Texas House; and electing hundreds of local Democrats across the state.
The coronavirus pandemic forced us to rework our Path to Victory. It's no longer safe to connect with voters using the techniques we've relied on in the past -- like knocking on doors and gathering in-person for phone banks and block-walks.
In a moment, I want to share more about Texas Democrats' new Path to Victory. But first, I need to ask:
Will you make your first $7 donation of 2020 to help us reach our end-of-month fundraising goal? Every contribution helps us keep fighting to turn Texas blue and elect Democrats up and down the ballot.
If you've saved payment info with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Express Donate: $7
Express Donate: $10
Express Donate: $25
Express Donate: $50
Express Donate: $100
Or, donate another amount
Over a year ago, we announced our Path to Victory -- but the coronavirus forced us to adapt and update our plan. Our new plan will require innovation, a large investment in our digital infrastructure, and hiring more talented operatives to help us deliver victories up and down the ballot.
When you donate today, you're help fund some of the key components of our new Path to Victory:
* Organizing in the Time of the Coronavirus: We're running a digital-first program that includes digital organizing and a seven-figure investment in digital ads to reach and persuade voters.
* Reaching out to new voters: Texas has millions of registered Democratic voters who don't always vote. We're reaching out to them and motivating them to vote in this election. We're also targeting and persuading moderate and independent voters who are fed up with Trump to vote for Democrats.
* Running a coordinated campaign as BIG as Texas: We're running the largest coordinated campaign in Texas history. This is a fully integrated effort to elect Democrats up and down the ballot -- including data, training, county party support, candidate services, and organizing.
Executing on the winning strategy laid out in our new Path to Victory is going to take a massive investment in our team's infrastructure -- and today, I'm inviting you to support our efforts.
Make your first $7 donation of 2020 to help us reach our end-of-month fundraising goal and ensure we have the resources we need to run a winning campaign.

I won't sugarcoat it: there's a lot of work to do between now and November 3. But now's not the time to get overwhelmed -- it's time to get to work. If we all pull our weight, I know we can win in November.

Hi,
This administration's corruption was clear long before Donald Trump even set foot in the Oval Office. But nothing has underscored his inability to lead quite like this administration's response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
People are out of work, hungry, suffering and dying. The United States has more than 4.2 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 and more than 150,000 people have died. The situation is dire and is getting worse -- but it didn't have to be this way. The truth is, one man is responsible: President Donald Trump.
More and more polls show that we have a real shot at ending our national nightmare in November -- to get Trump out of office and elect Joe Biden. We also have a real shot at flipping the biggest battleground state in the country: Texas.
That's why I'm asking you to join me in supporting the Texas Democratic Party today. If we turn Texas blue, we can guarantee we've blocked Donald Trump's path back to the White House.
Rush your first $7 donation of 2020 right now to help block Trump's path to the White House and turn Texas blue.

Thanks to the hard work of thousands of grassroots activists, Texas has been trending more and more blue with each election -- and now, Donald Trump and Joe Biden are neck-and-neck in the Lone Star State.
But let me be clear: winning in November isn't just about electing Joe Biden. We must elect Democrats up and down the ballot who will fight on behalf of working people.
If we flip Texas, we have a real shot at sending MJ Hegar to work alongside me in the Senate; expanding the Texas Democratic delegation in Congress; flipping the Texas House; and electing more Democrats down the ticket. The impact of these victories would be felt for years.
The Texas Democratic Party has a plan to win in November, and I'm proud to support their efforts. Help turn Texas blue by adding your first $7 donation of 2020 today.

Cliff Walker,yellowdog@txdemocrats.org,Fwd: Biden & Trump are tied in Texas!,"Hi,
Well, y'all, the polls are holding steady. Biden and Trump are neck-and-neck in Texas.
This latest poll just confirms what we've known all along: this is a dogfight. It's going to be a very, very tight race all the way to the finish line.
We can do this. We've been in high gear ever since Donald Trump got elected and we are kicking into higher gear now. Here's how we make this happen. With just 7 days left until the voter registration deadline, we are in an all-out final push to get eligible Texans registered to vote. After that, we'll be focusing every ounce of our efforts on getting Texans to the polls -- because there are more folks who share our values than theirs. That's how we flip this state.
To get this done, we are 100% depending on grassroots donors like you. We've got $64,972 left to go to meet our final end-of-quarter fundraising deadline and turn Texas blue. Can you rush your first $7 to get us there?

I grew up in Missouri City, just outside of Houston, and graduated from the University of Texas at Austin (Hook 'em!). So while I've had the privilege of working on campaigns across the world, trust me when I say -- nothing will make me happier than flipping Texas.
Texas is the biggest battleground state in the country. If we flip Texas, we'll completely block Trump's path to re-election. Plus, we have a real shot at replacing John Cornyn with MJ Hegar, and electing Texas Democrats up and down the ballot.
In 2018, we almost got it done. This year, it could come down to less than a percentage point. We've gotta work like we're behind, and we've gotta make sure the Texas Democratic Party reaches every single fundraising goal they set. That's why I'm asking you today:

Glen Maxey,yellowdog@txdemocrats.org,just unbelievable.,"Hi,
Can you believe this?
Republican Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick suggested that seniors are willing to die during the coronavirus epidemic to ""save the economy.""
You read that right.
Seniors should be willing to die because of the coronavirus to save the economy.
Here's what I have to say: The lives of our families, our friends, and our communities have no dollar amount. Healthcare is a human right.
Republicans are not here to protect you or your family. The only thing they are concerned about is enriching themselves and their stock portfolios. They would see our family members die to bail out wall street.
I'm not a grandparent myself, but I've raised and mentored legions of young people (including helping about 100 high school and college kids run for national delegate right now). And I want like hell for all of them to have a bright, safe and healthy future -- personally and for the economy, they'll inherit.
If you are a grandparent or you have a grandparent, we want to hear from you. We are collecting stories from Texans who have been impacted by the coronavirus outbreak. We want to amplify Texans' voices across our state, because now more than ever, we need to restore our sense of community.
So, I have to ask: Will you share your coronavirus experience with us? It's so important that we drown out the Republican recklessness with real, human stories. Tell us your story:
Share your story
Let's fight like hell,
Glen Maxey
Former State Representative
P.S. I'm a senior, Dan. If I do die, I'm leaving my fortunes as they are to the Texas Democratic Party to help remove out of touch right-wingers from office. And I'm changing it right now to target Dan Patrick and Donald Trump first.

Rose Clouston,yellowdog@txdemocrats.org,re: quick update,"Hi,
I wanted to update you on our voter protection program.
Yesterday, the Texas Democratic Party amended our federal vote-by-mail lawsuit and filed a motion for preliminary injunction to provide Texas voters and election officials the clarity they need in advance of the July 14 primary runoff election.
While voters of all ages are being affected by the novel coronavirus, only those who are 65 and older may be fully confident in their ability to vote by mail. Meanwhile, younger voters are left to navigate the patchwork of interpretations and public-facing information that varies county by county as they try to determine whether they are eligible for a vote-by-mail ballot.
Voters should never have to choose between their health and their right to vote. Every Texas voter who is social distancing to avoid COVID-19 should be able to vote by mail, no matter how old they are.
Voting by mail is safe and secure. It allows more voters to participate in our democracy, and it's a commonsense way to run an election, especially during a public health crisis. That's why I have to ask: can you chip in $7 to our voter protection program before our critical fundraising midnight deadline?

Glen Maxey,yellowdog@txdemocrats.org,Running on trust,"Hi,
This is it, folks. Voting starts in 15 days. Election Day is in 36 days. We've got one more month to do every last thing in our power to make Donald Trump a one-term president.
The end of September is our last end-of-quarter fundraising deadline before the most critical election of our lifetimes. I know it, and you know it. Every single member of this team is about to put in an absolutely Herculean effort to GET TEXANS OUT TO VOTE. Everything we've been building towards -- for years and decades -- comes down to our work between now and November 3: getting Texans to the polls and bringing in the votes to finally end Republicans' reign of terror against our families.
This campaign runs on trust. There is some dark, dark bullsh*t happening in the United States of America, and nowhere more so than in Texas. Trump Republicans are putting our communities through a hell of a lot, and they're not slowing down, either.
Right now, Trump Republicans are trying to push through a Supreme Court nominee against the will of the American people. If they succeed, healthcare will be dismantled for millions of Texans while millions more will lose protections for pre-existing conditions in the middle of the deadliest pandemic in United States history.
In the face of that -- to fight against all of it -- we have to trust each other. We are each other's greatest hope. As long as we have that, we will keep moving forward, and have the energy to work as hard as we have to to flip this state blue.
Texas -- and the whole country -- is counting on us. On this team. So I'm leaning on you today.
Can we get this done? Hell, yeah. Is it up to YOU? You bet.
We've got $89,284 to go to meet our last end-of-quarter fundraising deadline and to finally turn Texas blue. Chip in your first $7 of 2020 to power the final 36 days of this election:

Cristela Alonzo,yellowdog@txdemocrats.org,"hi, it's me, Cristela!","Hi,
I know a thing or two about making history as the first Latina to write, star, and produce in a network sitcom show. I know that the work isn't always glamorous and doesn't always make it onto TV.
I'm also the first Latina to star in a Disney Pixar movie, but more important than all of that -- I am a first generation Mexican-American that was born and raised in San Juan, Texas - the Rio Grande Valley. And what happens in my home state is very important to me.
Today, I'm reaching out to you for your help to make history. We're so close to flipping Texas and it's because of the work of Democrats, like you. Registering new voters, calling tu abuela to remind her to send in her vote-by-mail application, and mobilizing our communities. All of this work takes money -- and that is why I am emailing you today.
I'm going all in with Texas Democrats. Congressman Joaquin Castro, Lloyd Doggett, and Marc Veasey have pledged to go all in. Match their contributions and double their impact. Go all in with Texas Democrats.
We've set a goal of 1,750 Turn Texas Blue donors TODAY. We've only got a few hours to go. If you can spare $7 to our Turn Texas Blue Fund, we will not only meet our goal but exceed it:

You play one of the biggest roles in the work that we do. Everything we do now will determine how far we go in November, we need you in our grassroots movement with us. Texas Democrats are 1,653 donors short of reaching our goal -- can you chip in $7 to their Turn Texas Blue Fund?

Tammy Duckworth,yellowdog@txdemocrats.org,"Joe Biden, Kamala Harris and Texas","Hi,
When Joe Biden selected Kamala Harris to be his candidate for Vice President, it didn't take long for Trump and his cronies to gin up a racist smear campaign against her.
Because that's what Trump does. He uses racist attacks to try to divide us to distract from his failure to lead our nation. His goal isn't to make -- or keep -- America great. It's to keep himself in power, whatever the cost.
We've got to do everything we can to defeat Donald Trump and elect Democrats up and down the ballot in this election. Texas is one of the biggest battleground states in the country -- and flipping the state would effectively block Trump's path to the White House. That's why I'm asking:
Will you rush your first $7 donation to the Texas Democratic Party? Your donation will help them reach their end-of-month fundraising goal to ensure they have the resources they need to turn Texas blue.
If you've saved payment info with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Express Donate: $7
Express Donate: $10
Express Donate: $25
Express Donate: $50
Express Donate: $100
Or, donate another amount
We need to buckle down and work as hard as we can to elect Joe and Kamala. Our nation needs a President -- and our troops deserve a Commander in Chief -- who is competent and effective, and who has the empathy needed to lead our great, diverse country through these difficult times.
But it's about more than just electing Joe. We have an opportunity to elect Democratic leaders up and down the ticket who will fight for working families. In Texas, that means electing MJ Hegar to fight alongside me in the Senate; expanding the Texas Democratic congressional delegation; break the supermajority in the Texas Senate; FLIP the Texas House; and elect Democrats in local elections across the state.
I know that we can win in November and turn Texas blue. If you're with me, consider making a $7 contribution to the Texas Democratic Party today.
All my best,
Tammy Duckworth

The voter registration deadline is coming up fast. Don't wait -- this election is too important. We can win this because we have you on our team. Every single vote counts.
Democrats are pulling ahead in Texas. But I'll be honest: this is going to be a very close fight right up to Election Day. We need every single vote we can get to defeat Donald Trump.
This week, we set a goal of contacting 1 million unregistered Texans. Thanks to volunteers like you, we're well on our way to knocking that goal out of the water -- so we're upping our goal to 1.5 million! That's why I'm asking you, can you join our voter registration week of action and help get us over the line? Sign up right now:

Then take the next step. We can't take any chances -- we need every eligible voter to cast their ballot. Make sure you're registered to vote at your current address -- and if not, get registered today. It's super easy:

I want to make sure you saw this email from Glen earlier today.
Y'all, when Glen Maxey musters the troops, he ain't messing around. And we just heard that [[URL REDACTED]] thinks there's a real chance Texas sends Joe Biden to the White House this fall. It's a big, big deal that the biggest polling heavyweights are seeing the impact of all the work we're doing to make Texas the biggest battleground state.
They and countless folks across the country are waking up to what we've known for a while: Texas is turning blue. This is our moment, but to make it happen, we have to keep our head in the game.
This is our absolute last chance to register Texans to vote in time for the fall. With all the opportunities up and down the ballot, we can tip the balance in lots of races with just these new voters -- but only if every single one of us steps up to the plate.
The voter registration deadline is 21 days out and we need to raise $38,492 to register Texans and power our final push. So, I'm asking: can you chip in your first $7 of 2020 to our voter registration fund today?

Subject: This is our last chance to register Texans.
Hi,
We are 50 days away from flipping Texas.
Now, without dwelling too much on my age, I can tell you -- I've been waiting for this for a long time. Texas is turning blue because folks like you said HELL NO to Trump Republicans and you've been putting in the work to back it up.
I'll put it simply: there are more of us than them. When Texans come out to vote this fall, Democrats will win. Texas Republicans know it, and they are terrified which is why they've been dumping PAC money left, right, and center as a lifeline to vulnerable Republicans.
However, I'm not under any illusions: we are fighting for every last vote in this state. With millions of unregistered Democrats out there, voter registration is our secret weapon. However, we only have 21 days left to register Texans before the deadline. So, I need your help.
We all know how high the stakes are. During this pandemic, John Cornyn, Greg Abbott, and Republicans across the state have shown us their true colors beyond a doubt: they are more concerned with looking out for Donald Trump than protecting Texas families. Texas Republicans aren't here for us, and they deserve to be voted out.
This is our last chance to register Texans, and everything we've worked for is riding on this. We need to raise $54,877 dollars to our voter registration fund before our mid-month September 15 fundraising deadline. Can you rush your first $7 of 2020 to our voter registration fund today?

Manny Garcia,yellowdog@txdemocrats.org,re: razor edge,"Hi,
Another new poll came out this weekend showing Democrats on the razor's edge of flipping Texas. Key takeaways from the Dallas Morning News poll include:
* Biden and Trump tied in the state of Texas (43-43).
* Biden leading among independents in Texas by 15 points (43-28).
* Texans support the ability to vote-by-mail by a resounding 58-23 split, including more Republicans supporting this common-sense measure than opposing.
* John Cornyn earning at-most 37% of the vote (abysmal for an incumbent whose been in Washington the past twenty years)
* Texas Democrats holding a lead over Texas Republicans in the battle for the state House.
Across the state of Texas, Texans are demanding change. They understand that Texas Democrats are fighting to keep our families safe, increase access to healthcare, provide responsible leadership in this time of crisis, and create an economic plan that looks out for working Texans.
Texans are looking for leaders like Joe Biden who will fight for their fair shot to get ahead.
We will win the White House, take out John Cornyn, flip several competitive Congressional seats, break the supermajority in the Texas Senate, take back the Texas House, and win hundreds of local elections across the state of Texas. Our time is now.
Our time is now. We must keep our momentum going. That's why I need you to rush your first $7 contribution of 2020 to our rapid response fund today:

Rose Clouston,yellowdog@txdemocrats.org,UPDATE:,"Hi,
I have good news, and I have bad news. The good news: Two days ago, we got a favorable ruling in the federal district court on our lawsuit to allow Texans to vote by mail during this pandemic. Bad news: Yesterday the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit put that ruling on hold.
While the question of who is eligible to vote by mail is being worked out in the courts, one thing is certain: We will have thousands of in-person polling places open across Texas on July 14th for our primary runoff election, and they need to be staffed.
Whether this is your first time or you're a seasoned pro, you will receive all the training you need. So I'm personally asking you: Will you help our democracy and be an election worker?
yes, sign me up!
Being an election worker means that you will be able to have an impact on the 2020 elections and serve your community. It's fun: You check voters in, answer their questions, and ensure everyone has a positive voting experience. Best of all, you get paid!

Look -- poll after poll shows Joe Biden beating Donald Trump by one point in Texas. That's right, one point. When you wake up on November 4, the day after Election Day, will you be able to say you were the reason Texas turned blue -or- worse will you regret not volunteering?
We need 3,000 volunteers to sign up for a volunteer shift this week. Can I count on you to sign up for a phone banking shift today?

This election is very, very, very close. Right now, millions of Texans are eligible to vote but are not currently registered. We're going to change that because we know when more of us vote, Democrats win.
With just 43 days till voting starts, we've got to stay focused and bring in new voters NOW. If we get this right, we will flip Texas and send Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to the White House.
We will get there if we work together.
See you online,
Brittany Switzer

Manny Garcia,yellowdog@txdemocrats.org,I have some good news and some get-to-work news.,"Texas Republicans and Karl Rove are dumping money into this election to protect vulnerable Republicans.
Hey --
I have some good news and some get-to-work news: Texas Republicans just announced that -- with the help of Karl Rove -- they are dumping six-figure PAC money into this election to protect their vulnerable Republicans.
They are absolutely terrified of the gains we are about to make in Texas.
They know we are on track to send a wave of Democrats to the Texas House -- just in time to draw fair electoral districts and beat back Republican gerrymandering.
This Karl Rove PAC money is a last-ditch effort to stop us. However, it's the kind of money that tips elections against the voice of the people. So, I'm asking for your help today. Can you rush your first $7 of 2020 to our digital ads fund to elect incredible Democrats across the state and take back the Texas House?

We need to take back the Texas House this year. Right now, the prospects are looking really, really good. However, the GOP is not going down without a fight.
These Texas Republicans have been in office long enough. They've shown they are only at the State House for their bottom line -- not to protect our families or serve our communities.
Every single Democrat running for the Texas House right now has our communities at heart and will fight for us every day. It's our job to fight now and get them elected.
Voting starts in just 39 days. Chip in your first $7 to the Texas Democratic Party to get us over the finish line and flip the Texas House.
Thanks so much -- now let's get to work,

Tonight is the first presidential debate, and I wanted to check-in. This is an important moment in the election cycle. For many folks, tonight is the first time they'll fully tune in to everything that's at stake in this election.
This is our moment, and we need you with us.
Tonight, Joe Biden is going to speak directly to the American people. He's going to talk about his plan to contain the coronavirus and build our country back better. He will share his vision for the future and everything he will do for our families.
Voters across the country are worried about losing their job or their small businesses closing. They are concerned about their loved ones and if they will get the coronavirus. They are balancing work while making sure their kids learn remotely from home.
Joe Biden hears us, and he is here to fight for our families. The contrast between our next president and our current one could not be starker.
This is it. We have 35 days to elect Joe Biden and defeat Trump. Rush $7 or whatever you can today:

In contrast, Trump's failures will be on full display tonight.
President Trump lied to the American people about the coronavirus and how deadly it is. Because he didn't have a plan, 200,000 Americans paid with their lives, and millions are unemployed.
Trump's presidency has cost Americans everything. We have 35 days to fight with everything we've got -- like our lives depend on it -- to send Joe Biden to the White House.

Brittany Switzer,yellowdog@txdemocrats.org,a few of my thoughts,"Hey -- I want to talk about why this election is so important and how the coronavirus exposed deep systematic problems in our country.
I've been hearing, reading, and following the stories you shared with us about how the coronavirus has affected your family. One of the recurring stories people have shared over and over with me is about how they lost their job. I know the fear they face because my partner lost his job too.
I think about the Texans who have been left unemployed and because of that lost their health insurance, as I think about what we're going to do. The magnitude of this crisis weighs on me -- as I am sure it does on you too.
That brings me back to this election. One of the things I know I can do is work harder than ever. We must defeat Donald Trump and John Cornyn. We need a Democratic president and Democratic Congress so we can fix our country's healthcare system and re-build our economy so that it puts working families front and center.
We're single digits away from making this happen. We're so close to flipping Texas. When that happens, millions of Americans' lives will be better. I am doing everything I can to make that happen.
That's why I am emailing you today.
If we're going to recover from this global health crisis and be a stronger country than we were before. I need your help hitting our April end-of-month fundraising goal. We're $23,581 short of our goal. Every single dollar you give goes to electing Democrats.

Julian Castro,yellowdog@txdemocrats.org,You chose to keep going,"Hi,
There's a reason Kamala Harris is campaigning in Texas today and it's because of every single one of you.
You know, growing up, my mom taught me that if you want to make change in your community, you don't wait -- you work. You make your future happen.
At a time in our nation's history when absolutely everything is on the line, Texas Democrats have done what some people thought impossible. You've carried this state within inches of turning blue. Inches. And when it does, Texas will block Donald Trump's path back to the White House.
Now, it's time to fight even harder.
In four short days, we are going to show the world who we really are. But not without your help. That's why I'm asking: can you rush a $7 contribution or whatever you can to the Texas Democratic Party's critical end-of-month fundraising deadline?

I don't need to tell you how much pain this president has put our country through because we've all been living it -- nowhere more so than in Texas. The way we've gotten through it is by pulling together and pushing through.
We win by showing up for each other and pushing forward. It's that simple. So today, we have to come together and put every last scrap of our energy into clearing this final hurdle. When we win Texas -- when we take back our state -- every bit of effort will be worth it.
This is our last chance to put in the work. If you're with me, donate your first $7 or whatever you can to win this election today:

Gilberto Hinojosa,yellowdog@txdemocrats.org,Garcia v. Abbott,"Hi,
When we started our vote by mail lawsuit, we promised Texas voters that we'd never stop fighting for their right to vote.
Today, we are continuing our promise by petitioning the United States Supreme Court to provide all Texans their free, fair, and equal right to vote.
There's no logical reason for those whose 65th birthday is the day after Election Day to have to go to the polling place in person while their 65-year-old spouse can vote a mail ballot -- especially during the worst pandemic in a century.
Let's make no mistake about why we're back at the Supreme Court again. Texas Republicans are hell-bent on discriminating against and blocking Texas' new diverse majority from casting their ballot. We have not -- and never will -- stand by as Republicans discriminate against hard-working Texans trying to cast their ballot.
We are proud to bring this case to the Supreme Court to make voting easier and more equal for all Texans. We need your help. Can you chip in a $7 contribution to our voter protection fund?

I'm excited to join Speaker Nancy Pelosi at the historic, one-of-a-kind Texas Democratic Convention next week.
Texas Democrats never back down from a fight. Our work is not done and we will not rest until we take back the Texas House, just like the Democratic House that the honorable House Speaker Nancy Pelosi leads with tenacity and fire.
After all, they don't call us the biggest battleground state for nothing. Texas Democrats have the biggest voter registration program in our Party's history, biggest coordinated campaign in Texas history, and the biggest state convention. We didn't get there without you though.
That's what the Texas Democratic Convention is all about -- connecting with our collective communities for one single cause: a fair shot for all. Uplifting the issues that matter to you most is just step one of how we're going to win in November.
With you on our side, we're building a Democratic movement that will flip this state and block the Republican path to the White House. Can you make a $7 contribution:

What a year this is shaping up to be, and we're only in January. Texas is the biggest battleground state, and that's why we're working harder than ever to close the gap. With your support this month, Texas Democrats were able to:
* Launch an expansive program to target 2.6 million unregistered Democratic voters,
* Hire constituency organizers to mobilize our Democratic coalition,
* Start our second Staff The Movement Academy, and
* Sent over 925,000 vote-by-mail applications to Texans.
This is only the beginning. We're building the largest infrastructure in Texas history, and that's all thanks to you. You've been a huge supporter of our state party. I can't thank you enough for everything you've done. Without Texas, Trump can't win in 2020. This is the fight that's going to shape our political future, and your continued support is how we're going win.

Elizabeth Warren,yellowdog@txdemocrats.org,Texas has a special place in my heart,",
Texas has a special place in my heart. It's where I got my second chance at college -- for only $50 a semester -- at the University of Houston, and it's where I started studying why the path to economic security has gotten so steep and rocky for working families.
This year, we have a real shot at flipping Texas -- as long as every voter can safely make their voice heard. But Texas Republicans are doubling down on voter suppression, so we need to fight back even harder.
For decades, the state GOP has used discriminatory voter ID laws and gerrymandering to make it harder for Texans to vote. Now, they're asking Texans to make a heartbreaking choice: risk exposure to the coronavirus to vote, or sit this election out. Nobody should have to make that decision. That's why I'm reaching out today and asking for your help.
Our friends at the Texas Democratic Party are fighting to make sure as many Texans as possible are able to vote safely -- and they've set a huge goal of sending more than 815,000 vote-by-mail applications to Texans across the state. It's a steep goal, but they can meet it if enough people pitch in to help out. Can you support their efforts today?
Add a $1 contribution right now and the Texas Democratic Party will send 2 Texans their vote-by-mail application.
If you've saved payment info with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
$1 = 2 applications
$25 = 50 applications
$50 = 100 applications
$100 = 200 applications
$250 = 500 applications

Something big is happening in Texas: recent polls show Joe Biden and Donald Trump just a few points apart, and Senator John Cornyn's approval ratings are dropping.
Winning in Texas isn't just about electing Joe Biden. We have a chance to send MJ Hegar to the U.S. Senate, expand our House majority, and elect leaders up and down the ballot who will fight for big ideas and bold reform -- leaders who will put working people first.
If you agree every person should be able to vote without risking their safety or the safety of their community, I'm asking if you can make a contribution today.
We can flip Texas in 2020. Click here to add a $1 contribution. Your donation will allow the Texas Democratic Party to send 2 Texans a vote-by-mail application.

Chip in now
Hi,
This is it. Less than one week out. And I wanted to make sure you saw this message from Beto.
Two years ago, we came within 215,000 votes of electing Beto O'Rourke. That may sound like a lot, but in Texas terms, that's peanuts. And since then, over a million new Texans have registered to vote -- more than five times the number we would have needed to win back then.
Those new voters? Most of them are Democrats. And you'd better believe they're voting.
This is our Texas. This is who we are today, right now. We are the biggest battleground state in the country and we are poised to win. When Texas goes blue -- we won't just beat Trump, we'll defeat Trumpism, itself. We're going to steer our entire country away from the brink -- to put it simply, it's going to be electrifying.
I know y'all are tired. Heck, I'd be shocked if you weren't. You've been doing the impossible and moving mountains for a hell of a long time. You showed up and you stuck with it and you gritted your teeth and dug deep and now, we are inches away from that finish line.
I need to ask you to do it again one more time. You know, when you watch a distance race, the great runners are the ones who ignore their opponents and tune out the noise and focus like a laser on that single objective: crossing that line. And the mark of a winner is that the closer they get, the harder they run. We need to forget about everything but the goal. And we need to push for that line with every scrap of intention we've got.
We have six more days to put in the work and pull in the votes. We need to raise $42,357 to power the biggest Get Out The Vote operation this state has ever seen. Now is the time to hold nothing back. Rush $7 to win this election and turn Texas blue:

Subject: This is the year
We are seven days out from making history.
This is the year Texas turns blue up and down the ballot.
We all know it couldn't come at a better or more necessary time. Every one of us has seen the hate and division Donald Trump has put our country through, and the outright harm he's done to Texas families and Texas communities.
After yesterday, we are hurting even more, and I'd be wrong not to acknowledge it. We are one week out from Election Day and the Republican Senate just sold its soul to confirm an extreme right-wing justice to the Supreme Court, through a process so rushed and illegitimate it almost beggars belief. Trump Republicans put Amy Coney Barrett on the Supreme Court to strip millions of Americans of their healthcare. It could not be more clear, more cruel, or more in character.
Today, every single one of us has stepped up to say, ""enough."" With 38 electoral votes, our state is the path to the presidency. We are going to deliver every one of them to Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and break Donald Trump's grip on the presidency once and for all.
But, both of us know this started a long time ago. Texas is turning blue because folks like you have poured your heart and soul into inching us closer, year after year. You never gave up on the dream or on each other. And now, we're finally here.
I am so damn proud of our brilliant, unstoppable team. We are doing the work and the result is going to send shockwaves across this country.
We've made it this far because of you. Our work isn't over yet and with 7 days till election day, we can't rest. That's why I'm asking you personally, can you rush your first $7 contribution of 2020 to the Texas Democratic Party's Get Out The Vote Fund before their critical midnight deadline?

Right now, for the first time in 20 years, Democrats can win a majority in the Texas House -- drawing a decade's worth of fair electoral districts so that Texans can truly choose who represents them.
We can send MJ Hegar to Washington and give Texas a real voice in the Senate.
We can elect a powerhouse slate of Democrats in communities across Texas -- folks who are fighting to serve our communities instead of just pandering to wealth and power.
But make no mistake. Republicans are fighting right now to claw back this election against the tide of change. We have to be the ones who fight harder.
For the next seven days, we have to get as tired as we can pushing as hard as we can to get every last Democrat to the polls. That's how we win Texas and save our country. I'm calling on you today to help us see this through.
Can you donate $7 or whatever you can before midnight?

Gilberto Hinojosa,yellowdog@txdemocrats.org,"On this anniversary of September 11, we must recommit ourselves to the values we share as Americans and ensure that hope and compassion always outlast fear and hatred.","Hi,
Nineteen years later, we remember the lives lost in our nation's worst terrorist attack. We honor the lives of those we lost and the brave and selfless responders who put themselves in harm's way to save their fellow Americans.
In the midst of tragedy, countless heroes stepped forward. First responders raced up the stairs, rushed into the rubble, and put their lives on the line to save others. Firefighters, police officers, men and women in uniform, and countless others answered devastation with selflessness and courage.
Those same law enforcement officers and first responders are now once again placed in harm's way. This time the attacker is the silent and deadly killer. The coronavirus has claimed more police officers' lives than any other cause. I've heard it said and it's worth repeating, it didn't have to be this way.
We stood together as a nation following one of the worst attacks on American soil. Today, we must do the same. We offer each other the same level of compassion to overcome this pandemic, economic crisis, and social injustices to build our nation back better.
On this anniversary of September 11, we must recommit ourselves to the values we share as Americans and ensure that hope and compassion always outlast fear and hatred.
We need leaders who respect our frontline heroes and will fight for our country.

Did you see this? Governor Abbott just announced he is dramatically cutting back on places voters can hand-deliver their mail-ballots -- making it harder for Texans to cast their vote.
Republicans are on the verge of losing, so Governor Abbott is trying to adjust the rules last minute. Courts all over the country, including the Fifth Circuit yesterday, have held that it is too late to change election rules, but our failed Republican leadership will try anyway.
Make no mistake, Democracy itself is on the ballot. Every Texan must get out and vote these cowards out!

Throughout the Texas Democratic Convention, I've learned so much from our lineup of speakers, panels, and dynamic trainings. We've brought Texas Democrats together in order to turn Texas blue and create a more equitable, just future in our state.
Now more than ever, I'm so proud to be working in the biggest battleground state in the nation.

We spend hours phone banking, canvassing, volunteering, and so much more for a single common cause: a fair shot for all.
I'm reaching out to you today because we're powered by small-dollar grassroots donors just like you. Unlike Republicans, our votes and elected officials can't be bought. And that's the truth.
Before you know it, it will be November and we'll be voting in the most critical election of our lifetimes. We need your support in order to stay in the fight through Election Day and beyond. Can you rush in a contribution of $7 today to our Turn Texas Blue Fund?

Dr. Carla D. Brailey,yellowdog@txdemocrats.org,don't miss this,",
We are at a pivotal point in the history of our country. We are being tested in ways we have never seen before. The grief and heartache of watching yet another Black person die at the hands of police brutality and the overwhelming pain spilling into our streets has tested the resolve of us all.
As Black Americans, our very existence is a bold act of rebellion and still, we are the realization of our ancestors' wildest dreams. Black people have always been resilient. We're a community that has known first-hand what it takes to progress forward. Our resilience will continue to help us move our democracy.
We are indebted to the fortitude and strength of those who walked through fire hoses for the right to vote, to get an education, to sit wherever they wanted on a bus. But unfortunately in many ways, we are still fighting those same fights.
As the Texas Democratic Convention begins today, the past week's events are a painful reminder of why we are here and the magnitude of work ahead of us. We are committed to fighting for the dismantling of the unjust two-tiered American justice system rooted in white supremacy.
That's why I wanted to let you know that I'm hosting these events at the Texas Democratic Convention. By holding space with each other to grieve, reminisce, and remember why we're in this movement, we will be able to march forward and heal together.

Luke Warford,yellowdog@txdemocrats.org,The voter registration deadline is 15 days away -- don't sit this one out.,"Hi,
The voter registration deadline is just 15 days away. We both know we can't take any chances -- this election is just too important. That's why I'm asking you to double check that you're registered to vote at your current address, or get registered if you're not already.
Here's the deal: in 2016, Trump won three key states -- Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin -- by a TOTAL of 80,000 votes.
Texas has almost as many electoral votes as those three states combined. If we flip Texas, we block the Republican path to the White House. However, the margin of victory is going to be even thinner. It's going to take every single vote to win -- including yours.
I need you to check right now to make sure your registration is current, and get every friend and family member you can to do the same:
Check my registration
Don't wait until the last minute, and don't sit this out. Every single vote counts.

Texas is changing, and the eyes of the world are on all of us to get this done and turn Texas blue.
Thanks to Democrats like you, we've made serious gains. We launched the most expansive voter protection initiative in Texas history, not to mention we're spearheading a statewide voter expansion program, and registering millions of new Democratic voters.

We can't win this fight without you. Everything we do leading up to the November election will determine how far we go. This isn't going to be easy, and we need you on our side. We're only $9,856 away from reaching our fundraising goal. So I have to ask, can you rush your first $7 contribution of 2020 before our end-of-month deadline?

Beto O'Rourke,yellowdog@txdemocrats.org,This is the year,"We are seven days out from making history.
This is the year Texas turns blue up and down the ballot.
We all know it couldn't come at a better or more necessary time. Every one of us has seen the hate and division Donald Trump has put our country through, and the outright harm he's done to Texas families and Texas communities.
After yesterday, we are hurting even more, and I'd be wrong not to acknowledge it. We are one week out from Election Day and the Republican Senate just sold its soul to confirm an extreme right-wing justice to the Supreme Court, through a process so rushed and illegitimate it almost beggars belief. Trump Republicans put Amy Coney Barrett on the Supreme Court to strip millions of Americans of their healthcare. It could not be more clear, more cruel, or more in character.
Today, every single one of us has stepped up to say, ""enough."" With 38 electoral votes, our state is the path to the presidency. We are going to deliver every one of them to Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and break Donald Trump's grip on the presidency once and for all.
But, both of us know this started a long time ago. Texas is turning blue because folks like you have poured your heart and soul into inching us closer, year after year. You never gave up on the dream or on each other. And now, we're finally here.
I am so damn proud of our brilliant, unstoppable team. We are doing the work and the result is going to send shockwaves across this country.
We've made it this far because of you. Our work isn't over yet and with 7 days till election day, we can't rest. That's why I'm asking you personally, can you rush your first $7 contribution of 2020 to the Texas Democratic Party's Get Out The Vote Fund before their critical midnight deadline?
If you've saved payment info with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Express Donate: $7
Express Donate: $10
Express Donate: $25
Express Donate: $50
Express Donate: $100
Or, donate another amount
Right now, for the first time in 20 years, Democrats can win a majority in the Texas House -- drawing a decade's worth of fair electoral districts so that Texans can truly choose who represents them.
We can send MJ Hegar to Washington and give Texas a real voice in the Senate.
We can elect a powerhouse slate of Democrats in communities across Texas -- folks who are fighting to serve our communities instead of just pandering to wealth and power.
But make no mistake. Republicans are fighting right now to claw back this election against the tide of change. We have to be the ones who fight harder.
For the next seven days, we have to get as tired as we can pushing as hard as we can to get every last Democrat to the polls. That's how we win Texas and save our country. I'm calling on you today to help us see this through.
Can you donate $7 or whatever you can before midnight?

Friend \--
## Your Green voice is powerful!
Instead of being erased by the electoral college, your Green vote will be ON THE RECORD demanding a Green agenda, strengthening ballot access & potentially winning federal funding at 5%.
Trump is working with agencies and powers put in place by bipartisan administrations that Biden has been part of. In essence, Biden helped create that very militarized fascist apparatus that Trump is driving.
A vote for Hawkins/Walker is an affirmative vote. It is affirmatively FOR the Green agenda, Peace, Medicare for all, basic income, climate transition, and for strengthening an alternative party that clearly centers this agenda in its platform.
A Green administration would more reasonably follow the guidance of scientists, and could provide a systemic reboot of our government. Greens have access to the same pool of experts & human talent, but bring a fresh, pragmatic, working-class perspective. To me, those things are worth voting for!
With just 2% in a statewide race, GPTX will extend ballot access to 2030\. This achievable goal is an important foothold in building viability, so don't allow media & the duopoly to demoralize you! Claim your power by making the strongest showing possible for the Green agenda in 2020! Make sure to get yourself & your Green-supporting friends & family to vote this week.
Help Greens build into future cycles by donating, encouraging candidate recruitment, and staying tuned-in to local & midterm elections in 2021 & 2022!
In Solidarity,

Friend --
Will you invest in maintaining Green ballot access in Texas?
2020 Nomination Convention Results
The convention confirmed the nominations of three candidates for statewide office. The outcome of pending lawsuits, Texans for Voter Choice et al v. Hughs and Dikeman v Hughs, will determine whether the three will appear on Texas ballots; none of them paid the new filing fee imposed on candidates of all parties under 2019's HB 2504, nor did they submit the requisite petition signatures in lieu of the fee.
The new nominees are:
* David B. Collins (Harris County), US Senate
* katija gruene (Travis County), Texas Railroad Commission
* Charles Waterbury (Dallas County), State Supreme Court Position 1/Chief Justice
Below is a list of the other candidates nominated for non-statewide offices. Names of candidates who paid the fees, thus attaining ballot access, appear in italics. As with the statewide candidates, the disposition of the litigation will determine whether the others may appear on ballots in their respective districts.
US House
* Tom Wakely (Bexar), CD-21
* Hal J. Ridley, Jr. (Orange), CD-36
Texas Legislature
* Julián Villarreal (Bexar), SD-26
* katija gruene (Travis), HD-51
* Brody-Andrew Mulligan (Tarrant), HD-92
* Antonio Padrón (Bexar), HD-119
A more detailed summary of the convention, including text of two approved resolutions, is available here. GPTX remains committed to providing a path to the ballot for voices outside the duopoly.
Can you help cover our operational expenses?

Green Party of Texas,gptx@txgreens.org,Building a Green alternative,"Green Party of Texas
Friend \--
Have you made the most of your vote TODAY by demanding a GREEN alternative? Not only can you support Howie & Angela for President & VP, but our two statewide candidates, katija gruene for Railroad Commissioner and David Collins for US Senate, also qualify us for ballot retention through 2030\. GPTX will offer a broader slate of candidates in coming cycles, and this year's statewide races support future ballot access.
GPTX is ready to grow beyond this election and into 2022. It's important to understand that Greens are an all volunteer, do-it-yourself party. Going Green is not as easy as just switching political brands. We need you to help us build and operate this party.
Take a look at our calendar mapping out the next two years. In 2021, we will need to focus on candidate recruitment in local races and fundraising to prepare for 2022. In 2022, we will need volunteers to hold nominating conventions to place our candidates on the ballot & support their campaigns.
GPTX is not stopping with today's election. We are continuing to lay the track for a Green electoral alternative in Texas, and we invite you to participate with us and invest your energy in building that Green alternative.
Imagine if resources invested in sheepdog politicians had instead been directed to building Greens. Instead of deriding Greens for not having yet been successful enough, starved of resources and omitted in public discussion, let's start investing in our own electoral alternative, where the platform is clearly established and the policy and principles are right. Let's save & build on the substantial ballot access progress Greens have made!
Ballot access across the country is almost fully attained, and the task now is to fill out slates of candidates with stronger campaigns & develop the party. We know that connecting with the party has been difficult while the organization has not been sufficiently developed to facilitate formal intake. In the coming 2021-2022 period, this is something we need to fix. We need to build our network & organization to be better prepared for 2022. So please stay tuned to our website & activities in the coming period to help make that happen.

GPTX invites you to a virtual M4A Town Hall event on Thursday, August 13th. To RSVP email [[URL REDACTED]] for connection link.
#LeftUnity #WorkersInTheWhiteHouse #HawkinsWalker2020
2020 campaign efforts are under way. GPTX has allocated funds to begin a social media campaign promoting public awareness of our ""slate of eight"" 2020 candidates. Please monitor & support GPTX Facebook & Twitter to extend the reach of our messaging. Can you donate to support these efforts?
GPTX is also coordinating a banner signage volunteer campaign for our national & downticket candidates. Please RSVP to this event to participate in this effort & be matched with a team in your area.
We have also updated our resources & volunteer initiatives pages to help you find ways to support the Green movement & campaigns. Please bookmark these resources & check [[URL REDACTED]] regularly to stay up to date on party information.
Going forward, GPTX will need to improve our candidate recruitment & support efforts. Please join us in working to make the most of this campaign cycle & in improving our preparedness for future election cycles by becoming active with the State Executive Committee and any local or regional Green groups in your area. GPTX-SEC meets once a month, and always welcomes participation from across the state within their necessary administrative agenda.
GPTX has been hosting a series of ""Eco-Social"" meetings over the summer for Texas Greens to reach out & make acquaintances. Our next statewide ""Eco-Social"" will be August 24th, and then we will switch to regional rather than statewide ""Eco-Socials"" to help with region specific interpersonal party networking.
Again, please sign up to help with our banner signage campaign, please act on some of the volunteer initiatives we have suggested, and please join us for our upcoming M4A Town Hall (email [[URL REDACTED]]) & other events! If you can contribute financially, your donation to GPTX would be very helpful & appreciated.
We look forward to working with you to put people, planet, & peace over profit!

Federal matching funds are in effect for the #HawkinsWalker2020 campaign until August 24, so PLEASE take advantage of this opportunity to DOUBLE your contribution toward Green Party ballot access across the nation!
GPTX has recently been threatened with baseless litigation by Democratic interests. No question that they don't want competition on the ballot. What about you? Can you help GPTX maintain our path to the ballot by becoming a sustaining donor?
Volunteers can now join banner signage teams in their TX area to help promote awareness of GPTX 2020 candidates. We have updated our volunteer initiatives board with ideas and resources for letters to the editor, phonebanking, literature, yard signs, debate access action & more!
GPTX-SEC meets once a month to conduct party business, and Texas Greens are always welcome to come coordinate & build consensus with the State Executive Committee. Additionally, our last August ""Eco-Social"" zoom mixer Q&A will be on August 24th. We invite you to come join us to get acquainted & celebrate our progress in the 2020 election cycle!
In September, we will call the ""Eco-Socials"" regionally, so please tune in to catch when your region or metro is supposed to meet! We have really been excited to get folks tuning in & reactivating across the state this summer. The challenge is how we get integrated to work together, so please join us with this goal in mind.
Greens have a lot of latent strength in Texas, and we can all tell that the time is right for our party's policies. Going forward, we MUST improve our candidate process & support. GPTX thanks all of our candidates for standing as Greens in 2020!

Green Party of Texas,gptx@txgreens.org,Crisis of Authoritarian Capitalism - June 2020 Newsletter,"Green Party of Texas
Friend --
You don’t need us to tell you that the current moment is a crisis of authoritarian capitalism. Abuse of authority, police brutality, white supremacy, systemic racism – heartbreaking economic & social conditions – sheer incompetence and waste, all are on full display for anyone to observe. How can we navigate a pandemic without healthcare for all? How can we loosen environmental restrictions and disregard responsible climate action in a time of looming climate crisis? How can we be so completely dysfunctional?
Greens have been calling for healthcare for all, peace, ending the drug war, ending private prisons & mass incarceration, police reform & reallocation of public resources, basic income & minimum wage, Green New Deal and many other issues for decades. However we may have been derided as fringe or unworthy of serious attention, Greens continue to come together in courage & conviction that we must speak against the status quo & work together to envision a path forward. If there was ever a time needing the 10 key values of the Green Party, it is now. GPTX has a slate of candidates for 2020 supporting these issues in district & statewide races. We encourage you to support Greens when you can and contribute to continue to build this vital path for ballot access.
Outlook for GPTX in 2020 is positive. Current state law guarantees GPTX ballot access through 2026, and it is likely one of our statewide candidates will meet the threshold to extend our access through 2030. GPTX has had impressive past showings in some district & local races, and is poised to continue to make gains down ticket. The presidential nomination will be finalized at the GPUS convention on July 11, and Greens will be in a good position to promote a #WorkingClassForTheWin campaign focused on demanding needed social change through political challenge while making ballot access gains and hopefully securing federal funding for the future.
Help grow GPTX by spreading awareness of our platform & recruiting potential candidates to run on the Green ballot line in future elections. Running as a Green may allow candidates to avoid the competition of the primary and carry their campaign through to the general election.
GPTX is in desperate fundraising need. We have barely enough funds to meet our technical overhead, and we would like to run a marketing campaign to promote awareness of our 2020 slate of candidates on social media. Please contribute now to help us achieve that goal! Join our next “Eco-Social” zoom conference on July 13 to get involved!
Finally, as we have just passed Juneteenth and we speed on perilously toward July 4th, let us all hope that our nation can grow through our current pain to live up to its ideals. Human rights were enshrined in our constitution because they are inalienable and not to be infringed. Both parties have co-managed a status quo that justifies the violation of individual rights in the interest of government authority and imperialism, and this cannot be tolerated. Greens seek to build a path forward for our communities to heal and find an equilibrium that is livable and just for all. We invite our brothers and sisters from across the political spectrum to join us in working to put people, peace, & planet over profit!

Friend --
Are you ready to invest in a Green path forward?
As 2020 continues, many of us are trying to figure out how to proceed in the current political landscape. GPTX invites lonely Greens scattered around Texas to join us on Monday, June 8 at 7pm for our bi-weekly ""Eco-Social"" video conference, to discuss how to activate our party & any other topics of interest to Texas Greens. Active members will be on hand to explain background & provide orientation & encouragement to Green-interested participants.
Can you support our efforts?
Greens will be on the ballot in Texas in 2020! We must take this opportunity to strengthen our party and candidate pipeline building toward future cycles in 2022, 2024, 2026 and beyond! GPTX needs you to encourage potential candidates from groups you may be involved with to consider running as a Green, where they may stand a better chance of making it to the general election ballot. We need you to help activate volunteers & build local Green parties in your areas. Please join us to discuss this and more on our June 8th ""Eco-Social""!
Can you become a sustaining member today?

Can you donate today?
August was a dramatic month for GPTX. We were forced to defend our candidates and Green voter choice in Texas from an overwhelming & last minute onslaught of Democrat litigation. All over the country, Democrat interests at every level have made every attempt to force Greens from the ballot, both in the Presidential/VP and down-ticket races. The good news though is that...
We won! In a surprise turn of events, the Republicans tried to copy the Democrat tactics against the Libertarians, and in the resulting legal actions, the Texas Supreme Court issued a Writ of Mandamus restoring our three targeted Green candidates to the ballot! So David Collins for US Senate, katija gruene for TX Railroad Commission, and Tom Wakely for US Rep 21 will indeed appear on the November general election ballot, giving us opportunity to retain ballot access into future election cycles.
GPTX is very grateful to all the volunteers who scrambled to put together our legal responses. It was truly a team effort and a galvanizing experience. Can you contribute to help GPTX stay in the fight?
Between now and the general election, GPTX will be running a banner display campaign as well as a social media ad campaign. We could really use volunteer support for both of these efforts to help make Texas voters aware of Green candidates on the ballot in 2020. If we could get an influx of donations, we could increase these efforts beyond the initial seed money the SEC has allocated to start!
After the 2020 election, GPTX will be focused on recruiting candidates for future cycles and improving our operations so that we can be stronger in the future. Volunteers can encourage potential candidates to consider the Green ballot line, where they may have a more direct path to the general election. Help us develop our party network and local operations by becoming active with GPTX. Help raise funds & donate to increase and improve our efforts.
Greens are not backing down. We are in this fight for the long haul, laying down the track to make change possible. People, Planet, & Peace over Profit!
Keep Pushing!
In Solidarity,

Election season is moving fast & GPTX is working to coordinate yard signs for early voting locations. We need volunteers to help distribute signs to early voting locations in their own area. Visit our resources page for printable materials and other helpful content.
Right now we don't have quite enough funds for all the signage we'd like to order. We're trying to make the most of our resources by coordinating banner displays in cities across the state and promoting our slate of candidates on social media.
Last week, our Texas candidates joined Howie & Angela on the campaign livestream to talk about what they would each bring to the offices they seek.
Can you donate to help us publicize Greens on the 2020 ballot in Texas?
Reminder: Now would be a good time to double check your voter registration! Make sure everything is in order and no changes have been made so you will not have trouble voting this year!
Greens know change can't wait. A recently published ProPublica piece, ""New Climate Maps Show a Transformed United States"" illustrates the future we must urgently prepare for.
Looking forward, GPTX is determined to expand our candidate recruitment for future cycles. That means being more prepared to support our nominees in attaining ballot access. The new filing fees imposed by HB2504 were a significant hurdle for our candidates this cycle, and we would like to have more resources to assist with filing fees in the future. Can you help us with fundraising toward this goal?

Justin Nelson,info@email.texashdcc.com,What’s at Stake,"Go Vote – And Tell Your Friends and Family
Alex,
Late in the night of November 8, 2016, so many of us were surprised when Trump was elected. Since that time, we have worked in ways both small and large to protect the rule of law and democracy. Let’s not wake up the morning after this election and wish we’d done more.
In these final hours, please do any of the following that you are able (and maybe even more than one):
First, and most importantly, VOTE. The polls show that Texas is a toss-up. So is control of the Texas House. In 2018, many house races were decided by a few dozen votes. In 2017, control of the Virginia Legislature came down to ONE VOTE. YOUR VOTE MATTERS.
Second, TELL ALL YOUR FRIENDS TO VOTE. Encouraging your friends and family to vote works! Tell them the issues important to you and why it’s important to vote. Find three friends or family members to help get to the polls.
Third, help on Election Day—make calls or connect with your local party or campaign.
The election is in our hands. Together, we will continue to work for “liberty and justice for all.”
Sincerely,
Justin A. Nelson

Alex,
Did you know that Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has been indicted for fraud? And that a few years back, he was caught on film stealing a $1,000 pen? Yet he wants to make it criminal to vote by mail during a pandemic.
Indicted Ken is once again putting his personal political interests above common sense. Will you chip in to help us flip the Texas House and prevent Republicans like Paxton from suppressing the vote?

Ken Paxton and his cronies want to risk public health by forcing voters to go to the polls in the midst of a pandemic. It’s plain stupid. We saw what happened in Wisconsin, where the Republican Speaker of the House assured voters it was safe -- while dressed in full protective gear!
Paxton and his vote-suppressing allies are placing personal partisan interests ahead of doing what’s right. They are afraid of what would happen in a fair election. We need to send him a message. Chip in to help the Texas House Democratic Campaign Committee flip the Texas House and protect the right to vote.
Thanks and stay safe,
Justin Nelson

Since Texas is officially a swing state, the Texas House Democratic Campaign Committee is high on the GOP’s list of organizations to come after. They’re going to try to outspend us, so it’s crucial we ramp up our fundraising and ensure our candidates have the resources to win and flip the Texas House.

Trump Tax Return Alert via TXHDCC,info@email.texashdcc.com,you probably paid more in taxes last year than Donald Trump did,"he's a scam artist
The New York Times just released President Trump's tax returns. In 2016 and 2017, he paid $750 in taxes.
That's not a typo. No zeroes are missing. $750. That's it. That's all he paid.
He's a con-artist and a grifter, and if the Texas GOP had an ounce of integrity, they would denounce him immediately.
But all they care about is winning - even if it means building their government on the backs of hard-working Americans whose taxes pay for their president's lavish fake-billionaire lifestyle.
So we're going to remove them from power in November. Will you chip in $7.50 or $75.00 to let them know their support of this criminal president cannot stand?

At midnight on Tuesday, the books close on the first half of the election year, and the numbers that we post are going to go PUBLIC. That means opponents, media, and even Donald Trump himself can look at our totals if they want to.
Since Texas has been declared a toss-up, we can’t leave any room for doubt. We have to have the strongest showing possible. Will you chip in any amount before the deadline to show everyone what Texas Dems are made of?

ALERT: Billionaire and major Trump donor Sheldon Adelson has dropped $4.5 million OF HIS OWN MONEY into GOP Texas House races. They're losing, so they're calling all their deep-pocketed national donors to come in and save them.  Rush a donation to help us battle this influx of billionaire money >>>
Alex, things just went from bad to worse.
First Greg Abbott shuts down ballot drop-boxes in Democrat areas, and now the Texas GOP is calling up national deep-pocketed donors to help them buy the election.
We're winning, and they know it. But we CANNOT let our message be drowned out by their money!

Alex,
As I’m typing up this email, I’m taking care of my 94 year old mother in the comfort of my home -- leaving only when absolutely necessary. But I recognize that there are many of my neighbors who don’t have that luxury. They have to go to work in hospitals, grocery stores, and on the road. Our community members on the frontlines are heroes and deserve our support.
That’s why I’m even more committed to electing leaders to the Texas House who will represent us.
It’s tragic that the Trump administration is unable to rise to the occasion and lead us through the challenges presented by the spread of COVID-19, but in the absence of leadership at the federal level, state and local governments must step up.
Texas Democrats are advocating for policies that will help protect the health of Texans. We’re fighting to:
* Expand health care access to the 5 million Texans who have no health insurance
* Enact a statewide paid sick leave law
* Push the Governor to use his powers under a Disaster Declaration to expand eligibility for unemployment insurance right away
And Alex, those steps are just the beginning. We have so much work to do.
That’s why your support TODAY is critical.

Alex, as a top supporter we wanted to loop you in on some polling we just got in the door for THREE of our most highly contested races:
Pickup District #1 \- 59-36 Biden (2016: 50-44 Clinton) = D+17
Pickup District #2 \- 57-36 Biden (2016: 48-47 Clinton) = D+20
Pickup District #3 \- 54-42 Biden (2016: 52-43 Trump) = D+21
These numbers are EXTRAORDINARY, and all eyes are on the Texas House.
We CAN flip it - but only if we hit EVERY single fundraising goal between now and Election Day to combat the influx of GOP spending. Right now, we’re $3,545 short of where we need to be by the end of the week. Will you help us close the gap?

Alex,
Do you know how some Republicans manage to hold onto power despite losing the popular vote over and over again?
They cheat.
Through unfair gerrymandering, politicians are able to draw districts that benefit themselves and their party instead of their constituents. It’s an undemocratic process that we have the power to stop. In a few short months, state legislatures will begin the once-a-decade redistricting process -- and it is CRUCIAL that Democrats have a seat at the table to ensure a fair process that will prevent Republicans from manipulating our electoral maps again.
There is simply too much at stake in this year’s elections to sit on the sidelines. Will you join me in supporting the Texas HDCC as they work to flip the Texas House and fight partisan gerrymandering?

Celia Israel,info@email.texashdcc.com,a nationwide uprising,"this cannot keep happening
Alex,
Like you, I’ve been devastated by the events of the past few weeks. Once again, Americans are in mourning for a black man taken by unjust and illegal police force.
This unjust murder has sparked a nationwide uprising against institutional racism and human rights abuses. Here in Texas, this is sadly something we’re familiar with. George Floyd was from here. Jordan Edwards, Sandra Bland, Botham Jean, and Atatiana Jefferson were Texans. We mourn with their families, and with the families of every person taken from us unjustly.
The pain and anger is justified, and I am confident that as we rise up and protest what’s wrong, we’ll redouble our efforts to do what’s right. We will lift up the voices of the marginalized, we will stand with the protestors, and we will renew our commitment to ending structural racism wherever it’s found.
I stand with my fellow Americans against injustice. Now and always.
Thank you,
Celia Israel

Alex -
We are less than 50 days away from the most important election in our lifetime. This November, we must do everything we can to elect and support local Democrats, and today is the perfect opportunity to make those victories possible.
Today is the inaugural Fall Fest, a day of action to elect Democrats to legislative chambers across the country – starting in Pennsylvania, Arizona, Texas, and North Carolina. These four states are critical to our party’s future, this fall and beyond, and we’re asking every Democrat in America to help make today a success.
We only need to flip 29 more seats to flip legislative chambers blue in these four states. Will you donate $29 dollars today – one dollar for every seat we need – to elect Democratic majorities and flip these states blue?
As the President of the national Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, our mission is to support local allies like the Texas House Democrats and flip legislatures blue across the country. This November, we have a historic opportunity to win hundreds of those seats, but we need your support.
As you know, we only need to flip 9 seats to elect Democratic majority to the Texas state House for the first time in nearly two decades. All eyes are on Texas this fall, up and down the ticket – but winning these key statehouse races will impact our nation for a decade or more.
Please split a donation today between Democrats in Pennsylvania, Arizona, Texas, and North Carolina to help them win the seats they need to make this inaugural Fall Fest – and the 2020 elections – a historic success.
Today is a special day because it emphasizes what we can achieve when we work together. Thank you for your continued support for local Democrats!
Jessica Post
President, DLCC
Washington, DC
p.s. I encourage you to follow along using the hashtag #FallIntoTheMajority on Twitter as we come together across state lines to elect Democratic majorities this November. Let’s make this inaugural Fall Fest and today’s day of action a rousing success!

Last week, I reached out to ask how you were doing. Please know that I read every single response, and I’m honored that so many of you took the time to share how you’re faring during this historic time.
I heard from a 94 year old who is living through their first big pandemic, and says we are “all on the frontlines now.”
I heard from a parent worried about their adult children who have lost jobs, and sad that politicians have labeled folks their age “expendable.”
I heard from a frontline worker who is serving boxed breakfasts to the residents of the homeless shelter where they work. They say it’s a privilege to continue to serve.
So many of us are struggling, but we’re also banding together and finding hope.
That’s how I know we’re going to make it through this, Alex.

Alex,
This week we saw record-breaking turnout across Texas in the runoff elections. More people voted in the runoff elections than any prior Democratic runoff in the state--ever! And this record turnout occurred in the midst of a pandemic.
The stakes in November are as high as they ever have been--fighting against voter suppression, expanding Medicaid, protecting coverage for pre-existing conditions, using common sense to govern, standing up against Donald Trump. With your help, change is coming to Texas. Chip in now

Democrats have a shot to win the Texas House. After Tuesday’s election, we now have a full slate. And what a team it is. From working moms to former Army Company Commanders to advocates fighting employment discrimination to MBAs fighting for equal pay to small business owners, our candidates are community leaders. They represent the breadth, experience, and diversity of Texas. And they will represent ALL Texans.
All sides recognize the stakes of this election. As recent polls have shown, Texas will be competitive in November. This past weekend, the Dallas Morning News released a poll showing Biden up by 5 in Texas, 46-41! That same poll had Democrats leading Republicans for control of the Texas House, 52-47.
The momentum is on our side. Chip in to help us turn Texas blue.
We all know that we can’t do it alone. And we can’t assume we’re going to win. So make sure all your friends and neighbors are registered to vote. Make sure you tell them the stakes of this election and how much it means not just to get rid of Trump but to have a Democratic Texas House.
Together, we will win. Change is coming to Texas.
Sincerely,
Justin Nelson

Not only are Donald Trump and Joe Biden locked in a DEAD HEAT (!!!) but the survey found that most respondents trust DEMOCRATS over Republicans to lead the Texas House.
We have a plan to flip nine seats and take back the House, but to do it, we need your support. Rush a donation right away to help end the Republican stranglehold on Texas.

"Eric H. Holder, Jr.",info@email.texashdcc.com,Democrats CAN compete - and win,"Join the fight to flip the House!
Alex,
When I decided to launch the National Democratic Redistricting Committee with the support of my friend, President Obama, I committed to reverse the damage done to our democracy by gerrymandering. We are now in a fight to stop politicians from picking their voters AND TO ENSURE FAIRNESS IN OUR ELECTIONS. I’ve traveled the country to shine a spotlight on this undemocratic practice and believe that when electoral districts are drawn fairly, Democrats CAN compete -- and win.
Especially in Texas.
With so many congressional seats and a growing minority population that deserves equal representation, Texas is one of my top priorities. And the best path for fair maps in Texas is supporting the HDCC’s mission to flip the Texas House. In 2018, I was proud to help Democrats flip 12 seats in the state House. In 2020, we need to win nine more seats to win a majority and prevent Republicans from having total control of the redistricting process.
Right now, the team is up against a crucial fundraising deadline and they need to bring in $15,000 by the end of the month. Can you chip in?

Texas, one of the most gerrymandered states in the nation, is at the center of the redistricting battle. Republicans know that with potentially 39 congressional seats up for grabs, the stakes couldn’t be higher. And with changing demographics, I can assure you their only way to hold onto power is to manipulate the maps again -- but we can stop that from happening BY FIGHTING FOR A FAIR PROCESS.
If Democrats take back the House this year, Texas can finally have fair maps -- and for the next decade. That’s what we’re fighting for, friends. So please chip in before the crucial February fundraising deadline.
Thanks,
Eric H. Holder, Jr.

Justin Nelson,info@email.texashdcc.com,I Voted Early Today,"we can't let COVID stop us
Alex,
First, I want to thank you. Because of your support, the Texas HDCC not only hit our crucial end of quarter fundraising goal - we surpassed it. Thank you for your commitment to this mission. Together, we will win back the 9 seats we need to flip the Texas House.
Today, I voted early for the July 14 runoff elections. Even during COVID, it’s vital that we vote. Unfortunately, due to a decision by Governor Abbott and an interpretation by the Texas Supreme Court, not everybody can vote by mail.
My experience voting was unlike any other I experienced. The poll workers were masked but not everyone in the building was. Few options existed on where to vote. While the line was short, it was impossible to maintain social distancing throughout the entire process. And every voter had to sign a screen with their finger to obtain a ballot. When you vote, please wear at least a mask and glove to protect yourself and others.
If you qualify to vote by mail, please do so. Tomorrow is the last day to request a vote by mail application. While lack of immunity to COVID, without more, is not a sufficient reason by itself to request a ballot, you may qualify to vote by mail for other reasons. The Texas Supreme Court also has stated that voters may “take their health and health history into consideration in determining whether to request a vote-by-mail ballot.” In addition, everyone 65 or over can request a mail-in ballot. If you qualify to vote by mail due to disability, age, or other reasons, you can still request a ballot by mail by clicking here. Note you will need to print out the application and postmark it by tomorrow.
Governor Abbott’s decision not to allow vote by mail for all citizens flies in the face of public health guidance. We are in a public health crisis. It makes no sense to require in-person voting as COVID rages here. Now more than ever, we need to send a message that vote suppression does not work.
Let’s show Governor Abbott and the Republicans that nothing will stop us from voting.
Finally, thank you again for all your support over the last quarter. Because of you, we had our best fundraising months ever! We have a long way to go, but together we will work towards flipping the Texas House and protecting the right to vote.
Sincerely,
Justin Nelson

"Celia Israel, TX HDCC Chair",info@email.texashdcc.com,Update on the Coronavirus,"Checking in with you
Alex,
As the Coronavirus issue continues to dominate the news, I wanted to take a moment to check in with you. There’s a lot of fear and anxiety here in Texas and around the country, but make no mistake - we’re going to get through this.
We’re going to need to be vigilant and flexible in the days ahead. I’m encouraged that both the Texas and Federal governments have declared states of emergency so that resources can be allocated to respond properly to this virus.
The most important thing we can do now is to practice preventative hygiene and engage in social distancing as suggested by the CDC and other organizations. For more information on how to protect yourself and your community, click here.
Alex, it’s never been more clear that the work we do at the HDCC matters a great deal. Our Democratic candidates are continuing to fight for health care coverage and other policies that will make Texas even stronger. We’re so grateful to have you on our team.
Best,
Celia Israel

Texans are showing up to the polls in record numbers. Young people are voting at a rate THREE TIMES higher than they did in 2016. Joe Biden is tied with Trump, and the Texas House is on the verge of turning blue for the first time in years.
We can thank the Texas HDCC for a lot of that. The work they’ve been doing to organize and mobilize in this state is crucial, and in the last week before Election Day, we need to support them like never before. Will you chip in now to stand with the Texas HDCC?

Like you, we’re mourning the passing of Ruth Bader Ginsburg. We’re also honoring her request that we never give up.

Alex, this weekend was tough.
The passing of Ruth Bader Ginsburg has put November’s election into the sharpest possible focus. Absolutely everything is at stake.
And as the group tasked with flipping the Texas House, let us tell you - we’re feeling the urgency.
Bad laws that end up at the Supreme Court start in state legislatures. MULTIPLE Texas cases were heard during RBG’s tenure. Now, she’s not there. We’re on our own.
Flipping the Texas House has become even more urgent. So we’re doubling down, and we hope you are too. Chip in now to donate any amount right away.

Alex, the Texas GOP passed a law outlawing straight-ticket voting, and a court struck it down. This is BIG, and it affects every single voter in Texas.
We've always known that the Texas GOP is RELENTLESS in their attempts to suppress the vote (especially in minority communities.)
Thankfully, the court has stopped them... this time.
But you KNOW the anti-voting Texas GOP won't go down without a fight, and will keep trying to prevent people from voting. Our voter turnout operation has never been more important, and we need your urgent support. Chip in right away. >>>

Justin Nelson,info@email.texashdcc.com,seems like Ken Paxton and Donald Trump are on the same page,"First, the good news...
Alex,
First, the good news: a federal judge has said that ALL Texas voters can apply to vote by mail during this pandemic.
The bad news is that Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton immediately appealed to the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals to postpone the order, and the court agreed in less than 24 hours. Ken Paxton, Greg Abbott, and the rest of the Texas GOP will continue to appeal this ruling as long as they can, because they think the only way they can win is to prevent people from voting!
If you believe that every American should be able to vote safely during a global pandemic — regardless of political party — will you chip in to help Democrats flip the Texas House?
Chip in now
The same day this ruling came out, Donald Trump tweeted the following:
Trump Tweets
Alex, when I heard about these tweets… let’s just say I’m glad my kids didn’t hear what I said. In what sane world does the President of the United States corruptly try to tie funding to undermining the right to vote? This is why it’s so important to stand up for democracy.
Texas Democrats are fighting with everything we’ve got to make voting safer and easier — for everyone. If you’re with us, chip in to help us flip the Texas House.

The GOP believes voting by mail is a threat to democracy, and that wanting to do so during a pandemic is “laughable.”  We disagree. Chip in to help the Texas HDCC hold the GOP accountable and flip the Texas House.
We’re minding our own business, trying to enjoy our Saturday, when this hits our inboxes:
This is NONSENSE. Vote by mail SUPPORTS and is ESSENTIAL to democracy - especially during a pandemic.
But they don’t care about the pandemic either:
“The idea that we want to give you a disability claim because (you’re) afraid to go vote… is laughable. This is a scam by Democrats to steal the election.”

There’s really nothing left to say, Alex. The GOP simply does not want people to vote, and we have no choice but to show up at the polls in record numbers and vote them OUT.

Yesterday was a record breaking day for Texas. We surpassed 2016 turnout by over 200,000 voters, and lines were HOURS long - which shows both the extent of the excitement on the ground and the extent of the damage done by Republicans who shut down polling places. (Seriously, we HAVE to take back the House.)
And remember THIS from a few days ago?
“In the battle for the Texas House, where the GOP enjoys an 83-67 edge currently, 51% of respondents said if the general election were today, they would vote for the Democratic candidate.”

Alex, I want to be honest with you for a second about what we’re facing.
At midnight on Tuesday, the books close on the first half of the election year, and the numbers that we post are going to go PUBLIC. That means opponents, media, and even Donald Trump himself can look at our totals if they want to.
Since Texas has been declared a toss-up, we can’t leave any room for doubt. We have to have the strongest showing possible. Will you chip in any amount before the deadline to show everyone what Texas Dems are made of?

Justin Nelson,info@email.texashdcc.com,Stop Vote Suppression—Elect a Democratic Texas House,"They want you to be scared. Don't be.
Alex,
Today we saw the latest effort to suppress the vote in Texas. Governor Abbott wants to close most absentee ballot drop-off locations in big counties. It’s so outrageous and transparent that it would be laughable if it weren’t so serious. The best way to respond is to VOTE. And then make sure all your friends VOTE too. As President Obama says, don’t boo. VOTE.
Especially in the midst of a pandemic, we should be making it easier to drop off ballots—not harder. Attempts to suppress the vote are not new. But don’t let them scare you. This vote suppression is designed to scare us, but it only reveals how scared they are of people voting.
They know that if everybody votes, Texas will vote Democratic. So let’s prove them correct. The power remains in our hands.
A Democratic Texas House will block Republican efforts to suppress the vote. From gerrymandering to voter ID to restricting vote by mail to limiting voter registration, we’ve seen it all here. But make no mistake, Republicans will keep on trying. Unless we stop them.
So commit to vote. Commit to making sure all your friends vote. And then VOTE THEM OUT. Help us achieve a Democratic Texas House to block further efforts to suppress the vote.
Sincerely,
Justin A. Nelson

Justin Nelson,info@email.texashdcc.com,Today is the first day of early voting,"they can't stop us
Alex,
Late last night, the appeals court sided with Governor Abbott and allowed his voter suppression tactics to move forward.
Then this morning, Texas showed up in force at the polls.
The decision to allow Greg Abbott to remove ballot drop-off boxes is wrong, period. But make no mistake - Texans WILL vote in unprecedented numbers. Voting in Texas is safe, and folks have multiple ways to cast their ballots. Voting is our sacred responsibility, and no matter the obstacles they throw at us, we must show up to make our voices heard. The best way to fight back is to VOTE.
Donate to the Texas HDCC to help us protect our most fundamental right to have a say in our democracy.
The GOP knows that Texas is in play. Just today, they filed suit to stop CURBSIDE voting. It’s plain to see that they’re afraid of the voters. When everyone votes, the people win--regardless of the result.
The best way to fight voter suppression is to VOTE. Not just for President, but up and down the ballot. And please support the important work the Texas HDCC is doing to flip the Texas House and protect the right to vote.
Thank you,
Justin A. Nelson

Justin Nelson,info@email.texashdcc.com,Look for the helpers,"We'll get through this.
Alex,
All of us are adjusting to a new reality. So many folks are struggling right now—whether due to health, job, family, or other reasons. Even those of us fortunate enough to have their health and livelihoods are witnessing devastation and pain. We are also seeing what we feared in 2016 after Trump’s election. The federal government’s response has been negligent and incompetent at best.
Yet we will get through this—together. We are witnessing incredible bravery from essential workers. Health care professionals are putting their lives on the line every hour, often without basic protections like masks. And it’s not just in health care. From those who staff the grocery stores to those who continue to make our food to the sanitation workers to the police and paramedics to so many more, people are heroically putting their health on the line.
For those of you who have lost a job or who are trying to keep a small business afloat or who are dealing with the illness of a loved one or who are sick yourself, we are all here for you. The way forward out of this crisis will not be easy. We will have to continue to stay home until the virus abates somewhat and the experts say it’s okay. In the meantime, we must continue to protect and support the workers and small businesses that will remain the backbone of the economy. And we need mass testing—both to determine who is carrying COVID-19 and, through serological testing, who was exposed to it. We must make testing as easy and convenient as possible.
The government’s response to the virus also raises profound questions across a variety of areas. At the most fundamental level, we are seeing how our society and institutions are only as strong as our weakest links. The folks who are performing heroic deeds right now are often the ones who are paid the least. In Texas, the failure to expand Medicaid has led to glaring deficiencies in access to healthcare. Across the country, tens of millions are struggling with how to pay rent or mortgage while purchasing groceries and keeping the lights on.
As we move towards elections in November, it is deeply troubling to see Trump and other elected officials oppose basic measures to encourage voting and protect our democracy. Why does he oppose expanding the right to vote? In Trump’s words, “if you ever agreed to it, you’d never have a Republican elected in this country again.” Funny, I thought the whole purpose of an election was for the people to decide who we want as our elected leaders, not to discourage voting because you are afraid of losing if everyone votes. Over the next months and years, we will have to wrestle with all these questions and more.
It is easy and natural right now to be worried. I know I am. But we also must remain hopeful and patient. We support each other through these trying times. We recognize the human toll that so many are going through. We sustain each other so that physical distancing does not mean social isolation. We continue to try to create that “more perfect union” our Constitution envisions.
Robert Kennedy spoke about “tiny ripples of hope” that occur each time we “act to improve the lot of others” or “strike out against injustice.” Together, they can “sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance.” Especially now, it is up to all of us to create those ripples of hope.
Finally, like everyone else, we are adjusting to new routines. Right now, for example, I am writing this in my “office” with my new co-worker—my six-year-old son. But new routines can also lead to timeless truths. One of our recent go-to shows for our four-year-old and two-year-old is Daniel Tiger’s Neighborhood. (Our parenting skills have remained intact enough so far that we have not let them watch that *other* tiger show.) For those unfamiliar with Daniel Tiger, the program is an animated version of Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood. The life lessons it teaches such as kindness and empathy are not just for the pre-school crowd. Daniel Tiger also has an episode where he sings about what to do in scary times: Look For the Helpers.
To all the Helpers, we are grateful. You are creating these ripples of hope. Together, let us all resolve to keep on creating bigger and bigger ripples of hope and to support each other in these trying times. We will get through this.
For those seeking more public health resources about COVID-19, this website from the National Institutes of Health is a good starting point. For those seeking information on where to contribute, this website lists vetted community foundations across the country that are helping organize COVID-19 relief efforts.
May each of you remain healthy and safe.
Sincerely,
Justin Nelson

Alex,
In the wake of COVID-19, it’s become clear that the Texas GOP is unable to lead.
As Dallas County Judge, I’m doing what I can to mitigate the damage - but I could use some help. Texas needs a change, and that starts with flipping the Texas House this year.
The Texas HDCC is working to flip the 9 seats that will take the majority back for Democrats, and I’m standing with them.  They’re currently facing the final end of quarter fundraising deadline before Election Day - will you join me by chipping in any amount now to support their work?

If you believe people should come before profits, rush a donation to support the Texas HDCC in our effort to take the House back from the GOP.
Alex, this is shameful. Governor Abbott is rushing to open Texas businesses, putting Texans at risk, and what is Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick concerned about?
Protecting companies from lawsuits.
Dan Patrick wants you to break quarantine, risk your health, and be left with no way to hold a business accountable if a lack of proper sanitization practices gets you sick.
Anything for the economy, right Dan?

Texas is a Coronavirus hotspot, and the GOP isn’t going to do anything about it.
They planned to continue on with their IN-PERSON Republican convention (with Greg Abbott and Dan Patrick dialing in, of course.) until the city of Houston was forced to shut them down.
They refused to recommend masks, then reversed course and made them mandatory — AFTER cases spiked.
Dan Patrick even went on national television to say he didn’t need Dr. Fauci’s advice.

Alex, as a top supporter we wanted to loop you in on some polling we just got in the door for THREE of our most highly contested races:
Pickup District #1 \- 59-36 Biden (2016: 50-44 Clinton) = D+17
Pickup District #2 \- 57-36 Biden (2016: 48-47 Clinton) = D+20
Pickup District #3 \- 54-42 Biden (2016: 52-43 Trump) = D+21
These numbers are EXTRAORDINARY, and all eyes are on the Texas House.
We CAN flip it - but only if we hit EVERY single fundraising goal between now and Election Day to combat the influx of GOP spending. Right now, we’re $3,545 short of where we need to be by the end of the week. Will you help us close the gap?

Celia Israel,info@email.texashdcc.com,Juneteenth,"On June 19, 1865...
Alex,
Today is Juneteenth.
On June 19, 1865, Union soldiers landed in Galveston, Texas to share the news that the Civil War was over, the Emancipation Proclamation had been signed, and that enslaved people were now free.
The problem was that this news was two and a half years late. Enslaved people in Texas were the last in the country to learn of their freedom.
Thanks to the efforts of Black state legislator Al Edwards, Juneteenth became an official state holiday here in Texas in 1980. This was the first emancipation celebration that was given official recognition by the state, and other states soon followed suit.
In my family, we mark the day by reflecting on the injustices of both the past and present, and by recommitting to working towards a more just future. It’s especially poignant this year, as Americans are rising up and declaring that Black Lives Matter.
Today, just as in 1865, justice delayed is justice denied. We’re moving forward from here, and we won’t go back.
Sinceramente,
Celia Israel

Alex, it gets worse. A few days after his first disturbing statement, Trump used a press briefing to defend his OWN mail-in ballot:
Trump: ""I think mail-in voting is horrible, it's corrupt.""
Reporter: ""You voted by mail in Florida's election last month, didn't you?""
Trump: ""Sure. I can vote by mail""
Reporter: ""How do you reconcile with that?""
Trump: ""Because I'm allowed to.""
It’s almost as though Republicans know that in order to win, they have to suppress the vote.

Justin Nelson,info@email.texashdcc.com,"Schools Should Follow Science, Not Political Mandates","We must be responsible.
Alex,
Gov. Abbott has now followed the lead of Indicted Ken Paxton. They are letting politics drive the decision on when to reopen schools. As the parent of young kids, this infuriates me. Science, not politics, should drive the decision on when to re-open schools. Click here to send a message that science, not politics, should come first.
Like every parent, we would love to send our kids back to school. As I was writing this email, one of my kids came in to ask a question. She’s scheduled to start kindergarten in a few weeks. Parents of young children feel the effect of delayed openings more than anyone else.
But we must open in a responsible way and with a plan. Let’s make sure opening schools will not lead to another surge in COVID cases. The State of Texas should not force schools to reopen if schools are not ready or if the science says to wait. Indicted Ken Paxton and Governor Abbott should stop trying to appeal to a small segment of Republican primary voters and instead work in the best interests of *all* Texans.
It’s time for change. We need new leadership who will stand up for what’s right--regardless of the politics. Instead, from the Republican leadership in the Texas House to Governor Abbott, they are following the lead of Indicted Ken Paxton.
By flipping the Texas House, we can make sure all Texans have a voice and that science comes first. With your help, we can win.
In these challenging times, I hope everyone is staying safe and healthy.

Justin Nelson,info@email.texashdcc.com,"Clean Up Texas, Flip the Texas House","Ken Paxton must resign.
Alex,
Absolute power corrupts absolutely. By now, you may have heard that I’ve called for Indicted Ken Paxton to resign. Paxton has now been accused—again—of violating the law. This time, his own senior staff said they have a “good faith belief” Paxton broke the law and abused his power.
Republican leaders in Texas have known and tolerated Ken Paxton’s corruption for years. Yet they did nothing. That’s why we need a check on power. That’s why we need to elect a Democratic Texas House.
Ken Paxton has been under indictment for fraud for over 5 years! Yet Republican leaders like Greg Abbott have done nothing. In fact, Governor Abbott contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to Indicted Ken Paxton in 2018 when it looked like I might win near the end of the election! It’s time to say enough is enough. It’s time for leaders to fight against corruption—both the personal and the political kind.
When I ran for Texas Attorney General against Ken Paxton in 2018, I ran to make sure that the law would treat everyone fairly—regardless of your political party and regardless of who you are. I was proud to propose comprehensive ethics reform to clean up Texas government.
Equal justice should apply to all. An indicted and corrupt Texas Attorney General highlights how we have two systems of justice. The Texas Attorney General’s office is supposed to prioritize the interests of *all* Texans. Why have Republican leaders supported a corrupt and indicted Attorney General for over 5 years? When you have corrupt law enforcement officials, it corrupts the entire system.
A Democratic Texas House will fight to clean up government. It will check a generation of one-party Republican rule. It will stand up against political corruption as well—like voter suppression and gerrymandering. All Texans deserve a government that will treat everyone fairly and honestly.
Sincerely,
Justin A. Nelson

Alex, it gets worse. A few days after his first disturbing statement, Trump used a press briefing to defend his OWN mail-in ballot:
Trump: ""I think mail-in voting is horrible, it's corrupt.""
Reporter: ""You voted by mail in Florida's election last month, didn't you?""
Trump: ""Sure. I can vote by mail""
Reporter: ""How do you reconcile with that?""
Trump: ""Because I'm allowed to.""
It’s almost as though Republicans know that in order to win, they have to suppress the vote.

More importantly, I wanted to ask — how are you really?
When we talk to our friends and family these days, we are more intentional when we ask this question, and we really are waiting for a thoughtful response.  If you’re up for it, will you take a moment and let me know how you’re doing?
The stresses are many. If you are an “essential” employee, you’ve got your mask game on and are hustling for us all, whether it’s in your 18-wheeler, your scrubs or your grocer’s uniform. For those of us who are not essential (spare me the jokes about politicians), we have another job to do that is also stressful. It involves taking care of children or seniors or our life partners who are suddenly working from home, and it means wearing many different hats as a result.
I’ve been on countless briefing calls now and have the utmost respect for our health care workers and epidemiologists whose life’s work is built around studying viruses. We may not be where we are today if Washington D.C. had heeded their warnings and followed their lead.
But in our very own Central Texas, we have seen so many who have found ways to lend a hand. We have seen incredible innovation coming out of our small businesses and other organizations, who are all finding creative ways to be of service.
Now, how about you? What are you doing during this historic time?  I would love to hear your story.
And in your extra time, it’s really OK if you are doing more puzzles and gardening than exercising or learning a new language. Do things to help yourself and do things to help others. It all will feel good. Let someone know how you really are feeling, because it’s important to take care of yourself these days. We are living through an historic [[URL REDACTED]] are times we are going to get through ― together.
So how are you really? I’m waiting for a thoughtful response.

It's a difficult day for anyone who cares about the future of our country. But we aren't going to give up. We're going to fight even harder.
The fact of the matter is this: if we flip the Texas House, NO MORE bills attacking reproductive or civil rights will pass and end up before the Supreme Court.

\--- Original Message ---
We'll get through this.
Alex,
As I’m typing up this email, I’m taking care of my 94 year old mother in the comfort of my home -- leaving only when absolutely necessary. But I recognize that there are many of my neighbors who don’t have that luxury. They have to go to work in hospitals, grocery stores, and on the road. Our community members on the frontlines are heroes and deserve our support.
That’s why I’m even more committed to electing leaders to the Texas House who will represent us.
It’s tragic that the Trump administration is unable to rise to the occasion and lead us through the challenges presented by the spread of COVID-19, but in the absence of leadership at the federal level, state and local governments must step up.
Texas Democrats are advocating for policies that will help protect the health of Texans. We’re fighting to:
* Expand health care access to the 5 million Texans who have no health insurance
* Enact a statewide paid sick leave law
* Push the Governor to use his powers under a Disaster Declaration to expand eligibility for unemployment insurance right away
And Alex, those steps are just the beginning. We have so much work to do.
That’s why your support TODAY is critical.

Alex, this is shameful. Governor Abbott is rushing to open Texas businesses, putting Texans at risk, and what is Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick concerned about?
Protecting companies from lawsuits.
Dan Patrick wants you to break quarantine, risk your health, and be left with no way to hold a business accountable if a lack of proper sanitization practices gets you sick.
Anything for the economy, right Dan?

Hi Alex, as your Chair of the Texas Democratic Party, I have a front-row seat to a changing Texas. The fact of the matter is this: Texas is a battleground state.
We only need 9 seats to take back the Texas House! We flipped 12 in 2018, so I know we can do it.
The Texas House Democratic Campaign Committee is playing a huge role in our way forward. By mobilizing and energizing the Democratic movement like never before, we will secure a Democratic majority in the Texas House and change the course of Texas politics for decades to come.
Rush a donation to support the HDCC >>>
When we win this, it will be because Texas Democrats like you supported us from beginning to end. So I have to ask, can you rush a $25 contribution to the Texas HDCC to flip the Texas House?
This is where I have to say, I cannot stress the importance of supporting the Texas HDCC today. Republicans are watching everything we do and their wealthy donors are dumping money into Republican bank accounts.
We must show our strength as Texas Democrats. That means hitting every phonebank goal, every blockwalk goal, and every fundraising goal. You have done so much to change this state. I cannot thank you enough. Hitting these goals is how we build a winning campaign to take back our state.
Democrats are ready to deliver on the fair shot everyone deserves. Let’s unite, organize, and win. Join me in supporting the important work of the TXHDCC. Rush a donation right away.

Celia Israel,info@email.texashdcc.com,What a life,"today we honor RBG
Alex,
Like many of you, I'm spending my Saturday morning thinking about the impact of losing a champion like Justice Ginsburg.
Ruth Bader Ginsburg was a giant in every aspect of the word - nevermind that she stood at barely five feet. Her life was a testament to tenacity and grit. Despite the many doors that were closed to her, she paved her own way, right onto the highest court in the land. The trail she blazed will be walked on by countless women who come after her. We owe her so much.
As a young lesbian I was afraid to say who I was - in fact - society was dictating my silence and my fear of being who I was. Justice Ginsburg changed that with a vote to validate me and my family and all those young LGBT Americans who just want to live and love and be loved. Ruth changed laws that changed societies.
While we sip our coffee and take in the news, let's also take action. It's what she explicitly asked us to do.
A small but powerful woman stood up for me as a gay Latina from El Paso, Texas. Justice for folks like me, and so many others, depends on standing strong and flipping the Texas House. Let's make history together as we remember this small and powerful force known as Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Please join me in recommitting to this fight.
Our fight for our country, our state, and our legislature honors her memory. I’m not letting up, and you shouldn’t either.
Sinceramente,
Celia Israel

These new polls show that Greg Abbott’s DISASTROUS decision making in the wake of COVID-19 has weakened his popularity across the state.
Yeah, no kidding.

Alex, both as a nurse and as a person with common sense, I have to tell you... this is really bad.
With cases rising in Texas and Governor Abbott refusing to take action, the Trump administration is now making moves to close the few testing sites we currently have.

From the beginning, test-and-trace has been our only way out of this pandemic. Unfortunately, Greg Abbott appears to be following Donald Trump's lead, pushing the opening of businesses and child care centers without the necessary testing and contact tracing in place, while ignoring the science around wearing face masks and simply 'recommending' their use, despite surging cases and hospitalizations.
Enough. Let’s fight back. Chip in now to help the HDCC flip the Texas House and restore some sanity to Texas.
