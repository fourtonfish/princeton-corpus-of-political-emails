ARP is endorsing NO votes on Ballot Measures One & 2:
Vote
Ballot Question 1:
Ballot Measure 1 would raise taxes on the oil industry here in Alaska. The measure goes too far and puts Alaska’s economic recovery at risk by jeopardizing existing and future jobs, new projects that will grow oil production, and State revenue. Vote NO on 1!
Ballot Question 2:
The “Better Elections” ballot measure is BAD for Alaska voters. It will weaken the system and disenfranchise voters by creating a jungle primary. It will put ranked-choice voting in place which arbitrarily throws out your cast ballot and allows candidates with marginal support to win. In other words, votes cast will be negated (especially conservative ones). Vote NO on Ballot Question 2!
MORE >>
Fight back against the attacks on conservative values, free speech, Second Amendment Rights and more. Pitch-in to fuel our boots on the ground and make the Alaskan Republican Party stronger than ever.

Business Insider Claims
Federalist Waitress Sandwich
In a bombshell report by Business Insider, the Biden campaign has been caught in a cover up that started back in Spring 2019, when they sent researchers to the University of Delaware to access Senate documents that could include records surrounding Tara Reade's allegations that are unavailable to the public or the press:
In the face of corroborated sexual assault allegations, Joe Biden is trying to cover up his University of Delaware documents to save his political future.
The most transparent thing Joe Biden did on Friday was admit that he is hiding documents so they can't be used against him.
Former U.S. Senator Chris Dodd, who is linked to corporate bailouts, lobbying for Hollywood, and alleged sexual assault of a waitress at a restaurant, is among seven individuals appointed to Joe Biden’s Vice Presidential selection task force.
As the Biden campaign undergoes pressure to address the sexual assault allegations weighing against the presumed Democratic presidential nominee, it is an interesting choice to appoint a former senator, who also faces sexual assault allegations, to the campaign’s select vice president selection task force.
TAKE ACTION:
Don’t let special interest groups BUY Joe Biden the White House.

"Democrats want to remove safeguards and allow third-party ballot harvesting
This is what the Democrats don’t want you to know:
Here in Alaska, it was the Alaska Republican Party that encouraged conservative voters to apply for absentee ballots. In doing so, the ARP knew that absentee ballots had election integrity and safeguards in place to protect voter rights.
Sadly, our strong election process is now in jeopardy because Democrats want to eliminate the safeguards that allow legitimate absentee ballots to be secure (read more below).
It’s critical that our members, voters, and all concerned citizens stay up-to-date on this important battle to protect ballot integrity and voter rights. That’s why we wanted to send along the story below to make sure you’ve heard the latest about the ballot harvesting battle and who is REALLY FUNDING IT.
If you’re passionate about stopping third-party ballot harvesting and maintaining election integrity, we hope you’ll consider chipping in just $5 today. Help us fight back against the Democrat’s effort to CHANGE our election process and stop them from stripping away the safeguards that have made absentee mail-in ballots successful and legitimate here in Alaska.

THE LATEST:
Federalist Spygate Ballot Harvesting
Spygate Law Firm That Attempted To Overturn 2016 Election Behind 2020 Voting Lawsuits
A Democratic effort is underway in at least 16 states to overturn restrictions on mail-in balloting and third-party ballot harvesting.
CHIP-IN $5 TO STOP BALLOT HARVESTING FROM HAPPENING IN ALASKA
A nationwide effort by Democrats is underway in at least 16 states to overturn restrictions on mail-in voting and third-party ballot harvesting. States where suits have been filed include the swing states of Minnesota, Pennsylvania, and Florida.
The effort is being backed by the National Redistricting Foundation, a Democratic group headed by the Obama administration’s Attorney General Eric Holder. The suits appear to be funded by Priorities USA, a Democratic super PAC. A Wall Street Journal headline from April read, “Biden Campaign Indicates Priorities USA Is Preferred Super PAC — Nod from the presumptive Democratic nominee sends a message to top donors on where to focus contributions.”
PROTECT VOTER RIGHTS IN ALASKA >>
For example, the Pennsylvania lawsuit, funded by Priorities USA, seeks to mandate mail-in ballots, require the counting of votes received by mail after election day, and strike down Pennsylvania prohibitions on ballot harvesting, meaning the third-party mass collection of absentee and mail-in ballots.
The efforts in other states are similar. Democrat lawsuits in Minnesota take a similar, if less direct, path. A suit filed in Minnesota earlier this year by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee seeks to strike down a law prohibiting ballot harvesting.
Last week, conveniently just after Minnesota Democrats failed to get mail-in voting through the state legislature, another suit was filed by the Minnesota Alliance for Retired Americans Educational Fund, the local chapter of D.C.-based political action group Alliance for Retired Americans, a prominent left-wing and union-linked group that supports Democratic causes across the United States. The plaintiffs claim that requiring voters to have a notary public or registered voter witness and sign their absentee ballot is a threat to safety.
DO NOT LET WHAT’S HAPPENING IN THE LOWER 48, HAPPEN TO US
Another plaintiff in the same suit is a 24-year-old Yale Law School student, who complains that he cast his Minnesota absentee ballot too late in 2018, which disallowed it from being counted.
Getting rid of Minnesota’s rule requiring a witness when casting an absentee ballot and requiring that ballots be received by election day would turn Minnesota’s absentee voting system into a de facto mail-in balloting system. Critics allege Minnesota’s absentee voting system is already subject to abuse. For example, more than 25,000 Minnesota voters in 2018 had a challenged voter-registration status, meaning something in the state’s systems flagged them as ineligible to vote. Nevertheless, these voters are allowed to vote absentee and “self-certify” that they are eligible.
In the 2008 election between former Sens. Norm Coleman, R-Minn., and Al Franken, D-Minn., election judges controversially rejected about 12,000 absentee ballots, and more than 1,000 ineligible felons were still allowed to cast votes in that election. After Coleman initially won by about 700 votes, a recount declared Franken the winner by a mere 312 votes.
Unfortunately, the corporate media has grossly mischaracterized these lawsuits, couching their aims in humanitarian terms. Minnesota’s Star Tribune ran a headline titled “Older Minnesota voters file suit to change absentee voting rules.” The corporate media has conveniently ignored that Democrats are using the coronavirus pandemic to accomplish their longtime goal of overturning much of American election law.
Even more stunning, all 16 lawsuits are being run by Perkins Coie attorney Marc Elias. Elias was chief counsel to both the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee in the 2016 presidential election, and was one of the key figures in the Russiagate conspiracy to remove President Donald Trump from office.
Elias and another Perkins Coie partner, Michael Sussmann, hired the opposition-research firm Fusion GPS to try to create ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. This led to Fusion GPS paying money to former British spy Christopher Steele, who paid money to anonymous Russian sources via a British national named Edward Baumgartner, who had ties to Russia.
These Russian sources, working with Steele and Fusion GPS, came up with the allegations in the so-called Steele dossier, which circulated throughout the highest levels of the Obama administration during the 2016 election. This occurred despite no part of the dossier being anything close to verified. The intelligence agencies had good reason to doubt the dossier’s author, and knew it was politically motivated.
Nevertheless, the Obama administration’s intelligence agencies used them to spy on the Trump campaign and the Trump transition team. In one specific instance, Democratic lawyers Elias and Sussmann directly worked to plant now-debunked stories in the media about a server in Trump tower communicating with Russia’s Alfa Bank. Elias has faced no repercussions to date for his role in the Russiagate matter.
In total, Democrats plan to spend tens of millions of dollars on the lawsuits run by Perkins Coie and Elias. The Trump campaign and Republican groups are planning to spend at least $10-$20 million to counter the Democrats’ efforts.

There is a full-on assault on election integrity happening across the nation. Here at home, outside special interest groups are pushing the “Better Elections” ballot initiative… but there is NOTHING “better” about this resolution, in reality, it’s quite the opposite.
The “Better Elections” ballot measure is BAD for Alaska voters. It will weaken the system and disenfranchise voters by creating a jungle primary and mask the true political affiliations of primary candidates. It will put ranked-choice voting in place which arbitrarily throws out your cast ballot and allows candidates with marginal support to win. In other words, votes cast will be negated (especially conservative ones).

LAST MID-MONTH DEADLINE OF THE ELECTION
I wanted to give you a brief update: Ann and Craig just gave me an update on our numbers and I’ll tell you -- things are getting serious. It’s critical that we raise another $2,201.89 before the mid-month deadline TONIGHT or the programs we need to keep funding just won’t be possible.
I know I’m being blunt but tonight is our LAST MID-MONTH DEADLINE OF THE ELECTION.
This is a huge deadline for us and we need more funds to beat it. Can I ask you to personally contribute just $10 more to help us reach this deadline before midnight tonight?

Alaska GOP
There is a full-on assault on election integrity happening across the nation.
Here at home, outside special interest groups are pushing the “Better Elections” ballot initiative… but there is NOTHING “better” about this resolution, in reality, it’s quite the opposite.
The “Better Elections” ballot measure is BAD for Alaska voters. It will weaken the system and disenfranchise voters by creating a jungle primary and mask true political affiliations of primary candidates. It will put ranked-choice voting in place which arbitrarily throws out your cast ballot and allows candidates with marginal support to win. In other words, votes cast will be negated (especially conservative ones).
Will you join us in speaking out AGAINST the “Better Elections” ballot initiative and tell Alaskans to VOTE NO ON 2?
ADD YOUR NAME IN OPPOSITION TO BALLOT MEASURE 2. Sign here >>
You’ve seen what is happening across the country. Democrats are pushing to remove safeguards, change election processes with less than 100 days until election day, and push state and local governments to do so all in the name of COVID-19.
Here in Alaska, we aren’t exempt. Outside special interest groups including the Colorado-based PAC Unite America have spent over a million dollars to place the initiative on OUR ballot here in Alaska in November.
We can’t let that happen.
This Ballot Measure is so bad that states and municipalities that have implemented it are trying to REPEAL it.

“Donald Trump is under water on his approval rating, with 46% of voters approving of the job he’s doing to 49% who disapprove. He leads Joe Biden by just 3 points at 48-45. Biden has a double-digit lead with independent voters at 52-39. Republicans have won the state by at least 9 points in every election since 1968.”
“You can add Alaska to the growing list of potentially competitive Senate races where Republicans are going to have to play defense this fall.""
“The US House race in the state looks like a toss-up, with Alyse Galvin holding a slight advantage over Don Young at 43-41.”

"be a part of the team that made this possible
Alaska Republican Party
As one of our insiders, I wanted to write you a quick update on our strategy for 2020:
First, some great news is that our fundraising and grassroots organization is stronger than ever. We have been working hard to build the infrastructure we need to communicate, get out the vote, and reach voters during a worldwide pandemic and the system is now in place.
With this system in place it’s important that we focus on TAKING BACK THE STATE HOUSE, and fighting to make sure we KEEP THE SENATE.
YOU are a pivotal part of our strategy. Can we count on you to help us make this happen? Contribute $20 for 2020 here >>
Part of the Team
To do so, our plan includes a unique election organization model and a targeted push to encourage Republicans to apply to vote absentee for the Primary AND General Election, and most importantly our strategy to get out the vote in November.
In order to make sure Republicans get elected and that we fulfill these goals, our effort requires both organization and funding.
The infrastructure is ready but we still need more funding to get where we need to be.
Contribute $20 for victory in 2020 >>
After crunching the numbers here’s what it comes down to:
If we have 20,000 Alaska Republicans pitch-in $20 or more we will see victory in taking back the State House and keeping the Senate in November.
We had a record-breaking year last year and we’re reaching heights we’ve never reached before. But we are short of what we need to make this last push through the Primary and General Election.
Will you pitch-in just $20 for 2020 here and help us reach the 20,000 donor goal?
This may sound like a lofty goal -- but seeing the success we’ve had so far this year we KNOW this is possible.
As Senator Ted Stevens reminded us, “Alaska’s Future is in your hands”.
Alaska IS in our hands. Let’s fight for our great state.

Bernie Sanders just dropped out of the Presidential race, clearing the path for Joe Biden to be the Democrat nominee. Now the race will REALLY begin, and it’s important that TODAY (NOW!) we show momentum and support behind our President, Donald J. Trump.
Will you help make sure Democrats see just how strong support is for President Trump by pitching in $5 or more today?
I AM WITH TRUMP!
Democrats are watching to see how much is raised across the nation. They’re hoping fundraising will be weak.
They think that what is raised today determines the outcome of the election.

"Help us stop ballot harvesting
Fox News
""Democrats use coronavirus as excuse to try eliminating safeguards against election fraud""
Ballot harvesting is becoming a VERY serious issue for the upcoming election so we are creating a list of Alaskans AGAINST ballot harvesting to help the cause. Can we add your name?
ADD MY NAME >>
""The process of ballot harvesting should be illegal for very good reason. It violates the chain of custody, exposing the ballot to potential manipulation by campaign operatives or nonprofit political groups. They could harass voters to turn in ballots, 'assist' them in filling them out, and potentially 'lose' ballots that don’t support the candidate the ballot harvester is paid to help.”
-Jason Chaffetz, Fox News Contributor
AlexDemocrats are doing everything in their power to push ballot harvesting in their ongoing effort to remove voting safeguards -- And they’re using the pandemic as an excuse!
Don’t let them fundamentally upend the way we vote just to further their political aims.
We need you to stand with us and fight back. Sign the petition to STOP BALLOT HARVESTING.
Thank you for standing with us to make sure the coastal elitist Democrats and their lobbyist friends DO NOT get away with this. Will you help us STOP BALLOT HARVESTING?
For Alaska and for our nation,

"# TALL TALES from Juneau
### Eyes on the Dunleavy Disaster
“ONCE THEY GET DONE VENTING”
You could practically hear the eye rolling as he stared at his watch.
It’s hard to say when that might be; are we “done venting” about the horrendous cuts to the university system? Are we “done venting” about skyrocketing charges at the Pioneer Homes? Are we “done venting” at incompetent, partisan cronies, and conservative talk radio hacks making six figures? Are we “done venting” about disingenuous promises used to get into office? Are we “done venting” at extreme cuts to Medicaid, homeless services, pre-K, agriculture programs, and public safety? Thumbing his nose at the Constitution and rights of workers? Are we “done venting” about how our governor is defending funneling over a billion dollars a year in tax credits to oil companies while the rest of Alaska just has to suck it up? I don’t know. We’re all just like: vent, vent, vent. When will we ever stop?
An easier question to answer is the “what are Alaskans willing to do?” part. That, they’ve made pretty clear.
ONE MORE VENT...
The administration hasn’t actually announced it yet, but the next big money-saving move on the part of the Dunleavy administration is to cut about $100 a month in benefits from Adult Public Assistance recipients. According to the state these payments are for “needy aged, blind and disabled Alaskans to help them remain independent.” What better way to help them remain independent than cutting their already meager benefits? Right? Or maybe this is just another good-faith conversation starter to see what they’re willing to take. I’m sure the governor hopes that the blind, needy, elderly and disabled get done venting soon. As usual reporter Dermot Cole is tracking the current misdeeds at [[URL REDACTED]]
NEVER MIND
Republican Lance Pruitt, House Minority Leader, Dunleavy sycophant, and husband of Dunleavy’s recently-booted communications director Mary Ann Pruitt, has decided to join the governor in his furious backpedaling strategy. He spent the entire legislative session trying to sabotage efforts to roll back Dunleavy’s budget vetoes, including leading his merry band of malcontents to the Wasilla Middle School for a pretend special session. He spent his time as leader sniping at his colleagues in the majority at every turn. But now that he senses a tough challenge from Democrat Liz Snyder, he’s suddenly decided that maybe he wants to become a statesman. This involves telling other legislators to just pretend like all that other stuff never happened. [cue Kumbaya music] ""What I would like to see is us putting our swords down and recognizing that we're all Alaskans, and we have different ideas, and different ways of going about it, but together we can get through this challenge,"" Pruitt said to the Alaska Municipal League’s Annual Local Government Conference. Indeed. Now that he’s run everyone through with HIS sword, he’s ready for everyone else to make nicey-nice and put theirs away.
THE OTHER PRUITT
At least one Pruitt is out of the governor’s inner circle, in case you missed the memo. Mary Ann Pruitt will no longer be making a cool $15k a month to implement the governor’s inexplicable and ineffective comms strategy. You may remember how she arranged for a bizarre interview conducted by an Alaska “student” (who turned out to be the son of two Dunleavy commissioners) at a table with an enormous bowl of oranges - where the governor sat and answered scripted softball questions to post on YouTube.
Well NOW, former right-wing radio host Dave Stieren (who's making a mere $11k a month as a ""community relations liaison"") has taken over and is interviewing the governor himself, with a new series of scripted softball questions and calling it a “News Update.” But no oranges this time. You get what you pay for, I guess.
FULL HOUSE
(Randomly chosen image from randomly chosen Facebook page in Gillis' ""liked"" section. There were dozens more that would have done the job.)
The newest member of the House, hunting guide Mel Gillis (R), was sworn in this week. He replaces Josh Revak (R) who got appointed to the Senate after the death of Sen. Chris Birch (R). This will make the third legislator hand-picked by the governor who will be headed to Juneau in January – Rep. Sharon Jackson, Sen. Josh Revak, and now Gillis. His political experience? According to the Anchorage Daily News, “In the 1980s, he became involved in the political fights over the Alaska National Interest Lands Act. He has stayed involved with the politics of big-game hunting in Alaska in the decades since.” He’s also decided to caucus with the House Republican Minority. He has “liked” many political pages on Facebook including: Breitbart, Drain the Swamp Alaska, Pro-Life Alaska, the NRA, Ben Shapiro, and a variety of other pages like 'Conservative Guy' that post non-stop Obama conspiracy theories, angry feminists, evil Democrats, puerile doctored photos, and Russian propaganda. This should be fun.
ENDORSEMENTS!
On a happier note, congratulations to Dr. Al Gross who’s running a fantastic campaign to eject ineffectual Trump lackey Dan Sullivan from the United States Senate. Al’s running as an Independent, and has secured the endorsement of the SDCC (Senate Democratic Campaign Committee)! And congratulations also to candidate for U.S. Congress Alyse Galvin who has earned an endorsement from the Planned Parenthood Action Fund. These fine candidates have won our endorsement as well, and we can’t wait to help send both of them to Washington D.C.!
WE’RE HIRING
You may have heard that the Alaska Democratic Party will be running a completely new statewide primary for presidential preference in 2020. Gone is the crowded, sweaty high school gym and the hours of standing around to caucus. This time we’ll have polling locations across the state, a ranked-choice voting system, the ability to early/absentee vote, and a streamlined process that will allow more Democrats than ever to help choose our nominee! We just need one thing. Someone to run the show! That’s right, we are hiring right now for a Presidential Primary & Caucus Director to work full time from January to July. Details are HERE so if you or someone you know would be perfect for the job, let us know!
FUN, FOOD, AND FANTASTIC GOODIES!
Ok, yes this is super last-minute, but... There is still time to attend the best event of 2019 – our annual Holiday Auction and Dinner! It’s our biggest, sparkly-est, most awesome fundraiser of the year and tickets are still available at the door. We’re once again kicking up our heels at the Lucy Cuddy Hall at UAA. We celebrated there last year and the food was amazing, and there was more than enough space for our big group plus tables and tables and TABLES of really great auction items. In addition to silent auction items, you can bid on Alaskan adventures on land, sea, air, and snow; lunches with your favorite legislators; Hawai’i condos; fabulous art, and so much more! The reason our crowd gets bigger every year is simply because it’s that much fun. And if there’s one thing we could use these days, it’s that. More details at the link.
Chin up, keep venting, and I hope to see you tonight!
