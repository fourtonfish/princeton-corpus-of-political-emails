Dear Alex,
As the end of Pride Month draws near, we would like to honor the origins of this celebration.
Fifty-one years ago, on June 28th, the riots at the Stonewall Inn were led by trans women of color, Marsha P. Johnson & Sylvia Rivera. A riot against police brutality and the start of the LGBTQ+ Civil Rights Movement.
This month, the Supreme Court ruled that employers can no longer discriminate against their employees on the basis of their sexual orientation. Although we have made progress, the lives of trans men and women are still being threatened today.
At the Maryland Democratic Party, we stand with the LGBTQ+ community. We encourage you to honor Pride Month by educating yourself and your loved ones on the origins of the movement.
LGBTQ+ rights are human rights. Black Trans Lives Matter.
Thank you,
Maryland Democratic Party

Alex,
Last week, we learned from a major story released by Washington Monthly that Governor Larry Hogan has made millions of dollars while in office—an unprecedented amount of money for any governor in the history of our state. Multiple national outlets are now covering the story, including a scathing critique by the New Republic entitled ""The Most Popular Crook in America"". Here’s what we know:
Hogan has refused to divest from his private real-estate business while in office, setting up a potential conflict of interest where he can use his powerful executive position to increase his personal profits. While governor, Hogan has expanded state spending on roads, highways, and bridges near property he owns, potentially increasing the value of his property. These spending decisions were made at the expense of mass transit projects that would have benefited many Marylanders, and have troubled ethics law experts.

It doesn’t add up that Governor Hogan has made millions of dollars while in office on a modest government salary. At a time when public trust in government has eroded due to unethical conduct from the White House to the State House, the people of Maryland deserve to know more.
Will you sign our petition calling on Governor Larry Hogan to come clean regarding his blatant conflicts of interest and potential ethical violations?
Thank you,
Ben Smith

Dear Alex,
It pains us to watch the senseless murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis. It pains us to hear the words “I can’t breathe” ignored by officers who took the oath to protect and serve. It pains us to see the President of the United States call our fellow Americans “THUGS” and suggest violence against them.
No black man or woman should walk out of their houses and fear that they will never return. No black man or woman should feel unsafe in their own homes. No black man or woman should be afraid to go to a park or to church.
We hear you George Floyd, we hear you Breonna Taylor, we hear you Ahmaud Arbery, we hear you Freddie Gray, Eric Gardner, Botham Jean, Sandra Bland, Alton Sterling, and the countless others whose names fill our hearts with sadness and a longing for this to end.
We as your state Party will continue to fight to end institutional racism and the violence against black men and women. We are one America and we stand for justice and fairness for all.
Thank you,
Maryland Democratic Party

Dear Alex,
I am excited to announce that our first virtual fundraiser on Tuesday, May 26 will feature Congressman Adam Schiff as our special guest. We are thrilled to have him join us and we would love to have your support and participation.
The current pandemic has altered everyone’s way of life, and that’s no different here at the Maryland Democratic Party. Despite the challenges brought on by the pandemic, we are still committed to bringing you compelling online programming in support of the Party.
You can RSVP here.
We understand that these are difficult times, and while we need to continue to fundraise to elect Democrats, your health and safety are the most important thing right now. Please only give if you are able to do so.
All the best,

Alex,
Many Democratic operatives look at deep-red communities and decide that they aren’t worth the time and effort. At the Maryland Democratic Party, we think differently.
We believe that if we never engage with voters in stronger red areas, we will never be able to energize Democrats there. That’s why in the past year, we’ve been investing greater resources into Western Maryland and the Eastern Shore by hiring full-time regional organizers and building a stronger campaign infrastructure in every county.
I’m incredibly excited to tell you that this strategy has been paying off. In early November, our Election Night victories in Harford County and on the Eastern Shore demonstrated that Democrats can win even in places considered to be conservative strongholds. By executing large-scale Get-Out-The-Vote operations in these regions, we successfully defended Democratic seats and flipped red seats to blue in local races across Wicomico, Kent and Harford Counties.
And we’re not going to stop there. We intend to build up Maryland’s Democratic bench in 2020 and 2022 by challenging the GOP in more local races all across the state. With your help, I know that we can pull it off. Will you chip in to help us organize in conservative strongholds and flip more seats from red to blue across the state?
The momentum of our movement is building, and you can help push us over the finish line. Let’s redefine what’s possible in Maryland politics. Let’s put the GOP on high-alert with more upset victories. Let’s turn more red seats blue!
Rise and organize,
Michael Bayrd

Thank you for signing up!
We are at a critical moment in the history of our nation, state, and Party. Republicans are using the politics of fear and division to separate neighbors, families, communities, and regions while embracing tactics that weaken our democracy–but while Larry Hogan and the Maryland Republican Party have remained silent, Democrats are fighting back.
The Democrats in our state's legislature, Congressional Delegation, and our Democratic attorney general are working hard to protect Marylanders from Trump's toxic agenda. But they're going to need your help to succeed.
Click here to volunteer with the Maryland Democratic Party.
With your support, Maryland will help turn the White House blue in the 2020 Presidential election cycle, defend our Congressional seats, expand the number of Democrats in local municipalities, and lay the foundation for expanding our state legislative majority and taking back the governor's mansion in 2022.
We want to keep you and your networks informed, engaged, and motivated to take action, so follow us on these social platforms:

Dear Alex,
As we celebrate the holidays with our loved ones and prepare to usher in the new year and new decade, I’d like to take a look back at how far we have come in this past year. 2019 was a busy, productive and eventful year for Maryland Democrats. It was a year of change and growth, a year of diligent and dutiful preparation, a year of triumph, and also a year of goodbyes. Here’s a look back at some of the major developments for Maryland Democrats in 2019:
2019 was a year of goodbyes, change, and transition.
We said goodbye to longtime House Speaker Michael Busch, who passed away on April 7. He dedicated more than 30 years of his career to public service, and was the longest-serving Speaker in the history of our state. “Coach” as he was lovingly called, was a true champion for all of us and his contributions to our state will be a lasting part of his legacy that will be felt for generations. We made history by electing his successor, House Speaker Adrienne A. Jones, the first woman and the first African-American to hold the position.
We said goodbye to Congressman Elijah Cummings, who passed away on October 17. Congressman Cummings served Maryland’s 7th Congressional District for more than 20 years, and served 16 years prior to that as a Delegate in the Maryland General Assembly. We will forever remember his dedication to his community by improving the lives of others and protecting our Democracy.
We say thank you to Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller, who announced on October 24 that he is stepping down from his position. As the longest serving Senate President in the history of our nation, he has carved out an unforgettable legacy in Maryland politics. We honor his historic tenure and service to our state, and we wish his successor, Senate President Nominee Bill Ferguson, best of luck in the next Legislative Session.
And finally, we bid farewell to former Chair Maya Rockeymoore Cummings, who stepped down to run for Maryland’s 7th Congressional District. We are ready to build on the success and continue the forward progress started during her tenure. I am incredibly excited to once again lead our Party and I am grateful for the opportunity to serve.
2019 was a year of victories for the people of Maryland--in the legislature, and at the polls.
During the 2019 Legislative Session, Democrats passed a number of progressive policies to make deep investments in education funding, improve wages for Maryland workers, and support working parents and young people. We salute the service of our incredible Democratic legislators to better the lives of all Marylanders, and we are incredibly excited for the new slate of proposed initiatives put forward by House Speaker Adrienne A. Jones and Senate President Nominee Bill Ferguson for the 2020 Legislative Session.
On Election Night, November 5, we celebrated a number of wins in conservative strongholds across the state. We successfully defended our Democratic seats in Harford County and on the Eastern Shore, and managed to flip several red seats to blue--demonstrating that Democrats can win all across the state.
2019 was a year of rapid growth for the Maryland Democratic Party.
We’ve hired more regional organizers to organize Democrats all across the state to increase Democratic turnout in Western Maryland and on the Eastern Shore, and to focus on local and municipal races in off-cycle years.
We underwent a rebranding project to update our logo and relaunch our website, a large-scale infrastructural investment that will serve our movement for years to come. Our new logo is bold, blue and Maryland-proud, and our new website has a host of effective, modern tools to help build our movement, including an interactive events map, foreign language translation, and accessibility options.
We started the new MD Dems Podcast\--a weekly deep dive into Maryland politics, national news and the political strategies it will take to win back the White House and the Governor’s Mansion in Maryland, featuring some of the most exciting leaders, activists, and figures in Maryland politics.
And finally, we’ve been building our movement with a series of major events to energize Maryland Democrats for 2020. In January, Congressman Adam Schiff keynoted our 2019 Legislative Luncheon. In June, we hosted 2020 Presidential Candidate Andrew Yang for an event with our AAPI Diversity Leadership Council. And in November, we held our action-packed 2019 Gala: Celebrating Diversity in Democracy with special guest House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
We are at a critical juncture in America, and our democracy is being tested in ways we have never experienced. Our job as Democrats is to be ready, and I’m happy to say that the Maryland Democratic Party is finishing the year united, strong, and firing on all cylinders. Together, I have no doubt we will reach new heights in 2020 and beyond.
Thank you,
Yvette Lewis

Dear Alex,
Have you been overwhelmed by the amount of disinformation being spread by the President during this crisis? Trust me, you aren’t alone.
On Episode 38 of the MD Dems Podcast I deliver a scathing assessment of Trump's evening Coronavirus Task Force press briefings. What you might not have noticed is that the briefings are purposefully timed to preempt local and national news coverage in media markets across the country.
Local news is a trusted source of information for everyday Americans. Unfortunately, instead of getting the news, these ""briefings"" regularly feed lies and disinformation to the American public that are designed to boost Trump's approval ratings as his administration bungles its response to the Covid-19 Pandemic.
It’s time that we begin calling them out for what they are: propaganda for an administration that every day is demonstrating through sheer incompetence, mismanagement, and corruption that new leadership is sorely needed in the White House.
In this era of social distancing, it’s more important than ever to stay connected and remain a part of the conversation. I hope you enjoy this latest episode. Please stay safe, wash your hands, and TRUST SCIENCE.
Ep. 38: Stockpile of Lies
Thank you,
Arinze Ifekauche
Communications Director, Maryland Democratic Party
P.S. If you would like to more actively fight back against Trump’s disinformation campaign, please consider supporting our efforts to elect a Democrat to the White House by chipping in a small amount today. If you have the means during this difficult time, your support will help us continue building our critical election-year operation.

Alex,
I’m incredibly excited to serve as your next Maryland Democratic Party Chair. This is a position I know very well, having previously served as Chair from 2011 to 2015. I am honored and humbled to be returning. During my tenure, we ran two statewide coordinated campaigns, a highly successful convention for our delegates and raised over $7 million to help elect Democrats up and down the ballot. These events are on the horizon for us in the coming months and we are ready to hit the ground running.
As a lifelong grassroots activist, I look forward to working with you to continue building our statewide movement. Our Party is united and strong. Together, I have no doubt we will achieve our goals for 2020 and beyond.
I have been heartened by the enthusiasm of those who have offered to volunteer and become engaged to help win elections up and down the ballot both here in Maryland and in other states.
We are at a critical juncture in America. Our democracy is being tested in ways we have never experienced and requires us to defend it. To meet this challenge, the Maryland Democratic Party will need to mount an aggressive strategy. This will require thousands of volunteers, robust fundraising and many hours. But we know this will lead to victory.
Maryland volunteers will also be a crucial part of winning Pennsylvania and Virginia as we continue our streak of flipping Red seats Blue here at home.
When I was sworn in I pledged to put the “Party First”. That will be our rallying cry. As I begin my term, I am asking you to work with us in this vital endeavor. The only remedy is action. Join the fight by adding your name to our list of 2020 grassroots activists: [[URL REDACTED]]

Dear Alex,
During these difficult times, it’s more important than ever to help each other out. That’s why I’m reaching out to see how you are holding up, to let you know that we are here for you, and to share how you can help some organizations in Maryland that are doing incredible work at this time.
At the Maryland Democratic Party, we have a deep commitment to helping our local communities, protecting the most vulnerable, and securing a better future for the people of our state. These values are what make us Democrats—and in times of great crisis, they are more important than ever.
As you read this, many of our fellow Marylanders are in dire need of help. Our service industry workers are out of work; our children are out of school; our healthcare professionals are out of critical supplies. While these past few weeks have been overwhelming for many of us, I think we can all find a sense of comfort by stepping up to meet the needs of our communities. Below, I’m listing a few organizations that could use your help during this crisis. If you have the means, please consider helping them.
And finally, we all have our role to play in preventing the spread of Coronavirus. Remember to wash your hands and clean down commonly-used surfaces frequently; practice social distancing; follow the guidelines of local authorities and the CDC; be wary of misinformation; and reach out to your friends, family members, and loved ones.

This is a fundraising email. During a pandemic. Full stop.
If you are one of the millions of Americans out of work and or struggling to make ends meet, please disregard this email and continue to stay safe and secure as best you can.
For those who are fortunate enough to have resources to share, we’re asking you to donate to the Party ahead of the upcoming election.
We need your support to continue our organizing program. Our regional organizers are working with Maryland Democrats to pump thousands of volunteer calls into battleground states and competitive Senate races through our export program.
The pandemic may have stopped our ability to fundraise and organize in person-- but it has not discouraged us from continuing the important work of protecting the U.S. House, and taking back the White House and U.S. Senate.

Dear Friend,
Labor Day is dedicated to recognizing the social and economic achievements of American workers.
Labor is the backbone of our country. We would like to give a special thank you to all of the essential workers who have risked their lives to keep the country running during a global pandemic.
We would also like to thank all of the Unions who have fought for workers’ rights and safe working conditions. Thank you for protecting America’s workforce.
Happy Labor Day!

Dear Alex,
This week, former Vice President Joe Biden became the presumptive Democratic Nominee for President following Senator Bernie Sanders’s withdrawal from the race.
Senator Sanders ran an incredible campaign that inspired a generation of voters to think deeply about the major issues affecting our country, from access to healthcare, to the harmful effects of the expanding wealth gap between the ultra-wealthy and working families, to the urgent need to combat climate change. We applaud him for a well-fought campaign, and we are incredibly excited to work with the campaign of Vice President Biden to take back the White House this November.
As the Covid-19 pandemic has revealed the urgent need for competent leadership in the White House, it’s time for Democrats to rise, organize, and mobilize. Hundreds of your friends and neighbors in Maryland are eager to get this campaign started--and we want to make sure that you aren’t left out. Are you interested in volunteering to help us defeat Donald Trump?
The Maryland Democratic Party has been busy laying the groundwork for victory in 2020. During this era of social distancing, we’ve pivoted to digital organizing efforts to continue empowering our volunteers, activists and allies to create meaningful change in our local communities across the state.
And this fall, if and when this crisis is behind us, we will launch our exciting new program to export Maryland volunteers to flip the nearby swing states of Pennsylvania and North Carolina, and keep Virginia blue.
We are fighting for the future of our Democracy in this election--the stakes are too high to sit out on the sidelines. With your help, we can propel Vice President Joe Biden to the White House, flip the Senate, and elect Democrats up and down the ballot this November!
Help us defeat Donald Trump and propel Joe Biden to victory by signing up to volunteer.
Thank you,
Yvette Lewis

Dear Alex,
On January 1, 2020, the minimum wage in Maryland increased to $11 an hour. Of the workers who have just received a pay raise, the majority of them are minorities, and more than 55% of them are women.
This is the first step of a phased plan to raise Maryland’s minimum wage to $15 an hour over the next five years. Today, I celebrate this victory for Maryland workers, and I thank my Democratic colleagues in the Maryland General Assembly who fought to make the Fight For Fifteen a reality.
In 2019, Maryland Democrats sponsored and passed a minimum wage bill making Maryland just the 6th state in the nation to enact a statewide $15 minimum wage. For employers with 15 or more employees, the minimum wage will be increased by 75 cents each year to reach $15 an hour by January 1, 2025.
When Governor Larry Hogan vetoed the bill to increase the minimum wage, my colleagues in the Maryland House of Delegates and the Maryland State Senate banded together to immediately override his veto and guarantee wage increases for more than a half million working Marylanders. We have fought, and will continue to fight for fair wages and better working conditions.
I am thankful for my Democratic colleagues who had the courage to move the needle forward for working families across our state. I hope you’ll join me in thanking them by signing the Maryland Democratic Party’s thank you card:
Thanks for all that you do,
Senator Cory McCray

Hi Alex,
I’m Council President Brandon Scott, the Democratic nominee for mayor of Baltimore. I’m proud to be running because the status quo just isn’t working; we have a broken political system that has torn our country and city apart, and it’s time for change. We need a new generation of leadership, from Annapolis and Washington, to Baltimore and our city councils.
It’s also why I’m supporting Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. They will usher in a new era of leadership. Together, we can build a coalition that will lift up every Baltimorean and Marylander.
But we need your help. This fight is not an easy one, and we need the resources to keep it going.
Can you pitch in $20 to help us build a new generation of leadership?
We need to fight for a livable minimum wage, reimagine public safety, and properly invest in our schools and education systems. Our current leadership has shown they will not make these investments in our future. It’s going to be on us.
Even $5 could make the difference we need.
I know we can count on you to make this investment, and charter a new path for our state and country.
Thank you so much for your help,
Brandon Scott

Alex,
We are at a critical moment in the history of our nation, state, and Party. Republicans are using the politics of fear and division to separate Democrats, neighbors, families, communities, and regions while embracing tactics that weaken our democracy.
So we want to know that you're with us. That's why we're asking you to add your name and say you're committed to helping Democrats get elected up and down the ballot in Maryland this year and for years to come.
We're working to get to know your region, meet its leaders, and understand its unique perspectives and concerns.
And we're working to actively engage all Party constituencies and be open to constructive feedback and advice along the way.
We've heard concerns about healthcare, climate change, pushing back against the Trump administration, and questions about what Democrats can do to help working families.
Here's what we know we need to do: we must develop and pursue transparent, equitable, inclusive, and unifying strategies that will enable Democrats to maintain and expand state and federal legislative seats while also winning future gubernatorial races.
So we want to hear from you: are you with us in fighting for justice?
Thank you!

Alex,
This morning, Washington Monthly published an exposé of Larry Hogan’s extensive use of State transportation projects to benefit his real estate investments. Hogan refused multiple interview requests for the story, and his spokesman says there is nothing wrong with the Governor actively making decisions on transportation projects that benefit his business without recusing himself.
Reporting from Eric Cortellessa on Hogan’s apparent self-dealing found that:
* “Before canceling the [Baltimore] Red Line, [Hogan] approved millions of dollars in road and sidewalk improvements near property he had bought approximately two years earlier.”
* Hogan purchased a land parcel known as Brandywine within months of personally earmarking a $58 million interchange project at the Brandywine location. He “did not notify legislators that he had property interests nearby before the vote.”
* Hogan-- who has never recused himself from any decision-making that conflicts with his business dealings-- claims that he’s never made a decision on an individual project. But former Governor Parris Glendening says that transportation projects are the “governor’s decision and not someone in government bureaucracy”; a former director of the non-partisan Department of Legislative Services in Annapolis called Hogan’s claims a “ridiculous assertion.”
* “Maryland ethics law bans officials or employees from making decisions on matters in which they have an economic interest.” In a 2019 memo the Maryland Ethics Commission made clear that “an official may not participate in any matters on behalf of the State relating to the [official’s] secondary employer or entity where the ownership interest lies, even if the Commission grants an exemption or exception.”
And there’s more… a lot more. Click here to read a highlighted version of Cortellessa’s 4,363-word investigation if you’re short on time!

Alex,
Yesterday, the House of Representatives impeached President Donald Trump for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. This is only the third time in history that the House has voted to impeach the President of the United States—and it couldn’t have been done without the incredible Democratic Members of Maryland’s Congressional Delegation.
While this is a somber moment for our nation, the Constitution of the United States must be defended. We cannot ignore a President who has actively solicited assistance from foreign governments-- TWICE-- to interfere in a national election. And we cannot allow the Executive Branch to thumb its nose at the constitutionally mandated power of congressional oversight.
Our Democratic Members were at the center of the lead up and ultimate execution of these historic proceedings, and they represented us admirably with a phenomenal display of patriotism, courage, and grace.
We hope you will join us in thanking our Democratic Members of Congress for their efforts to defend our Democracy and hold the President accountable.
Sign the card to thank Maryland’s Democratic Members of Congress for their important work in this critical moment.

Dear Alex,
This February, the Maryland Democratic Party proudly commemorates Black History Month, and honors the many Black Marylanders who have shaped our nation’s history.
Maryland has played an outsized role in the history of African Americans. From our state’s shameful participation in the Atlantic slave trade rose the seeds of abolition, civil rights, and freedom. Larger-than-life African Americans that have shaken the nation--Frederick Douglass; Harriet Tubman; Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall; and most recently Congressman Elijah Cummings\--all hail from the Great State of Maryland. We honor their enduring legacies, and pledge to continue their fight to secure equal justice, liberty, and opportunity for all.
We also recognize the many Black Marylanders who currently serve as trailblazers for the rest of the nation. In the Maryland General Assembly, House Speaker Adrienne Jones became the first African American and the first woman to ever hold the position. And in our own organization, Chair Yvette Lewis and Executive Director Eva Lewis (no relation) made the MD Dems the first state Democratic Party in the nation to be led by African American women in both leadership roles.
To those who have made, and continue to make history--we salute you. And to the countless African American Democratic leaders in the Maryland Legislative Black Caucus, U.S. Congress, County Executive seats, Mayorships, and local offices around the state--we proudly stand with you in the fight to continue improving the lives of all Marylanders.
While the fight for racial equality has come a long way, we are nowhere near finished. We believe that addressing historic social, economic and political inequities faced by black communities is a moral imperative. As we recognize Black History Month this year, may we renew our commitment to improving the lives of Maryland’s black communities by uplifting our leading black voices, supporting smart policies, and electing Democrats up and down the ballot.
Thank you,
Maryland Democratic Party

We are exactly 100 days away from the election, and we need you now more than ever. We cannot sit back and watch this election pass by, we need you to take action by volunteering for the Maryland Democratic Party to call into swing states to make sure that Donald Trump is defeated in November.
This is the most important election of our lifetimes. This election is more than putting a Democrat in the White House, this election is to defeat an existential threat to our democracy, Donald Trump.
There is so much at stake. We are voting for Supreme Court nominations, for reversing the economic impact of the coronavirus, for affordable health care, for action on climate change, and most importantly, we are voting to bring decency, compassion, and empathy back into the White House.

Dear Alex,
On Wednesday Governor Hogan directed the State Board of Elections (SBE) to hold in-person elections on November 3, 2020.
Rather than mailing ballots directly to every Marylander, he wants the SBE to mail applications for ballots to every voter. This is clearly a redundant and needlessly complicated process since Marylanders have the ability to request a ballot online or at their local board at any time before the deadline.
The Maryland Democratic Party and a growing consensus of elected officials, public health experts, and election experts agree that the upcoming Presidential General Election should be conducted by vote-by-mail with as many early voting and in-person voting locations as safety will allow.
Sign the petition to demand every Maryland voter be mailed a General Election ballot.
In a statement released by Maryland Democratic Party Chair Yvette Lewis, she disagreed with Hogan’s decision:
""We are living in a world where our entire way of life and economy can be wiped out in a matter of days. Why on earth would Gov. Hogan recommend that our public buildings be open and staffed for the general election, when we have no idea what our public health situation will be by the Fall? If the Governor insists on an in-person precinct-level election, then he must be held fully responsible for any and all poll-worker shortages; lack of PPE; or long lines associated with his decision. We must follow the advice of the scientists and public health experts.""
The Primary Election, despite multiple setbacks, still resulted in record turnout! Maryland voters deserve safe and equitable access to the ballot-- and there is little evidence that Hogan’s decision will yield a safer, more cost effective, and higher turnout election in November.
We can-- and we must-- do better.
Thank you,
Maryland Democratic Party

Dear Alex
In the most consequential election of our lifetimes, we need all hands on deck to make sure Marylanders can vote safely and conveniently at home, early or on Election Day. Every tool should be deployed to keep ourselves and each other safe. Governor Hogan’s decision not to mail every voter a mail-in ballot will make voting during the pandemic even more challenging.
These are uncertain times and we still aren't sure what exactly election day voting will look like. We are working with state and local leaders to make sure election day is safe and voters have every opportunity possible to cast their ballot, but we need your help.
Maryland Democrats must step up now to help make this election a success. Voting by mail, submitting your ballot applications early, and urging others to do the same will help prevent massive disenfranchisement and “flatten the ballot curve.” Democracy must continue and Democrats must lead the way.
Please share this information with your friends, family, and neighbors:
Election Day will take place on Tuesday, November 3, 2020 with polling locations open on Election Day and various early voting locations open throughout Maryland beforehand.
The Maryland State Board of Elections (SBE) will automatically mail a mail-in ballot application (not your actual ballot, as was done in the primary) to the address that they have on file for you. You may also request a mail-in ballot online by October 20, 2020. The mail-in ballot application and the ballot itself will come with prepaid postage. You can check which address SBE has on file for you here.
If you need to register to vote or update your current address, you must do so by Tuesday, October 13, 2020. Or you may exercise your right to “same day” register and vote during the early voting period and on Election Day. You can find further guidance on this process here.
Once you receive your ballot, be sure to fill out the entire ballot, sign the oath on the envelope, and postmark it by Election Day. You can also place your ballot in a secure ballot drop-off box in your community. Drop-off box locations will be provided with your mail-in ballot. If you are unable to vote by mail, you must vote in-person during the early vote period or on Election Day at your designated polling location in your jurisdiction.
Getting our message out to every Marylander about the opportunity to cast their vote against Donald Trump in this election will take real legwork. This election will be different. We can’t count on the Governor to get the word out about how, when and where to vote-- which is why we must work together to ensure Democrats make it to the polls in November!
Thank you for your support, let's get out the vote!

Maryland Democratic Party
* * *
Legislative Leaders of Maryland
Adrienne A. Jones Speaker of the House and Bill Ferguson President of the Senate
Democrats,
We are writing to make sure you know about important Democratic Party priorities on the statewide fall ballot, Question 1 and Question 2. We strongly encourage you to vote for Question 1 and 2 and advocate for their passage.
QUESTION 1
Question 1 reads:
“The proposed amendment authorizes the General Assembly, in enacting a balanced budget bill for fiscal year 2024 and each fiscal year thereafter, to increase, diminish, or add items, provided that the General Assembly may not exceed the total proposed budget as submitted by the Governor.”
Currently, Maryland’s legislature is the weakest of any in the country when it comes to budgetary powers. When the Governor sends his proposed budget to the legislature, the legislature can ONLY cut from the Governor’s proposed budget -- not add or move money around.
This ballot question was overwhelmingly approved by Democrats in the Maryland General Assembly because this allows legislators to set priorities within the Governor’s overall budget. It is important to remember that this ballot question does not impact the constitutional requirement to have a balanced budget every single year.
The Governor will have the ability to line item veto items within the budget, subject to a legislative override. The change would become effective with the next Governor's first budget (January 2023).
Why should voters support the change? Passage of Question 1 is a good government reform to ensure that a co-equal branch of government is truly co-equal. Frankly, most Marylanders probably already assume the legislature has this power.
Why should Democrats support the change? Because the Democratic Party has controlled both chambers of the Maryland General Assembly since 1917 but, unfortunately, has not held the Governor’s mansion during that entire period. During the last twenty years, Democrats have only held the Governor’s mansion for 50% of the time despite overwhelming majorities in the legislature.
The limits on the General Assembly’s budgetary powers have had real world impacts. In 2019, Governor Hogan refused to fund 76 line items the legislature asked him to -- because we could only ask without this power -- including such priorities as an anti-violence grant program; funding for the prescription drug affordability board; rape kit test funding; pre-trial services; and school construction.
QUESTION 2
Question 2 reads:
“Do you approve the expansion of commercial gaming in the State of Maryland to authorize sports and events betting for the primary purpose of raising revenue for education?”
As Maryland faces unprecedented budget challenges, especially with inaction at the federal level, the legislature will be looking for all opportunities to provide continued funding to public school programming. This year, due to the impact of COVID-19, the Education Trust Fund is facing a $156 million shortfall.
Following the Supreme Court decision, Maryland is already losing out to surrounding states. According to an Oxford Economic study, there is approximately $2.8 billion in illegal sports betting that occurs annually in Maryland. Approval of this constitutional amendment would allow the State to regulate this activity while also providing funding support to public schools.
We appreciate your support in advocating for passage of these two important ballot questions this Election Day.
Sincerely,

Dear Alex,
Last week the Maryland General Assembly took the dramatic step to adjourn the 2020 Legislative Session more than two weeks early due to the Coronavirus crisis. We support House Speaker Adrienne Jones and Senate President Bill Ferguson for making this tough call in the interest of public health.
Though their time was cut short, Democrats in the General Assembly still managed to pass several historic pieces of legislation that will benefit all Marylanders including: a bill to fund Maryland’s public schools; an emergency package to protect Marylanders from the impact of COVID-19; a public safety package; and so much more.
Let’s take a moment to say THANK YOU to our legislators who worked to enact life-saving public health and public safety measures before adjourning!
Here’s a brief snapshot of some of the major bills successfully passed by the Maryland General Assembly in 2020:
COVID-19 Emergency Package
To protect Marylanders from the impact of the Coronavirus pandemic, Senate President Bill Ferguson, House Speaker Adrienne Jones, and Senator Clarence Lam led a series of emergency measures that authorized the Governor to use up to $150,000,000 to fund costs related to addressing the Coronavirus pandemic and take actions addressing the economic fallout of the crisis. The measures also authorized the Secretary of Labor to determine eligibility for unemployment insurance for those affected.
Lower Prescription Drug Costs
In an effort to reduce prescription drug costs, Del. Shane Pendergrass proposed a “reverse auction” to select the pharmacy benefits manager (PBM) for State Employees, Retirees, and Welfare benefit recipients. Vendors would submit their lowest bids in a competition to be selected as PBM for the Maryland Rx Program. Adoption of this process would limit independent pharmacies from unsustainable reimbursement practices while preventing a reduction in employee benefits.
Transformational Education Reforms
Democrats hope to dramatically improve our state's education system with the passage of the Built to Learn Act and the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future by investing record funding levels in school construction, teacher pay, expanded pre-k, vocational training for high school students, and much more. Be sure to thank Speaker Adrienne Jones; Senate President Bill Ferguson; Dels. Maggie McIntosh, Kathleen Dumais, Michael Jackson; Senate President Emeritus Mike Miller; and Senator Douglas Peters.
Speaker Jones and Sen. Charles Sydnor passed a 10-year $577 million funding package for Maryland’s HBCUs. The package is contingent upon the outcome of a pending lawsuit seeking compensation for years of underfunding of the State’s black colleges.
Economic Fairness for Job Seekers
Delegate Karen Young and Senator Susan Lee led the effort to ban employers from seeking wage history information for job applicants and require employers to provide a salary range to job applicants upon request.
Promoting Public Safety
To make our communities safer, Senator Will Smith and Delegate Luke Clippinger led the fight to establish a Law Enforcement Coordinating Council to provide more support for communities with the greatest concentration of crime, develop more effective strategies to fight crime, and increase cooperation across jurisdictions. Senator Susan Lee sponsored a bill to make it easier for prosecutors to bring witness intimidation cases during trials involving crimes of violence and felony drug crimes.
These are a small sample of the 600+ pieces of legislation passed this Session.
We thank our Maryland Democrats for their extraordinary work under these incredibly difficult circumstances. As we adapt to the rapid changes affecting our everyday lives, there is perhaps no time more appropriate than the present to reflect on the important work conducted by our elected officials to keep our citizens safe, rise to the urgency of the moment, and safeguard our collective future.
Thank you,
Yvette Lewis

Dear Alex,
As we celebrate the holidays with our loved ones and prepare to usher in the new year and new decade, I’d like to take a look back at how far we have come in this past year. 2019 was a busy, productive and eventful year for Maryland Democrats. It was a year of change and growth, a year of diligent and dutiful preparation, a year of triumph, and also a year of goodbyes. Here’s a look back at some of the major developments for Maryland Democrats in 2019:
2019 was a year of goodbyes, change, and transition.
We said goodbye to longtime House Speaker Michael Busch, who passed away on April 7. He dedicated more than 30 years of his career to public service, and was the longest-serving Speaker in the history of our state. “Coach” as he was lovingly called, was a true champion for all of us and his contributions to our state will be a lasting part of his legacy that will be felt by generations. We made history by electing his successor, House Speaker Adrienne Jones, the first woman and the first African-American to hold the position.
We said goodbye to Congressman Elijah Cummings, who passed away on October 17. Congressman Cummings served Maryland’s 7th Congressional District for more than 20 years, and served 16 priors year to that as a Delegate in the Maryland General Assembly. We will forever remember his dedication to his community by, improving the lives of others, and protecting our Democracy.
We say goodbye to Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller, who announced on October 24 that he is stepping down from his position. As the longest serving Senate President in the history of our nation, he has carved out an unforgettable legacy in Maryland politics. We honor his historic tenure and service to our state, and we wish his successor, Senate President Nominee Bill Ferguson, best of luck in the next Legislative Session.
And finally, we bid farewell to former Chair Maya Rockeymoore Cummings, who stepped down to run for Maryland’s 7th Congressional District. We are ready to build on the success and continue the forward progress started during her tenure. I am incredibly excited to once again lead our Party and I am grateful for the opportunity to serve.
2019 was a year of victories for the people of Maryland--in the legislature, and at the polls.
During the 2019 Legislative Session, Democrats passed a number of progressive policies to make deep investments in education funding, improve wages for Maryland workers, and support working parents and young people. We salute the service of our incredible Democratic legislators to better the lives of all Marylanders, and we are incredibly excited for the new slate of proposed initiatives put forward by House Speaker Adrienne Jones and Senate President Bill Ferguson for the 2020 Legislative Session.
On Election Night, November 5, we celebrated a number of wins in conservative strongholds across the state. We successfully defended our Democratic seats in Harford County and on the Eastern Shore, and managed to flip several red seats to blue--demonstrating that Democrats can win all across the state.
2019 was a year of rapid growth for the Maryland Democratic Party.
We’ve hired more regional organizers to organize Democrats all across the state to increase Democratic turnout in Western Maryland and on the Eastern Shore, and to focus on local and municipal races in off-cycle years.
We underwent a rebranding project to update our logo and relaunch our website, a large-scale infrastructural investment that will serve our movement for years to come. Our new logo is bold, blue and Maryland-proud, and our new website has a host of effective, modern tools to help build our movement, including an interactive events map, foreign language translation, and accessibility options.
We’ve increased our small-dollar recurring donors five-fold, expanding our operating budget by thousands of dollars through grassroots supporters alone.
We started the new MD Dems Podcast\-- a weekly deep dive into Maryland politics, national news and the political strategies it will take to win back the White House and the Governor’s Mansion in Maryland, featuring some of the most exciting leaders, activists, and figures in Maryland politics.
And finally, we’ve been building our movement with a series of major events to energize Maryland Democrats for 2020. In January, Congressman Adam Schiff keynoted our 2019 Legislative Luncheon. In June, we hosted 2020 Presidential Candidate Andrew Yang for an event with our AAPI Diversity Leadership Council. And in November, we held our action-packed 2019 Gala: Celebrating Diversity in Democracy with special guest House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
We are at a critical juncture in America, and our democracy is being tested in ways we have never experienced. Our job as Democrats is to be ready, and I’m happy to say that the Maryland Democratic Party is finishing the year united, strong, and firing on all cylinders. Together, I have no doubt we will reach new heights in 2020 and beyond.
Thank you,
Yvette Lewis

Dear Alex,
Interested in becoming a Maryland Delegate to the 2020 Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee? Then check out our informational webinar hosted by the Young Democrats of Maryland and Maryland State Delegate Nicole Williams (District 22) to learn more!
The filing period to run as a Congressional District-Level Delegate is January 6 – January 24, 2020. You must register by 5:00 PM at the State Board of Elections in Annapolis, Charles County, Frederick County or Wicomico County. At-large and Alternate Delegates may file their candidacy between May 7, 2020 – May 14, 2020 at 5:00 PM.
The Democratic National Committee allotted 119 convention Delegates and eight Alternates to Maryland for the 2020 Convention. Twenty-three of those Delegate slots are automatically reserved for Party leadership including our voting DNC Members and the Democrats in our federal delegation. Another 10 Delegate slots were reserved for state and local elected officials who have pledged support for a particular candidate.
Registered Maryland Democrats may run for the remaining Delegate slots. The selection process designates 65 slots divided (by formula) across Maryland’s eight Congressional Districts, where they will appear on the primary election ballot. Additionally, 21 At-large slots and eight Alternates will be selected by a vote of Maryland’s Democratic State Central Committee at its first meeting following the primary. Those slots will be apportioned to presidential candidates on the basis of the statewide primary vote.
The Delegate Selection Plan also mandates parity in representation among men and women, and young Democrats are eligible to run as Delegates so long as they turn 18 prior to November 3, 2020.

Dear Alex,
Democrats in the Maryland General Assembly are fighting to reduce violent crime with new legislation that will provide for greater accountability for state agencies, smarter resources for law enforcement, and fewer illegal guns in our communities. Governor Larry Hogan favors passing draconian mandatory minimum sentencing laws that have already been shown to be ineffective at reducing violent crime. Democrats have no interest in passing ineffective laws--yet this doesn’t matter to Larry Hogan.
Last week, Hogan called on Senator Will Smith to step down from his position as Chairman of the Judicial Proceedings Committee over this disagreement. Hogan’s actions were inappropriate and crossed the line of decency.
The Governor needs to work with Democrats to create real solutions that will address violent crime in Maryland. Instead, he seems content to hold press conferences, lash out at legislators trying to do their jobs, and hide behind polling data instead of tackling complex issues with sincerity.
After his outburst last week, Democrats moved swiftly to hold Hogan accountable. Here’s a recap of how we responded:
Senator Will Smith's Baltimore Sun Op-Ed
“Last week the governor of the state of Maryland called on me to step down from my position as the chairman of the Judicial Proceedings Committee because the committee has not passed a portion of his legislative package, which would have created new draconian mandatory minimums and taken discretion away from prosecutors and judges.
Gov. Larry Hogan referenced recent polling data 11 times during a 12-minute statement to the press in which he continued his push for new mandatory minimums.
The governor needs to stop polling and start leading. Real leadership requires tough work and dedication to understanding the problems before us, not bumper-sticker, poll-driven hyperbole.”
Read the article here.
MD Dems Tweet Storm
See the full Tweet thread here.
MD Dems Facebook Post
“Today, Governor Larry Hogan showed that his grandstanding is as breathtaking as it is galling. Calling for the resignation of legislators who disagree with ineffective and draconian policies like mandatory minimum sentencing doesn’t just cross the line of decency—it shames the office of Governor.”
See the full Facebook post here.
We will not tolerate Hogan’s disingenuous grandstanding. If he were serious about using his power as governor to fight crime, he would push the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services (DPSCS) to fill the 20% of jobs left vacant within the agency so that DPSCS could better monitor the 30.5% of Baltimore City murder victims and the 27% of Baltimore City murder suspects under Parole and Probation supervision!
Thank you,
Maryland Democratic Party

Dear Alex,
Democrats have done their best to partner with Governor Hogan to respond to this once in a lifetime pandemic-- but his decision to veto bills to improve our schools, fight crime, and reduce drug prices late last week is his latest failure in a string of avoidable failures.
Hundreds of thousands of Marylanders are still waiting on their unemployment claims to be processed by the State while Americans in hard hit states like New York and Michigan have readily had access to their unemployment benefits for weeks.
Hogan might be distracted by the media attention and should focus on seeing this COVID-19 crisis through to the finish-- sign the petition if you agree.
Following a “Mission Accomplished” style victory speech and ensuing national media tour, it was revealed that Hogan’s signature deal with South Korea to secure 500K test kits was actually a flop.
Reporting from the Washington Post found that Marylanders can’t get the tests they need to monitor the spread of coronavirus because the tests were not purchased with the necessary-- and hard to find-- testing accessories such as reagents and nasal swabs. He bought the useless tests at roughly 30% above the normal asking price.
Worthless tests aren’t the only things Hogan’s administration is haphazardly purchasing. The New York Times reported last week that a federal investigation was opened into a $12.5 million PPE contract Hogan’s administration awarded to a fly-by-night medical supply company founded by veteran GOP fundraising operatives.
It appears Marylanders can’t get their unemployment; can’t get the tests they were promised; and can’t trust Hogan and his administration to responsibly look after our tax dollars.
If you think Hogan should focus on competently running the government and leave the legislating to Senate President Bill Ferguson, Speaker Adrienne Jones and the Democratic majority you elected to represent you-- add your name to this petition.
When this crisis is over, we will still need high quality public education and safety. We must avoid the potential $2 billion judgment against the State by fully funding our HBCUs for the next 10 years and settling this decade old lawsuit. And we will need affordable drug prices as we dig ourselves out of this devastating economic downturn.
We all want to make it to the other side of this crisis, but we won’t get there if we do not hold our elected leaders accountable when they fall short.
Thank you for your support and continue to stay safe,
Maryland Democratic Party

Today former Vice President Joe Biden became the presumptive Democratic Nominee for president following Senator Bernie Sanders’s withdrawal from the race.
Maryland Democratic Party Chair Yvette Lewis said she was thankful for Senator Sanders’s leadership, his inspiring movement and his progressive agenda.
“Sen. Sanders ran an admirable campaign that inspired a generation of voters to think more deeply about the healthcare disparities in America; the harmfulness of our expanding wage gap between the rich, the middle class, and the poor; and our urgent need to address climate change,” Chair Lewis said. “The Covid-19 pandemic has laid bare many of the inequities in our society as well as the need for competent leadership in the Oval Office during moments of national crisis. We will need Sen. Sanders’s voice-- as well as his voters-- lending their full-throated support for Vice President Biden from now until November.”
Eva Lewis, Maryland Democratic Party Executive Director, said that the Party would immediately reach out to Biden’s team to begin building its “coordinated campaign” operation. Coordinated campaigns allow state parties to combine resources such as staff, office space, political advertising, data, and other resources with presidential candidates in an effort to minimize duplication and maximize the coordinating candidate’s ability to scale their campaign.
“We already have organizers working in communities across the State, and we’ve begun preparations to export our volunteers from reliably Blue Maryland to our neighboring swing states in Pennsylvania and Virginia. We have to do everything in our power to take back the White House.” Lewis said.
In light of the pandemic, the Maryland Democratic Party has shifted its focus to digital organizing by ramping up its email, phone banking, texting, and social media programs. It is also holding regular digital organizing training sessions for Democratic volunteers.

Dear Alex,
We are seeing record levels of voter turnout here in Maryland and across the country, but the job isn’t done yet. The Maryland Democratic Party is hard at work to ensure we get out the vote for Joe Biden and Democrats up and down the ballot.
This weekend is our final push for Tuesday. We are making calls, sending text messages, running radio ads, and knocking doors to make sure we get every single vote -- especially in the critically important swing states. On November 3rd, let’s be able to say we left it all on the field.
Can you make one final contribution before Election Day? Any amount you can afford could be the difference to put us over the top.
I know our best days lie ahead. Together we can emerge stronger and united. With your help, we will build back better.
Best wishes,

Alex,
As Maryland Democrats, we are fighting for economic justice, and as we continue to expand our base and strengthen our Party, we want to make sure that you have a voice in our Party's future.
So, will you stand with us? Add your name and let us know that you're committed to helping Democrats get elected up and down the ballot in Maryland!
The work we’re doing is critical to the future of our state.
It’s the difference between elected officials who will invest in our schools and those who will look the other way when our schools are crumbling. It’s sending a message that we believe in investing in workers and paying a fair wage, not just padding the pockets of the already ultra-wealthy.
We have big plans for the next few years, and we have a long wish list of things to accomplish. So, I have to know -- are you with us?
Thank you,
Ben Smith

Hi Alex,
I’m Michael, the Organizing Director for the Maryland Democratic Party. Right now, both the White House and Senate are on the line. With the threat of a 6-3 conservative Supreme Court, if we don’t take them both back, we face an elimination of health care as we know it and an unprecedented erosion of women's rights.
We’ll be spending the next 41 days calling swing state states for both Vice President Biden and the Senate races, persuading people to vote like our future depends on it -- because it does. In the last two weeks alone, we’ve made nearly 40,000 calls into these states.
But we need your help, this program is not cheap, and we need the resources to keep it going.
Can you pitch in $20 to help support our swing state program?
Pennsylvania and Florida are both tossups, Joe and Kamala need to win at least one of them to win this election.
Every bit of help you can give us allows us to make more calls to Pennsylvanians and Floridians. With President Trump holding a rally in Pennsylvania last night, with more to come, we need to invest double in that area.
Even $5 could make the difference between Joe winning or losing.
I know we can count on you to keep this program running.
Thank you so much for your help,
Michael

Hi Alex,
The Maryland Democratic Party is devastated by the passing of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg; she leaves behind an extraordinary legacy of breaking barriers and fighting for human rights.
We’ve spent the weekend reflecting on her legacy, and what we can do to honor it. She was a fighter -- whether it was her fight for human rights, or her fight against cancer, she never gave up and always believed in a better tomorrow.
That is how we can honor her legacy, by fighting for a better tomorrow. We don’t know yet who President Trump will nominate, but we know this: with a 6-3 majority on the court, Republicans will eliminate our health care, they will attack women’s rights, they will errode voting rights, and they will irreparably damage our environment.
The Affordable Care Act will be in front of the Supreme Court in mid-November; if President Trump gets his pick, they could eliminate protections for pre-existing conditions. During a global pandemic, there could be nothing more dangerous to our country, and to the people of Maryland. It’s up to us to stop this blatant Republican hypocrisy, and to protect our health care.
Over the next 43 days, we’ll be calling into Colorado, Maine, and Arizona; we’re going to be sending a message to Cory Gardner, Susan Collins, and Martha McSally to VOTE NO on eliminating the ACA, and ending Roe v Wade.
We hope you will join us by signing up to volunteer at [[URL REDACTED]] In order to make enough calls, we need to recruit an additional 300 volunteers this week, will you be one of them?
We hope to see you there,
The Maryland Democratic Party

Hi Alex,
We want to share some important information with you about mail-in voting in the 2020 Presidential Election, and to hopefully clear up any confusion.
The 2020 Presidential Election will be held on Tuesday, November 3rd, 2020.
Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, this election is likely to have limited polling workers and locations -- so we recommend you vote by mail if possible.
The Maryland State Board of Elections should automatically mail a ballot application to the address that they have on file for you. Unfortunately, unlike in the primary, Governor Hogan has decided to send ballot applications, not ballots themselves. In order to ensure you receive your ballot on time, election officials recommend that you mail your ballot application by Thursday, October 15th. All ballot applications must be received by Tuesday, October 20th, and remember to sign your application.
You should then receive your ballot by mail; officials recommend you return your ballot in the mail by Tuesday, October 27th, do not sign your name or make any markings on your ballot outside of the ovals beside your choices. You can also drop off your ballot in any of the almost three-hundred ballot drop boxes that will be distributed statewide. If dropping off your ballot, you must do so by 8:00 PM on November 3rd. You can visit [[URL REDACTED]] or call 410-269-2840 to find out where your closest drop off site is located.
If you have moved since the last time you voted, have not voted in a very long time, or have never voted in Maryland -- you should visit [[URL REDACTED]] to check and update your voter registration status and address. If you need to register to vote or update your current address, you must do so by Tuesday, October 13th.

Dear Alex,
Larry Hogan’s governorship is creating a crisis in Maryland. Marylanders are desperate for leadership and Hogan has failed. Since the beginning of May, Hogan cut funding, ignored unemployment, and put prescription drug affordability in jeopardy.
During the legislative session, the Maryland General Assembly passed the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future, a multibillion-dollar education reform plan that would increase Maryland state’s education spending over the course of 10 years. This included settling a 13-year lawsuit that would provide $577 million to Maryland’s HBCUs who have been underfunded for decades. In May, Hogan vetoed it. Not only did he veto the bill, on Friday, June 26th, Hogan announced a proposal for a $200 million cut to public school funding. Over the course of his governorship, he has refused to invest in education which has hurt not only our teachers and schools but more importantly our children’s quality of education.
Along with the veto of the Blueprint for Maryland’s future, Hogan vetoed the Prescription Drug Affordability Board and Fund, which would lower the cost of prescription drugs for Marylanders. He stated that it would raise taxes and fees on our citizens when many are out of work and struggling to get by.
While he claims he wants to ease the financial burden for Marylanders, he refused to acknowledge the economic crisis that is unemployment. Four months into the pandemic, almost 850,000 Marylanders have filed for unemployment claims, and 48,000 new claims have been filed just this week.
During Governor Larry Hogan’s six years in office, he reduced the size of the Department of Labor’s staff by 30%. The Department of Labor was unable to handle the number of unemployment claims with the reduced staff size. In May, Hogan ignored the pleas of thousands of Marylanders who were unable to receive their unemployment benefits claiming that the system has been fixed. Although the backlog of unemployment claims has been cut in half since May, there are still approximately 25,000 claims pending, some that have been pending since March.
Hogan’s actions are inexcusable. Instead of parading in the media, Hogan should focus on prioritizing his citizens and their well-being.
Thank you for your support,

Alex,
You might be wondering: “What is the Maryland Democratic Party doing to prepare for the fight against Trump in 2020?”
We’ll tell you: to prepare for this large-scale undertaking, the Maryland Democratic Party is diligently working behind-the-scenes to build up our campaign infrastructure, energize our volunteer base, and strengthen our operation in every corner of the state to ensure that Maryland will play its important role in defeating Donald Trump. We’ve been investing in the latest technologies that will give us an edge over the competition; we’ve been organizing like never before to activate voters well ahead of election day; and we’ve been listening to Marylanders everywhere to learn how we can better address the issues affecting their lives.
There’s just one more thing to add though: none of this matters if Democrats in Maryland choose to sit on the sidelines in this election.
That’s why we’re asking for your help today. Moderate, progressive, conservative--we don’t care. The only label that matters here is Democrat.
This is a time for Democrats to stand united. Will you chip in to support our efforts to defeat Donald Trump and put a Democrat back in the White House this November?
Thank you,
Maryland Democratic Party

Dear Alex,
The deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbrey, and so many others at the hands of law enforcement and vigilantes have forced our country into a moment of reflection.
For many of you reading this, America’s deep-seated racism and the inequitable systems it has produced through slavery, Jim Crow, red lining, and the school-to-prison-pipeline are barriers you and your ancestors have faced your entire lives.
However, there may be others at this moment of national crisis that are coming to the sobering reality that Black people, Indigenous people, and People of Color (BIPOC) have been oppressed and brutalized for the entirety of America’s long history.
Wherever you fall on the awareness spectrum, none of us should shy away from awkward or difficult conversations about race. Perhaps it is time to have that conversation with your relatives; your Trump supporting high school classmates; or colleagues who cloak their bigotry in “edgy” humor.
Dismantling racism and its vestiges must be done with acts of courage both large and small. We’ve seen the bravery in people of all races protesting state sponsored violence in the middle of a pandemic. What small acts of courage are you willing to commit to in support of this movement? We are all in this together.
Black Lives Matter,
The Maryland Democratic Party

Dear Alex,
President Donald Trump was just acquitted by the U.S. Senate on his impeachment charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.
The American people deserved a fair and impartial Senate impeachment trial to hold President Trump accountable for his actions. Unfortunately, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had other ideas.
After the House of Representatives voted to impeach President Trump, Senator McConnell blatantly admitted that he was not “an impartial juror,” and that he would coordinate closely with White House counsel ahead of the trial.
Later, he ignored calls to subpoena key witnesses and relevant documents that the White House refused to provide during the House investigation, and led the effort to defeat that vote in the Senate -- despite nearly 7 in 10 Americans supporting new witnesses being allowed to testify.
Are you as frustrated with Senator McConnell’s actions as we are? Let us know how you feel about the way he has conducted the Senate impeachment trial by taking our Official Impeachment Survey today.
Thank you,

Dear Alex,
This year, Maryland Democrats are fighting to implement the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future to dramatically improve education in Maryland. The Kirwan Commission has worked since 2016 to deliver the Blueprint--a carefully considered set of recommendations that will reduce classroom sizes; increase pay for school teachers; and allow every child in Maryland the opportunity to receive a quality education.
This will be one of the biggest fights of the 2020 Legislative Session, and our Democrats in the General Assembly need to know that you stand with them in the fight to create stronger schools for all of Maryland’s students. Will you add your name as a citizen co-sponsor to the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future?
All families, regardless of socioeconomic status, should have access to a strong public school. But for far too many, this isn’t the reality. Analysts found that in 2015, Maryland’s public schools faced a funding shortfall of $2.9 billion statewide, with 53% of black students attending school districts underfunded by 15% or more compared to just 8% of white students. Additionally, it was found that the state spends 5% less on schools in impoverished areas.
Public education remains one of our best tools for providing pathways to the middle class. It’s imperative to ensure that public school funding is adequate, equitable, and sustainable across the board--the future of Maryland’s students depend on it.
We support the efforts of our lawmakers, parents, educators and business leaders to carry out these crucial reforms for our public education system. By adding your name today, we can bring this ambitious vision for our students one step closer to reality.
Help Democrats ensure that all public schools in Maryland are funded equitably by adding your name as a citizen co-sponsor to the Blueprint for Maryland's Future.
Thank you,
Eva Lewis

Dear Alex,
In just one week, all eyes will be on Iowa.
As the first major contest of the presidential primaries, the Iowa caucuses will serve as a critical step for candidates on the road to the White House.
Regardless of the outcome of the primary race, we feel that it’s important for Democratic voters in Maryland to know just one thing: that if Democrats fail to unite in our fight against President Donald Trump, then we have no chance of winning this November.
The future of our Democracy is on the ballot, and we must stand united to take back the White House on election day. We pledge to support the eventual Democratic Nominee for President. Will you join us by signing our Unity Pledge?

To shed some light on the debate surrounding this issue, we sat down with Delegate Brooke Lierman, University of Baltimore Professor Dionne L. Koller, and Terps Football Starting Center Ellis Mckennie for the latest episode of the MD Dems Podcast.
The three discuss the state of affairs for Division I athletes’ ability to be paid; Del. Lierman’s bill filed in response to the tragic death of UMD football player Jordan McNair that would give student athletes the ability to unionize and seek compensation; how Title IX and women athletes would be impacted; the risks associated with playing for free in big time college athletics, and more.
We’re incredibly excited to be diving deep into the major issues affecting our state with our podcast. I hope you will give this episode a listen!
Thank you,

Dear Alex,
We want to share some important information with you about voting in the 2020 Presidential Primary Election.
Maryland’s primary election will be held on Tuesday, June 2, 2020.
Because of the Covid-19 pandemic, this election will be a vote-by-mail election, with limited in-person voting available for those who are unable to vote by mail. Ballots began arriving at mailboxes in early May and will continue to arrive through mid-May.
** Please note that the ballots were printed with April 28th as the date of the election; this is a mistake caused by the abrupt rescheduling of the election**
The Maryland State Board of Elections will automatically mail a ballot to the address that they have on file for you. If you have moved since the last time you voted, have not voted in a very long time, or have never voted in Maryland-- you should visit [[URL REDACTED]] to check and update your voter registration status and address.
If you need to register to vote or update your current address, you must do so by Wednesday, May 27, 2020.
And remember, postage on your ballot is prepaid. You DO NOT need to add any stamps on your return envelope. Just fill it out, and put it in the mail by June 2nd! Voters who wish to drop off their ballots may do so at designated drop off locations during the early voting period from Thursday, May 21, 2020 through Tuesday, June 2, 2020.
If dropping off your ballot, you must do so by 8:00 PM on June 2. Again visit [[URL REDACTED]] or call 410-269-2840 to find out where your drop off site is located.
Please be sure to share this information with your friends, family, and neighbors. You can also pass along this simple explainer video from the Board of Elections. We are in unprecedented times and our state and local officials are doing the best that they can to adapt to very fluid election dynamics. You can help spread the message that our Democracy carries on in spite of the crisis!
We hope that you all are staying healthy, safe, and distant as we all navigate this pandemic.
Thank you,

Alex,
In order to keep pursuing justice and getting Democrats elected up and down the ballot, we must:
* build a well-resourced, statewide, year-round Party operation that centers on democratic values;
* modernize Party operations;
* build a pipeline of highly-skilled and diverse candidates and operatives;
* reestablish and grow our historical linkage with rural voters;
* recruit, educate, and build community among new and existing voters;
* and, protect and defend our democracy.
That's not an easy endeavor, but together we can do these things and so much more.
We need you on our side in order to make this vision a reality. Alex, make a contribution today to ensure we have what it takes as we build a Party that works for all of us.
Thank you so much for standing with us!

Dear Alex,
Interested in becoming a Delegate to the 2020 Democratic National Convention (DNC) in Milwaukee? Here’s what you need to know:
The filing period to run as a Congressional District-Level Delegate is January 6 – January 24, 2020. You must register by 5:00 PM at the State Board of Elections in Annapolis, Charles County, Frederick County or Wicomico County. It is important to state that running as a DNC Delegate is not as simple as just filing your candidacy; as a Delegate, you have a host of responsibilities you must commit to.
Join the Young Democrats of Maryland and Maryland State Delegate Nicole Williams (District 22) on Wednesday, January 8, 2020 at 8:00 PM for an informative webinar on how to run as a DNC Delegate.  This training will focus on the process for filing your candidacy, how to run a campaign, what to expect if you are elected, and more.
Delegate Williams, who represents District 22 in the Maryland General Assembly, was a delegate to the 2012 Democratic National Convention, and can provide further insight on the ins and outs of the delegate selection process.
This will be a great conversation that you won’t want to miss! You must register on our sign-up form in order to attend the webinar. A recording of the webinar training will also be posted online for future reference.

Dear Alex,
Over the past few months, we’ve been using the MD Dems Podcast to do deep-dives into Maryland politics, national news, and the political strategies we’ll need to take back the White House in 2020 and the Governor’s Mansion in 2022.
On one of our latest episodes, I sat down with Baltimore City Council President Brandon Scott to discuss some of the biggest issues facing the City of Baltimore.
We begin with a discussion of the Freddie Gray uprising and Brandon Scott’s upbringing in Baltimore. Our conversation continues as we discuss the failed strategies of the past, gun violence as a disease, and Governor Hogan’s “asinine” claims about education funding in Baltimore City.
I asked Brandon how changing economics could positively affect one of Baltimore’s poorest and most violent neighborhoods. He recommends a multi-agency approach and touts an equity-based City budgeting process.
Our conversation wraps with a discussion on overcoming Baltimore’s trust barrier between the public and its officials, as well as education issues.
This is a great, substantive episode about Baltimore politics, and I hope you’ll join the conversation.
Listen to the episode here.

Dear Alex,
Today marks the 155th anniversary of Juneteenth, the day that commemorates the true emancipation of enslaved people in America.
On June 19th, 1865, Major General Gordon Granger ordered the Union Army to establish themselves in Texas, 139 days after Congress passed the Thirteenth Amendment, where they found approximately 250,000 people were still enslaved.
As we reflect on the 155 years since Juneteenth, achieving Civil Rights continues to be an ongoing struggle.
It took three years for the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment, which gave African Americans citizenship. It took five years for the ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment, which gave African American men the right to vote. It took 89 years for the landmark Supreme Court Case, Brown v. Board of Education, which outlawed segregated schools. It took 99 years for the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which ended Jim Crow in the south. It took 100 years for the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which outlawed obstructions to African Americans’ right to vote. Today, we are still fighting.
As Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. said during his “I Have a Dream” address in 1963, “There are those who are asking the devotees of civil rights, “When will you be satisfied?” We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police [[URL REDACTED]] are not satisfied and we will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream.”
The Maryland Democratic Party recognizes that this is a pivotal moment in American history and our goal is to work towards solutions that will have a lasting impact. We will be hosting a series of panels, Black Lives Matter: Next Steps. Our first will feature Congressman Kweisi Mfume, Karine Jean-Pierre, Senator Mary Washington, Delegate Jheanelle Wilkins, Krystal Oriadha, and Wes Moore. Together we will focus on actions to take now to support the movement. Join us on June 30th at 7:00 PM.

Maryland – Tuesday, November 3rd, the Maryland Democratic Party released the following statement as the Associated Press and Decision Desk HQ called Maryland for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris:
“Marylanders have spoken, they’ve had enough of Donald Trump’s failures, divisive rhetoric, and lies — they have overwhelmingly chosen Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. This strong repudiation is a victory not only for the people of our state and country, but a victory for our democracy as evidenced by the massive, historic voter turnout seen from the mountains of Westen Maryland to the Eastern Shore. We’re one step closer to restoring the soul of America. We hope to see continued positive results in following states, and look forward to every vote being counted.”
There have not been calls for any of Maryland’s eight congressional races, or in Baltimore city races, but we’re confident in strong showings. We look forward to every vote being counted, and to see the final results.

Dear Alex,
Marylanders deserve leaders they can trust. That’s why this week, Democratic legislators discussed the Conflicts of Interest Act of 2020, a proposed bill that would force Governor Larry Hogan to disclose more information about his real estate business, and require that future statewide officeholders divest from their private businesses while in public office.
Earlier this year, multiple outlets reported that Larry Hogan may have steered state transportation contracts to increase the value of his private real estate holdings in a blatant conflict of interest. Hogan has made millions of dollars since taking office in 2015--an unprecedented amount of money for someone serving the public on a modest government salary of only $180,000 per year. As you can see for yourself, the math doesn’t add up. The people of Maryland deserve to know more.
MAKE YOUR VOICE HEARD: Will you add your name to the growing list of Marylanders demanding that Hogan comes clean about his apparent conflicts of interest?
In his first term, Hogan expanded state spending on roads, highways, and bridges near property he owns, potentially increasing its value, while at the same time refusing to divest from his private real-estate business. These decisions have raised the alarm among ethical experts, and were made at the expense of mass transit projects that would have benefited hundreds of thousands of Marylanders, including the Baltimore Red Line.
In response to these credible allegations, a watchdog group has called for an ethics investigation into Hogan’s private finances. But what’s incredible is that this isn’t the only ethics investigation underway against the Governor.
Last year, the State Prosecutor opened an investigation into suspicious LLCs that have donated to Hogan’s re-election campaign beyond the legal limit. And following a whistleblower complaint in February, Hogan’s Opioid Operational Command Center was referred for a criminal investigation for allegedly mismanaging millions that should have gone to helping victims of the opioid crisis.
At a time when public trust in government has eroded due to unethical conduct from the White House to the State House, the people of Maryland deserve much more than what they’re getting from this Governor. The Conflicts of Interest Act of 2020 will shine daylight on the corruption taking place in our State.
By adding your name to our petition, we can demand that Governor Larry Hogan comes clean to the people of Maryland about his apparent conflicts of interest.
Thank you,
Maryland Democratic Party

"Maryland Democratic Party
Alex,
With just one week to go until Super Tuesday, it’s clear to me that we have an incredible field of strong candidates this year--every one of whom would make a far better President than the current occupant in the White House.
As this election heats up, we can expect that Donald Trump will use desperate tactics in his effort to get re-elected. He’ll use disinformation to confuse us, voter suppression to silence us, and bigotry to divide us.
I’m proud to say that Democrats won’t stoop to using these cheap, immoral tactics. Instead, we’re going to lead with our values, energize our base, register first time voters, persuade our neighbors, and build a grassroots coalition to take back our Democracy.
But to pull it off, we have to do it together. If Democrats fail to unite against Trump, we have no chance of beating him this November. That’s why ahead of Super Tuesday, I’m asking for your help to amplify our message of unity.
Add your name to let the rest of the nation know that Maryland Democrats are united in lockstep against Donald Trump--and that we need Democrats in all 50 states to stand with us.
Our message of unity isn’t just talk; it’s a boots-on-the-ground strategy. The Maryland Democratic Party will coordinate with the Democratic Parties of Virginia, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina to export Maryland volunteers in a united effort to secure victory in these crucial swing states.
As we plan the logistics for this exciting operation, it’s crucial that we lay the groundwork by amplifying our message of Democratic unity far and wide. You can help us build a critical mass of support by signing our petition to let the nation know that Maryland Democrats are united, and by forwarding this email to your friends and family.
Trump wants everyone to believe that Democrats are divided. Let’s show him just how wrong he is.
Thank you,
Eva Lewis

Dear Friend,
From combating climate change, to making sure that Americans have affordable healthcare, to tackling income disparity, to advancing social progress--the next President will have a tremendous impact on our lives for years to come.
A Democrat in the White House will propel our nation into the future. A second Trump term could set us back for an entire generation.
If Democrats don’t unite going into this election, we’re going to lose. Straight up. We can’t let our differences divide us. That’s why ahead of Super Tuesday tomorrow, I’m asking for your help in sending a very powerful message of unity.
Will you show that Maryland Democrats are united and ready to defeat Donald Trump by chipping in a small amount to our movement?
The Maryland Democratic Party is building a state-wide campaign operation to help propel our eventual Democratic nominee to the White House. We’re committed to fighting for our Democratic nominee. And we need you to join us.
By supporting the Maryland Democratic Party today, you can help us:
● Prevent a second Trump term by ensuring that Maryland votes blue by overwhelming and decisive margins on Election Day
● Export Maryland volunteers to the flip the nearby swing states of Pennsylvania and North Carolina, and keep Virginia blue
● Elect Democrats up and down the ballot in all corners of Maryland
● Elect a President who will defend our Democracy, uphold our Constitution, and fight for working families and the middle class
No matter who you support at this stage in the Presidential race, the differences between our Democratic candidates pale in comparison to the differences between Democrats and Donald Trump. That’s why we must enter this election united, strong, and ready to take back the White House.
Our country cannot afford a second Trump term.
We must unite in this election.
We must win.

Dear Friend,
As we enjoy this restful Saturday, I’d like to update you on the progress that the Maryland Democratic Party has made in my first full month as Chair.
This is an important email about our fundraising efforts, our plans for the 2020 presidential campaign, our efforts to hold Governor Larry Hogan accountable for his wrongdoing during his re-election campaign, and much more:
Fundraising
On January 7, we kicked off the 2020 Legislative Session with our action-packed Annual Legislative Luncheon. We honored Senator Thomas V. Mike Miller Jr. for his service to our state, and celebrated Speaker Adrienne Jones and Senator Bill Ferguson for their new leadership positions. The event was a wonderful success, and we raised tens of thousands of dollars in donations to help elect more Democrats up and down the ballot in 2020.
In January 2020, our fundraising numbers were higher than any single fundraising month in 2019. I’m very proud of our fundraising team and all of our staff that helped put the Luncheon together. It was an awesome way to kick off 2020.
Announcing Our New Executive Director Eva Lewis
I’m happy to announce that former MD Dems Political Director Eva Lewis has been selected to become our new Executive Director. For those of you that may not know Eva, she is rejoining the team after serving as the DNC's Northeast Regional Director for the Association of Democratic State Committees (ASDC). As Regional Director, she devoted her time to helping State Parties organize for success up and down the ballot in upcoming races.
Eva has also worked many years as an attorney, grassroots organizer and political operative building coalitions and increasing political engagement.
Be sure to send her a note welcoming her to the team!
Convention Update
Planning is underway for the 2020 Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee. We secured prime real estate at a hotel within walking distance to the convention site. We have some major events planned for the convention and we hope to see you in Milwaukee.
When you attend the Democratic National Convention, you witness history in the making. It’s an absolutely electrifying experience. I couldn’t be more excited for what’s in store.
#DemsDrive95
Sometimes we can fall prey to the safety of small ideas. Many people have said Maryland won’t be a factor in the 2020 Primary because it falls so late on the nominating calendar. I disagree with that point of view, and our team has begun planning something BIG for the April 28th primary!
We’re in the preliminary stages of planning the event, but we will have some major announcements about the biggest names in Democratic politics visiting Maryland and the rest of the East Coast very soon! #DemsDrive95
2020 Canvass Exporting
Our field and data team is developing a sophisticated volunteer export program in partnership with Pennsylvania, Virginia and North Carolina. Party staff has already reached out to their counterparts in these states and are laying the groundwork for Marylanders to have an impact in our neighboring swing states.
All of this work, of course, is supported by the volunteers we’ve recruited since the Party shifted into a year-round organizing program.
Holding Governor Larry Hogan Accountable
Last month, I submitted a formal letter to the Maryland State Board of Elections requesting an update on two complaints submitted by the Party in 2019 regarding Hogan’s gubernatorial campaign contributions.
There are still verifiable excess contributions totaling $145,387 that have not been refunded. Hogan’s attorney Chris Ashby dismissed the 2019 allegations as a “shoddy political hit job.” Mr. Ashby and his team then promptly returned nearly $63,000 in donations a few days after the story was reported in the Washington Post.
Governor Hogan took in roughly a quarter-million dollars in prohibited contributions to get himself re-elected. He should be held accountable for his ethical shortcomings. It is disingenuous and a failure of leadership to tell the public he’s done nothing wrong while being forced to return more than $60,000 in campaign contributions.
Organizing Across The State
Our field organizers have been knocking on doors, placing phone calls, recruiting new volunteers, and meeting with Democrats all across the state to build up our campaign infrastructure and ensure that we’re ready to elect Democrats this November. Here’s just a few photos of some of our activities:
Meeting with the Democratic Club of Dorchester County
Knocking on doors and handing out campaign literature in Frederick County
Meeting with the Montgomery County Democratic Central Committee
As you can see, we’ve been very busy! We have made it our mission to put the Democratic Party first above all else. We have lots of work to do, and two Executive offices to reclaim, President of the United States and the Governor of Maryland.
And that work cannot be done alone. We must do it together!
Thank you,
Yvette Lewis

Dear Alex,
We have seen an outpouring of grassroots support this year, and we couldn’t be more thrilled. The people-powered movement we have built together will lead us to victory in just seven days -- but we cannot stop there. We need to build on this momentum as we ramp up for statewide elections here in Maryland in 2022.
One of the most effective ways of doing this is by having a robust network of small dollar monthly donors. We recently rebuilt our recurring donor program, now known as the Blue Circle. We have seen participation more than double this year, and the average contribution is about $15. These donors will get access to exclusive benefits, such as a bi-monthly panel, and will be the first to know about new Party developments.
Our inaugural event for the program kicks off tomorrow night. We will be joined by a rockstar cast of elected officials from the Maryland General Assembly for an engaging panel on infrastructure, and the future of Maryland.
Can you join the Blue Circle today by chipping in $5, $10, or $20 a month to ensure that your Party has the resources necessary to carry this energy into 2021 and beyond?
Once you sign up you will receive an email with all of the details for Wednesday’s kickoff event. We would love to have you on the team.
Onward to victory,
Jamie Conway

This has been a time of hard truths. The hard truth is that a black man was killed by police in Minneapolis, while bystanders called for mercy, and while the officer knew he was being recorded. The hard truth is that these types of killings by police, and by civilians with no legal authority, have been a very real threat to minority populations since the founding of our nation.
George Floyd did not have to die. We cannot accept the killing of unarmed minorities as part American life.
It would be an understatement to say that I was disappointed to see the reaction of some in power to the killing of Mr. Floyd and the resulting protests. Those who decried the property damage but showed no concern for the people – the human beings – who marched peacefully to deliver a message of ‘justice’ missed the point entirely.
To see an American president so tone deaf and unable to grasp the gravity of the moment, unable to see the need for unity over division, would be unbelievable if it were not so typical for Donald Trump. Watching officers from various federal agencies fire rubber bullets, beat, push, and spray pepper balls at peaceful protestors and members of the press in Lafayette Park felt like a gut punch. Making it all the worse was that the order to disperse the crowd that had gathered in the shadow of the White House to exercise their First Amendment rights was given by the Attorney General of the United States.
“I swore never to be silent whenever and wherever human beings endure suffering and humiliation. We must take sides. Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. Silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented.” ― Elie Wiesel.
I serve as a senior member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and I am a longtime member of the U.S. Helsinki Commission. Both are forums for defending human rights and civil rights. I can tell you definitively that if the chief law enforcement officer of a developing country acted the way Mr. Barr did, with such excessive force to dispatch a peaceful crowd, Democrats and Republicans of the committee would come together with such condemnation that the world would notice. Yet, when it happened in this country, too many were largely silent.
For years, pre-dating Donald Trump’s presidency, Senate and House Democrats have put forth many bills to hold police accountable, provide adequate training and rebuild the trust between police and they communities they serve. I introduced the End Racial and Religious Profiling Act and the Law Enforcement Integrity Act. Both of these bills are designed to give law enforcement, the majority of whom are deeply committed to equal justice and the rule of law, the tools, training and resources they need to protect the community and themselves.
There is no panacea to the problem of systematic racism in policing. These bills and others are a down payment on the systemic change needed. We need greater accountability, more informed data to see what best practices can be replicated in other communities, and changes in training and policies that can allow justice and transparency to triumph over fear and distrust.
I am committed to playing a positive part to enact such changes. Staying quiet and being complacent to injustice cannot be an option.
I do not know what it is like to fear for your life during a traffic stop. I do not know what it is like to have to teach a child that the police may treat them differently because of the color of their skin. I do not know what it is like to see a loved one die, on video, at the hands of police. No American should have to experience any of this. We must work to make sure that no American experiences these horrors.

Dear Alex,
Donald Trump just attacked Senator Chris Van Hollen on Twitter:
Mr. President, we know exactly who our Senator is and what he's done for Maryland and the country.
Our Senator has served in the Maryland General Assembly and US House fighting for Maryland families -- to protect the Chesapeake Bay, keep our communities safe from gun violence, and increase funding for education and healthcare.
But Trump might be most angry with Van Hollen because he wrote the DETER Act, which uses the threat of powerful sanctions to deter Vladimir Putin from interfering in our elections again.
Chris Van Hollen will be remembered for fighting to protect our Democracy. Donald Trump will be remembered for being impeached.
We can’t let this attack against our Senator stand. Sign our petition to let Donald Trump know that the people of Maryland are watching. His actions against our Democracy will be judged harshly by generations to come.
Thank you,
Maryland Democratic Party

Dear Alex,
Every so often, I see some pretty alarming headlines about the weakening of democratic norms, the undermining of the rule of law, and the erosion of checks and balances under this administration. Some people write:
“Can American Democracy Survive Trump?”
The idealist in me will say yes, and point to the strength of our institutions, the courage of whistleblowers, the free and independent press, and (perhaps most relevant to my line of work) a vocal and organized political opposition. But the realist in me says that it’s not so simple. Our Democracy is being undermined--and it can’t be overlooked that those most directly responsible are the two standard bearers of the Republican Party.
I can provide a laundry list of the many ways in which President Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell are harming our institutions of governance. But right now, I’d like to hear from you about a more specific question: who do you think has done more damage?
The thing I enjoy the most about politics is hearing from people like you on the biggest issues affecting our communities, our state, our nation and our world. What we do at the Maryland Democratic Party has real on-the-ground impact, and it all begins by starting simple discussions like this one.
Now that you’ve heard from me, I’d like to hear from you:
TAKE OUR POLL: Who has done more damage to the American institutions of governance?
Patrick Fowler
Digital Director, Maryland Democratic Party
P.S. One final thing for the record: I believe that American Democracy will survive Donald Trump--so long as we Democrats rise, organize, and mobilize to the polls this year and every year. We still have a Democracy. Let’s take it back.

Hi Alex,
We are excited to be hosting our third Black Lives Matter panel, “Black Lives Matter: Police Reform,” Tuesday, September 22 from 7:00-8:30 PM.
Join moderator Senator Mary Washington, Professor of Sociology at the University of Maryland, Dr. Rashawn Ray, Past-Chairperson of the National Black Police Association, Captain Sonia Pruitt, and Professor of Education and Sociology at Washington University in St. Louis, Dr. Odis Johnson, for a conversation on police reform.
This conversation comes as our nation and state are in the midst of a civil rights movement surrounding the violence against Black and Brown Americans by police – and the systemic racism which enables it. Panelists will discuss the origins of the issue, how it manifests itself today, and what we can do to overcome it.

Dear Alex,
Governor Hogan has failed to show prudent leadership regarding our upcoming election. He has ordered all precinct level polling places to open on election day, and it is not clear that Maryland will have enough poll workers, PPE, and social distancing measures in place to carry out a safe and secure election.
Despite this lack of capacity, Hogan is falling in line with his GOP colleagues and is ignoring the advice of public health and election experts that vote-by-mail be utilized to keep voter participation high.
We strongly recommend that voters who can vote by mail/absentee do so.
Here’s what you need to know about the November 3, 2020 Presidential General Election:
Election Day will take place on Tuesday, November 3, 2020 and will be conducted in person-- per Governor Larry Hogan’s recent (and irresponsible) decision-- with precinct level polling locations open on election day and various early voting locations open throughout Maryland.
The Maryland State Board of Elections (BOE) will automatically mail an absentee ballot application (not your actual ballot, as was done in the primary) to the address that they have on file for you. You may also request an absentee ballot online by October 27, 2020. You can check which address the BOE has on file for you here.
If you need to register to vote or update your current address, you must do so by Tuesday, October 13, 2020. Or you may exercise your right to “same day” register and vote during the early voting period and on election day. You can find further guidance on this process here.
If you are unable to vote by mail, you must vote in-person during the early vote period or on election day at your designated polling location in your jurisdiction.
Please use this handy list of resources to ensure that you can continue to exercise your right to vote:
* If you need to register to vote, click here.
* To check your voter registration, text CHECK to 77788 or visit this link
* If you are registered to vote and need to check that your address is up to date, click here.
If you have concerns about your right to vote, please reach out to our Voter Protection Hotline at 833-MD-VOTES. You mail also email us at [[URL REDACTED]]

It’s zero hour: today, the 2020 presidential primaries begin in Iowa.
This year, we are fighting for the future of our Democracy. With so much at stake on the ballot, it’s crucial that Democratic voters unite to take back the White House, flip the Senate, and elect Democrats up and down the ballot across the state.

Alex,
I just poured myself a large cup of coffee. Yes, it’s after 4:00 PM. And yes, it’s been a busy day.
As Political and Organizing Director for the Maryland Democratic Party, I often choose to pull long hours at the office to advance our mission of electing Democrats up and down the ballot.
Campaigning is tough work--but I want to let you know that it’s worth it. Because at the end of the day, I know that I’m doing everything I can to safeguard the future of American democracy. We all follow the news; I don’t need to list every one of Trump’s actions that have undermined our rule of law, harmed our country’s global standing, and deepened our nation’s divides.
As I enjoy my far-too-late-in-the-day cup of coffee, I’m excited to tell you about something I’ve been working on. The Maryland Democratic Party is preparing to launch an exciting new program to export Maryland volunteers to flip the nearby swing states of Pennsylvania and North Carolina, and keep Virginia blue. And I want to know if you’re in:
Let us know if you want to help ensure that Virginia, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina vote Democrat in 2020 by adding your name to our Swing State Volunteer Program.
This could be the most important election of our lives, and we must do everything in our power to prevent a second Trump term. By joining our movement, you can play a critical role to ensure that Virginia, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina vote blue this November--and deny Trump their combined total of 48 electoral votes.
The stakes are high. The road ahead will be tough, tiring and trying. But together, I know we can rise to the challenge and win this.
Pour yourself a cup of 4:00 PM coffee, and add your name if you are interested in learning more about our Swing State Volunteer Program.
Rise and organize,

Alex,
Next Monday the House and Senate will hold a rare joint hearing—featuring four committees across two chambers—on legislation to transform Maryland's education system for generations to come.
We're doing our best to elevate and explain these critical public policy issues in accessible ways through the MD Dems Podcast.
In one of our recent episodes, I sat down with Maryland State Education Association (MSEA) President Cheryl Bost and MSEA Legislative Director Sean Johnson to talk about the Kirwan Commission’s Blueprint for Maryland’s Future.
We kick off our conversation with a basic question: “What is Kirwan?” Cheryl and Sean's explanation leads to the topic of community schools—an education model that has enjoyed significant publicity since LeBron James opened his “I Promise School” in Akron, Ohio in 2018. Cheryl breaks down the impact that the model has had on school children and the broader community. Importantly, the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future calls for up to $2 million on average in additional funding per school in Maryland over the next 10 years.
Later on, Sean addresses the fictional “Kirwan Tax Hike Commission” and other misleading talking points put forward by Governor Larry Hogan. Cheryl and Sean further stress the importance of the Blueprint by talking about how it will address concentrated poverty in jurisdictions across the state, and institute strict accountability measures to ensure that funding is used effectively. Our conversation wraps with information about how residents can participate in the legislative push to pass the Blueprint during this year’s legislative session.
As a father of two young kids myself, I’m inspired to see Democrats fighting to give all of Maryland’s children access to a high-quality public education. Good public schools shouldn’t just be limited to wealthy ZIP codes—they should be accessible to all families everywhere. If you’re a parent like me, I think that this is a conversation you don’t want to miss.

Dear Alex,
As the Coronavirus Pandemic continues to disrupt our daily lives, we urge you to practice social distancing, wash your hands frequently, stay home if possible, heed the guidance of local authorities and the CDC, and be wary of potential sources of misinformation.
In times of crisis, Americans look to our elected officials for leadership. When the health and safety of millions of our fellow citizens are at stake in a rapidly evolving situation like this, we want to be confident that our government is doing its job effectively—regardless of which political party is currently in power.
Unfortunately, President Donald Trump has demonstrated that he is dangerously unfit to lead our country in this moment of crisis. Trump’s mismanagement of this pandemic has endangered the lives of millions of Americans, and has detrimentally affected our country’s ability to respond effectively to stop the spread of Coronavirus.
Trump ignored weeks of warnings about the severity of the outbreak, made by public health experts and officials in his own administration. He downplayed the severity of the risks, claiming it would “go away” when the weather gets warmer—costing precious time for Americans to prepare. He has rocked financial markets with numerous incorrect claims. And he falsely blamed the Obama administration for the testing shortage, and continued to lie about access to testing.
The availability of widespread testing would help our healthcare providers better track and mitigate the spread of Coronavirus. It’s crucial that we continue to expand access and capacity for testing. Yet, in a press conference on Friday, March 13, when asked about the delays in Coronavirus testing, Trump stunningly stated that “I don’t take responsibility at all.”
As millions of Americans across the country adapt to this new normal, in which our public spaces close, our grocery stores face shortages, and our economy sinks-- we say to you that we must find comfort, solidarity, and security in each other. We don’t know how long this will last. We don’t know how bad it will get. But we do know that by working together, we can weather this storm.
This crisis demands leadership. Donald Trump has unequivocally failed to rise to this challenge, which is why we must make sure that this November, we elect a new President who will.
Stay safe, check in on family and loved ones, and wash your hands.

Dear Alex,
Who could have guessed in 2016 that America would be in the grips of a financial crisis and a global pandemic under President Trump’s leadership? Many people believed there was no way Trump would prevail on election night-- that America wouldn’t elect a racist, misogynist, and simple-minded reality TV sideshow to become President of the United States of America.
But it happened.
Less than four years into his presidency, Donald Trump has proven himself to be the disaster we believed him to be. Trump was impeached; he’s destroyed the public’s trust in the press, the scientific community, and our federal government; and his abysmal handling of the covid-19 pandemic has put millions at risk and destroyed our financial markets.
Despite his unmitigated failure as President, he will ask Americans (with help from the Russians) for a second term in office in November.
Will you add your name to our pledge to defeat Donald Trump?
The America we knew under Obama has been destroyed. To rebuild it-- and to build upon it\-- we must defeat Donald Trump in November!
Look at what’s happening. We cannot afford to have buyer’s remorse in 2020-- there’s simply too much at stake. We have to take back our Democracy when the time comes.
Thank you,
Eva Lewis

The Fourth Circuit will hear Johnston v Lamone, 19-1783, on Thursday, January 9, 2020. This is the case on whether it is constitutional for Maryland to force the Libertarian Party to submit 10,000 signatures in order to get back on the ballot, even though the party has approximately 22,000 registered members. The party argues that the petition is meaningless because it is obvious that there are at least 10,000 voters who want the party on the ballot; otherwise they wouldn’t remain registered members. The U.S. District Court had upheld the law.

## Maryland Matters: Libertarian Presidential Candidate Delivers Signatures for Maryland Ballot
by Bob Johnston

(L to R) Joe Bishop-Henchman, Bob Johnston, Jo Jorgensen
From Maryland Matters on August 5, 2020:
> Libertarian candidate Jo Jorgensen presented more than 7,000 signatures to the State Board of Elections Monday, which she hopes will more than fulfill Maryland’s requirement to appear on the state ballot for president.
>
> “I’m running for president because government is too big, too bossy, too nosy, too intrusive, and the worst part is it tends to hurt the very people that they try to help,” Jorgensen, a senior lecturer in psychology at Clemson University, said as she delivered her papers.
>
> About 30 people lined the sidewalks of Annapolis’ West Street as Jorgensen exited a big blue campaign bus adorned with her face. Bob Johnston, chair of the Libertarian Party of Maryland, followed as she walked to the Board of Elections office, three cardboard beer boxes of petitions in tow, bearing 7,731 signatures.
>
> The minimum requirement for third party candidates in Maryland is 5,000 valid voter signatures.
>
> According to Joe Bishop-Henchman, chair of the Libertarian National Committee, Jorgensen has qualified to appear on the ballot in 42 of 50 states.
>
> Bishop-Henchman said the party is still working toward meeting requirements in the other eight states.
>
> “We want to get out there because Americans need another choice,” he said. “Americans need somebody who’s actually delivered real solutions for the pandemic and for the health care situation in this country; real solutions on bringing our troops home and taking care of our veterans; and real solutions on so many of the other important issues.”
>
> Krystal Woodworth, vice-chair of the Libertarian Party of Maryland, called Jorgensen “pragmatic” and “radical”.
>
> “She doesn’t compromise her message at all in order to appeal more to people, she’s principled, and she’s not going to change so people like her,” Woodworth said in an interview.
>
> Addressing her supporters in a parking garage near the State Board of Elections office, Jorgensen thanked volunteers for pushing for her to be on the ballot.
>
> “It’s just so important to be on the ballot in all 50 states,” she said, “because right now the status quo is giving us the impression that we have an alternative — that we have a choice, but we’ve got two big government people, they both want to increase spending, they both want to take away your decision-making power and neither one wants to bring the troops home, so the only way to get that choice to every American is to be on the ballot in all 50 states.”
>
> Twice in her interview with Maryland Matters Jorgensen asserted that, if she were in the Oval Office, her first priority would be “bringing the troops home — day one.”
>
> “Because that’s something I can do myself,” she said. “I don’t need Congress to do that. I don’t need their help to do that.”
>
> She also recommended bringing overseas troops home as one solution to America’s major economic downturn brought on by the coronavirus crisis.
>
> Despite its effect on every aspect of American life, the pandemic has not slowed Jorgensen. Annapolis was one of her first stops along her “20-city, 16-day bus tour,” going as far west as Kansas City, Mo. and Dallas, Tx.
>
> Jorgensen jabbed at presumptive Democratic Nominee Joe Biden (D) for being “locked up in his basement giving Zoom interviews” while she is traveling around the country.
>
> “I think this helps put us on a slightly equal footing,” she said, “although what we really need to be on an equal footing is to have me in the debates so that Americans can see a real choice.”
>
> Biden and President Trump (R) are poised to face off in their first presidential debate next month. According to the Commission on Presidential Debates, neither of the 2016 election’s two third party candidates qualified to appear on the debate stage.
>
> Many voters ready for a new president argue that a vote for anyone other than Biden is a de facto vote for Trump.
>
> “First of all, I would say that that’s the last thing it is,” Jorgensen said, noting that there are states that traditionally vote red or blue regardless of the candidate.
>
> For instance, Jorgensen lives in South Carolina, where she said the Republican candidate wins every time.
>
> “We were one of only six states that carried Bob Dole [in the 1996 presidential election against Bill Clinton], so it doesn’t matter who’s on the ballot. The Republican is going to win in South Carolina,” she said. “So I would suggest if you’re in South Carolina that if you are not happy with either system that you’re throwing away your vote by voting for Trump because he’s going to get the nomination anyway.”
>
> “There are, like, 40 million Americans out there that lean Libertarian, and if everybody voted the way they really wanted to then we would win in a landslide.”
>
> Because of the pandemic, the nation has been conflicted about how to vote safely, and many states are struggling to determine the best way to carry out the election.
>
> Last week, Trump tweeted that the election should be delayed to avoid universal mail-in voting, which he wrote would lead to the most “INACCURATE & FRAUDULENT election in history.” The president did not present any evidence that mail-in voting is related to voter fraud or inaccuracy.
>
> Jorgensen said the date of the election should not be moved.
>
> “We’ve been through much worse than this in our country,” she said. “And I just want to point out that my goal as president would be to make government so small that it wouldn’t even matter if people forgot to vote, that they could make their own choices in health care, environment, health, education, and so on, and that they wouldn’t even worry about who was in the White House.”
>
> Asked twice whether she thought the election should be mail-in only or if polls should open, Jorgensen changed the subject and never answered the question.
>
> She criticized the current administration’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, saying that Trump should have lifted FDA restrictions on U.S.-made test kits and promoted testing for asymptomatic citizens.
>
> Jorgensen earned her nomination the party’s candidate in May. Woodworth said that the Libertarian Party was accused of being “Russian trolls” because her nomination was announced at midnight.
>
> “People were like, ‘Oh, it’s Russia, because it’s daytime in Russia,’” she said. “No, we just we just finished our process and we announced it as soon as it happened.”
>
> Jorgensen is not new to the presidential ticket. In 1996, she ran as the party’s vice-presidential candidate alongside author and radio host Harry Browne, and campaigned in 38 states.
>
> Browne ran again in 2000. He died six years later.
>
> According to her campaign website, Jorgensen officially joined the party in 1983. She ran for Congress in South Carolina’s 4th District on the Libertarian ticket in 1992.
>
> Jorgensen’s running mate, Jeremy “Spike” Cohen, is a podcast host and former web designer. Before partnering with Jorgensen, New York Magazine’s Intelligencer reported Cohen was the prospective running mate of Vermin Supreme, the Libertarian candidate noted for sporting a boot atop his head.
>
> Woodworth called Cohen “hipper” and attractive to younger voters, adding that he and Jorgensen make a solid pair.
>
> “She has all the experience that’s needed, and then he has this hip energy and a way of explaining libertarianism to the young people that brings them in and then they stay for Jo,” she explained.
Thanks to David Lashar for arranging the interview.

## Endorsement: Decriminalize Nature Baltimore
by Krystal Woodworth
## The Libertarian Party of Maryland endorses Decriminalize Nature Baltimore & DC Initiative 81
Decriminalize Nature Baltimore & DC Initiative 81
On October 17, the Libertarian Party of Maryland passed two resolution in support of the decriminalization of ethenogens. Ethenogens are chemical substances, typically plants, that are ingested to produce a nonordinary state of consciousness for religious or spiritual purposes. Initiative 81 is a DC voter initiative that will appear on the November ballot. If passed, Initiative 81 would make the enforcement of laws against natural plant medicines (entheogens) among the lowest law enforcement priorities, helping thousands of DC residents who currently fear arrest or prosecution. Decriminalize Nature Baltimore is a local affiliate of the same nature. The following resolutions were passed:
Resolution 1. Initiative 81 is a referendum organized by Washington D.C. residents with the help of Decriminalize Nature DC to make enforcing bans on psychedelic plants the lowest priority for police. This change would help thousands of D.C. residents suffering from anxiety, PTSD, addiction, or depression who currently fear arrest or prosecution for pursuing healing through natural, entheogenic substances. The initiative has the support of prominent medical professionals, police officers, and D.C. residents. The Libertarian Party of Maryland endorses Initiative 81.
Resolution 2. The Libertarian Party of Maryland endorses Decriminalize Nature Baltimore.

## Ballot Access Requirement for Maryland Green, Libertarian Parties Cut in Half

> The petition requirement for Maryland’s Green and Libertarian parties to gain ballot access for the November general election has been slashed in half.
>
> The parties will have until Aug. 3 to turn in 5,000 valid signatures from registered voters, down from the statutory requirement of 10,000.

>
> A settlement agreement was filed in the court on Friday.

> “The Green Party has been on the ballot every year since 2000 in Maryland and with this settlement I am confident we will be on the ballot in 2020,” former Maryland Green Party Chair Andy Ellis, one of the plaintiffs in the case, said in a statement.
>
> The Green Party has collected 5,200 signatures so far, and will continue to collect more to account for any signatures that are invalidated by the State Board of Elections.
>
> The state board approved a policy change in late April to allow parties and candidates to collect signatures electronically during the COVID-19 pandemic.
>
> The Green Party has launched an online petition and a phone-banking operation and expects to meet the August deadline, incoming co-chair Tim Willard said in a statement.
>
> The Libertarian Party of Maryland has collected about 3,000 signatures so far and hopes to collect another 4,000 before the August deadline, Bob Johnston, the party’s state chair, said.
>
> The party has some petitioners working on the ground now and hopes to add more soon.
>
> The national party is committed to 50-state ballot access for the Libertarian presidential ticket, which will help the party’s cause in Maryland, but getting signatures will still be difficult with most of the large festivals that petitioners used to visit still canceled, Johnston said.
>
> “The people who have been telling us to socially distance, are now telling us to go collect signatures. …It’s really putting us in a bind,” he said.

=====> DEADLINE: noon Monday, June 22, 2020!!! <=====
(But you don't have to wait until the last minute. Really.)
The next issue of the Free? State Libertarian newsletter is planned to be out for July. Looking for articles, comments, and photos from events since the last issue. Include pics! Describe your experiences with the online National Convention (part I), your opinion on the protests, government handling of COVID-19, etc.
Please report on any letters to the editor that you had published, radio or tv appearances, or anything relevant across the state that has some connection to a Libertarian issue for the regular feature IN THE NEWS. The subsequent issue will be for December, so if you have any outreach plans between now and then, it would be beneficial to include them now as well. Anything else you can think of. Local Groups/College chair and officers' reports, announcements, and general articles are solicited. Please send in any info on upcoming events, meetings, and get-togethers as well.
Please don't send me a note telling me that I (or somebody else) should write an article on a favorite topic. Write it yourself or solicit someone else for the job. I don't mind cleaning text up, but the content should be yours. Also please don't forward me articles that have been published in some other newspaper or magazine for reprinting unless you have already secured reprint permission for the FSL. A short excerpt is fine, particularly if you are going to comment on it, but I'm not keen on making our newsletter a reprint vehicle.
Please email articles to [[URL REDACTED]], fax 214-889-3668, or snail mail to LPMD Newsletter, PO Box 321, Owings Mills, MD 21117. Photos are also solicited. I much prefer text via email so that I don't have to retype it. I can convert from most any word processing format. Don't be ashamed to hand me hard copy, though. I want your articles any way you can generate them. Dictate to a cassette tape if you have to, and I'll (have Google) transcribe it. I'm not kidding! We need submissions -- either about something in Maryland, or written by someone in Maryland. Preference is given to authors who are MdLP members.
Back issues can be found at [[URL REDACTED]]
I am also looking for advertising -- do you know anyone who is willing to place ads? Or put a message in yourself to help support the MdLP. (It's a convenient way to contribute by placing a business card, etc. -- maybe you can deduct it as an advertising expense.) Ask your business associates, local vendors, etc. if they'll at least put a business card ad in.

Make checks payable to the Md. Libertarian Party, and send along with copy to PO Box 321, Owings Mills, MD 21117. (Or use the Donate Now option on the webpage to pay, select ""General Contribution,"" and email the copy.)

## Libertarians Nominate Jo Jorgensen for President
by Bob Johnston
Jo Jorgensen
Jo Jorgensen
In a historic virtual presidential nominating convention Libertarian Party delegates from 50 states and the District of Columbia nominated Dr. Jo Jorgensen for President of the United States Saturday evening.
The party, which achieved 50-state ballot access in 2016, is working diligently to do so again in 2020. With the nomination, Americans will have an opportunity to elect the first female president. Her ground-breaking run will give voters a chance to elect a candidate committed to freedom and liberty. Jorgensen’s campaign will give Americans relief from the grim options that they will face from the other candidates in November.
The online convention was the first of its kind for any political party with nationwide ballot access. In an age of social distancing, the Libertarian Party has risen to the challenge, practicing personal responsibility and professionalism while conducting the business of the party in a timely and efficient manner.
“I am incredibly proud to serve as chair of the only national political party to hold their presidential nominating convention on time and under budget even in the face of a global pandemic,” said Nicholas Sarwark, LNC National Chair. “Our delegates from around the country were able to meet virtually to debate the merits of potential nominees. Real choices were made to come to the strongest candidate and consensus was built to have the party unified around the nominee. The Libertarian Party does politics differently and that different approach is exactly what Americans need right now.”
“I am glad that the voters will finally have a real choice because the non-choice between Trump and Biden is still an option between big government and more big government,” said Jorgensen. “The volunteers are already pouring in and it looks like it will be the most massive volunteer effort that the LP has ever seen. It is really growing from the grass roots.”
Jorgensen holds a doctorate in industrial/organizational psychology from Clemson University where she teaches. A native of Grayslake, Illinois, Jorgensen is a wife, mother and grandmother currently living in Greenville, South Carolina.
Dr Jorgensen’s website is [[URL REDACTED]]
Spike Cohen was chosen as the vice-presidential nominee on the third ballot on Sunday.

>
> The parties ask for a suspension of the law that requires them to submit 10,000 signatures in order to regain their political party status. The lawsuit hasn’t yet been assigned to a judge.
The lawsuit asks the court to reduce the signature requirement to 1,000 signatures from registered Maryland voters, to be submitted to the Board of Elections by August 3, and to use a less restrictive determination as to the validity of the signatures.

##  New post on The Libertarian Party of Maryland
## Vote Libertarian and Thank You for your Support.
by Eric Blitz
Below are the opinions of the author, not a formal position of the Libertarian Party of Maryland.
Election day has arrived and today, November 3rd, is the last day you can vote for candidates who consistently and vigorously support liberty in Maryland. Voting for Jo Jorgensen for President and Jeremy 'Spike' Cohen for Vice-President may not change this year’s electoral votes from Maryland, but every vote counts towards sending an unequivocal signal that you support liberty as a value in our political system.
The Republican and Democratic candidates are compromised. They pretend to care about liberty while announcing schemes that will reduce your liberty and limit your ability to make choices to direct your life. They may gratuitously pick one or two of our issues to support, rhetorically, but ask yourself how long have their parties paid lip service to such issues but failed to deliver? It is the ultimate version of the Charlie Brown football trick and sadly, many will think the ball will be there to kick this next time because of course this is the “most important election of our lifetime.” We’ve all heard that before. We’ll no doubt hear it again.
It is easy to get disheartened by the political process, especially in Maryland when there is almost no chance that anyone other than the Democrat will win. But that also gives voters who care about certain issues greater license to vote their conscience rather than settle for voting for or against the old legacy parties.
* Voting Libertarian is the strongest signal you can send if you support the right of self-defense and the 2nd Amendment protections.
* Voting Libertarian is the strongest signal you can send if you support a substantial reduction in the size and scope of government and government authority.
* Voting Libertarian is the strongest signal you can send if you support uncompromising solutions to ending police brutality and abuse.
* Voting Libertarian is the strongest signal you can send if you support ending the failed drug war and finally legalizing cannabis.
* Voting Libertarian is the strongest signal you can send if you want a rollback of the privacy intrusions of the surveillance state.
* Voting Libertarian is the strongest signal you can send if you want private, not public, solutions towards jobs, a healthy and fair economy, better education, better health care, and private environmental solutions.
* Voting Libertarian is the strongest signal you can send if you want an end to the foreign wars and the constant foreign interventionism.
* Voting Libertarian is the strongest signal you can send if you want really eliminate oppressive taxes and begin balancing budgets rather than passing debt down to future generations.
Voting Libertarian sends these signals to the political system because the Libertarian candidates Jo Jorgensen and Spike Cohen are, like the countless other Libertarian candidates all around the country, uncompromising in their commitment to these values. It sends these signals clearly because a vote for a Libertarian is for a party that is consistently advocating for these values. Voting for the old legacy parties’ candidates sends almost no signal other than you dislike or like Trump’s personality politics. Whomever wins will have almost no mandate on issues because this election hasn’t been about issues (that won’t stop the victor’s supporters for trying to interpret the outcome as a mandate for their preferred positions).
Not voting at all is worse still, because you provide no input that isn’t interpreted as silence. The silence of others is always interpreted, like the false mandate, as a reflection of the interpreter’s preconceived beliefs, not those of the non-voter. It will never be interpreted as a rejection of the system or their candidates (that’s what a vote for a Libertarian does), because in politics, like much of life, it is all about who stands up and is counted for something. The politicians, the media, your fellow citizens, they cannot hazard to guess what you mean by your decision not to vote, but if there was a Libertarian on the ballot and you didn’t vote, they can conclude you were not committed enough to liberty to at least give your support to a candidate who tried to bring liberty into the electoral process. With that conclusion in hand, they can feel safe that you won’t bother them further. If you want to bother the political class further, you’ll have to vote for an alternative. You will have to vote Libertarian.
Finally, I want to thank all the volunteers, the donors, and the candidates who put so much time and effort to participate in the political process and support the Libertarian Party of Maryland. There is nothing easy about our brand of politics. Unlike most voters who just have to register, we had to work hard just to be given the chance to vote for our candidates. We had to gather petition signatures for countless hours. We took time off from work, from our families, from our hobbies, to let a Libertarian option be represented. In doing so we help build the platform upon which future growth can occur. Every step forward prevents a step backwards, every step forward puts us in the position to bring some future child into a world that is free.

=====> DEADLINE: noon Monday, February 10, 2020!!! <=====
(But you don't have to wait until the last minute. Really.)
The next issue of the Free? State Libertarian newsletter is planned to be out for March. Looking for articles, comments, and photos from events since the last issue. Include pics! Describe your experiences collecting petition signatures, your opinion on the impeachment, etc.
Please report on any letters to the editor that you had published, radio or tv appearances, or anything relevant across the state that has some connection to a Libertarian issue for the regular feature IN THE NEWS. The subsequent issue will be for July, so if you have any outreach plans between now and then, it would be beneficial to include them now as well. Anything else you can think of. Local Groups/College chair and officers' reports, announcements, and general articles are solicited. Please send in any info on upcoming events, meetings, and get-togethers as well.
Please don't send me a note telling me that I (or somebody else) should write an article on a favorite topic. Write it yourself or solicit someone else for the job. I don't mind cleaning text up, but the content should be yours. Also please don't forward me articles that have been published in some other newspaper or magazine for reprinting unless you have already secured reprint permission for the FSL. A short excerpt is fine, particularly if you are going to comment on it, but I'm not keen on making our newsletter a reprint vehicle.
Please email articles to [[URL REDACTED]], fax 214-889-3668, or snail mail to LPMD Newsletter, PO Box 321, Owings Mills, MD 21117. Photos are also solicited. I much prefer text via email so that I don't have to retype it. I can convert from most any word processing format. Don't be ashamed to hand me hard copy, though. I want your articles any way you can generate them. Dictate to a cassette tape if you have to, and I'll (have Google) transcribe it. I'm not kidding! We need submissions -- either about something in Maryland, or written by someone in Maryland. Preference is given to authors who are MdLP members.
Back issues can be found at [[URL REDACTED]]
I am also looking for advertising -- do you know anyone who is willing to place ads? Or put a message in yourself to help support the MdLP. (It's a convenient way to contribute by placing a business card, etc. -- maybe you can deduct it as an advertising expense.) Ask your business associates, local vendors, etc. if they'll at least put a business card ad in.

>  $20 1/8 Page (business card)
Make checks payable to the Md. Libertarian Party, and send along with copy to PO Box 321, Owings Mills, MD 21117. (Or use the Donate Now option on the webpage to pay, select ""General Contribution,"" and email the copy.)

## Ballot Access News Post on US Fourth Circuit Court Hearing
by Bob Johnston
Below is a post from Ballot Access News on the Maryland Libertarian Party's appeal to the US Fourth Circuit Court hearing on January 29, 2020 in Richmond, Virginia:
> On January 29, the Fourth Circuit heard Johnston v Lamone, 19-1783. This is the Maryland Libertarian case, in which the party argues that because it has approximately 22,000 registered members, there is no point in requiring it collect 10,000 signatures to get back on the ballot. Another issue in the case is the Maryland law that won’t count signatures if the middle initial is missing from the petition even though it is on the voter registration form. Listen to the 39 minute argument using this link.
>
> The three judges are G. Steven Agee, Albert Diaz, and Pamela Harris. The judges seemed inclined to rule against the party on the main issue. They have a strong feeling that a voter registration into a party is not meaningful, especially if the voter registered into the party some time ago. Judge Harris suggested an example of a college student at a frat party having registered Libertarian at a young age, and then forgetting that he or she made that choice. The attorney for the Libertarian Party tried to explain that voters do have an interest in updating their party affiliation, because they know, or should know, that they can’t vote in the upcoming presidential primaries if they are still registered into a minor party. But that seemed to fall on deaf ears. The petition must be completed within a two-year period, and the judges all seemed to feel that a petition signature is more meaningful than a registration, because it is recent. The attorney for the Libertarian Party tried to explain that a signature on a petition means very little, and that probably the vast majority of people who sign petitions for a party don’t really agree with it, but they are signing because of a belief that every party that is making a serious attempt deserves to be on the ballot.
>
> The judges did question the state (at the 21:54 mark) about the policy that a petition signature is invalid if the middle initial is missing, but the state argued that issue is not now ripe, and wouldn’t be ripe until after a petition is submitted and rejected.

## Libertarians and Greens Call on Maryland Officials to Maintain Their Ballot Access Due to COVID-19 Outbreak
by Bob Johnston
The Maryland Libertarian and Green Parties are calling on the General Assembly, Governor, and Board of Elections to place them on the ballot for the November general election, due to the COVID-19 outbreak.
Both parties have been petitioning throughout the state to each collect over 10,000 signatures to get back on the ballot, but their petition drives have ground to a halt, because of the COVID-19 outbreak.
""As people who have a great deal of success in qualifying for the ballot, we would ask that the Governor, General Assembly, and the Board of Elections understand the effect this state of emergency had on peoples' willingness to be approached by a stranger, let alone take a pen or clipboard"", said Libertarian Party Executive Director Dan Fishman.
""Additionally, though all of our petitioners are healthy and would be benched at the first sign of illness, Corona is apparently often spread by people who are asymptomatic.""
""Paid and volunteer Green Party petitioners have been doing what we do every four year to be on the ballot. We gather signatures in public at large gatherings, and door-to-door, but this has become untenable and potentially unsafe with the public health crisis and state of emergency we now face,"" said Maryland Green Party co-chair Andy Ellis.
The Libertarian and Green Parties have been active in Maryland for over 20 years, consistently running candidates, lobbying the General Assembly, and holding outreach events, thereby having established their regular participation in the democratic process. That continued participation should not be made impossible or dangerous due to the declared public health emergency.
For more information contact Dan Fishman (202) 333-0008 x232.

Maryland Libertarian Party Regains Ballot Access
Maryland Board of ElectionsThe Maryland Libertarian Party has regained political party status, as the state Board of Elections notified the party that the petition to get back on the ballot was successful.
""I want to thank everyone who helped petition to get back on the ballot, especially under such circumstances where the state of Maryland insisted we had to collect signatures while making it illegal or very difficult to petition in public for much of 2020"", said Maryland LP chair Bob Johnston.
As a result, Libertarian Party presidential and vice-presidential nominees Jo Jorgensen and Jeremy ""Spike"" Cohen will appear on the November general election ballot.
The Maryland LP has ballot access through 2022, as political parties that successfully petition appear on the ballot for two full general election cycles. To retain party status in Maryland, the 2022 candidate for Governor must get at least 1% of the vote, or the party must have at least 1% of the registered voters in the state on December 31, 2022.

## Maryland City Council Member Returns to Libertarian Party
by Bob Johnston
Muir Boda
Muir Boda
Muir Boda, a member of the Salisbury, Maryland City Council, has returned to the Libertarian Party.
Boda resigned from the Maryland Republican Party and the Wicomico County Republican Central Committee on May 17, and renewed his memberships in the state and national Libertarian Parties a week later.
Boda has been on the city council since 2015, and is the current council vice-president. He was unopposed in running for reelection last November. His current term ends in November, 2023. He also serves as the President of the Eastern Shore of Maryland Association of Municipalities, and is a member of the Board of Directors for the Maryland Municipal League.
“Coming home to the Libertarian Party is the best political decision I’ve made. The two major political parties are built on litmus tests – with the GOP only accepting blinding allegiance to Trump, while the Dems continue down the path of Socialist ideals, which means I fail both of those tests,” said Mr. Boda.
“Muir’s returning to the Libertarian Party is further proof that, for Libertarians, it is not worth trying to work through the Democrat and Republican Parties to effect change”, said Maryland LP chair Bob Johnston. “Plus, Muir is a great guy and fun to have around. I’m glad he is back!”
Boda had been a member of the Maryland LP from 2010 to 2014, and had run for the US House 1st congressional district as a Libertarian in 2012.

"JOIN US THIS FRIDAY AND SATURDAY FOR TWO IMPORTANT EVENTS!
At noon tomorrow, the Green Party will once again join the Bethesda African Cemetery Coalition at 5204 River Road in Bethesda.
Moses Cemetery is an historic 18th century Black burial site being destroyed by developers to put up self-storage units. Hundreds of trucks have removed massive amounts of dirt and potential remains, funerary items, and graves. Bethesda African Cemetery Coalition has been protesting desecration of this site since 2017. Despite promising to do so, County Executive Marc Erlich has not closed down the construction site currently desecrating Moses Cemetery.
The Montgomery County Green Party has long been a part of this coalition, and other chapters of the Maryland Green Party have recently joined the protests and actions. Maryland Green Party Co-chair and Montgomery County Green Tim Willard said, “The fight to preserve and memorialize the Moses African Cemetery, where African Americans have been buried since the time of slavery, is a vital step toward recovering a history that has been erased from the record. We must restore the dignity and honor to the people who built this community so long ago.”
On Friday, the Bethesda African Cemetery Coalition will have their largest protest event yet. Billed as ""Flowers for Moses,"" dozens of community activists bearing real and plastic flowers while wearing all black will descend on Moses Cemetery tomorrow to protest the ongoing desecration of the site. There will be local musicians, a rally, and honoring of our community's Black ancestors.
""This is the scene of a crime."" Come out and help protect this historic space.
WHEN: September 4th, 2020 at 12 noon
WHERE: Moses Cemetery 5204 River Road Bethesda, MD, 20816
~~~
Let’s help elect the next Baltimore City Councilmember!
Saturday at 6 p.m., please join Dr. Jill Stein in welcoming two Green candidates for City Council in 2020, Franca Muller Paz ([[URL REDACTED]]) and Jake Tonkel ([[URL REDACTED]]) will be hosting a Zoom party and joint fundraiser. Enjoy fun activities with the candidates, hear from both campaigns and Green elected officials from around the country, and join us in building real unity in the world of divisive politics.

Hello Friend,
We are calling on the General Assembly, Governor, and Board of Elections to place our party on the ballot for the November general election, due to the COVID-19 outbreak.
We have been petitioning throughout the state to collect over 10,000 signatures to get back on the ballot.
Our party’s participation in the democratic process should not be made impossible or dangerous due to the declared public health emergency.
Read Full Statement
* * *
## How To Petition During COVID-19 Pandemic
1) Download the Printable Petition Form. If you can not access a printer or otherwise complete the petition due to the Coronavirus, please instead sign the non-binding electronic Green Party Ballot Access Affidavit to demonstrate to the state government that you would sign the binding petition if you could (skip the following steps if ""signing"" electronically).
2) Sign your printed petition form, including
1. Your full legal name including any middle names - for example if your legal name is ""Steven Martin Murray"", writing ""Steve Murray"" won't count!
2. Your signature - watch out! A lot of people misread the form and start filling out the address in this box.
3. Your full address where you are registered to vote, for example ""123 Fake St, Apt 9, Baltimore 21213""
4. Your date of birth
5. The date of signature (today's date when you sign the form)
3) Collect signatures from anyone else you safely can, such as family members or roommates you are quarantined with, or neighbors you are able to make arrangements with. Up to five people can sign each form and there is no limit to the number of signatures you can collect.
4) Sign the Circulator's Affidavit at the bottom of the form. You must fill in every line every line of this including your name, address, phone number, signature, and date of signature. If you don't do this NONE of the signatures on the form will be counted!
5) Either mail your completed forms to our Ballot Access Coordinator (address in the Petition Tracker link) or, if you are unable to use the postal service for whatever reason, keep the forms somewhere in your home for now. Either way, please use our quick and easy Petition Tracker so that we know how to get these sheets out of your hands.

Hello Friend,
In case you missed it, SB 10 (cross-filed with HB 103) unanimously passed in the Senate a few weeks ago.
This legislation calls for a constitutional amendment that would allow for special elections at the next statewide general election for vacancies that occur in the first two years of a general assembly term.

Hello Friend,
First we are excited to announce that we will start providing regular updates on our petitioning progress. We will also share specific petitioning opportunities for the future.
We have good news! We are almost a third of the way towards our goal of 15,000 petition signatures. We have at least 4,500 confirmed signatures.
State law requires at least 10,000 valid signatures to secure ballot access. We know from experience signatures can be invalidated over minor mistakes, such as forgetting a middle initial.
Ballot Access means we can challenge uncontested candidates in General Elections. In 2018 we ran against unopposed Republicans in Western Maryland and against unopposed Democrats in Baltimore City. We believe it is important for voters to have a real choice in November.
Can we count on you to help us reach 5,000 signatures, over the next two weeks?
We are kindly asking you to Volunteer or Donate.
Even if you only have an hour to petition, your contribution is immensely significant and sincerely appreciated.
Anyone (age 18 or older) can petition by doing the following steps:
1. Read Petition Instructions
2. Download & Print the Petition
3. Contact Ballot Access Coordinator Hunt Hobbs for Upcoming Events
4. Collect & Report Signatures
* * *
### Upcoming Petitioning Events:
* Wednesday, Feb 12 4pm-5pm: Maryland Transit Legislative Action Rally

* Saturday, Feb 15 2pm-4:30pm: Our Revolution Candidate’s Forum

Hello Friend,
We are excited to announce our three keynote speakers for the 2020 State Assembly.
Ajamu Baraka is the National Organizer and National Spokesperson for Black Alliance for Peace. He was the Green Party nominee for Vice President in 2016. Baraka served as the founding executive director of the US Human Rights Network, a national network that grew to over 300 U.S.-based organizations and 1500 individual members. In 2019, the US Peace Memorial Foundation awarded Baraka with the US Peace Prize for his activism against militarism, and imperialism as well as his work for peace.
Kali Akuno is a co-founder and co-director of Cooperation Jackson which advocates for sustainable community development, economic democracy, and community ownership. He is the Director of Human Rights Education at the U.S. Human Rights Network as well as an organizer with the Malcolm X Grassroots Movement.
Marsha Coleman-Adebayo is an author, scholar, whistleblower, and civil rights leader. She is chair of the Macedonia Baptist Church’s social justice ministry and a member of the Bethesda African Cemetery Coalition. She was a senior policy analyst at the EPA where she exposed how mining vanadium in South Africa was harming the environment and human health. The EPA retaliated against her for this action for which she successfully sued the agency. This resulted in the passage of the Notification of Federal Employees Anti-discrimination and Retaliation Act (No FEAR Act) which protects whistleblowers. She received her doctorate degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).

Hello Friend,
You may have learned that yesterday we filed suit in the US District Court in Baltimore, seeking a reduction in the requirement of signatures for ballot access. Had it not been for COVID-19, we would have met our petitioning goal, as we always have to get on the ballot since 2000.
We will be providing more detailed information about the status of our ballot access lawsuit at our State Assembly on Saturday May 30th. This is a virtual event taking place via Zoom Video Conferencing, beginning at 1:00 pm Eastern.
Registration is now open to participate in the State Assembly.

II. Organizing Sessions
Transit
This session will explore non-car modes of travel - public transit, walking, and bicycling - in Maryland, with a particular focus on Baltimore City and Baltimore County. Using public transit, walking, and bicycling align with Green Party values, particularly ecological sustainability, social justice, economic justice and community based economics, and even decentralization. This session will include an overview of transit modes, the connection to Green Party values, action steps, and resources.
Immigration
In Maryland and across the country, mass deportation of immigrants and exploitation of their labor has been perpetrated by Republicans and Democrats alike. This panel will briefly contrast the policies of the corporate parties with those of the Green Party before focusing on examples of immigrant solidarity community organizing being lead by several local organizations. Participants will learn how they can plug in to campaigns to fight for intersectional immigrant justice.

Margaret Flowers Co-Chair of the Green Party of the United States and Andy Ellis Co-Chair of The Maryland Green Party will discuss why the 2020 election is a key opportunity to organize independent political power in the United States and in [[URL REDACTED]] 2020’s will be a decisive decade in the future of the planet. But the corporate parties are giving us a choice between Barbarism and Austerity. The workshop will lay out a path for an eco-socialist alternative via comparing and contrasting the Green Vision to the Democrats and Republicans on Key issues like The Green New Deal, Medicare for All, and Peace. The workshop will provide participants with concrete action steps about how to build independent political power in Maryland Via this election cycle
Labor
The combined global pandemic/depression has provoked enormous responses from workers all over the world, who have seen the importance of collective actions against the employers to defend both their incomes and their lives. When we talk about the Green Party's priorities, supporting these organizing campaigns--and participating in them in our own workplaces--is really important. This workshop will give a summary of current struggles and a general discussion of unionization.

05/31/2020 - Immediate Release:
## HOWIE HAWKINS WINS MARYLAND GREEN PARTY PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY
At its 2020 Assembly yesterday, the Maryland Green Party announced Howie Hawkins as the winner of its primary for the presidential nomination. With 68% of the vote, Hawkins has secured 5 of Maryland’s 8 delegates to the Green Party of the United States Presidential Nominating Convention to be held in July. Dario Hunter received 32% of the vote and 3 delegates. Party members will be assigned to cast Maryland's eight votes at the Green Party's national convention on July 11th. Five delegates will be pledged to vote for Hawkins in the first round of voting, three will be pledged to vote for Hunter.
""Americans face many threats in 2020 from the corporate domination of both major parties, and the crises of COVID-19 , economic collapse, and climate change,” said Maryland co-chair Tim Willard. “We embrace Mr. Hawkins' call for an eco-socialist Green New Deal that combines an economic bill of rights with a rapid transition by 2030 to 100% renewable energy and a halt to new fossil fuel projects""
Also elected were Party Co-chairs Tim Willard and Virginia Rodino, Treasurer Brian Bittner, Recording Secretary Reanud Brown, Delegates to the Green Party US National Committee Andy Ellis, Margaret Flowers, and Kevin Zeese and Alternate Delegates to the Green Party US National Committee Tim Willard and George Gluck. A single alternate delegate position remains vacant and shall be filled by coordinating committee appointment.
The Maryland Green Party Assembly was held virtually for the first time today and it’s presidential primary and election of officers conducted predominantly by mail over the past several weeks. Assembly speakers included Ajamu Baraka, the National Organizer and National Spokesperson for Black Alliance for Peace and Green Party nominee for Vice President in 2016, Kali Akuno, co-founder and co-director of Cooperation Jackson which advocates for sustainable community development, economic democracy, and community ownership, and Marsha Coleman-Adebayo, author, scholar, whistleblower, and civil rights leader.
“I’m excited for the future of the Maryland Green Party” says outgoing co-chair Andy Ellis. “Our new party officers and national delegates have the experience and wisdom to lead Maryland’s 10,000 Greens through this critical election cycle. I’m sure with new officers at the helm, the Maryland Green Party will return to the ballot in November and present voters a vision of a future worth fighting for”

Hello Friend,
We did it!
A few days ago, our Maryland Green Party held our first end-of-year party and fundraiser and the event was a tremendous success! Because of Greens like you, since launching our $2,500 fundraising campaign on September 1, we have raised over $3,500 in one-time gifts.
A HUGE thank you to each of you who contributed. Your generous contributions and enduring support for our cause is humbling, inspiring, and plays a tremendous role in sustaining our Party and platform as 2019 comes to an end and 2020 begins. This event was yet another fine example of the power we have when we come together.
2019 has been a year of tremendous success for our Party, allowing us to hire two part time staff members to assist with communications and ballot access organizing. Locally, we took action demanding elections be publicly financed in Baltimore City; protesting the ICE Detention facility in Howard County; and supporting Climate Emergency Action in Montgomery County (View List of Accomplishments).
Whether you supported us with your time or a financial contribution, by signing our petition for ballot access, or in another way, it's because of you that our Maryland Green Party will endure into 2020 as a party of the people.
While we have surpassed our goal for $2,500 in one-time gifts, the struggle continues and we still have more to do. Our sustaining monthly donors play an exceptional role in supporting our Party. Currently, we have 26 monthly donors at the level of $12 or more and I look forward to growing this number over the coming weeks and beyond.
Thank you as always for your enduring support.
In solidarity,
Andy Ellis, Co-Chair Maryland Green Party

## Greens Speak
“Supporting the Maryland Green Party is my way of building the political alternative we urgently need.
Throughout history, it has been alternative parties that have impacted the national dialog on critical issues and driven major social transformation. In this era when we have two corporate political parties that are failing on critical issues such as health care, the climate crisis, endless war, economic inequality and systemic racism, we need to build an alternative party that clearly outlines the changes we seek. That party is the Green Party. The platform is excellent. It's based on fundamental principles of grassroots democracy, social justice, peace, and ecological wisdom.
When I give my dollars to the Maryland Green Party each month, I know they make a difference. They support educational events and organizing to build the growing number of Green Party locals around the state. They support petitioning for ballot access so we can run candidates. They are building a positive future that we require and that I know we can achieve if we keep working at it.”
Dr. Margaret Flowers, Co-Chair, Green Party of the United States

“Can you help us? The Maryland Green Party is working hard to become a viable alternative to Democrats and Republicans, a party of real change, not entrenched interests. In 2018 we ran candidates from the Eastern Shore to Western Maryland. In parts of the state we were the only serious alternative to the major parties. Now we need your help. We are petitioning to keep our ballot status so that we can continue to grow. Please consider a donation to the party now.""

## Eco-Sensitive Gifts
Contributed By Montgomery County Green Party
""The most eco-sensitive gifts follow the 4 R's: Refuse, Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle ... Ending the tradition of material gift-giving is likely the best option, perhaps with a conversation about minimalism or the need to reduce our footprints. If you do offer gifts, replace gift-wrap paper with comic pages or, better yet, with cloth ""shopping"" bags, or scarves.""

Friend,
Last night the Maryland Green Party filed a lawsuit in Federal Court against Governor Larry Hogan and State Board of Elections Administrator Linda Lamone in order to challenge the unconstitutional application of Maryland’s ballot access laws during the COVID-19 State of Emergency.
Since early March when we suspended our in-person petitioning efforts, we have been lobbying the State of Maryland for two demands: 1) allow electronic signature collection and 2) lower the signature threshold to account for the impossibility of petitioning during a global pandemic.
On April 22nd we succeeded in the first half of our demands, when the State Board of Elections authorized electronic signature collection. We have been developing an open-source electronic signature gathering platform and look forward to sharing it soon. Unfortunately our appeals for a lower signature threshold have as of yet been ignored by the Governor’s office.
The lawsuit, which includes the Libertarian Party of Maryland, seeks to have the Green Party placed on the November Ballot based on the progress made prior to COVID and on our consistent place on every ballot since 2000. We have a constitutional right to seek ballot access and more importantly our members have a constitutional right to affiliate as they choose. We believe the law is on our side, and we look forward to the opportunity to make the case to a judge.
The COVID-19 crisis has shown more than ever that we cannot simply accept the choice of barbarism and austerity that the two-party system offers us. COVID-19, the climate crisis, war around the world, racism, and severe economic inequity have our state, nation, and world firmly locked in a race to destruction, and we need to be able to provide voters a different vision of a more just, equitable, and sustainable world. This lawsuit is an important part of that.
We will provide updates as the case develops and please don’t hesitate to reach out and ask me if you have any questions.

The Maryland Green Party Stands with The Nationwide Uprising for Black Life
In a few short weeks, a vibrant and powerful movement has erupted in this country, with reverberations and solidarity actions across the globe. Not just bystanders, Maryland Green Party members took part in actions and demonstrations in counties throughout the state. In addition to the rallies, protests and vigils, here is a brief snapshot of other events and activity the Maryland Green Party is involved in support of the uprisings and movements proclaiming “Black Lives Matter”.
*The Baltimore County Green Party and Baltimore City Green Party joined other signatories in a letter by the Baltimore County Justice Coalition (BCJC) that requested the release of detailed information and bodycam footage regarding the shooting and killing of Robert Johnson, a black man, by Baltimore County Police in Essex on May 16, 2020.
BCJC is a social-political coalition that is committed to ensuring accountability and transparency among the Baltimore County Police Department. BCJC will be hosting a forum on defunding the police the week of July 5th. To receive event information, follow BCJC’s facebook page: [[URL REDACTED]]
If you would like to connect further, BCJC can be reached by email at [[URL REDACTED]]
*In early June, Montgomery County Greens joined the Bethesda African Cemetery Coalition’s (BACC) call for justice for black men who have been killed by Montgomery County Police. We call for the arrest of Montgomery County police officers involved in the recent shootings of innocent young black men. Protecting black lives, “from the cradle to the grave,” the BACC seeks to stop the desecration of Moses African Cemetery, preserve the rich history of this once thriving African community, and consecrate Moses African Cemetery with a memorial and museum on River Road in Bethesda, MD. The desecration of Moses African Cemetery is an expression of the racist cultural annihilation—the genocide—of an African community that was kidnapped, abused, tortured, raped and then dumped in the area that is now known as Moses Cemetery
*Police violence and racism have always been tools of capitalism: Read Baltimore City Greens Kevin Zeese and Margaret Flowers’ article that explains how police have been designed to uphold the status quo including racial injustice and class inequality, and how instead of bloated budgets for police forces, there is a need for “democratic community control of the police as a starting point in addition to defunding the police and funding alternatives such as programs that provide mental health, public health, social work and conflict resolution services, and other nonviolent interventions. Funding is needed for the basic human needs of housing, education, employment, healthcare, and food especially in communities that have been neglected for years and whose low-wage labor has enriched the wealthy in this unequal society.” Read their article here.

Maryland Ballot Access Update
Following a successful settlement of legal action taken to reduce the number of signatures, The Maryland Green Party is in the home stretch of our 2 year long ballot access effort. We have more than 5000 signatures, the amount the state agreed to in the legal settlement, but now we are building our cushion to account for the signatures they will discard. We have until August 3rd to submit petitions and we want to work to get 7000.
Please sign our on-line petition here [[URL REDACTED]] then share it with your friends.

Green Party Presidential Campaign Update
After winning 68% of the vote in the Maryland primary, Howie Hawkins went on to clinch the first-ballot nomination from the Green Party when he won the primaries in Michigan and with the Lavender Caucus. Hawkins selected Angela Walker to be his running mate. Angela has been a longtime activist who led the Amalgamated Transit Union into the Wisconsin Uprising against Scott Walker and into the Occupy Movement. She ran for sheriff against David Clark in Milwaukee and won 20% of the vote and was the Socialist Party vice presidential candidate in 2016.
Hawkins/Walker have joined the protests against police violence and have called for radical changes in policing, with greater emphasis on mental health and social workers as well as conflict resolution experts to decrease reliance on police and investment in neglected communities. They have anchored their police position around democratic community control of the police. They have also pointed out of the failed bi-partisan state especially with Covid-19 and the economic collapse. Hawkins has been receiving increasing media coverage including in The Hill, Newsweek, Hill TV's Rising, Jacobin, and the Independent. Hawkins is working to achieve ballot access in all 50 states and contributed to the legal fees for Maryland and is helping the MGP be on the ballot in 2020. Hawkins/Walker is also working to achieve federal matching funds.

Hello Friend,
The current and necessary public health restrictions make it impossible for us to publicly petition, but that doesn't mean there aren't ways you can help.
One thing you can do is sign an affidavit saying you WOULD publicly petition if you could.
This non-binding electronic Green Party Ballot Access Affidavit demonstrates to the state government that you would sign the binding petition if you could.

"Breaking News: WE ARE ON THE BALLOT!
Thousands of Maryland voters demonstrated their conviction that non-corporate parties have an important place on our state ballot. Voters across the state included their signatures on petitions that we submitted to the Board of Elections earlier this month. It was announced today that the Maryland Green Party successfully collected enough signatures, ensuring a choice for voters in the state who recognize the futility and rotted system of the corporate duopoly. Franca Paz Muller in Baltimore, George Gluck in Rockville and Presidential and Vice-presidential candidates Howie Hawkins and Angela Walker will be listed on our ballots. These candidates and their volunteers, as well as MGP activists and members across the state put in hours of effort to make this happen. Special shout-out to MGPers Andy Ellis, Hunt Hobbs and Tim Willard for their extraordinary dedication and tireless work. Sign up to get your mail-in ballot and change your affiliation to the Green Party!
Join Howie Hawkins in Maryland TOMORROW!
Join Presidential candidate Howie Hawkins and the Bethesda African American Cemetery Coalition tomorrow, August 19, to protest the desecration of an African American cemetery. This cemetery is located on the grounds of a former tobacco plantation and slave breeding plantation that became a successful Black community until it was displaced to build a suburb for white people. Today at 8 p.m., Vice Presidential Candidate Angela Walker will live-stream a conversation on this issue with Marsha Coleman-Adebayo, the co-founder of the campaign and Green Party member.
Where:
Macedonia Baptist Church

Bethesda, Maryland 20816
When:

March two blocks down River Road to the Desecration Site, the former cemetery
The Latest on Our Presidential Campaign...
People in 36 states will be able to vote for Hawkins/Walker and the campaign is currently petitioning in 14 states.
It is dangerous for people to be petitioning during a pandemic. Hawkins/Walker petitioners take a lot of precautions working to gather signatures to exercise our basic democratic right to run for office and for voters to be given a choice beyond the Democrats and Republicans. The US is unique in requiring large numbers of signatures to run for office. This is a barrier to democracy that no other country has. While not all countries have elections for president, we can compare requirements for national legislatures for comparison purposes. In the US it varies from state to state. In Illinois over 15,000 signatures are required; in Georgia over 20,000 are required. By comparison, the United Kingdom requires 10 signatures, New Zealand requires two, Australia requires 50, Canada requires 100 in urban ridings and 50 in rural ridings.
In addition to very likely being on the ballot in Maryland, Hawkins/Walker is on the ballot in most of the large states, e.g. California, Florida, Illinois, New York, and Texas. It is also on the three states that decided the 2016 election or has submitted signatures sufficient to be on the ballot in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan.
The Hawkins/Walker campaign has put out a series of statements on how to respond to COVID-19 beginning on March 3. President Trump has surrendered to COVID-19 and has failed to put forward a national plan to respond to the pandemic. Former Vice President Biden is silent and not using his national podium to lead the nation or his party. Congress is in a stalemate unable to put forward the emergency measures needed to respond to the crisis. See the two most recent: Red Lines for COVID Economic Recovery and The Moment of Truth for COVID and Economic Relief.

Hello Friend,
As you may already be aware, union pensions are under attack, which is why the Maryland Green Party supports the Butch Lewis Act (HR 397 — 2019-2020) to preserve union pensions. We oppose the Grassley Alexander proposal which would destroy union pensions.
The Maryland Green Party views the Butch Lewis Act as the starting point of pension reform in order to allow unions to prosper and protect working families.

Hello Friend,
Take a minute to easily sign our new online petition. Your signature can help get us on the ballot through 2024.
SIGN PETITION
Once you have signed, please regularly share with friends and family who are registered Maryland voters.
Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the State Board of Elections is allowing the use of electronic petitioning instead of in person petitioning. However, this does not make up for all the lost time petitioning in the Spring. Consequently, last month we filed federal suit to seek necessary relief. Relief has been granted in several states including Illinois and Vermont.
While we cannot petition at large events and festivals as we traditionally have done, we are making a dedicated effort to hit our goal of 10,000 valid signatures with our additional electronic signatures.
You can help us reach our goal by getting 5 registered voters everyday to sign the electronic petition.
Want to volunteer? We are phone banking for ballot access. Join the phone banking training this Sunday June 7 from 6:00 pm to 7:00 pm.

This is a message from your new state co-chairs, Virginia Rodino and Tim Willard. We were elected at the State Green Party Assembly last Saturday.
We would like to thank party members who expressed their trust in us to lead the party through the difficult times we are in. While the COVID-19 pandemic and the economic crash have caused suffering for millions of people, they have also exposed the failings of our economic system and offer us a unique opportunity to provide sustainable alternatives.
The Assembly featured stirring keynote speeches by Marsha Coleman Adebayo, author, scholar, whistleblower, and organizer of the Bethesda African Cemetery Coalition; Kali Akuno, co-founder and co-director of Cooperation Jackson; and Ajamu Baraka, National Organizer and National Spokesperson for Black Alliance for Peace.
Also featured were workshops on Labor, Transit, and Immigration.
Outgoing co-chair, Andy Ellis, has prepared a comprehensive, year end report of the party’s achievements in the past year. The report and the recording of the Assembly can be found here: [[URL REDACTED]]
Our biggest challenge right now is the fact that the COVID-19 pandemic has prevented us from hitting the streets to petition for ballot access. We have brought a lawsuit before the state to reduce the signature burden needed to get us on the ballot. They have already granted us the ability to use electronic petitioning instead of in person petitioning. Please visit our online petition page and get your friends and acquaintances to sign too!

Thank you for your continued support. We must continue our organizing in the next year to offer the public a humane and sustainable alternative to the two main parties.

Hello Friend,
Our party has endorsed SB 10 and HB 103 in the 2020 session of the Maryland General Assembly. These bills call for a constitutional amendment that would allow for special elections at the next statewide general election for vacancies that occur in the first two years of a general assembly term.
It is worth noting that this bill is an imperfect compromise.
Read Our Statement For Reasons Why We Support This Compromise
Earlier today, the third reading of this non-partisan legislation passed unanimously in the Senate.
We are asking you to contact the Delegates on the House Ways and Means committee, to guarantee the success of this legislation.
Tell them to support special elections by voting in favor of HB 103.
Anne R. Kaiser, Chair (410) 841-3036, (301) 858-3036
Alonzo T. Washington, Vice-Chair (410) 841-3652, (301) 858-3652

A Tribute
I met Kevin Zeese during Ralph Nader’s 2008 presidential campaign. Kevin was the press secretary and I was the deputy press secretary as well as the Maryland state campaign coordinator. Because of his support I was able to participate in parts of the campaign, had access to more challenging tasks, and was able to contribute more to building the movement than I would have been otherwise. I also witnessed for the first but not last time that Kevin could produce the fastest written, most comprehensive and incisive press releases and policy statements I had ever seen. To this day I aspire to reach his speed and deftness in presenting written arguments for an electoral platform or media talking points or policy paper. Because of Kevin’s advocacy I was invited to join him and Ralph to create an anti-war organization called Democracy Rising where I wrote and conducted research, and the trio of us brought a stronger spotlight to the devastating effects of the United States’ illegal occupation of Iraq.
Throughout the years since, I observed Kevin’s unrelenting campaigning as a Senate candidate, his passionate leadership in his local, state and national Green Party work, and the tenderness and respect he showed toward others on protests, demonstrations and events, particularly those from vulnerable communities. His efforts were so widespread that I lost track of everything he was involved in, but I appreciated seeing his anti-imperialist and eco-socialist arguments strengthen and crystallize the longer I knew him.
It is clear that the Greens have lost a fierce fighter of our Party’s values and mission. He was a top-notch electoral candidate for us and had no problem being the featured speaker or author for any issue, but he also rolled up his sleeves and stood on street corners collecting signatures for petition drives and sat through hours of meetings on administrative committees for the Party. He did the grunt work as committedly as he accepted leadership positions, and we are a stronger local, state and national party for it.
His work is unfinished, and the best way to honor Kevin is to continue the fight for a better world, one that he believed in and worked alongside all of us to help create.
We in the Maryland Green Party are commemorating his life’s work and in particular his dedication to our party by launching a Kevin Zeese Memorial Fund. This fund will help support Green Party projects and campaigns that follow the spirit of Kevin’s efforts in areas such as media, legal defense, ballot access, democracy and direct action.
Kevin had served as the Press Secretary for the U.S. Green Party’s presidential campaign, and I stepped in to help finish the job which Kevin knew was so important: lifting up the powerful voices of Howie Hawkins and Angela Walker. I will be donating my earnings from that campaign to the MGP’s Kevin Zeese Memorial Fund. Please join me in commemorating his work to building our Party by donating to the Fund.
We would like to send our deepest condolences to Kevin’s partner and Green Party member Dr. Margaret Flowers for her blessing and support of this fund, and for her continued activism in our Party and beyond. On Saturday, November 21, 2020, 2-4 p.m. we will be hosting an online Green Party Memorial Service for Kevin Zeese. This will be a safe space for Green Party members and allies to remember Kevin and discuss how we can help move forward the work to which he was so dedicated. Please mark your calendar and RSVP for this event, we look forward to joining with you in sharing, remembering, and planning future work in Kevin’s memory.
In gratitude,
Virginia Rodino
Maryland Green Party Co-Chair

Franca Muller Paz is running a potentially historic campaign for Baltimore City Council, District 12. With her progressive, pro-labor agenda, she has won unprecedented support from organized labor. She secured the endorsement of the Metropolitan Baltimore Council of AFL-CIO Unions, the first time this council has ever endorsed a third party candidate. This week she received another labor endorsement from the Eastern Atlantic States Regional Council of Carpenters. Her background as a union representative and labor-centered platform has earned the trust of organized labor in Baltimore City, Maryland, and beyond. She has also received endorsements from environmental advocacy organizations like Sunrise Movement Baltimore and Sierra Club, as well as a national endorsement from the Democratic Socialists of America. Check out her full list of endorsements!
Franca is also on track to raise over $100,000 from over 1200 grassroots donors. In just 3 weeks of COVID-safe door-knocking, the campaign has identified over 1000 supporters -- and that number is quickly climbing. We need YOUR help to get our amazing Baltimore City candidate over the finish line. Even if you aren’t local to Baltimore, there are ways to be involved in voter outreach such as phone/textbanking, social media promotion, and donating. A win for Franca is a win for the city of Baltimore and our entire Party!
Join us for one final online Franca for the People fundraiser and party.
There will be prizes, games, and lots of fun. Here is the link to RSVP: [[URL REDACTED]] Please spread the word to other Greens and progressives.

We filed an ethics complaint against Larry Hogan, regarding conflicts of interests with his business arrangements.
Through his controversial real estate dealings, he is the only Governor in the state's history to have made millions of dollars while serving in office.

## Maryland Green Party Settles Ballot Access Lawsuit Against State Of Maryland.
Yesterday afternoon the Maryland Green Party and the Libertarian Party of Maryland entered into a settlement with The State Board of Elections to lower the threshold of petition signatures required to put the Green Party on the ballot from 10,000 to 5,000. Both parties had sought relief from the 10,000 signature requirement as a result of the COVD-19 State of Emergency.
The Green Party has already collected 5,200 signatures by paper petitions and several hundred since launching its electronic efforts this month. With the decision yesterday additional signature collection is intended to account for any signatures the State Board may deem inavlid,
Since March the Maryland Green Party has been lobbying the state to provide two things in the face of the COVID-19 State of Emergency 1) electronic collection of signatures 2) reduction in the number of signatures required. In April the State Board of Elections issued a policy that allowed electronic collection of signatures and with yesterday’s settlement both goals have now been achieved.
The Green Party is collecting signatures on-line at [[URL REDACTED]] and must turn in 5000 valid signatures by August 3rd, 2020.
Former Maryland Green Party Chair and Plaintiff in this case Andy Ellis said “The Green Party has been on the ballot every year since 2000 in Maryland and with this settlement I am confident we will be on the ballot in 2020”
“We have begun a phone banking operation to collect electronic signatures and we fully expect to meet the August 2 deadline,” said incoming co-chair Tim Willard.
