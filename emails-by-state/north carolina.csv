"Ian Shannon, North Carolina Democrats",headquarters@ncdp.org,10 days out and counting on you,"To turn the most important battleground state blue, we have to reach and mobilize more North Carolinians. $10 can help us reach 100 voters while we've still got time!
North Carolina Democratic Party
Hey y'all,
We only have 10 days left to turn North Carolina blue. Later in this email, I’m going to ask you to contribute to our GOTV fund. But first, I want to tell you more about what’s at stake in the final stretch.
Here’s the situation: 2.98 million North Carolinians have already cast their ballots. The turnout has been so exciting, but we can’t stop now. This is the most consequential election of our lifetimes, we aren’t voting just for Democrats, we’re voting for health care, education, jobs and so much more. In the coming days, President Trump will do everything he can to fire up his base in North Carolina. He’s already visited our state twice this week alone and eight times since August.
To fight back and flip the most important battleground state blue, we have to reach and mobilize millions more Democratic voters statewide -- and we need the resources to make it happen. Team, $10 can help us reach 100 voters during this final stretch, and our finance team is about to make the last, most important investments of this election.
Your commitment right now will supercharge our voter outreach over these final 10 days. Can I count on you to pitch in $10 and support our GOTV fund today?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately.
EXPRESS DONATE: $10
EXPRESS DONATE: $25
EXPRESS DONATE: $50
EXPRESS DONATE: $100
EXPRESS DONATE: $200
Or donate another amount.
Anything you can give will power our outreach in this make-or-break final stretch. With your support, we’re going to mobilize even more voters to lift Joe Biden and Democrats up and down the ballot to victory.
Let’s make it count,
Ian

North Carolina Democratic Party
Today, Governor Roy Cooper officially filed to run for re-election, team!
North Carolina Democrats made history in 2016 when we sent him to the Governor’s mansion. Since then, he has fought hard to protect public education, stand up for worker’s rights and the middle class, fight back against power-hungry Republicans, and make our state stronger.
But there’s more work to do. If we don’t re-elect Governor Cooper, we won’t be able to expand affordable health care for half a million North Carolinians, offer meaningful raises for our teachers, or enact crucial protections for our air and water.
I know if we come together again, we can build the team that helps re-elect one of the greatest Democratic governors in the country and sends more Democrats to office! Pitch in $10 or more and we’ll send you this official NCDP sticker, for free!

"Lorenzo Pedro, North Carolina Democrats",headquarters@ncdp.org,Holding Sen. Tillis accountable for his racist mask-wearing comment,"Senator Tillis would rather shift blame to racial minorities than acknowledge President Trump's failed coronavirus response.
North Carolina Democratic Party
Friend --
Senator Thom Tillis made national headlines last week for saying Latinx North Carolinians are harder hit by COVID-19 because they are less likely to wear masks or socially distance.
GOP senator criticized for suggesting Hispanics less likely to wear masks and social distance
Let's be clear: His statement was racist and blatantly false. According to Pew, Hispanics reportedly wear masks at a higher rate than white adults. Tillis refuses to acknowledge the deeper causes of the coronavirus’ disproportionate impact on our community.
Systemic health and social inequities — not a lack of mask-wearing — contribute to high transmission rates in our Latinx communities.
Senator Tillis would rather shift blame to racial minorities than acknowledge President Trump’s failed coronavirus response. North Carolinians deserve a Senator who will prioritize public health and address the systemic causes and racial disparities in coronavirus infections. Will you chip in $10 to help NC Democrats defeat Tillis and the GOP in November?
Together, we will hold him accountable at the ballot box for his racist statement and his defense of Trump. Chip in today if you’re ready to unseat Tillis and elect leaders who will respect and serve ALL North Carolinians.

Will you do your part to help Democrats reach the voters we need to win?
North Carolina Democratic Party
Team --
We have fewer than 100 days until Election Day, and exactly 30 days until North Carolina begins mailing absentee ballots to those who’ve requested them.
Soon, voters across the state will open, mark, and mail back their ballots. And we need to do everything we can to ensure they cast their absentee ballots for Democrats across the ticket -- from the White House to the Attorney General’s Office to the General Assembly.
Can you chip in $10 to help North Carolina Democrats reach more voters before absentee ballots go out in 30 days? Your investment today will help Democratic candidates win up and down the ballot in this crucial election.
North Carolina is the most important battleground state in the nation, and momentum is on our side. But 2016 taught us to prepare for razor-thin margins of victory. My race came down to 24,000 votes, and we’re taking nothing for granted this year. These early absentee ballots could very well decide the election’s outcome.
We simply cannot afford four more years of failed Republican leadership. North Carolina Democrats are counting on your support to safely reach more voters before absentee ballots begin to go out. I hope you’ll add a contribution to help us keep up the momentum and win in November.

Democrats --
Donald Trump betrayed his oath of office. The evidence was overwhelming.
But I just watched as Senator Thom Tillis stood up, said “not guilty,” and traded in America’s democracy for political calculations.
Let me be plain: Donald Trump abused his power, and Thom Tillis actively worked to cover it up to save his own skin.
We must defeat them both at the ballot box this year. Trump can’t win the White House without North Carolina. Republicans can’t win the Senate without Tillis. We cannot win North Carolina without you, Team. So, I’m asking:

North Carolina Democratic Party
Friends --
Today marks a historic victory for equality in our nation. The Supreme Court just issued a landmark ruling that the 1964 Civil Rights Act protects LGBTQ+ workers.
Republicans devote $20m and 50,000 people to efforts to restrict voting
As we celebrate this ruling, NC Democrats will continue to stand alongside the LGBTQ+ community in the fight against discrimination. We call on our U.S. Senators, Richard Burr and Thom Tillis, to support the Equality Act in the U.S. Senate to ensure that all North Carolinians are given full and equal protection under the law.
No one should be discriminated against for who they are or who they love. That’s why NC Democrats are committed to stamping out all forms of discrimination in our state and country.
Thank you for supporting the ongoing fight for LGBTQ+ equality.

Tonight, Cal Cunningham will face Senator Tillis in the first debate of the general election.
We know Cal is ready to speak our values and hold Senator Tillis accountable for putting his corporate special interests before North Carolina families.
Before Cal takes the stage tonight, we want to show him you’ve got his back. Can you pitch in $10 to help power our movement to unseat Senator Tillis and elect Democrats across the ticket?
North Carolina’s choice for US Senate has never been clearer.
Just last week, Thom Tillis made national headlines, first for landing himself in the middle of an alleged corrupt campaign donation scandal, and then for his staff telling a three-time cancer survivor that she’ll just have to “figure out” how to afford health care.
Meanwhile, Cal has a plan to lower health care costs, invest in public education, help our economy recover, and bring new independent leadership to Washington.
We need to put an end to this culture of corruption and elect the Senator North Carolina deserves. With only 50 days until Election Day and control of the US Senate on the line, Cal and NC Democrats are relying on your support now more than ever. Will you chip in?

North Carolina Democratic Party
Y'all --
We expected Trump to lie, interrupt, and act petulant as he has done for the last four years. But that was like nothing I’ve ever seen -- and quite frankly it was an embarrassment to this nation.
While people will talk about Trump’s erratic and caustic behavior, I am so proud of Joe Biden for standing up to the bully in the White House and winning that debate. We must do everything we can to make sure we elect Joe and Democrats up and down the ballot to stop Trump in his tracks.
If you’re feeling fired up this morning and want to make a difference in this election, chip in to our final full quarter before the election.
The resources you provide will make sure we can kick Trump and his GOP enablers out of power in Washington and in North Carolina.

Senator Thom Tillis is going to vote against calling key witnesses to hear evidence tonight -- putting the last nail in the coffin of our hopes for a fair, honest trial.
LOAD PICTURES
This proves it, once and for all: Tillis is not willing to uphold his oath of office to the people of North Carolina. We must hold him accountable.
That's why I'm asking you to do something very important: make a $10 donation to help defeat him and the NC GOP this year:

Let's get one thing straight: Thom Tillis cares more about winning reelection than he does the people of North Carolina. Every spineless moment he's spent cuddling up to Mitch McConnell and national Republicans -- from raiding North Carolina's military bases for an ineffective border wall, to supporting a lawsuit to gut affordable health care, and pledging to circumvent democracy to block a fair trial -- has been at our expense.
We're not going to let him get away with it. Here at the NCDP HQ, Democrats have been working hard: opening offices across the state, putting organizers on the ground, running ads, and reminding people about Tillis' wrong priorities. We are fighting for the people of this state.
In light of Tillis' shameful stance, I couldn't think of a more important time to support that work.
Turn your frustration at this blatant obstruction into action. Donate $10 before our critical end-of-month deadline to defeat Thom Tillis and Republicans statewide this year.
Yours in the fight,

Friends --
Election forecasters across the country agree: If Democrats want to flip the Senate, we need to win in the “Core Four” states: North Carolina, Arizona, Colorado, and Maine.
Thom Tillis, Martha McSally, Cory Gardner, and Susan Collins have failed to stand up to Donald Trump on everything from his administration’s bungled coronavirus response to his ceaseless attacks on our health care. We NEED to put an end to this catastrophe.
That’s why all the “Core Four” State Democratic Parties have come together to make it easy for you to help us take back the Senate, deliver the White House for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, and elect Democrats up and down the ballot!
Will you make a gift of $20 or whatever you can afford to help the North Carolina, Arizona, Colorado, and Maine Democratic Parties elect Democrats up and down the ticket?
There is no road to flipping the Senate--and creating a more progressive nation--that doesn’t include defeating these four Trump lackies. Your contribution is key to helping all four State Democratic Parties supply volunteers with the tools they need to talk with undecided voters, hire organizers, and build the largest Get Out The Vote effort this country has ever seen.

North Carolina Democratic Party
We’re holding the Trump administration accountable. If your small business is struggling to secure a loan, will you share your story?
SHARE YOUR STORY
Friends,
Hard-working North Carolinians are paying the price for the GOP’s disastrous crisis response -- and our small business owners are taking a big hit.
Instead of helping, Donald Trump’s administration is completely mismanaging a fund that was supposed to get relief to small businesses. Turns out, only 2.5% of the money has actually made its way to North Carolinians’ pockets.
A new study released a few days ago shows how bungled Trump’s management has been:
* Over 820,000 small businesses in North Carolina have been left high and dry
* 80% of small businesses in the US that applied for relief money received nothing
* Minority-owned businesses have disproportionately been left behind
It’s clear: because of Trump, this money is not going where it's supposed to. Instead, several news outlets are reporting that big firms with ties to the GOP and Trump’s campaign have received millions of taxpayers dollars.
At a time when businesses across North Carolina continue to close, this is unacceptable. We must fight back. We’re asking small business owners to make their voices heard. If your business is struggling to secure a PPP loan, will you share your story with us?
SHARE YOUR STORY
Thank you for speaking out and helping us hold the Trump administration accountable.

North Carolina Democratic Party
Team,
Amid this evolving health crisis, one thing hasn’t changed: the importance of turning out voters this November. We know North Carolina is better off when more people participate in our democracy. That’s why we’re fighting to expand access to safe, secure, and accessible voting.
But Republicans have a different idea. In the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, the Trump campaign and national Republicans are spending millions to restrict voting and oppose Democratic efforts to protect ballot access -- forcing people to choose between their health and casting their ballot.
Republicans devote $20m and 50,000 people to efforts to restrict voting
We have to fight back. Will you donate $10 or more to support North Carolina Democrats’ urgent voter protection efforts? Now more than ever, we need your support to defend our democracy against GOP voter suppression.
Republicans oppose equal access to the ballot because they know that when more people vote, Democrats win. We need North Carolinians to vote in record numbers — whether by mail or at the polls — to re-elect Governor Cooper, to defeat Thom Tillis, and to take back the state legislature.
At this critical moment, we’re counting on your support to fight for our values and our democracy from the ground up. Anything you’re able to give will make a difference as we scale up our voter protection efforts and send a strong message to the GOP!

As a U.S. Senator and California’s former Attorney General, Kamala’s record of fighting for justice -- consumer protections, police reform, civil rights and more -- speaks for itself. She strengthens our ticket and will restore integrity to the vice presidency.

Together, I know we can put an end to Trump’s failed leadership and begin a new chapter in our nation’s history. But it’ll take each of us doing everything in our power to turn North Carolina blue.

Democrats --
For the past decade, Republicans have been consistently chipping away at our democracy, our public schools, our health care, and our ability to make real progress in North Carolina.
The only way to fight back is with a groundswell of consistent grassroots energy.
That’s why I’m excited to announce a new initiative: the Blue Crew. Launching today, this grassroots team will be dedicated to facing down Republicans each and every month -- and since you are one of our most dedicated supporters, I wanted to ask you:
Will you join the Blue Crew by starting a monthly donation of $5 or more today?
JOIN THE TEAM
By starting a small monthly gift, you’re making sure that North Carolina Democrats consistently have a strong, united, and well-organized party -- one that is ready to tackle Republicans head-on and lift our candidates to victory up and down the ticket.
So start your investment in North Carolina’s future today: join me as part of the Blue Crew and show the GOP that grassroots power is on our side.
Thank you for your consistent commitment to our shared values.

* Vote right now during early voting: For the next 16 days, you can visit any early voting site in your county to cast your ballot! Would-be voters can also register and vote on the same day. Early voting provides great flexibility -- just make sure to do so before this period ends on October 31st!
* Vote in person on Election Day: If you choose to wait until Election Day, polling places will be open from 6:30AM to 7:30PM on November 3rd. Make sure to vote at your assigned polling place -- you can find yours HERE!
If you or anyone you know has questions about voting, call us at our Voter Assistance Hotline: 1-833-VOTE4NC. We have a team of staff and volunteers who are here to help you, because we understand how important it is for all of us to vote in the most critical election of our lifetimes. We have already seen a surge in Democratic enthusiasm, so let’s amplify the energy!

Friends --
I can guarantee you that no one is more disappointed that we cannot have our Unity Dinner this year. Or our Western Gala. Or any of the events that typically bring together Democrats from across North Carolina under one roof.
As you all know, this pandemic has forced us to get creative and find ways to come together as Democrats.
That's why I wanted to be sure you received your invite to our first-ever Vote the Whole Slate! Virtual Gala on Wednesday, September 23 at 6:30PM. I’ll be joined by Governor Roy Cooper, Cal Cunningham, Chief Justice Cheri Beasley, and more special guests to celebrate all we’ve accomplished this year and the brighter future we have in store.
Your support, now more than ever, is crucial since we cannot hold these events in-person.
To protect our state, we must vote the whole slate. And we need your support in our efforts to elect Democrats up and down the ballot -- from the courthouse to the White House.
I hope you can join us.
Yours,
Wayne

North Carolina Democratic Party
Team --
In his speech to the Republican National Convention in Charlotte yesterday, Donald Trump said, ""North Carolina, I love you, and that's why I'm here.”
But I think it’s pretty safe to say we’re not feeling the love right now. Every day, North Carolinians are paying the price for Trump’s failures:
* 156,000 confirmed COVID cases and more than 2,500 deaths
* Rising unemployment and hundreds of thousands of lost jobs
* No national testing strategy to contain the spread of the virus
* Insufficient PPE to protect our frontline health workers
North Carolina doesn’t need the president’s pandering while he tries to win our electoral votes -- we need testing, PPE, and relief for our small businesses. But he’s too busy peddling misinformation to address the challenges we are facing.
In November, we can turn North Carolina blue and block Trump’s path to victory. Can you chip in $10 to help us elect Joe Biden and Democrats up and down the ballot?
Together, we can ensure Trump doesn’t get a single electoral vote out of us in November.

Hi, team!
I wanted to send a note and personally thank you for all that you are doing to support Democrats here in North Carolina! This is a fight for democracy -- and I’m so glad to have you on our team.
It’s because of you that we have the resources to take on Donald Trump and the NC GOP. You are powering our work to reach out to voters from the mountains to the coast and encourage them to elect Democrats up and down the ballot! You give me faith that we can build America back better.
Since you are such an important part of that, I wanted to give you a quick update on what we’ve accomplished together:
* 6 million phone calls made to voters in our state since March
* 3.7 million texts sent to date, with an average of 700,000 texts a week
* 1 million pieces of voter and down-ballot protection literature distributed
This fight is just now kicking into high gear, and we’re relying on your help to carry this strong momentum all the way through Election Day. Take action to continue supporting our candidates:
* Volunteer to phone bank with us for our upcoming weekend of action, because in a state like North Carolina, every single vote counts and voters are casting their ballots right now
* Consider another contribution to our cause! We are ramping up critical programs to elect Democrats from the courthouse to the White House, so every dollar matters between now and Election Day
Together we will flip North Carolina blue in November. I can’t wait to celebrate that moment with you soon.

Right now, as North Carolina Democrats across the state are casting their vote in the primary, our team is in the final sprint to prepare for the general election.
As soon as we learn who our candidates are, from the US Senate all the way down to local school boards, we’ve got to be ready to support them. Everything we’ve been preparing for over the last year -- building our grassroots team, protecting the right to vote, registering thousands of new voters -- is kicking into high gear the second our candidates get chosen.

"Meredith Cuomo, North Carolina Democrats",headquarters@ncdp.org,Even Republicans recognize Trump's failure,"At a time when even registered Republicans like Orr are turning against Trump, we have a real opportunity to replace the President and his allies in November.
North Carolina Democratic Party
The Trump administration’s disastrous COVID-19 response proves he’s unfit to lead our country. But don’t take it from us -- even registered Republicans recognize President Trump’s incompetence.
In an op-ed published this week, former North Carolina Supreme Court justice Robert Orr slammed Trump for his failed leadership during this ongoing crisis:
Senator Burr stepping down as chair of intelligence committee amid FBI investigation
Orr calls out several of Trump’s “floundering responses,” including bullying governors, suggesting we drink bleach, and disregarding our Constitution.
It’s clear that Democrats aren’t the only ones fed up with the President’s failed leadership. At a time when even registered Republicans like Orr are turning against Trump, we have a real opportunity to replace the President and his allies in November.
With fewer than six months until Election Day, we need supporters like you to pitch in now if we’re going to keep the momentum and make Trump a one-term president. If you’re able, will you give $10 to help us take back the White House and elect Democrats all the way down the ballot?
Regardless of party affiliation, North Carolinians deserve competent, compassionate leaders at all levels of government. That’s why we’re working hard to elect candidates who are committed to a more prosperous, better educated, safer and healthier North Carolina.

North Carolina Democratic Party
Team --
Today, the Supreme Court made history by blocking Trump’s cruel and illegal decision to try and end the DACA Program. This victory for DREAMers is a victory for us all.
As the son of immigrant parents, it means so much to hear the Supreme Court reaffirm that young people who were raised as part of our American family belong. Now, over 20,000 DREAMers in North Carolina don’t have to live in the fear and uncertainty of deportation -- their home is here.
Today’s victory is huge -- but it was hard-fought and won by a narrow margin. We cannot allow Trump, Mitch McConnell, and Senate Republicans four more years of time to stack our federal courts with anti-immigrant, far-right, conservative judges.
If you're in a position to, can you help fuel that fight? Together, I know we can remove Trump from office, send Cal Cunningham to the U.S. Senate, and elect Democrats up and down the ballot who will live up to our nation's ideals.

North Carolina Democratic Party
Team,
We are in a dead heat against Senator Thom Tillis and the stakes couldn’t be higher. This Senate race will determine the future of our state and our country.
Less than 24 hours after the passing of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg -- a champion for justice and equality and an inspiration to us all -- Senator Tillis said he would rubber stamp President Trump’s choice for the Supreme Court no matter who they are. And he wants to ram through this nominee to a lifetime appointment before Republicans lose control of the presidency and the Senate. With the Affordable Care Act and its protections for people with pre-existing conditions coming before the Court this year, so much hangs in the balance.
That’s why I’m reaching out to ask you to split a donation between our campaign and the North Carolina Democratic Party to help take back North Carolina and our country. With your support, we’ll win this Senate seat, elect Democrats up and down the ballot, and make history.
The next Supreme Court nominee will help decide cases that determine the future of our nation. Friend, this decision will impact us and our children for a generation here in North Carolina.
All the work and progress we have made towards fighting for a fairer health care system -- one that doesn’t deny coverage for preexisting conditions -- will be under grave threat. Can you chip in to give us the resources we need to get North Carolina and our country back on the right track?

"Robert Howard, North Carolina Democrats",headquarters@ncdp.org,Let's make NC the next state to expand Medicaid,"North Carolina is now one of just 12 holdouts.
North Carolina Democratic Party
Last week, deep-red Oklahoma became the 38th state to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. North Carolina is now one of just 12 holdouts.
Even during a public health crisis that’s left more people struggling and out of work, GOP lawmakers refuse to do the right thing and work with Governor Cooper to expand Medicaid.
Together, we’re going to hold Republicans accountable at the ballot box in November. It’s time for new legislative leaders who will make healthcare a top priority. Will you chip in $10 or more to our Legislative Victory Fund to help Democrats win legislative majorities in 2020 and finally expand Medicaid?
During a global pandemic, no one should have to choose between paying their rent and seeing their doctor. Expanding Medicaid would be a major step in addressing the economic and public health consequences of COVID-19.
It would bring North Carolina’s federal tax dollars back into our economy – creating 40,000 jobs and keeping rural hospitals open. As job losses widen the coverage gap, experts estimate that Medicaid expansion would provide healthcare to 800,000 North Carolinians.
Access to affordable healthcare – and unseating incumbent Republicans who refuse to expand it – has never been more urgent. Let’s make North Carolina the next state to pass Medicaid expansion.

Hi, Team!
More than 3.8 million North Carolinians have already cast their ballot in the most critical election of our lifetimes. What we are witnessing is incredible and unprecedented turnout -- but we can’t stop here because this is North Carolina, y’all. It’s going to take a team of dedicated volunteers to flip this state. Luckily, I know you are up for it!
We need to fill 2,380 more volunteer shifts. This is the difference between winning and losing. Can you help?
COUNT ME IN
I’ll be honest with you -- we haven’t been this close to flipping North Carolina blue up and down the ticket in more than a decade. If we keep up the fight, in five days North Carolina will be able to stop Donald Trump, end Mitch McConnell’s reign over the Senate, protect and expand our House majority, re-elect Governor Roy Cooper, vote in a Democratic Council of State, flip the state legislature, and elect local Democrats!!!
What we do over these next five days will have a profound impact for years to come, so let’s leave it all on the field. Volunteer for Democrats this weekend:
* Sign up here for our last week of phone banking to reach even more North Carolinians and make sure that every eligible voter can make their voice heard at the polls
* Join our voter protection team here to protect voting rights in NC
Thanks so much for what you’ve done so far and what you are doing in the final stretch! Together, I know we can flip North Carolina blue and build a better future for our state and our country!

North Carolina Democratic Party
Hi, team!
Did you hear yesterday's big news? North Carolina is now offering online voter registration!
Democrats believe in breaking down barriers to the ballot box, not putting them up, and that’s why we’re so excited that registering to vote is now more accessible -- especially during this time of social distancing.
This is huge. Registering new voters could be the difference between defeating Donald Trump and another four years of chaos. Now that it’s online, it’s easier than ever for folks to get involved.
That’s why I made these ads -- and since you’re one of our most dedicated supporters, I wanted to give you an inside look.
LOAD PICTURES
I need your help to get these in front of as many North Carolinians as possible. Can you pitch in $10 or more to our Digital Ad Fund before tonight’s critical deadline to help?

EXPRESS DONATE: $10

Or donate another amount.
This is so important -- perhaps right now more than ever. We might not be able to knock doors or hold in-person events for the time being, but we can practice social distancing and get out the vote at the same time by helping folks register online!
If we’re going to elect leaders who will fight for affordable health care, expand voting rights, and make sure kids get a quality education no matter the zip code -- then we need to hit our voter registration goal. So I have to ask:
Can you pitch in $10 or more to our Digital Ad Fund today? Grassroots contributions from people like you make our voter outreach possible.
Thanks, y'all!

It's not enough to just stop Donald Trump and Thom Tillis -- we need to send Democrats to office from the top to the bottom of the ticket. It's the only way we'll make real progress in our state.
That's why the NCDP is committed to electing strong leaders to the Council of State and the Supreme Court. Folks in those offices make incredibly important decisions that affect our lives everyday -- from health care to education to social justice reforms.
I know our candidates are ready to get to work for NC -- but they need your help to get to office. It's up to you to spread the word about getting them elected. That's why I'm excited to announce a free, new virtual Town Hall series that will highlight our slate during September and October -- and I would love to see you there!

North Carolina Democratic Party

With 95 days left before the election and our end of month deadline just hours away, here are three reasons why your grassroots support would make a huge difference right now:
1. You’d be fueling our Voter Protection Team. Just yesterday, Donald Trump alluded to delaying the November Election. He and his Republican allies are actively trying to suppress the vote and make people question the very foundation of our democracy. That’s unacceptable. Our team is fighting back so that every voter knows their vote is safe and secure.
2. You’d be supporting over 100 diverse and talented organizers across our state. We’ve already made more than 2 million calls and recruited thousands of volunteers -- but we need your contribution to continue building our organizing power.
3. Your donation will help us meet our critical deadline at midnight. We can’t fall short of our goal. Every contribution -- no matter how big or small -- will help us build on our momentum and cross the finish line to victory in November.
With your support, we’re going to make history by electing North Carolina Democrats up and down the ballot. But to win the most important battleground state, we need all hands on deck.
So what do you say? If it makes sense for you right now, please chip in $10 or whatever you can to help us hit this goal by tonight’s deadline.

North Carolina Democratic Party
We are so fortunate to have Governor Cooper and Chief Justice Beasley leading our executive and judicial branches through the COVID-19 pandemic. But -- when it comes to the legislative branch -- North Carolina needs stronger leadership at the helm.
Senate Leader Phil Berger continues to show that he’s more interested in scoring cheap political points with his base than leading an effective legislative response to the crisis. From refusing to expand Medicaid and denying health care coverage to thousands, to undermining the governor with calls to prematurely reopen -- Berger’s actions endanger our public health and the economy.
North Carolinians deserve better than Phil Berger and the Republican-led General Assembly.
That’s why Democrats are fighting to take the majority this year -- but right now, we’re $7,149 away from our monthly goal. Can you pitch in $10 to our Legislative Victory Fund today to help us make up the difference?

* Hosted 117 virtual events with thousands of attendees - many featuring our amazing slate of statewide candidates; and
* Relaunched our Rural NC Listening Tour, adapted for a virtual world, to ensure we engage voters across rural NC.
We’re in for a tough fight this November. North Carolina is the battleground state with the most riding on it. We’ve got the power to make Trump a one-term president, flip the US Senate, re-elect Governor Cooper, flip the General Assembly, and elect hundreds of Democrats.

Democrats --
For the past decade, Republicans have been consistently chipping away at our democracy, our public schools, our health care, and our ability to make real progress in North Carolina.
The only way to fight back is with a groundswell of consistent grassroots energy.
That’s why I’m excited to announce a new initiative: the Blue Crew. Launching today, this grassroots team will be dedicated to facing down Republicans each and every month -- and since you are one of our most dedicated supporters, I wanted to ask you:
Will you join the Blue Crew by starting a monthly donation of $5 or more today?
JOIN THE TEAM
By starting a small monthly gift, you’re making sure that North Carolina Democrats consistently have a strong, united, and well-organized party -- one that is ready to tackle Republicans head-on and lift our candidates to victory up and down the ticket.
So start your investment in North Carolina’s future today: join me as part of the Blue Crew and show the GOP that grassroots power is on our side.
Thank you for your consistent commitment to our shared values.

At the state level, Governor Cooper and North Carolina officials are stepping up and taking incredibly important actions to prevent the spread of this virus.
But at the federal level - it’s a different story. Senator Tillis and Mitch McConnell can’t be bothered to take action. Instead, they are holding up a critical aid package that would help fight COVID-19. We must demand the leadership from them that we deserve.

This election is unlike any other. Digital organizing is even more critical than before to mobilizing NC voters to defeat Donald Trump, retire Thom Tillis, re-elect Governor Cooper, take the majority in the state legislature, and elect Democrats down the ballot.
We need to meet people where they are, and right now, that's entirely in the online space. These are powerful communities that we need to plug into, engage with, and move to action! There are only 46 days left in this election, so there's never been a better time to get involved. Can you help?
Join the fight online with us NOW with one of these 3 easy actions:
1. Join the Cardinal Crew, our digital volunteer team, to amplify our candidate's messages on social media.
2. Record and share a video about your voting plan!
3. Join the NC Text Team and send texts from home to voters.

North Carolina Democratic Party
Democrats --
North Carolina’s coronavirus case count surpassed 100,000 this week, but you wouldn’t know it given the way Lieutenant Governor Dan Forest continues to wage his war on the facts.
Just in the last few weeks, he’s falsely said that “masks do not work” and stay-at-home orders don't prevent deaths. He’s even gathering his maskless masses for indoor, in-person campaign rallies without social distancing.
Dan Forest’s dangerous disregard for medical guidance and North Carolinians’ lives shows exactly why he’s unfit to serve as governor. We have to keep Roy Cooper in office and elect Democrats up and down the ballot in November. Will you invest $10 to fuel that fight today?

Lieutenant Dan’s disregard for public health guidelines doesn’t come as a surprise — he’s made a habit of it since siding with the right-wing fringe group that heckled health care workers. This crisis calls for leaders who prioritize health and safety over politics, but GOP candidates like Dan Forest can’t seem to stop themselves from playing partisan games during a pandemic.
We need to hold them accountable at the ballot box. With just over 100 days until the election, we’re counting on your support now more than ever. Can you pitch in to help?

Election Day is the finish line of a sprint that starts today. With so much at stake this year, we need to get out every single absentee, early, and Election Day vote for North Carolina Democrats. If you’re able, will you contribute $10 now to ensure we reach these first absentee voters?
North Carolina is the most important battleground state, and the first in the nation to mail out absentee ballots. If Democrats vote in record numbers, we can send Trump packing, flip the US Senate, and take back the state legislature.

North Carolina --
This moment demands leadership. From mismanaging the coronavirus outbreak to using tear gas on protestors for a photo-op, Trump has shown he is incapable of leading or uniting this nation — and completely uninterested in trying.
Americans cannot afford four more years of Trump’s failed leadership.
Together, we will hold him and his Republican allies accountable at the ballot box. November brings the opportunity to elect leaders who will respond to the demands of this moment and fight for equality, justice, and opportunity for all.
We’re living through the battle for the soul of our nation — and we’re the most important battleground state. No Republican since 1968 has won the presidency without North Carolina. To stop Donald Trump, we must turn our state blue. The path to winning the White House, taking the US Senate, and expanding the House majority runs through us.
At this moment, the stakes could not be more clear. We’re doing everything in our power to mobilize voters who are ready to use their voices to create change. But we can’t do it alone, team.

Hi team,
November 3rd is less than two weeks away, and we are already seeing North Carolinians turn out in unprecedented numbers to cast their ballot during early voting and vote by mail. Thank goodness because, my fellow Democrats, this is the most critical election of our lifetimes.
What’s at stake is the future of our state and our nation. North Carolinians deserve leaders who will fight for everyone, from the mountains to the coast.
As your Attorney General over the past four years, I have taken on powerful interests to protect North Carolina families. I have led lawsuits against pharmaceutical companies that are fueling the opioid crisis. I have worked hand-in-hand with Governor Roy Cooper and know how important it is for our state that we re-elect him, vote in Rep. Yvonne Lewis Holley as our Lieutenant Governor, and flip the state legislature so we can move North Carolina forward. Together, we are proud to be on the Democratic slate and ready to serve you.
Now, with just 13 days to go until the end of this election, I am asking you to help us.

North Carolina Democrats,headquarters@ncdp.org,Tillis is tangled in yet another campaign donation scandal,"We can make this straw donor scheme the bookend on Tillis' corrupt political career. North Carolinians deserve a Senator who will stand up for our state, not special interests and mega-donors.
North Carolina Democratic Party
Team --
North Carolinians know that Senator Tillis' loyalty lies with corporate special interests, not our state. The Washington Post's recent bombshell investigation revealed that Tillis was ""one of the biggest beneficiaries"" of an apparent illegal scheme led by GOP mega-donor and USPS chief Louis DeJoy.
Thom Tillis is tangled in a campaign money scandal. What should he have known?
Senator Tillis has not denounced the scheme or said he would return the campaign contributions he illegally received. He may be silent on the scandal, but his long record of caving to wealthy backers speaks for itself:
* Tillis took $400,000 from Big Pharma while voting to give drug makers billions in tax breaks and opposing efforts to lower prescription costs for North Carolinians.
* He slashed our state's education funding by $500 million while cutting taxes for his corporate donors.
* He passed a $1.7 trillion tax cut that benefited Big Pharma and insurance companies.
Do you see the pattern? Amid a failing campaign, Senator Tillis continues to sell out our state to corporate mega-donors and special interests. But he is not above the people of North Carolina. We deserve a Senator who will stand up for our state, not wealthy special interests.
Can you pitch in $10 to help us kick Tillis out of office, flip the U.S. Senate, and elect Democrats across the ballot? We're counting on your support to hold Tillis accountable in November.
This straw donor scheme should be a bookend on Tillis' corrupt political career. But Tillis' corporate backers will stop at nothing to protect their ally in the Senate. Please consider donating to help us fight back and elect Cal Cunningham and Democrats across the ticket.

"Meredith Cuomo, North Carolina Democrats",headquarters@ncdp.org,Remember the Three Stooges?,"Republican politicians are playing partisan games during a global pandemic. It's time to replace them with leaders who take public health seriously.
North Carolina Democratic Party
Team --
Republican politicians are putting North Carolinians' health and safety on the line with their partisan games. It’s time for Lt. Governor Dan Forest, Insurance Commissioner Mike Causey, and Senator Danny Britt to stop treating a global pandemic like a joke. These three stooges exemplify Republicans’ disastrous leadership throughout this crisis:
LOAD PICTURES
* Lt. Governor Dan Forest just held an in-person campaign event with over 100 attendees -- no masks, no social distancing. His reckless behavior and statements show how out-of-touch he is with the tough reality facing our state.
* Insurance Commissioner Mike Causey refuses to mandate mask-wearing at NCDOI, despite multiple COVID-19 cases among employees. Causey also continues to hold unnecessary, maskless DOI events across the state as cases and hospitalizations skyrocket. His irresponsible actions violate health experts’ guidance and endanger state employees.
* Senator Danny Britt tested positive a day after the legislative session, during which he refused to wear a mask \-- potentially exposing all of his colleagues to the virus.
Forest, Causey, and Britt’s absurd behavior endangers public health. We need to do everything we can to unseat these Republicans and their allies in November. If you’re able, will you chip in $10 to support our efforts?
Together, we’re going to elect Democratic candidates up and down the ballot who will prioritize health and safety over partisanship. North Carolinians deserve leaders who will take this crisis seriously.

Friends --
We are less than 90 days out from Election Day -- and we’re in for a fight.
This is a fight for the soul of our nation. It’s a fight for our state. It’s a fight to elect Joe Biden, Cal Cunningham, Governor Cooper, and North Carolina Democrats up and down the ballot.
The path to a better nation and state runs through North Carolina on Election Day. That’s why the North Carolina Democratic Party’s Coordinated campaign is naming ourselves “Fight for NC.” Our state is worth fighting for, and together we are going to do all we can to flip NC blue.
Fight for NC is looking for a logo and needs your help! That’s why we're hosting a logo design contest!
Submit your logo
Our campaign will be strong because of North Carolinians like you. We want our new logo to reflect the power, diversity, and tenaciousness of people from the mountains to the coast.
Please submit your logo by next Friday and we will announce a winner. The winning logo will be used for our campaign’s branding!
We are looking forward to seeing your designs that show us you’re ready to “Fight for NC”!
Thanks,

North Carolina Democratic Party
Team --
We are nearing the end of our last full quarter before the most consequential election of our lifetimes. We have 38 days to go until November 3rd, when together we can stop Donald Trump, defeat Thom Tillis, and send the GOP packing.
But I am worried, friend. Latest polls show that Joe Biden and Donald Trump are tied in North Carolina. Trump knows that, which is why he has already visited North Carolina five times this month. And the GOP is pouring millions of corporate and special interest money into propping up Tillis and Republicans in our state.
Thankfully, grassroots supporters like you make me feel hopeful. I know that when Democrats are united, we make change happen. That’s why I am reaching out to ask for your support. We need it now, in these last few weeks, more than ever to help Democrats up and down the ballot cross the finish line.
Will you pitch in $15 today so we can defeat Trump and elect Democrats up and down the ballot?

Tonight, Governor Roy Cooper will face his far-right opponent on the debate stage. The choice before us has never been clearer.
Dan Forest’s extreme agenda will damage our state and take us backward, while Roy Cooper will continue to build on four years of progress for North Carolina. We all know what’s at stake this year: Medicaid expansion, access to affordable healthcare, investment in our public education, a coordinated pandemic response backed by science, and so much more.

With your help, we will re-elect Governor Cooper and vote in a Council of State and state legislature that will work hand-in-hand with him.

North Carolina Democratic Party
Team --
In a minute, I’m going to ask you to make a contribution to the North Carolina Democratic Party. But first, I want to explain why your support will have a major impact -- especially ahead of August’s fundraising deadline.
We’ve locked in our presidential ticket and built a strong slate of candidates down the ballot. The latest polls show Democrats are neck-and-neck in key races across North Carolina. But with just 66 days until the election, we’re facing down unprecedented Republican attacks and voter suppression efforts.
Our fight for North Carolina’s future will only get tougher between now and November 3rd. That’s why we need to hit every single fundraising target to continue building the infrastructure our candidates need to come out on top.
August is a historically slow fundraising month -- and that’s proven true this year. If we want to turn North Carolina blue, it’s crucial that we push through this “summer slump” and meet our August goal. Can you donate $10 (or any amount) before Monday night to help us keep up the momentum?
As Finance Director, it’s my job to make sure we have the funding for critical programs to combat voter suppression and get out the vote for Democrats up and down the ballot. Our candidates are counting on the backing of a fully-funded NCDP -- and we risk letting them down if we fall short of our August goal.
Your contribution ahead of Monday’s deadline will ensure we have the resources to fight back and power Democrats to victory across the ticket. We’re getting down to the wire, and every dollar donated this weekend will have a direct impact.

North Carolina Democratic Party
Team --
Since 1996, I have had the privilege to serve as your Secretary of State and the first woman elected to executive office statewide in North Carolina. I know how important it is to have women in elected office from the courthouse to the statehouse and beyond.
And this year’s Democratic slate is strong with women -- especially women of color. In fact, half of our candidates for Council of State who are running alongside me are women: Representative Yvonne Holley, who will be the first woman of color to serve as Lieutenant Governor; Jessica Holmes, who will be the first woman of color to serve as Commissioner of Labor; Beth Wood for auditor; Jen Mangrum for Superintendent of Public Instruction; and Jenna Wadsworth for Commissioner of Agriculture.
That’s why it is so important to celebrate these historic runs at this year’s Women’s Leadership Brunch on Saturday, October 10th at 11:00AM ET. Can I count on you to be there, too?
GET TICKETS NOW
I’m honored to be joined at the brunch by my dear friends Representative Yvonne Holley, Supreme Court Chief Justice Cheri Beasley, and Democrats who want to support and honor women running for office this November.
I hope you’ll be able to join us for this important conversation.
See you this weekend,

Friends --
Senator Richard Burr must resign.
Last night, stomach-churning news broke: after receiving dire and classified briefings about the coronavirus, Senator Burr sold off more than half of his stock portfolio. That means he used his position and access to make a profit off of what he knew would be a life-changing crisis.
Senator Richard Burr Sold a Fortune in Stocks as G.O.P Played Down Coronavirus Threat
While he was publicly reassuring people that we would be prepared for the coronavirus, he was privately preparing for the worst. It speaks volumes that his first inclination was to protect himself and his stock portfolio -- instead of trying to protect hard-working North Carolina families.
This gross abuse of trust must be met with swift action. That’s why the North Carolina Democratic Party has called for an immediate investigation and Senator Burr’s resignation. We need you to add your voice to ours.

North Carolina Democratic Party
Hello --
The Republican-led General Assembly has used its power to lead a crusade against the people of North Carolina. From refusing to expand Medicaid, to systematically dismantling public schools, to aggressive voter suppression -- they’ve laid down a blueprint for war against democracy and equality.
It’s on us to call them out and hold them accountable. My new book, Indecent Assembly, does that by detailing the impacts of their ultra-conservative political ideology.
Republicans devote $20m and 50,000 people to efforts to restrict voting
Despite the GOP’s best efforts, there’s some good news: this November we’ve got an incredible opportunity to make a difference at the ballot box. If there’s one thing I’ve learned from participating in Moral Mondays, it's the power of people to institute change.
That’s why I wanted to personally ask you to join me for a book discussion on June 16th. I’ll give an in-depth analysis of the ways the General Assembly has hurt North Carolina and the steps we must take to change our state. Can I count on you to join me?
RESERVE YOUR SPOT
I’m convinced we’re in a brutal battle for our form of government, our constitutional liberties, the rule of law, and our own decency. The stakes are enormous. But our collective voices are strong. That’s why I hope you’ll join me, Senator Valerie Foushee, and Representative Graig Meyer for a book discussion next Tuesday.
Looking forward to it,

Right now, millions of people across our country are raising their voices in response to the murders of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and the systemic violence and discrimination that Black Americans face every day.
There are no words to sufficiently capture the pain and grief that so many are feeling -- so we will not try. Instead, we will simply say:
We stand with you. We see you. We hear you. We will listen, learn, and heal. Together we will work, act, grow, and change this country.
This is the time for mourning but also for resolve -- a resolve to confront the institutional racism that still plagues our society and to honestly acknowledge the immense work we must do to rid ourselves of it.
To begin this work, North Carolina needs leaders at all levels of government who will fight to dismantle public policies that oppress the Black Community -- leaders who will build an open, inclusive North Carolina where all people are truly welcomed and treated equally. Our Party is committed to electing people who will bring about that change, and we’re proud to stand shoulder to shoulder with you in that effort.

"Wayne Goodwin, North Carolina Democrats",headquarters@ncdp.org,Tillis is propped up by corporate interests,"This week, big business special interests launched a $7 million ad campaign to reward Senator Tillis and other vulnerable Republicans for voting to give corporations a massive tax giveaway
North Carolina Democratic Party
Friend --
I’ve said it before: North Carolina is the most important battleground state this year. That’s why outside groups are spending tens of millions to prop up vulnerable Republicans like Senator Thom Tillis.
This week, big business special interests launched a $7 million ad campaign to reward Senator Tillis and other vulnerable Republicans for voting to give corporations a massive tax giveaway and to end protections for pre-existing conditions. This doesn’t come as a surprise — North Carolinians know he’s spent his entire political career caving to his corporate backers and selling out to Trump instead of looking out for us.
We’re counting on grassroots supporters like you to build the financial resources NC Democrats need to stand up to GOP mega-donors and out-of-state groups. If we raise $25,000 by June’s critical end-of-quarter deadline, we'll be in a strong position to fight back.
Will you chip in $15 right now? It’ll help us send a message that we won’t let outside interest groups buy North Carolina’s elections.
Republicans can’t win the Senate without Tillis, and Democrats can’t win North Carolina without you. We need all hands on deck to send Cal Cunningham to office, re-elect Governor Cooper, and elect Democrats up and down the ballot in November.
If you’re able, please make a contribution today to help us meet this important $25,000 goal by June 30th.

You know the stakes of this election, team. Every path to the White House runs through North Carolina. To defeat Donald Trump and lift our Democratic candidates to victory, we need to turn out unprecedented numbers of voters between now and November 3rd.
Our party’s GOTV strategy is paying off -- more than 3.8 million North Carolinians have already cast their ballots, and we’re seeing a significant Democratic advantage! However, experts predict an Election Day surge for Trump. To protect our lead, we’ve got to keep up the fight during the last two days of early voting and keep the momentum going into November 3rd.

Folks,
Tonight, Joe Biden went head-to-head with Donald Trump. The final debate reaffirmed what we already know: Joe Biden is the leader we need to build our state and our nation back better. There’s no path to the presidency without North Carolina -- just look at the latest CNN reporting:
“A Biden win in North Carolina would probably end Trump's chance of taking the Electoral College. According to statistical models from the folks at FiveThirtyEight and Jack Kersting, Biden's chance of winning the election when carrying the Tar Heel state is north of 95%.”
I know we can do this, y'all -- but only if we keep up our fight until the last ballot is cast. If you’re fired up after the debate, pitch in $10 or whatever you can to help us turn the most important battleground state blue.

North Carolina Democratic Party
Team --
The clock is ticking. With 36 days left, North Carolina could determine the fate of our country. Just take a look at this New York Times headline:
The White House, Senate and Supreme Court Could All Hinge on North Carolina
The stakes couldn’t be higher. This past weekend, President Trump announced Judge Amy Coney Barrett as his nominee for the Supreme Court. If confirmed, Barrett would solidify a conservative majority that could usher in sweeping changes in health care, abortion rights, and voting rights for decades. We must stand together for what’s best for our country and stop Trump and his Republican enablers from rushing through confirmation on the eve of this election.
The Democratic spirit is strong and we are united as we wrap up the final full quarter before Election Day. But now more than ever, we need to carry forward that momentum -- for the White House, U.S. Senate, Supreme Court, and Democrats up and down the ballot. So I have to ask:

Meet the Original
Green New Deal-er
Hi, My Name is Howie Hawkins.
I Want to Earn Your Trust and Support for My Candidacy
for the Green Nomination for President.
Hi ,
I'd like to introduce myself. My name is Howie Hawkins, and I'm seeking the Green Party nomination for president.
A LITTLE ABOUT ME
I'm a retired Teamster from Syracuse, New York. I served in the Marine Corps, studied at Dartmouth College, and worked in construction and warehouses. Since the 1960s, I have been a constant campaigner for peace, justice, unions, the environment, and independent working-class politics for a democratic,
socialist, and ecological society. A Green since I participated in the first national Green Party organizing meeting in 1984, I was the first US candidate to campaign for a Green New Deal in 2010. My campaigns for governor in 2010, 2014, and 2018 won ballot status for the New York Green Party. I am the ""Original Green New Deal-er.""
I’ve spent the last six months or so asking Green Party members and allies to support my run for the Green Party Presidential nomination, understanding that its goals are to help build the Green Party and to advance an ecosocialist program.
People like you have proven, conclusively, that the support for me is real. My website is at [[URL REDACTED]], where you can learn more in detail about my vision and ideas to fundamentally transform our society.
As I just mentioned, the central purpose of my campaign is to build the Green Party so that disenchanted progressive voters have a place to go after the inevitable disillusion of the 2020 presidential race – whoever wins.
At the heart of this build-out strategy is ballot access. My campaign is raising money specifically for ballot access activities – primarily petitioning drives to get us on the ballot in all 50 states plus D.C.
(We estimate that we’ll need to raise $1.5 million to get the signatures we need. And we know we can raise those dollars because literally everyone believes that third parties like ours should be able to put their candidates on the ballot!)
Here’s the bottom line: If our candidates are not on the ballot, we can’t make an impact on public policy, much less revolutionize our economy and save ourselves from planetary collapse.
More to the point, if we don't have at least 37 states on the ballot in 2020, the North Carolina Green Party loses its own ballot status.
I’ve run 3 times for Governor in New York, and by doing so, have secured the ballot line for Green candidates there. I’ve also participated in literally dozens of petition drives, getting out to shopping malls and community events to personally get signatures to secure ballot access.
Our campaign is putting in serious work to achieving ballot access in 50 states plus D.C., and I personally have petitioned recently in Arizona and Ohio. I truly believe that presidential candidates must prioritize ballot access, because if we aren't doing everything we can via this key activity to get our candidates on the ballot, then we are not doing everything necessary to grow the Green Party into the political opposition to the duopoly that we all desperately need.
Now, in addition to building the Green Party into a true national political force, I am running on a visionary, yet practical, Ecosocialist Green New Deal platform.
The Green New Deal has been our Party’s signature program over the last decade. A few congressional Democrats took the Green New Deal and got it into the national spotlight—but they diluted its content. Now it is the subject of a major debate in the presidential campaign.
As the original Green New Dealers, we Greens will set the standard against which every candidate, and the national debate, will be measured against. That's why I recently rolled out an exhaustive plan for how to pay for it, called the Ecosocialist Green New Deal, which you can read about here.
This campaign is our opportunity to declare, loudly, that we will NOT accept “the lesser of two evils,” we will NOT accept the duopoly’s corporate candidates, and we will NOT accept politics as usual.
Will you donate $20 or more today to support the Ecosocialist Green New Deal?Everyday Americans need to hear a realistic and detailed plan on how to address climate change. The time is long gone for half measures. We need transformative politics to save our planet with our Ecosocialist Green New Deal.
The effectiveness of our campaign will be determined in large part by how much money we raise for staff, publicity, and on-the-ground organizing. If you can, please give today.
No amount is too small—whatever you can give today will make a real difference in this critical election year.
In Solidarity,
Howie Hawkins

Dear Friend:
As the election ramps up, we wanted to let you know about this month's news from the North Carolina Green Party:
* Organize with us to get out the vote for the Hawkins/Walker Green Party presidential campaign.
* Donate to our presidential campaign fundraiser.
* Check out our most recent activism in solidarity with BLM.
* Read our open letter calling on Gov. Cooper to put farmworker safety before profits during Covid.

## NCGP to Governor Cooper: Farmworker Safety During the Pandemic Is More Important Than Profits
Governor Cooper:
In April of 2020, a letter was sent to you from the North Carolina Farmworker Advocacy Network (NCFAN), which is a coalition of organizations working to improve the living and working conditions of agricultural workers. In this letter, you were asked to use the power of your office to issue an executive order that would help to protect agricultural workers during the pandemic. In particular, NCFAN requested that you instruct agribusinesses to:
* Provide migrant farmworkers with access to healthcare services and other resources.
* Ensure migrant agricultural workers are not put at risk in their employer-provided housing.
* Ensure agricultural workers are able to protect themselves from exposure while working.
* Protect workers from retaliation who get sick.
* Ensure H-2A farmworkers are able to enroll in the Affordable Care Act (ACA), ensure Spanish interpretation for health information, and provide adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare workers serving agricultural workers.
These are not onerous requirements. As NCFAN has pointed out, you previously publicly committed to issuing this order, as reported in the News and Observer on August 14, 2020. Comparable orders have been issued in Michigan and Wisconsin. In fact, in 2016, long before the pandemic, both Attorney General Josh Stein and yourself told the NC Latino Congress that, once in office, you would work toward “improving the state’s ability to provide culturally and linguistically appropriate health and human services to North Carolina’s growing Spanish-speaking community.”
However, upon signs of resistance from the NC Department of Labor and Department of Agriculture, you quickly rescinded the commitment to the executive order. Both of the heads of these offices are Republicans, and both are themselves committed to protecting business (including large farmers and agribusiness) from any legal responsibility to protect workers beyond the bare minimum dictated by law. Since Republican legislators have spent the last decade reducing that responsibility, your office had an opportunity to begin to reverse the damage of laws created to benefit employers over employees. It should have been an easy decision to inform commissioners Berry and Troxler that their resistance to your order was not in line with the needs of the farmworkers in North Carolina, and that your administration, and the attorney general’s office, was quite prepared to enforce this order. As has been pointed out by NC Justice Center, in an article in the Greensboro News and Record on September 10, 2020, many businesses would have complied with your order regardless of the positions of the commissioners.
The failure to issue the order is a betrayal of North Carolina farmworkers, and it calls into question your intent to govern on behalf of all inhabitants of the state. Farmworkers, with or without visas or other documentation, are used by agribusiness to make profits. COVID-19 disproportionately affects people in black and Hispanic communities. For Berry and Troxler, despite the high-sounding rhetoric, these people are disposable, whereas the profits of agribusiness are indispensable. We must ask, which position will you take Governor? Will it be people or profit? Health or illness? Empathy or indifference? The people expect better.

## North Carolina Green Party Supports and Participates in the Black Lives Matter Movement
Several North Carolina Green Party members, including cochair Tony Ndege, Charlotte Area Greens cochair Jacob Samuels, past candidates Keenen Altic, Joshua Bradley, and Robert Corriher, assistant secretary Ade Mowry, Troy Winfree of Triad Greens, and others have been heavily involved in statewide protest movements against state violence and systemic inequity.
These actions have included:
* A week-long occupation of the Governor’s Mansion in Raleigh, which helped to win the successful veto of the onerous SB 168.
* Dozens of protests in the wake of the murder George Floyd, including several events in the Triad where Ndege is a lead organizer in the Black Lives Matter movement.
* Demands for truth and transparency over the death of John Neville and other jail inmates.
* Demanding that Forsyth County and all NC counties sever their contracts with Wellpath, a for-profit corporation which is the largest healthcare provider for incarceration institutions in the country.
* Recent actions in solidarity with the #KenoshaUprising in response to the shooting of Jacob Blake, who grew up in Winston-Salem.

## Volunteer to Get Out the Vote for Howie Hawkins and Angela Walker
Let's get out the vote for Green Party candidates Howie Hawkins and Angela Walker! We can ensure automatic ballot access through 2024 for the NC Green Party by winning at least 2% of the votes for president in 2020 in North Carolina!
VOLUNTEER! There are many ways to help get out the vote for Howie and Angela. We need volunteers:
* to serve as coordinators across the state
* for door hanger canvassing (no face-to-face required during this Covid-19 crisis)
* social-media content posters
* content writers
* phonebanking and textbanking
* early-voting canvassing
* campaign yard sign placement and pickup
Even volunteering an hour or two will make a tremendous difference. Join us for our statewide campaign meetings on Wednesday nights on Zoom to learn how you can help. Please register in advance for these meetings and sign up to volunteer!
More and more voters are realizing that the two corporate parties have failed us. The Hawkins/Walker ticket represents real change in this country. While every candidate says that, the Green Party’s platform proves our commitment to broad sweeping system change to improve the lives of the working class, especially oppressed groups, as well as our environment. Our votes come from people who want something different and have no faith in continuing the same failed strategies; they're people who are fed up with our undemocratic electoral system and the corporate parties’ failure to protect and serve its citizens.
None of our most urgent problems will be significantly addressed by either a President Biden or a President Trump. Voters overwhelmingly support Green Party positions like:
* Medicare for All
* An end to wars for profit / bring our troops home
* Slashing of the military budget
* End to the militarization of police
* End of the War on Drugs - legalize cannabis and expunge records of non-violent “offenders”
* A Real Green New Deal
* Equity and protection of marginalized peoples
This tells us what we already know: that we need to stand even stronger for what we want, and that's real change!
It is critical that we take a stand and not only vote for our future and the future of new generations but also, most importantly—organize for a new mass party, not vote for our fears and hope for the best. The tactic of Lesser Evilism has not worked in over a century of attempts to reform either big-business party, and it certainly won’t work for us in 2020 or for the future of people or our planet.
REGISTER GREEN TODAY!
* * *
## Donate to Our NCGP Campaign Drive!
We're raising $7,500 to get out the vote for the Howie Hawkins and Angela Walker presidential ticket in North Carolina and to increase NC Green Party registration! Our goal: win at least 2% of the vote for Hawkins/Walker in our state. Two percent means the NCGP automatically retains its ballot line for 4 more years to run Green candidates. Otherwise we may lose ballot access for several months or longer, and we will be required to collect several thousand petition signatures.
DONATE NOW to help us organize for H20—and to build the North Carolina Green Party. The two major parties have utterly failed the people and the planet. Help us build our own political power independent of the two capitalist parties!
Your donation will be used for:
* Increasing voter registration and candidate interest for 2020–2024.
* Sending out mailers to statewide registered Greens.
* More signage and getting signs to volunteers in every town—rural as well as larger cities!
* Door hangers and other important materials for Get Out the Vote and membership-building efforts.
* Training volunteers and having limited volunteer stipends.
* Putting materials on campuses and other areas with a large percentage of likely voters.
* Other critical volunteer materials including PPE, hats, and badges.
* Phone banking and text banking for getting out the vote and membership drives.

Please help us by donating - even if only a modest amount. Unlike Trump and his cronies, all of our NCGP members are working class volunteers. Unlike Biden, we haven't fundraised over 700 million from Wall Street donors and SuperPACs.
Thank you for your donation!
Warmest Regards,

NC Green Party,secretary@ncgreenparty.org,The SCOTUS Confirmation Hearings Were A Sham: What Is the Way Forward,"Friend \--
Please check out our latest blog post on the SCOTUS Confirmation Sham and the Necessity for a Mass Party of the Left.
Our argument is that transformative change we must abandon the Pepsi or Coke model of electoral politics and build an entirely different kind of party altogether. We need a real party that is run independently of corporate power in which everyday people take a role in building and which organizes us to fight back:
The Amy Coney Barrett confirmation hearings do not support the so-called “Lesser Evil” argument. In fact the sham of a SCOTUS confirmation absolutely underscores the necessity for us to build a mass party independent of Wall Street power which can actually organize and lead millions to fight back. The party of labor and ecology that we need would be calling upon and organizing workers and unions to strike, protest and truly resist the confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett. This is the kind of mass party that we desperately need today. Instead, we have two ruling parties that do the opposite - they both organize in meeting rooms to put down labor resistance and militant protests. The Democrats are failing to offer ANY serious resistance to Barrett’s confirmation; this is a case of deja vu that should not come as a surprise to any of us by now. The same script is being played out again and the people who are telling us that they are the “Lesser Evil” are capitulating to her confirmation and hugging their so called “greater evil” cronies. The consistent deadly betrayals by the political elite of the interests and lives of everyday people are once again masked by fake respectability politics during the pomp and circumstance of these hearings.
> they see no future beyond our decaying system
Our upcoming popular resistance to the confirmation of Barrett will once again be blunted by a well-financed liberal wall of calls for “civility” by the Democrats. We will hear desperate pleas for more donations to the big nonprofits that function no differently than corporations. They will come to our demonstrations and implore us to “resist” by electing them to capitulate. Again. They will even host well-funded tightly-controlled “protests”, in order to funnel the righteous anger of the people back into the clutches of the Democratic Party. Again. These non-profits will ask us to pour our dwindling funds into their lobbyist organizations which pale in comparison to the rich corporate lobbyists. This is all ultimately a twisted political game to the political class and the non-profit leadership because they are primarily concerned with perpetuating their careers and their power. Why? Because they see no future beyond our decaying system. None of them will be calling for us to strike or pour into the streets or to do anything significant to hurt the bottom dollar of their corporate bosses. This will continue to happen time and time again as the contradictions and decline of our system deepen - until we break with the Two Party trap and build our own independent power.
We, the working class majority, desperately need to build our own parties which represent the interests of the people and the planet; not the Wall Street elite who are the proven enemies of labor, ecology and peace. Such a party may begin with humble and difficult beginnings, but the hunger for such an organization is real. Two-thirds of Americans today want more parties. To move towards a party that represents the interests of every day working class people, we need to ditch once-and-for-all the divisive language defining SOME of us are the ""middle class"" and some are less deserving, which politicians from BOTH ruling parties have consistently used to divide and conquer working people. They have wielded this rhetoric to deceive us into believing that ""some"" of us would be protected by them against the rest of us. That we are better off divided. This kind of divisive politics has paved the way for Trumpism and far worse. This class-divisive rhetoric, underscored by the lack of an independent party of labor, has set back the ability of the majority to build true power.
Donate TODAY
Now is not the time to play it safe. We have seen with this systemic response to the ongoing pandemic and economic crisis that none of us are safe. As the profit system continues its death spiral towards mass evictions, war, potential nuclear annihilation, environmental collapse and rising fascism, we are ALL at risk of perishing if we do not forge a new Ecosocialist system. To do this, we need to fundamentally redefine what a real party for the us should be \- a vehicle for people with similar interests, that organizes to fight for those interests. A new mass party must have a fundamentally different structure than the corporate structure of the DemoPublican system. It must be built on organizing, not high-dollar advertising. We cannot beat them in a party they control with tactics they have billions to spend on. We must have a party that is involved in movements and which can make headways in labor. All of these things require the commitment of everyday people like us - a stark contrast with the “Coke or Pepsi” politics of our present electoral system.
> a small handful of judges appointed by the servants of the elite that is incapable of being recalled by the direct will of the people.
The impending confirmation of Barrett to the Supreme Court and the complete capitulation of even the left-most congressional Democrats underscores the backwardness of our entire 233 year old system of the electoral college, of state-controlled gerrymandered districts and an anti-democratic Senate body. This system includes the archaic structure of the Supreme Court - a small handful of judges appointed by the servants of the elite that is incapable of being recalled by the direct will of the people. Despite several historic hard fought progressive victories embodied in the Bill of Rights, all of the sitting Supreme Court Justices have at one time or another, played a role in eroding many of those protections - the First and Fourth Amendments in particular. The last progressive Amendment to this country’s Constitution, lowering the voting age to 18, was passed almost 50 years ago in response to our powerful Vietnam Anti-War movement during which millions of youth stood up to the draft and the injustices of being forced to kill and be killed but not even able to vote. The gradual decline to a complete halt of progressive amendments over the last century, underscores the calcification of our political system ruled by corporate power, and its total resistance to bending or responding to the will of the masses. New generations have called this systemic dead end “late stage capitalism” and that is a wholly appropriate description.
> The Democrats will never fight for us - they serve Wall Street, the war industry, and the corporate developers.
This is why a party capable of steering future mass movements forward to lasting organizational power (instead of into the two party trap) is necessary. The Democrats have proven time and time again that they will not protect us or even respect the majority will of its voters. Their purpose as a party ruled by the rich and their own interests is to protect the status quo of the wealthy elite above all else - including their own party's success at representing or even inspiring its voters. More than half of Congress are millionaires themselves. The Democrats will never fight for us - they serve Wall Street, the war industry, and the corporate developers. They will only occasionally concede to our demands and then spend the rest of the time eroding those concessions in lock step with Republicans. As the late great comedian and social critic George Carlin observed, it's all one big Wall Street club, including most of the politicians who are wealthy themselves- and we're not in it.
The North Carolina Green Party calls upon the people of North Carolina to support us and join us in our goal of fighting for a new and better system. We cannot accomplish this by simply voting for the “lesser” evil and putting far less resources in building something new. Now is not the time of pragmatism and fear-based retreat - now is the time to stand up and fight for our collective survival.

WHAT: Weekly NC Green Party Hawkins/Walker Campaign Statewide Volunteer Zoom Meeting
WHEN: Wednesday Oct. 7 @ 8:00 p.m. (and every Wednesday afterward through election week!) Once you sign up for this Zoom you will be automatically registered for future Wednesday Zooms and any future updates about time changes.
WHERE: Weekly Zoom Video Conference. Please register in advance for this meeting.
REGISTER FOR VOLUNTEER ZOOM CALLS
(Never used Zoom before? It's FREE and easy to download. To watch the Zoom call you need to download the Zoom app at [[URL REDACTED]] Here is a 1-minute video on how to join a Zoom call.)
We've had great turn-out for our Statewide Hawkins/Walker Volunteer Zoom meetings so far! Our volunteers have placed hundreds of Hawkins/Walker campaign signs throughout the state. Dozens of volunteers are helping from every corner of the state! Please join us. We still need help placing signs, placing door hangers, and with many other tasks.
Our first meetings have been so successful that we will decided to have weekly Zoom calls every Wednesday evening. They should typically be at 8PM!
If you cannot attend but still want to volunteer, you can let us know by signing up at [[URL REDACTED]]
Let's get out the vote for Green Party candidates Howie Hawkins and Angela Walker! It is critical to all Green Party supporters who want our candidates to succeed to be present at our organizing meeting or to sign up to volunteer! Why? The only way to ensure automatic ballot access through 2024 for the NCGP is for our candidates, Howie Hawkins and Angela Walker, to win at least 2% of the vote for president in 2020.
Our target voting demographic certainly aren't “stealing” votes from anyone—they are people who want something different and have no faith in continuing the same failed strategies; they're people who are fed up with our undemocratic electoral system. Break the two-party system!
The past two federal elections have cost more than eleven billion dollars. Unlike the corporate political mafias that rule our elections, offer empty politics, and call themselves parties, the NCGP is a real member-driven party.
We will be earning votes for our candidates, and we are confident that a large percentage of potential voters are our base. Our base includes people who are fed up with our rigged elections and people who are fed up with corporate politicians who serve rich donors and Wall St. lobbyists and war profiteers. Our base also includes people who are less than enthusiastic about voting for politics-as-usual and for politicians who betray their platform. None of our most urgent problems will be significantly addressed by either a President Biden or a President Trump. The same corporate media that viciously attacked attempts by Sanders supporters to pull the Democrats toward even mild reforms is using these fear tactics and virtual blackouts of independent candidates. This tells us what we already know: that we need to stand even stronger for what we want, and that's real change!
* * *
DONATE TO OUR 2020 NCGP CAMPAIGN DRIVE!
DONATE TODAY!
We're fundraising to get out the vote for the Howie Hawkins and Angela Walker presidential ticket in North Carolina and to increase NC Green Party registration! Our goal: win at least 2% of the vote for Hawkins/Walker in our state. Two percent means the NCGP automatically retains its ballot line for 4 more years to run Green candidates. Otherwise we may lose ballot access for several months or longer, and we will be required to collect tens of thousands of petition signatures.
Donate now to help us organize for H20—and to build the North Carolina Green Party. The two major parties have utterly failed the people and the planet. Help us build our own political power independent of the two capitalist parties!
Your donation will be used for:
*     *       * Increasing voter registration and candidate interest for 2020–2024.
* Sending out mailers to statewide registered Greens.
* More signage and getting signs to volunteers in every town—rural as well as larger cities!
* Door hangers and other important materials for Get Out the Vote and membership-building efforts.
* Training volunteers and having limited volunteer stipends.

We are finally here: tomorrow is Election Day! NC Green Volunteers have visited thousands of households with contactless door flyers in just the last few weeks and we have volunteered at several early voting locations!
This has been a multi-billion dollar Presidential Election, however less than a quarter of donations have been donations under $200. If NC Green Party wins just 2% of the Presidential vote we will have automatic ballot access through 2024!
NC Green Party is a grassroots political party that stands for the people and the planet over profit and empire. We need several more volunteers tomorrow for Election Day and also holding signs at major intersections today and tomorrow! Please CALL 336-577-1421 or 919-491-3186 to volunteer AND sign up here.
Can’t flier at the polls because of social distancing concerns? Help us with street advertising! Print or make a big legible VOTE HAWKINS/WALKER FOR PRESIDENT sign and stand near an entrance to a voting location or at a major intersection with the sign. Messages like LEGALIZE IT or PEOPLE/PLANET OVER PROFIT go a long way!
Please remember:
* Many if not most people walking to the polls will say no or will only require the briefest of discussion. Keep conversation brief unless someone seems very interested/fed up with the two party system. Do not engage in lengthy disagreements if a voter wants to engage you in an argument.
* If someone wants to hear a little more, please emphasize the fact that the Democrats and Republicans are controlled by the rich and corporate money as a starting point. Almost no one has disagreed with that when we mention it!
* Wear PPE and gloves and bring some napkins. Spray sanitizer on the gloved hands and dry them every few minutes.
* Be friendly - a “how are you doing today?” And assistance in directing folks to the line will go a long way.
* Pay attention to the NO ELECTIONEERING BEYOND THIS POINT sign and do not cross it.
We will print and distribute fliers for volunteers in the following areas: Asheville, Charlotte, Chapel-Hill, Cary, Durham Greensboro/High Point, Greenville, Raleigh/Wake, Wilmington, Winston-Salem/Forsyth
Live somewhere else? We can possibly print some quarter size flyers for you in your area if you call 336-577-1421 or 919-491-3186 ASAP. However, we greatly appreciate it if you can print your own fliers and contact us - we have limited funds for modest printing reimbursements with receipts.

NC Green Party,ncgp@ncgreenparty.emailnb.com,Vote in the NC Green Party Presidential Primary!,"North Carolina Green Party
Greetings, Friend:
Early voting has already started for the MARCH 3, 2020, presidential primary in North Carolina. This is a historic moment for all of us who seek revolution for people and planet and who recognize that there are no real solutions from the corporate parties—for the first time ever, the North Carolina Green Party has a candidate running for president as a Green in the primary race for our party’s nomination!
We encourage all registered Greens to GET OUT AND VOTE for our candidate, HOWIE HAWKINS, to demonstrate your support for independent left politics in this state.
Howie Hawkins is a co-founder of the Green Party of the United States and a longtime Green candidate from New York. From the start, Howie has been committed to independent working-class politics for a democratic, socialist, and ecological society. He was the first candidate to run on a fully developed Green New Deal in 2010, combining an Economic Bill of Rights to jobs, income, housing, health care, and education with 100% clean energy by 2030 in order to reconstruct the economy for economic justice and climate safety. Howie has been a constant organizer in peace, justice, union, and environmental campaigns.
Hawkins is the only Green presidential candidate who has met the requirements to be recognized by the North Carolina Green Party.
Since Howie is the only candidate on the ballot, why is it important to vote? Because we believe it is critical to show the citizens of North Carolina that our voters feel strongly about exercising their rights as registered Greens. If every registered Green in North Carolina requests a ballot, it will send a clear signal to the leaders of the dominant parties that we are serious about participating, as Greens, in electoral politics in this state, and that we value our ballot-access status. The duopoly party leaders will think twice about passing new laws that disenfranchise Green voters.
Thank you for your support!

(Never used Zoom before? It's FREE and easy to download. To watch the Zoom call you need to download the Zoom app at [[URL REDACTED]] Here is a 1-minute video on how to join a Zoom call.)
On Wednesday night we will be discussing and planning our statewide electoral strategy and why it is so critical for our party and independent politics in our state. If you cannot attend but still want to volunteer, you can let us know by signing up at [[URL REDACTED]]
Let's get out the vote for Green Party candidates Howie Hawkins and Angela Walker! It is critical to all Green Party supporters who want our candidates to succeed to be present at our organizing meeting or to sign up to volunteer! Why? The only way to ensure automatic ballot access through 2024 for the NCGP is for our candidates Howie Hawkins and Angela Walker to win at least 2% of the votes for president in 2020.

It is critical that we take a stand and not only vote for our future and the future of new generations but also, most importantly—organize for a new mass party, not vote for our fears and hope for the best. The tactic of Lesser Evilism has not worked in over a century of attempts to reform either big-business party, and it certainly won’t work for us in 2020 or for the future of people or our planet.
NC Greens plan on running a full slate of local candidates in 2021–2022, and contrary to the Democrat propaganda, our presidential campaign is the #1 way to grow new interest in our party and our message today.
There are many ways to help get out the vote for Howie and Angela: we need volunteer coordinators as well as volunteers to help with door hanger canvassing (no face-to-face required during this Covid-19 crisis), social-media content, phonebanking and textbanking, early-voting canvassing, and campaign yard sign placement and pickup. Even volunteering an hour or two will make a tremendous difference.

We're raising $7,500 to get out the vote for the Howie Hawkins and Angela Walker presidential ticket in North Carolina and to increase NC Green Party registration!

NC Green Party,ncgp@ncgreenparty.emailnb.com,Let's celebrate Earth Day by dismantling Duke Energy!,"NC Green Party
Dear Friend:
My name is Forrest Hinton—cochair of the Triad Area chapter of the North Carolina Green Party, reproductive justice activist, black lives activist, LGBTQ rights activist, and member of the Working Class and Houseless Organizing Alliance in Greensboro.
I’m writing to wish you a happy Earth Day on this 50th anniversary!
Please celebrate today with the North Carolina Green Party (NCGP) by joining us in a critical demand of the environmental justice movement: the fight against corporate criminal and energy giant Duke Energy Carolinas.
As we continue to fight the oncoming climate catastrophe, corporations like Duke Energy are a major obstacle to our progress. As you know, in 2014 Duke was responsible for the devastating coal-ash spill here in our state, polluting the Dan River with 39,000 tons of coal ash.
To add insult to the devastation, Duke Energy is trying to offset the cost of the coal-ash cleanup onto the backs of working people like you and me. Duke is doing this by lobbying the North Carolina Utilities Commission to approve billions of dollars in rate increases. But they’re not fooling us: Duke wants the rate increases to pad the pockets of its shareholders and to pay for the cleanup, for which Duke was found legally liable.
What are the NCGP’s demands to stop Duke’s environmental and social injustice?
End Residential Power Cutoffs Immediately!
The North Carolina Green Party and regional activists are urging the North Carolina Utilities Commission to deny Duke Energy’s request. We say NO to Duke’s corporate greed and corruption! We demand an immediate end to potentially deadly power cutoffs for those who cannot afford their bills, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic. We demand, “Not one more dime, Duke!” Duke has repeatedly broken federal law and betrayed the public trust. The Democrats and Republicans—both capitalist, corporate-controlled parties—appear to be OK with Duke putting the lives of its captive customers in danger by cutting off their power.
Dismantle Duke Energy!
Ending power cutoffs is one thing, but how do we get at the root of the problem? The NCGP is one of the only organizations that goes much deeper than merely opposing Duke Energy’s rate hikes. The Greens are calling for the public takeover and the dismantling of Duke Energy as we know it.
Public ownership of major industry is a key aspect of ecosocialism. It is a key reason why we, the NCGP, define ourselves as an ecosocialist party, and it’s how we’re much different even from the most progressive candidates the Democrats have to offer. This kind of public ownership of major industry, especially the energy industry, is outlined in Green presidential candidate Howie Hawkins’s Ecosocialist Green New Deal.
Let’s be real: Duke is a criminal organization. It has repeatedly broken its public charter for decades with disastrous results. Its license should be revoked and its assets seized. For-profit energy producers act in their own self-interest, not in the interests of communities they serve, and not in interest of the environment. Their business has had dire consequences for the people of North Carolina, and it cannot continue. We must move to end the laws that restrict municipal control of utilities and renewable energy cooperatives. So far, we are one of the only organizations willing to go there publicly, but with your help, we can get the word out and spread this crucial demand.
Give the People the Power Over Renewable Resources!
The path to 100% renewable energy must begin today. Despite Duke Energy’s attempts at greenwashing their tarnished image as one of the nation's biggest polluters, their Integrated Resource Plan calls for only a fraction of their resources over the next decade to be allocated to renewable energy. Duke’s own 15-year plan shows that the corporation will increase renewables to only 8% of its total generation in the Carolinas—which is less than the current national average. This is setting us back as a people and as a planet.
While the candidates of the corporate parties offer watered-down giveaways to Duke, North Carolina Greens and radical candidates like Howie Hawkins, the Green presidential front-runner, plan to fight these corrupt entities. With the real ecosocialist Green New Deal, as well as public ownership of utilities, we want to fight corporate interests at the roots.

Join me in celebrating the 50th anniversary of Earth Day by making a donation to the NCGP to help us build the political power we need to fight Duke. Your contribution will help us build independent, grassroots Green political power in North Carolina to fight capitalist, corporate power exercised through the policies and inaction of Democratic and Republican lawmakers.
To that end, we also need your help organizing! So please sign up to volunteer with the NCGP. Make sure you click the option to receive information about our Energy Democracy Working Group to help us organize against Duke and other environmental injustices.
Want to make a greater investment? Then consider becoming a member of the NCGP. Members pay dues. They vote in party decision-making, are eligible to become members of regional chapters and local branches, and are registered to vote Green. (With some exceptions: North Carolina residents who are ineligible to vote due to state disenfranchisement—including reasons such as age, criminal record, or noncitizen/undocumented status—may also become members. Email the NCGP secretary at [[URL REDACTED]] if you feel you are ineligible to vote due to state disenfranchisement.)
I hope that you will join me, and others like me, in supporting the North Carolina Green Party. Ours is a radical platform that gets at the roots of capitalist catastrophes like Duke Energy.
Solidarity, and happy Earth Day,
Forrest Hinton

NC Green Party,ncgp@ncgreenparty.emailnb.com,CRITICAL MEETING: WED NIGHT & 2020 Campaign Drive,"NC Green Party
Dear Friend:
We have two important updates for you:
* IMPORTANT VOLUNTEER MEETING WEDNESDAY NIGHT!
* DONATE TO OUR 2020 NCGP CAMPAIGN DRIVE!
I. IMPORTANT VOLUNTEER MEETING WEDNESDAY NIGHT!
WHAT: NC Green Party Hawkins/Walker Statewide Volunteer Zoom Meeting
WHEN: Wednesday Sep. 23 @ 8:00 p.m.
WHERE: Zoom Video Conference. Please register in advance for this meeting.
(Never used Zoom before? It's FREE and easy to download. To watch the Zoom call you need to download the Zoom app at [[URL REDACTED]] Here is a 1-minute video on how to join a Zoom call.)
On Wednesday night we will be discussing and planning our statewide electoral strategy and why it is so critical for our party and independent politics in our state. If you cannot attend but still want to volunteer, you can let us know by signing up at [[URL REDACTED]]
Let's get out the vote for Green Party candidates Howie Hawkins and Angela Walker! It is critical to all Green Party supporters who want our candidates to succeed to be present at our organizing meeting or to sign up to volunteer! Why? The only way to ensure automatic ballot access through 2024 for the NCGP is for our candidates Howie Hawkins and Angela Walker to win at least 2% of the votes for president in 2020.
Our target voting demographic isn’t “stealing” votes from anyone—they are people who want something different and have no faith in continuing the same failed strategies; they're people who are fed up with our undemocratic electoral system.
The past two federal elections have cost more than eleven billion dollars.
Unlike the corporations that call themselves parties, the NCGP is a real member-driven party. We will be earning our votes, and we are confident that a large percentage of potential voters are our base. Our base includes people who are fed up with our rigged elections and people who are fed up with corporate politicians who serve rich donors and Wall St. lobbyists and war profiteers. Our base also includes people who are less than enthusiastic about voting for politics-as-usual and for politicians who betray their platform. None of our most urgent problems will be significantly addressed by either a President Biden or a President Trump. The same corporate media that viciously attacked attempts by Sanders supporters to pull the Democrats toward even mild reforms is using these fear tactics and virtual blackouts of independent candidates. This tells us what we already know: that we need to stand even stronger for what we want, and that's real change!
It is critical that we take a stand and not only vote for our future and the future of new generations but also, most importantly—organize for a new mass party, not vote for our fears and hope for the best. The tactic of Lesser Evilism has not worked in over a century of attempts to reform either big-business party, and it certainly won’t work for us in 2020 or for the future of people or our planet.
NC Greens plan on running a full slate of local candidates in 2021–2022, and contrary to the Democrat propaganda, our presidential campaign is the #1 way to grow new interest in our party and our message today.
There are many ways to help get out the vote for Howie and Angela: we need volunteer coordinators as well as volunteers to help with door hanger canvassing (no face-to-face required during this Covid-19 crisis), social-media content, phonebanking and textbanking, early-voting canvassing, and campaign yard sign placement and pickup. Even volunteering an hour or two will make a tremendous difference.
II. DONATE TO OUR 2020 NCGP CAMPAIGN DRIVE!
DONATE TODAY!
We're raising $7,500 to get out the vote for the Howie Hawkins and Angela Walker presidential ticket in North Carolina and to increase NC Green Party registration! Our goal: win at least 2% of the vote for Hawkins/Walker in our state. Two percent means the NCGP automatically retains its ballot line for 4 more years to run Green candidates. Otherwise we may lose ballot access for several months or longer, and we will be required to collect tens of thousands of petition signatures.
Donate now to help us organize for H20—and to build the North Carolina Green Party. The two major parties have utterly failed the people and the planet. Help us build our own political power independent of the two capitalist parties!
Your donation will be used for:
* Increasing voter registration and candidate interest for 2020–2024.
* Sending out mailers to statewide registered Greens.
* More signage and getting signs to volunteers in every town—rural as well as larger cities!
* Door hangers and other important materials for Get Out the Vote and membership-building efforts.
* Training volunteers and having limited volunteer stipends.
* Putting materials on campuses and other areas with a large percentage of likely voters.
* Other critical volunteer materials including PPE, hats, and badges.
* Phonebanking and textbanking for GOTV and membership drives.
Want to donate AND become a member of NC Green Party?
BECOME A MEMBER TODAY!
Kind Regards and Solidarity,

Hi, Friend:
Check out the following news and updates from the North Carolina Green Party (NCGP):
###  North Carolina Green Party Cosponsors Protests Against Police Violence and Racism and Calls for Immediate End to Police Immunity
The NCGP continues to emphatically support the protests and actions in North Carolina, across the US, and around the world that have arisen in response to decades of systemic police violence and institutionalized racism that culminated in the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis on May 25, 2020.
[[URL REDACTED]]
NCGP has been busy supporting the push for racial and economic justice in North Carolina, standing alongside Black Lives Matter activists in Winston-Salem, Greensboro, Charlotte, Raleigh, and all over North Carolina. NCGP cochair Tony Ndege is a founding organizer of Black Lives Matter Winston-Salem and has co-organized several protests in his city, and many other Greens including recent candidates Joshua Bradley, Robert Corriher, and Keenen Altic have been involved in dozens of actions throughout the state. We support these protests and the burgeoning movement to end the US policing and carceral system, which is designed to suppress opposition to the economic supremacy and white supremacy of the capitalist class.
The system that murdered George Floyd is showing the world not only its contempt for the lives of people of color but also its inability to address the economic, ecological, and social problems that beset the US. As we call for justice and reparations for people of color that have suffered for generations under the heel of systemic racism, we also call for an end to the underlying economic system that has created the conditions for police violence and murders in the first place: capitalism.

[[URL REDACTED]]
“To understand police violence, one has to acknowledge the historical role of capitalism and racist exploitation in dictating the priorities of policing,” said Wayne Turner of the North Carolina Green Party. “That priority, despite slogans and police mottoes, has always been the protection of private property and the suppression of working-class organizing and extending the brutal legacy of slavery and cheap labor under Jim Crow to generations of black and brown communities.”
“By shifting funding away from social programs that promote the health and well-being of the general public and address economic inequality and instead shifting toward more policing, the US has allowed militarized police forces to become the face that governments present to the public,” said North Carolina Green Party cochair Tommie James. “We shouldn’t send swat teams to deal with mental-health issues or use deadly force when responding to a supposed traffic violation.”
NCGP supports a radical reconfiguration of the role of policing in the US. A first step should be to end qualified immunity of police, which shields police officers and other government officials from legal actions by victims and families, even if their civil rights were violated. It is necessary that we redefine the role of police and sheriff’s departments, who are seen by much of the public as the protectors of wealth and property, as suppressors of dissent, and as actively funneling the poor and people of color into our bloated prison system that reduces individuals to a life of legalized slavery.

### Governor Cooper Vetoes NC Senate Bill 168
NCGP members participated with other activists for more than a week in a sidewalk occupation in front of the governor’s mansion to urge Governor Cooper to veto NC Senate Bill 168. The NC Senate and House passed the bill at 2:30 a.m. June 27, establishing that all death records are confidential and not available for public review without family authorization. The bill sat on Governor Cooper’s desk for days until the deadline of July 6, when he finally signed the veto. If the bill had become law, it would have made it more difficult to get justice for victims of police violence.
###
Atlantic Coast Pipeline Abandoned by Duke Energy and Dominion
Environmental activists have won a hard-fought victory this month: Duke Energy Corporation and Dominion Energy announced July 5 they have abandoned the proposed $8 billion pipeline, citing continued regulatory delays and uncertainty. The pipeline would have carried natural gas 600 miles through West Virginia, Virginia, and North Carolina and underneath the Appalachian Trail. The NCGP has spoken out about this issue since 2015, and we have consistently called for the socialization of all utilities, including energy.
Despite the utility companies’ claims, the NCGP has noted that the natural gas was largely meant for overseas sales and not for consumption in North Carolina. Meaning, the operation to transport fracked natural gas to the coast served mainly to increase profits for Duke and Dominion shareholders and not for the public good. The real win will come when we replace privatized energy utilities with public ownership and operation.
### Howie Hawkins and Angela Walker Win Green Party of the United States Nomination!
For the first time ever, a Green presidential ticket will appear on the North Carolina ballot! We are thrilled to report that on July 11, retired Teamster and lifelong Green activist Howie Hawkins was nominated by the Green Party of the United States as its 2020 candidate for president. Hawkins was nominated after receiving a majority of votes in the first round of voting at the party’s national convention, where he received 210 out of 355 total votes (59.15%) cast by Green delegates from across the US. A call to approve Angela Walker, a truck driver from South Carolina, as the vice-presidential nominee was approved by a majority vote of 221. In their acceptance speeches, the nominees highlighted the connection between climate change and social justice and the importance of enacting a real Green New Deal.

We are pleased to announce the North Carolina Green Party Spring Gathering
This year, due to COVID-19, we are holding our first virtual Spring Gathering using Zoom. This gathering is both our annual business meeting and our presidential nominating convention for 2020. The gathering will be broken into two parts, a Business Meeting and a Discussion and Organizing Meeting:
1\. The Business Meeting will take place on Saturday, May 30, 2020 form 2:00 PM to 6:30 PM. This meeting is for members only.

Our special guest is Green Party presidential candidate front runner, Howie Hawkins.
If joining or rejoining the NCGP, please do so 24 hours in advance (by Friday, May 29 by 2:00 PM). This is to give us time to have an updated list of members at the time of the meeting. An agenda and other information will be provided prior to the meeting. Please remember that a criteria for membership requires that you are currently registered as a Green. If you are unable to register to vote due to various state disenfranchisement but want to be an NCGP member, please contact [[URL REDACTED]]

Dear Friend,
Please check out these news and updates from the North Carolina Green Party:
### North Carolina Green Party’s First Presidential Primary March 3
Thanks to all of our Green voters who showed up to vote Green on Super Tuesday, or during early voting!
For the first time ever, the North Carolina Green Party (NCGP) held a state-run presidential primary to apportion delegates to the national Green Party's Presidential Nominating Convention, to be held this July in Detroit. Green Party candidate Howie Hawkins, co-founder of the national Green Party and the first US candidate to run on a Green New Deal in 2010, won with 67% of the vote! Howie is committed to independent working-class politics for a democratic, socialist, and ecological society. North Carolina’s four delegates to the Green Party of the United States (GPUS) convention will be elected at our Spring/Summer Gathering and carry their votes to Detroit on July 11.

### Charlotte Greens Stand Up Against Duke Energy
Charlotte Area Greens joined other local activist groups to protest Duke Energy’s proposed 6.7% rate hike hearing held by the NC Utilities Commission January 26 in Charlotte. Over 70 people showed up for the hearing and dozens of protesters gathered outside for a press conference. Charlotte Greens were at the front of the crowd, and the event was covered by major local TV and radio stations.
Duke Energy is proposing to raise its rates to force its captive ratepayers to cover the cost of state-mandated cleanup of coal ash contamination from Duke's dirty energy plants. The NCGP is calling for an end to Duke’s monopoly power—make them clean up their mess, and bring our energy grid under public control.

### NCGP Adapts to COVID-19 Outbreak
In light of the need to limit personal contact to avoid the spread of COVID-19, the NCGP Coordinating Committee has decided to move our Spring/Summer Gathering to an online venue via video-conferencing.
The NCGP will be releasing a statement about the impact of the virus on North Carolina, and what the pandemic has revealed about public health response under intensely neoliberal capitalism, with continued privatization of the healthcare system, the concomitant underfunding of public resources, and the lack of hospital beds. One obvious problem is that a universal healthcare system would have removed the need to find funding for the millions of uninsured and underinsured citizens that will come into contact with the virus. The Hawkins campaign has developed a vision for a universal healthcare plan that is worth your attention: Medicare for All as a Community-Controlled National Health Service.
### Upcoming Statewide and National Meetings
Planning has just begun for our statewide Spring/Summer Gathering, which will be scheduled for sometime in May or June. As noted above, due to the need to limit personal contact to avoid the spread of the COVID-19 virus, the NCGP Coordinating Committee voted to move the venue to an online format. This will be an important meeting, and all members are encouraged to attend. We will be electing delegates to the Green Party's Presidential Nominating Convention, among other business—details will be forthcoming at least three weeks in advance of the gathering.
The GPUS Presidential Nominating Convention is scheduled to be held at Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan, July 9–12. However, this venue may be changed to an online format depending on the development of the COVID-19 crisis. Registration is now open at [[URL REDACTED]] National meetings are a great place to find out more about what other state parties are doing, attend workshops, and meet face-to-face with Greens you may have only met online. Minority scholarships and some travel funding may be available.

NC Green Party,ncgp@ncgreenparty.emailnb.com,Vote in the NC Green Party Presidential Primary!,"North Carolina Green Party
Greetings, Friend:
DON'T FORGET TO VOTE!
Early voting ends Saturday, February 29. The MARCH 3, 2020, presidential primary in North Carolina is this Tuesday. This is a historic moment for all of us who seek revolution for people and planet and who recognize that there are no real solutions from the corporate parties—for the first time ever, the North Carolina Green Party has a candidate running for president as a Green in the primary race for our party’s nomination!
We encourage all registered Greens to GET OUT AND VOTE for our candidate, HOWIE HAWKINS, to demonstrate your support for independent left politics in this state.
Howie Hawkins is a co-founder of the Green Party of the United States and a longtime Green candidate from New York. From the start, Howie has been committed to independent working-class politics for a democratic, socialist, and ecological society. He was the first candidate to run on a fully developed Green New Deal in 2010, combining an Economic Bill of Rights to jobs, income, housing, health care, and education with 100% clean energy by 2030 in order to reconstruct the economy for economic justice and climate safety. Howie has been a constant organizer in peace, justice, union, and environmental campaigns.
Hawkins is the only Green presidential candidate who has met the requirements to be recognized by the North Carolina Green Party.
Since Howie is the only candidate on the ballot, why is it important to vote? Because we believe it is critical to show the citizens of North Carolina that our voters feel strongly about exercising their rights as registered Greens. If every registered Green in North Carolina requests a ballot, it will send a clear signal to the leaders of the dominant parties that we are serious about participating, as Greens, in electoral politics in this state, and that we value our ballot-access status. The duopoly party leaders will think twice about passing new laws that disenfranchise Green voters.
Thank you for your support!

## “Why the Democrats Are a Dead End for People of Color” Event with Angela Walker
Register for the Zoom event: Wednesday, September 2, 8:00–9:30 p.m.
Join Green Party / Socialist Party 2020 candidate for vice president, Angela Walker, and a panel of other organizers as we discuss how both parties of Wall Street have proven time and time again over the last century that they’re a dead-end trap for People of Color and for any substantial change toward our collective survival.
For decades the Democrats have faked left and moved right. They talk about inclusion to get our votes and then they consistently betray us. This is because the Democrats and Republicans are owned by big business nationally and corporate developer money locally and have no intention on changing that. They rule us by buying our political misleadership class, by scaring us away from alternative options, and by keeping us afraid of our own power. But they will never include us in decision-making and certainly never give us power. This is slavery by another means: we need freedom!
This two-party capitalist system is destroying our planet and our communities. We need truly revolutionary change to stop it! In order to fight for real revolutionary change we must organize independently of Wall Street corporate bosses and big-money grants and donors. Register for the Zoom event: Wednesday, September 2, 8:00–9:30 p.m.

The North Carolina Green Party and the Northern Piedmont Chapter of the Socialist Party-USA invite you to join our study group on the writings of revolutionary authors and their contributions to the practice of freeing ourselves from the forces of ecocide, genocide, poverty, war, and imperialism.
Our goal is to develop a better understanding of how we should act in response to these forces, building on the work of those who have trod these paths before us. Collectively, we face both problems that have been charted historically and new problems that arise from the ravages and crises of capitalism and its effects in our time.
Our first work will be Frantz Fanon’s Wretched of the Earth. Please register for the Zoom meeting at this link. In this work, Fanon addresses the psychological and physical effects of colonization on the indigenous inhabitants of colonized areas and the response of the colonized peoples to these effects.
Using Fanon’s description of struggle for self-determination in French-controlled Algeria, we’ll explore what the indigenous of Algeria felt during this struggle and if Fanon's insights can be extended to the struggles of humanity today to achieve a better life for all. Specifically, what practices were engaged in to achieve independence for the people of Algeria? Are those practices relevant to current struggles? What new practices might be deduced from the history of African colonial struggles? Register for the Zoom event: Thursday, September 3, 8:30–10:00 p.m.

## Better Ballot NC Ranked-Choice Voting Effort
A new group, Better Ballot North Carolina, has formed in North Carolina to pursue the implementation of Ranked-Choice Voting in our state. You are invited to the statewide launch September 12. Ranked-Choice Voting, which has different counting methods for different types of elections (e.g. multi-candidate single-winner or multi-candidate multi-winner races) allows voters to rank their candidates in order of preference. The value of RCV is that it eliminates the argument that a voter’s true preference must be sacrificed in favor of an undesirable but ""lesser-evil"" candidate. With RCV, if the voter’s first choice does not win in the first round of vote tabulation, or even if the choice is eliminated in the first round, the voter’s second choice then transfers to that candidate, who has lost nothing by being a second choice.
Better Ballot North Carolina is composed of members from a number of different organizations and political proclivities, including North Carolina Greens. Registered in NC as a nonprofit, the group’s goal is to educate North Carolinians about the value of Ranked-Choice Voting in offering more candidates with diverse views and ideas. Visit the group at [[URL REDACTED]], and sign up to attend the statewide launch meeting on September 12.

North Carolina Green Party to Sanders Supporters: Help Us Build Political Power Independent of the Capitalist Parties
April 12, 2020
Friend:
With the news that Bernie Sanders suspended his campaign for the Democratic Party nomination for president, our hearts go out to our friends and the millions of Bernie supporters who invested so much of their time, passion, and funds over the last several years to fight for economic and social equity and justice, Medicare for All, and a Green New Deal.
Please keep your fire burning and break from the corporate two-party system that continues to fail us over and over again! No more lesser of two evils. We, the North Carolina Green Party, invite you to stand with us and demand an actual democracy that represents all of us. Now more than ever, we’re reaching out to all of you to help us build a better world.
We believe that this current COVID-19 pandemic, which has affected every one of us, clearly reveals how poorly suited capitalism is in responding to crises. In particular, it exposes the weaknesses of our for-profit healthcare system and the way the US treats its working class and poor. On March 25, the NC Green Party published its Response to COVID-19, which includes actions we believe must be taken.
In the Green Party you will find like-minded people already engaged in this work; you’ll find a party determined to take on this corrupt system. We are not and have never been corporate-funded or organized by big moneyed interests. We are the definition of grassroots.
Our Mission:
The North Carolina Green Party is an anti-racist, feminist political party that supports gender equality and gender diversity. We reject capitalism in favor of a democratically run economy that responds to the needs of community and planet.
We believe positive social and political change will come when progressive and radical people determine that movement activism must also include this critical element: building our own political power outside the confines of the capitalist two-party system. For this reason, the North Carolina Green Party is a membership-based, dues-paying party and is fundamentally and structurally different from the two major parties—we’re funded by individual working-class members, not corporate interests and the ruling elite.
Joining the Green Party is a revolutionary act. United, we will be an undeniable force in the continuing revolution for people, planet, and peace! Join us!
In Solidarity,
The North Carolina Green Party

For almost a century the Democrats have consistently faked left and moved right. They talk about inclusion to get our votes and then they consistently betray us. This is because the Democrats and Republicans are owned by big business nationally and corporate developer money locally and have no intention on changing that. They rule us by buying our political mis-leadership class, by scaring us away from alternative options, and by keeping us afraid of our own power. But they will never include us in decision-making and certainly never give us power. This is slavery by another means: we need freedom!

NC Green Party,ncgp@ncgreenparty.emailnb.com,NC Green Party Response to COVID-19,"NC Green Party
Dear Friend:
The outbreak of the specific coronavirus strain now working its way through the US has exposed many weaknesses in the US healthcare system, and in the way the US treats its working class and poor. As the Democratic and Republican parties argue over helping the 1% versus the rest of the country, the North Carolina Green Party recommends that both federal and state governments undertake the following actions to ensure that working class families and the poor, including the homeless, have a chance to emerge unscathed, both physically and financially, from the impact of COVID-19.
1. Stop evictions and foreclosures. During this crisis it is essential for health and safety that foreclosures and evictions be immediately halted. Further, we call for the following:
* The federal government should use this period to address the real estate bubble that has been created anew after the 2008 financial crash. Property that is overvalued or over-leveraged by debt puts home ownership out of reach for many. At the same time, large investors such as Blackstone, which used the 2008 crash to buy billions of dollars worth of property at dirt-cheap prices, are now squeezing consumers in the rental markets. These investors and speculators, should be dispossessed of their properties, largely rentals, and those properties offered by the government to first-time homebuyers.
* There are many properties sitting empty. Regardless of the reason for the vacancy, there is no excuse for homelessness while there is shelter available. Run down properties can be refurbished (creating jobs), while acceptable properties can be made available to homeless people. No one should be allowed to place property rights over the safety and well-being of unsheltered people.
2. Stop automobile repossessions and invest in mass transit projects. People need transportation for essential purposes, such as obtaining food and medicine, or seeking medical care.
* Even though people need them in the current environment, the automobile creates many problems in the world. Purporting to offer unparalleled personal choice, we have designed our society around cars, and thrown more efficient, less polluting mass transit out the window. Efforts to develop mass transit in the US are thwarted by various interest groups who place their interests above all else. We need social solutions that provide the poor and working class with transportation options and reduce pollution. All government entities should take this opportunity to imagine new structures that move us toward less pollution and cleaner air and water, with zero dependence on fossil fuels.
3. Stop all utility cutoffs, including the internet. Loss of water limits the ability to maintain sanitation. Loss of power means the inability to refrigerate or freeze food, maintain heat and conduct a normal life. Access to the internet is essential for education, employment and staying connected to friends, family, community services and healthcare providers. There is no excuse for power, water or other shutoffs during the outbreak.
* The largest power companies in the US, as well as companies claiming ownership of water, are not acting in the real interest of the public. Pollution from coal ash and fracked gas, inadequate maintenance on power lines, reluctance and obfuscation over solar power implementation, and maintaining high rates to pay back investors have made private power companies predators of the working class and the poor. Stop energy for profit. Socialize the major power utilities and start administering them for the public benefit, not the portfolios of shareholders. This action should be the beginning of a transition to 100% clean renewable energy by 2030. If we miss this chance to address the equally frightening impending disaster of a collapsed ecosystem, then a new shock will be forced upon the US and the world that will make COVID-19 seem insignificant.
* We need a broadband public works construction program providing fiber optic updates and Free Broadband so all residents can communicate with loved ones, seek employment and stay globally connected. In a time when telecommuting has quickly become a necessity, this is not infrastructure development that can be delayed.
4. Stop the actions of bill and debt collectors and cancel student loan debt. Bill and debt collection agencies often skirt the line between legal and illegal behavior.
* As before the 2008 financial crash, too much of the US economy is borne on consumer debt. Families facing loss of employment and difficulty meeting basic survival needs don’t need to hear from aggressive and bullying collection agents.
* A particularly pernicious sector that threatens the future of many Americans is educational debt, now at $1.6T and a recognized burden on the economy. Allowing generations of people graduating into a hollowed economy to be forced to spend a significant portion of their life paying student loans, whose benefits will often never materialize, is ensuring that a large and relatively young sector of society will never be able to fully participate in any future economic success or realize much of their personal dreams. Stop the debt payments now and forgive the debts. Stop allowing banks to make student loans at exorbitant rates that can never be realistically handled by most borrowers. And put an end to financing loans for the rapacious and predatory for-profit colleges, which are a natural home for con artists and grifters.
5. Make unemployment benefits available immediately. Unemployment benefits must be paid immediately and without condition. Further, when the crisis is over, companies should not be allowed to use the epidemic and closures as an excuse to trim their workforce.
* All barriers to the quick and immediate distribution of unemployment benefits should be removed by the state.
* It is time for the nation to look at the nature of employment, especially in large companies that depend on squeezing labor for profit. Despite business lobbyists' claim that 80% of businesses offer some form of paid leave, millions of workers in the service industry, retail, groceries and restaurants do not have this benefit. These are some of the biggest employers in the US, and have escaped offering paid sick or emergency leave. At the same time, data from a 2016 report suggests that the federal government spends $17B a year subsidizing low-wage employers, which is a subsidy to the restaurant industry, especially the fast-food sector, and the service industry in general. These subsidies shore up profits for CEOs, boards, and shareholders and thereby only benefit a small segment of the public while condemning millions of low wage insecure workers to misery. Even in industries where pay is better, employee safety may be sacrificed for profit saving measures.
* We believe that this nation needs to move away from for-profit organized companies to an economy largely based on worker owned cooperatives and socialized industry.
6. Use federal and state resources to take care of under-served communities and homeless persons. As this crisis progresses, communities will lack sufficient equipment, facilities and personnel to respond to more than a handful of cases. Extra health care personnel should be hired and equipped to provide additional support and field hospitals will have to be established. Special care should be taken to make sure that rural areas have everything necessary to meet the immediate need imposed by this virus.
* Emergency mass production of millions of free home COVID-19 test kits, respirators and ventilators manufactured by employees earning a living wage.
* Much of the problem faced by the public today as COVID-19 drills deeper into the medical and economic life of the US, is that we do not have a robust national health care system. Instead, we rely on private insurers to determine what level of care we will receive, assuming we can afford it. The idea that we cannot have a national health care system should be the first victim of the virus. At the beginning of the outbreak, we were engaged in a debate on who should pay for testing, and how insurers would handle co-pays and deductibles. Some states have responded appropriately by telling insurers that they must pay during the epidemic. North Carolina should follow suit. But if Medicare-for-All or a similar national healthcare program were in place, no time would have been wasted on that issue at all. In a public health emergency, like a pandemic, the federal government would simply have provided the testing. Everybody in, nobody out. Let’s use this time to establish and mobilize an emergency national health program focusing on Coronavirus and related care. This emergency program should be expanded to shift permanently from a for-profit health care system to a socialised National Improved Medicare for All that includes all major and preventative care, including eye and dental care and an emergency health card for all residents, with employment offered to insurance industry employees. See for example, the Hawkins Health Care Plan, at [[URL REDACTED]] Pandemic preparedness is only one of many reasons why a national health care plan is needed.
7. Immediate change in federal spending priorities in response to the pandemic.
* Both the federal government and the state governments should realize that the currently inadequate response to the epidemic and the need for emergency measures to protect workers is the result of decades of purposeful neglect of the function of government. While we have cut taxes on the wealthy and on corporations, we have underfunded public health and education. While we wage wars of opportunity abroad and maintain a military that consumes more resources than the next seven highest spending nations, we charge outrageous tuition for colleges, maintain the largest prison population in the world and have high levels of poverty relative to the rest of the developed world. We should:
1. Withdraw all troops from overseas operations. Shut all foreign military bases, and begin retraining armed forces and veterans in a massive renewable public works program.
2. Stop all deportations and detentions immediately. ICE operations across the US should be suspended indefinitely. Sequestering populations of people in jails and detention centers will only create another incubator for the virus.
3. Undo the massive tax breaks for the 1% and corporations. This is in addition to halting taxes taken from Social Security and increasing the monthly individual cash award Congress proposes from $1000 to $3000 for people making less than $80,000 per year (approximately $5T). There should be no talk of “affordability”. The US has spent trillions more than this on failed and ongoing wars. It’s time to start helping US citizens, not just banks, arms dealers, and stock traders. The stimulus package announced today does not come close to what is needed.
8. Rethink the safety and security of the US food supply. The US government has since the 1960s presided over a massive concentration of the food production and distribution in the hands of a relatively small number of companies. This has been accompanied by an increase in environmentally harmful farming practices, factory meat farms, suppression of prices by large buyers that in turn requires agricultural price supports, and an emphasis on exports. This has created multiple insecurities in food supplies - underpaid farmers, dependence of the food supply on long-distance, polluting transportation and dependence on labor intensive canning and packing operations that can be disrupted by workers becoming ill. Much as we need a decentralized and more robust energy grid, the US should plan to decentralize food production and delivery. Bigger is not better when it breaks down, it just means more people are affected.
9. Do not allow the epidemic to be used to curtail or remove civil liberties. Predictably, the federal Department of Justice has asked Congress to consider weakening constitutional protections as part of a response to the epidemic in the US. Requested changes include the right to detain arrested persons without a trial, with the argument being that in an emergency a judge might not be available to handle pre-trial arguments. Another change would deny asylum seekers that test positive for the new coronavirus the right to be considered for asylum. None of this is necessary, and is intended to see how far DoJ can push the Patriot Act weakened walls of constitutional protection in law enforcement and government emergency. Coronavirus or no, all of our basic rights must be preserved in full. It is tempting in times of emergency, and especially now, to limit movement and freedom to assemble, which is foundational to the right to petition for redress of grievances from local, state and federal governments. Following this impulse to its logical conclusion would lead to a police state that cannot necessarily be dismantled.

I. NCGP HAWKINS/WALKER VOLUNTEER MEETING WEDNESDAY NIGHT (Tonight!)
WHAT: Weekly NC Green Party Hawkins/Walker Campaign Statewide Volunteer Zoom Meeting
WHEN: Wednesday Sep. 30 @ 8:00 p.m. (and every Wednesday afterwards through election week!) Once you sign up for this zoom you will be automatically registered for future Wed Zooms and any future updates about time changes/etc!
WHERE: Weekly Zoom Video Conference. Please register in advance for this meeting.
REGISTER FOR VOLUNTEER ZOOM CALLS
(Never used Zoom before? It's FREE and easy to download. To watch the Zoom call you need to download the Zoom app at [[URL REDACTED]] Here is a 1-minute video on how to join a Zoom call.)
Did you catch the empty politics and political charade played by candidates and corporate media alike last night? If anyone wasn't certain that our futures are not safe in the hands of politicians from either podium who are only there to serve their own interests and the interests of the rich and to defeat any meaningful progress for people and planet.. that was on full display during last night's debates!
Last week, we had a great turn-out for our Statewide Hawkins/Walker Volunteer Zoom Call! Dozens of volunteers attended from every corner of the state! We will have notes available at the Zoom tonight for anyone that missed it!
Our first meeting was so successful that we will decided to have weekly Zoom calls every Weds evening. They should typically be at 8PM!
If you cannot attend but still want to volunteer, you can let us know by signing up at [[URL REDACTED]]
Let's get out the vote for Green Party candidates Howie Hawkins and Angela Walker! It is critical to all Green Party supporters who want our candidates to succeed to be present at our organizing meeting or to sign up to volunteer! Why? The only way to ensure automatic ballot access through 2024 for the NCGP is for our candidates Howie Hawkins and Angela Walker to win at least 2% of the votes for president in 2020.
Our target voters certainly “stealing” votes from anyone—they are people who want something different and have no faith in continuing the same failed strategies; they're people who are fed up with our undemocratic electoral system. Break the two party
The past two federal elections have cost more than eleven billion dollars. Unlike the corporate political mafias that rule our elections, offer empty politics and call themselves parties, the NCGP is a real member-driven party.
We will be earning our votes, and we are confident that a large percentage of potential voters are our base. Our base includes people who are fed up with our rigged elections and people who are fed up with corporate politicians who serve rich donors and Wall St. lobbyists and war profiteers. Our base also includes people who are less than enthusiastic about voting for politics-as-usual and for politicians who betray their platform. None of our most urgent problems will be significantly addressed by either a President Biden or a President Trump. The same corporate media that viciously attacked attempts by Sanders supporters to pull the Democrats toward even mild reforms is using these fear tactics and virtual blackouts of independent candidates. This tells us what we already know: that we need to stand even stronger for what we want, and that's real change!
II. DONATE TO OUR 2020 NCGP CAMPAIGN DRIVE!
DONATE TODAY!
We're fundraising to get out the vote for the Howie Hawkins and Angela Walker presidential ticket in North Carolina and to increase NC Green Party registration! Our goal: win at least 2% of the vote for Hawkins/Walker in our state. Two percent means the NCGP automatically retains its ballot line for 4 more years to run Green candidates. Otherwise we may lose ballot access for several months or longer, and we will be required to collect tens of thousands of petition signatures.
Donate now to help us organize for H20—and to build the North Carolina Green Party. The two major parties have utterly failed the people and the planet. Help us build our own political power independent of the two capitalist parties!
Your donation will be used for:
* Increasing voter registration and candidate interest for 2020–2024.
* Sending out mailers to statewide registered Greens.
* More signage and getting signs to volunteers in every town—rural as well as larger cities!
* Door hangers and other important materials for Get Out the Vote and membership-building efforts.

# Hi ,
Trump has built his presidency on division, fear, and hate.
That’s all we’ve had for four years… just more division, fear, and hate.
Meanwhile, the Democrats have shown that they’re either unable or unwilling to take Trump head-on for the liar and coward that he is.
Instead, they bicker and argue while making hollow promises to voters like you about how they will represent your interests and not that of corporate lobbyists.
It has to stop!
I hope that you have seen the work that this campaign has been putting in to EARN your donations and vote.
Unlike the Republicans or Democrats, we don’t expect you to flock to empty promises, and we appreciate your help in this fight to transform America into a country that looks after the people and the
planet.
You shouldn’t have to come to candidates.
Candidates should come to you.
That’s why I’m asking you to make a donation to this campaign today.
We’re not pandering to millionaires and billionaires. With an average donation of $27, we’re more interested in earning the assistance from those who need a Green option the most.
You are our secret weapon in this campaign and your donation makes all the difference in our fight for an Ecosocialist Green New Deal that will give much-needed help to the millions of people just like you.
Can I count on your help?
Click the link below to make a donation and help us bring an end to the establishment’s games!
Our average donation is $27, but we are so appreciative of anything that you can contribute!
In solidarity,

our campaign, and have YOUR questions answered!

Howie Hawkins and Angela Walker, candidates for the Green Party nomination for president and vice president
# Hi ,
You've surely heard the news by now that yesterday, presumptive Democratic Party nominee, Joe Biden, settled on former California attorney general and US Senator, Kamala Harris, as his running mate.
Are they serious?
Our VP candidate, Angela Walker, tweeted yesterday that, ""two months into massive uprisings in EVERY American city, Joe Biden's VP pick makes it abundantly clear he isn't listening to the electorate. You still think you can push him further left?""
Angela is exactly right, and this underscores why she and Howie Hawkins are running today. Progressive voters need a choice that won't have them holding their noses at the ballot box, and we need to build something that belongs to US, not to corporate funders or the private prisons industry.
How do we build? We've said from the beginning that ballot access is the key. With ballot access, state parties can more easily put Green candidates on every line on the ballot, to challenge neoliberal policies like the ones Biden and Harris championed their whole careers, from our school boards to our city councils and state [[URL REDACTED]] the way to Congress.
You know we've been fighting on the ground for ballot access, and we've had some stunning victories recently. Now we are on the ballot in Washington, Arkansas, New Jersey. We turned in more than enough petitions in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.
But now Democrats are trying to claw back our victories. There have been legal challenges filed to invalidate the thousands of signatures we successfully submitted in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. A judge just ruled in favor of the Democrats' complaint in Montana too, knocking the Green Party off the ballot again.
We are still deep in petitioning season, but now we have the added burden of having to fundraise to protect our ballot lines via a legal defense.
We need your help. Can you donate today to ensure we have enough resources to protect our Green Party ballot lines?
If the Green Party is not on the ballot, there will be no one to tell the truth about how ingrained is the Democratic ticket with the private prisons industry.
No other campaign will be advocating for Medicare for All and a sound pandemic and economic relief that we all need to address the very real corona depression happening right now.
No other campaign will be working toward ending the new nuclear arms race that threatens our very existence.
No other campaign will be fighting to end climate meltdown, which is the primary existential threat we face today.
Help us protect the Green Party's gains and to build for the future. Please make a donation of any size today.
In solidarity,
## Team Howie
P.S.: We're still in our matching funds period, until August 24. Every dollar you donate will be matched 1:1 by the federal government until then, so donate now to double your money.

# Hi ,
By the way, we just want to express sympathy for everyone who had to suffer through the debate…
To be blunt, it was a fraud and there was no serious debate to be had.
Let’s be honest, does anyone actually think that this represents the American people?
Just imagine how it would have gone if there were more than just Biden and Trump on that stage.
If the Green Party was given fair representation, not only would there have been a voice on that stage talking about the Green New Deal, taking action against climate change, and Medicare 4 All…
… There would have been someone to call both CLOWNS out on their childish behavior, racism, and lies.
It’s time to get Greens on the debate stage! Make a donation today to help us in our fight to Open The Debates!
We’re having the most critical election in our nation’s history and the Commission on Presidential Debates is happy to keep third parties out of the conversation and give us two grown men acting like bickering children.
As Howie mentioned on Twitter:
We know some people are thinking it’s too late to get Greens in on the conversation, but the truth is that there’s not been a better time!
People are furious about what they saw in the debate. Our website got so much traffic after the debate that the server crashed!
So don’t let anyone try to tell you that this campaign is a “wasted vote.”
People are waking up. They’re tired of the establishment parties’ circuses and want REAL solutions to their REAL problems.
They're also thirsty to hear more about these real solutions. Howie's response to the debate was, hands down, the MOST watched live stream we have ever put out. You can watch it on YouTube here.
Howie and Angela have those solutions and are fighting tooth and nail to talk about the Ecosocialist Green New Deal on the national stage.
With your help, we can do it.
Make a donation today (recommended $27) to the ONLY campaign fighting for Medicare 4 All, calling for a Green New Deal, and calling out racists for what they are!
We know things are tough right now, but we can’t stop the fight.
We need to know that we can count on you to make a donation and help us drive this home.
Just look at the debate. Did it seem like either of them was ready to roll up their sleeves and do the hard work required to save our country?
It’s not too late. With your help, we can keep fighting to open these debates and get a REAL conversation going about how to actually help the people of this nation.
Make a donation (average $27) today to end ""politics as usual"" and help the only honest, people-first campaign on the ballot that's fighting FOR you!
It’s time for the people to rise up and demand the change that we need.
And remember:

Green New Deal-er
How are you holding up, ?
Who would have thought that in the world's only remaining superpower, COVID-19 infections and deaths are now accelerating faster than any country on Earth.
They constantly tell us that people love their health insurance plans, yet if we're each being honest, what really causes the most worry about the pandemic is not so much the illness itself, but not being able to seek treatment because the co-pays and deductibles are too high.
The President of the United States has become probably the greatest source of misinformation about COVID-19, more than even the worst clickbait websites. Trump is insisting that we all get back to work and die for the Dow, without bothering to ensure that we have enough masks; sanitizing protocols; a test, trace, and quarantine program to protect us from the infected; or even hospital beds or ventilators, in case the worst happens.
As Howie Hawkins said today in his latest campaign update, Trump is killing us.
And Joe Biden? After being completely silent for weeks, he issued a plan that essentially piggy-backs off what state governors are already doing. There's no protection for renters or single-family home mortgagees. The plan calls for just 14 days of paid sick leave and later talks about making the economy resilient, not communities or people, but the economy.
And don't forget that Biden doesn't believe in Medicare for All, at a time when it's clear that public health care is outperforming privately-administered health care like we have here in the United States. Biden's plan keeps talking about ""coverage,"" or Democrat-speak for increasing for-profit health insurance's stranglehold on our human right to be healthy. Joe Biden's health care plan simply does not cover everyone.
Worse, Biden's plan will cost $58 trillion over the next ten years, or $6 trillion more than the status quo in public and private spending. Under Biden’s plan, bureaucratic waste and profits for health insurance and drug companies will be deducted from spending on actual health care on problems like COVID-19.
This sort of dangerous cluelessness spells trouble for the American people. But Howie's plan would save money in many ways, via:
* Simplified billing to a single public payer.
* Collective power to negotiate lower drug prices.
* Elimination of shareholder profits and excessive executive compensation.
* A uniform electronic health records system to more efficiently provide care.
* A uniform claims data system to reduce fraud.
* Global hospital budgets instead of fee-for-service payments that incentive wasteful unnecessary procedures and prescriptions to maximize income.
But if Howie's campaign doesn't put up a strong fight for our right to health care, no one else will. That's why we need your help. Can we count on your donation today?
Consider how far every cent of your donation goes. With just $25, we can make 50 phone calls. With $50 we can buy internet ads for two days to push our platform forward. With $100 we can pay an online organizer at least 4 hours to grow our base. With any amount, we can pay for legal fees for the ballot access court fights we are facing even now.
We can't trust either capitalist candidate to demand what we need: a fully-funded national health service, so that we're ready for the next wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Please help with your donation today.
In solidarity,
## Team Howie

# Hi ,
Did you watch tonight's debate?
Howie made commentary with his observations on tonight's live stream, which you can watch here.
The arm wrestling over ""socialized medicine,"" over fracking and over belligerence with China and Russia is precisely why progressives are looking elsewhere for the solutions that will solve the problems they face today.
This is why we need to get in front of as many voters as possible. If the media won't cover this campaign, we have to talk to voters directly.
Jill Stein agrees.
So we're still working hard at reaching our goal of making 7 million phone calls to voters all across the country. But it takes resources, and we need your help.
Can you chip in $27 (our average donation) tonight to ensure we can reach voters and speak to them directly?

# Hi ,
51 years ago in New York City’s Greenwich Village, police were conducting one of their common raids of gay bars in the area.
In 1969, homosexuality was still illegal in nearly every state. Bars and restaurants could get shut down for having LGBTQIA employees or serving LGBTQIA patrons. Drag queens and transgender patrons were particularly singled out as New York City also labeled “masquerading” as a member of the opposite sex as a crime.
So when these police raided the Stonewall Inn, it could have been seen as “business as usual.”
But something incredible happened…
The people rose up together and fought back. The police were forced to retreat and lock themselves inside the Stonewall Inn while the patrons continued to rise up in a powerful demonstration. It is
especially important to note that this uprising and the wave of Gay Rights activism that followed was particularly championed by two transgender women of color, Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera.
When we talk about Pride, we are commemorating those LGBTQIA people who fought (and still fight) for equal rights. That is why, 51 years later, we refuse to forget what happened at the Stonewall Inn.
These people had asked for equality over and over but were being ignored by a system that simply did not care about them. So they did the only thing that they could: they united and rose up together.
The LGBTQIA community is not interested in asking permission to exist. They are not asking permission to be treated equally.
History has shown that asking permission still gives all of the power to the oppressor.
In the year 2020, we are tired of centuries of inequality. Whether it’s inequality based on race, sexual orientation, gender identity, or anything else, we are DEMANDING complete and total equality.
Anything less is a violation of human rights.
This campaign is about the ability of people to come together to create solutions that benefit us all. We recognize that the change that the masses are hoping for is not going to come from a corrupt, two-party system.
We aren’t just campaigning for reform. We are campaigning for revolution and an EcoSocialist Green New Deal.
The revolution has just begun. Will you donate to our campaign to take our country back from the oppressors?
With an average donation to our campaign of $27, we are working to implement solutions that work for us all and not just the 1%.

Green New Deal-er
Hi ,
The coronavirus crisis has changed our lives dramatically. My heart goes out to people around the world who are sick and struggling to get proper health care. I feel for all whose lives are being turned upside down because they are losing their jobs, income, and access to the necessities of life.
This crisis has exposed the gaping holes in the US healthcare system. Tens of millions are uninsured or are under-insured by substandard plans that they cannot afford to use. Our healthcare workers are needlessly at greater risk because of the shortages of test kits, personal protective equipment, ventilators, and hospital beds.
Trump, the real estate heir who found a way to go bankrupt owning casinos, cannot figure out how to use his federal powers to organize the production and supply chains to get healthcare resources where they are needed. But he did manage to gut infectious disease control and public health protection programs before the pandemic hit.
The health care gap between the richest and poorest Americans is now here for all to see as the rich and famous receive quick testing while the rest of us struggle to get tested, even those of us who are symptomatic. The health care gap is part of 45 years of steadily growing economic inequality that has shortened working-class life expectancy due to increasing “deaths of despair.”
Joe Biden, the centrist with no solutions, is now the likely Democratic Party presidential nominee, and the bombardment of the ""blue no matter who"" message is already loud. My presidential campaign is the alternative that lifts up real solutions like Medicare for All, an Economic Bill of Rights to end economic inequality, a full-strength Green New Deal to confront the climate crisis, and Nuclear Disarmament Initiatives to reverse the new nuclear arms race. I’m running to put those solutions front and center in the national debate all the way through the November election and beyond.
If the Green Party presidential ticket is not in the 2020 presidential debate, no one will be talking about real solutions to these pressing problems. Now more than ever, we must build a strong, mass-based independent party of the working class and of all people who love peace, freedom, justice, and the environment.
But I need your support to keep up the struggle for these policies that will dramatically improve all our lives. Can you help with a donation today?
With your contribution, you will receive my ebook, The Case for an Independent Left Party: From the Bottom Up. It is an argument for why and how we can unite at the grassroots across race, gender, occupational, and issue lines into a major party and force in American politics for a democratic and ecological socialism.
Our campaign is closing in on our goal of qualifying for federal primary matching funds. Every dollar you contribute, up to $250 per individual, will be doubled when we qualify. Please make a contribution today.

# Hi ,
Let's get straight to the point.
Thanks to the work and contributions from people like you, our campaign has achieved federal primary matching funds status.
So what does that mean?
In short, all donations made to this campaign will be matched by the federal government.
This is huge news that is almost impossible to overstate!
We needed 20 states to raise $5,000 in increments of up to $250 per individual. Virginia became the 20th state to meet this threshold today and our campaign is now over the top!
But why stop there?
All of the donations that we receive through August 27 will now be matched.
This means more ability to petition for ballot access (which is particularly costly). It means more ability to invest in growing our grassroots campaign across the nation.
Most importantly, it means that we are that much closer to creating the positive changes that the working class and the environment need.
If you make a donation (average of $27) to our campaign today, your donation will be DOUBLED by the federal government at no extra cost to you!
Some people may think that the issues that we are talking about and the solutions that we are offering are “pie in the sky.”
But we have over 4,000 donors and over 7,000 donations that prove that this is the real deal. With your help, we’ve raised almost $220,000.
That’s 220,000 reasons that this will be the most successful campaign by a third-party in history. That’s 220,000 reasons that we are going to take our country back from the fascism of Trump and his cronies.
We aren’t slowing down and we are going to keep swinging no matter what.
It’s because of you. You have shown that you have our backs and that you are just as sick of this administration’s nonsense as we are.
So we want to ask you a favor.
Will you continue to donate to our campaign?
The clock is ticking and we have to strike while the iron is hot. Right now, whatever you donate will be matched. A $50 donation, for example, becomes a $100 donation.
Can we count on your donation (average of $27) today as we take this fight all the way to Trump’s doorstep?
It is truly an honor to have you with us.

# Hi ,
I want to keep this quick and to the point.
We have less than a week to get on the ballot in Arkansas, Wisconsin, Kansas, Nebraska and Pennsylvania.
This is a very expensive and very time-consuming process to get past the laws, regulations, and general red tape involved in getting on the election ballot.
People in these states won’t even have the option of voting Green if we can’t raise the funds necessary to get on the ballots.
It’s an ambitious goal and it’s certainly hard work, but we know that we can count on you to help us cut through the red tape and give people in these states a choice that will ACTUALLY benefit them.
The only way that we take this fight all the way to the top is if everyone works together and contributes.
We have less than a week to raise the funds necessary to get on these ballots.
It is with hat in hand that we ask you to make a donation to the campaign today. We cannot afford to neglect our friends and allies in these states!
Make a donation now to ensure that EVERYONE has the option to vote Green!
“We need system change, not business as usual.”
In solidarity,

# Hi ,
It’s getting down to the wire.
We are fighting day and night for you. Voters like you all over the country are seeing just how important the Ecosocialist Green New Deal is to improving their lives. This campaign is gaining speed and the establishment CANNOT ignore us if we qualify for matching funds.
The reality of it is this:
Campaigns are expensive.
This is especially true for non-establishment parties. As we still experience the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, it has forced us to have to challenge signature-gathering requirements in court so that we can make sure that we are on state ballots.
The brass tacks come down to this:
* Washington needs 1,000 signatures by July 25, which will cost $3,000
* Arkansas needs 1000 signatures by August 3, which will cost $3,000
* Kansas needs 5000 signatures by August 3, which will cost $15,000
* Nebraska needs 2500 signatures by August 3, which will cost $7,500
* Minnesota needs 2,000 signatures by August 18, which will cost $6,000
This is exactly why we need to hire petition gatherers NOW. If we’re going to make this happen, we need your help to raise the money TODAY.
We’ve qualified for matching funds which means that the federal government will double all of the fundraisings that we have done since this campaign began. If we’re going to get an Ecosocialist Green
New Deal (and we will!), this is how we do it.
Every donation that we have received in YOUR STATE will be matched up to $250!
With your help, we have come so far. We truly couldn’t do it without you.
It is YOUR support and donations that have made this possible and it is your continued support that will get us on EVERY ballot across the nation!
We want to be real with you.
Times are uncertain right now. They are shaky and it’s only natural to be scared right now.
2020 has brought a global pandemic, increasingly severe effects of climate change, a President who is actively waging war against American citizens, and more.
With so much going on, I know that requesting your donation is a big ask.
But if this isn’t the perfect time to bring Green values to the national stage, what is?
The two-party system is leaving us, the working class, out of the entire political process. They have shown that they don’t care about our needs.
It has to stop.
With our campaign being so close to reaching our goal, every donation means the difference between creating the changes that have been needed for some time in your state or workers resigning
themselves to yet another four more years of neglect and, frankly, abuse.
We’re in the eleventh hour, friend.
If we don’t do this now, will we ever get this chance again?
The average donation to our campaign is $27, but we are so appreciative of anything that you are able to contribute to this cause.
Remember: NEVER SETTLE!

Howie Hawkins and Angela Walker, candidates for the Green Party nomination for president and vice president
# Hi ,
It’s hard to paint a clearer picture of what it means to be “lost in the sauce” than the circus of a convention that the Republicans had.
Even still… it’s kind of hard to find the words that really describe that nonsense.
When so many of Trump’s speakers were his own family singing his praises on the lawn of the White House (supposedly the People’s House) to the largely-unmasked crowd, it made it abundantly clear how Trump views his position as some kind of dynasty.
As the crowd cheered, he continued to double, triple, and quadruple down on his racism, xenophobia, sexism, and other hyper-conservative stances.
Meanwhile, we’re still digging in our heels and pushing back against the BROKEN ballot access system to make sure that everyone has the option to vote Green in their state.
Not only are we trying to get on the ballot in the last few remaining states, but we’re also having to play defense to protect our place on the ballot in states likes Wisconsin and Pennsylvania and Montana where the Democrats are trying to have us removed from the ballot.
Our average donation is $27, but anything that you can donate makes all the difference!
It can’t be stressed enough:
For the Green Party, every state is a battleground.
If we people don’t have the option to vote Green, there’s no true Left candidate to vote for.
We all want to defeat Trump. But HOW you vote against Trump matters.
A Green vote is the strongest anti-Trump vote. Biden and Trump both oppose a Green New Deal, Medicare for All, an end to endless wars, and the list goes on and on.
The Green Party is your chance to escape the bipartisan hamster wheel and vote for what you actually want. This is the most legitimate way to resist Trump at the ballot box, and voting Green is where we make our stand.
As Howie always says, ""don't get lost in the sauce. Vote for what you want and make the politicians come to you.""
But it all has to start with individual donors like you.
Your donation is what helps us mobilize to mount an effective field organizing strategy and oppose the voter suppression in the form of challenging our ballot access petitions in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Montana.
Donate now to bring an end to voter suppression!
Remember: Never Settle!

Hi ,
In his famous book, Capital, Karl Marx drew the connection between capitalism and vampires. He wrote that capitalism “only lives sucking living labor and lives the more, the more labor it sucks.”
Look around you.
The vampires of the top 1% continue to feed and are allowed to do so without hesitation or restraint.
They feed off of the workers and, in return, offer wages that are well below the ever-increasing cost of living.
They feed off of the planet with endless drilling for oil and perpetual wars. In the midst of a full-blown climate crisis, they refuse to admit their fault in causing irreversible damage to our planet.
They adamantly fight against a system that provides healthcare for all as they continue to put profits over the value of life.
Just like the vampires in legends, the 1% will not stop feeding until all that is left of their victim is a dry husk.
But there is some good news!
You see, the vampires of legend had specific rules that they had to abide by and certain traits that would reveal their true nature. When the townspeople knew these rules and traits, they were able to protect themselves from the vampires.
Consider this:
Vampires could only enter a home if they were invited in.
The capitalist system exists by being built on the back of workers. Workers are taught and trained to keep their heads down and be thankful for what they are given.
In this way, workers continue to invite the current vampiric system into our homes by not demanding accountability and fairness. We allow politicians to compromise our needs to the point that what we DO get is nothing close to what we told the politicians we need.
Drawing a line in the sand and demanding that corporations pay their fair share of taxes, demanding Medicare for all, and demanding a living wage is the first step towards keeping the vampires away.
They had no reflection when they looked into a mirror.
It is almost impossible to believe the level of blatant hypocrisy that is being normalized.
We have an administration that lies constantly. Then the administration lies about lying only to then lie about lying about lying.
Donald Trump disbanded the White House pandemic office only to later deny his involvement as COVID-19 spread across the country. He dedicated his time to spreading dangerous misinformation about the virus. Meanwhile, hard-working people finding themselves with no income have had no choice but to watch in horror as the bills begin to pile up even higher and they are receiving no aid from the system that is supposed to protect them.
Trump claimed in 2016 that he would be working so hard for the people that he wouldn’t have time to play golf. However, he has spent over 2300 hours golfing at the expense of the taxpayers. This golf tab is at over $133,000,000 and it continues to rise.
How much of a hypocrite does someone have to be to be incapable of seeing their reflection in a mirror? Anybody else would be ashamed of what they see.
They had the supernatural ability to charm others.
The Trump administration’s incompetence will go down in history as one of the darkest times in our nation’s history. They have wasted no time in finding ways to continue to support corporate interests at the expense of the working class. The disregard for our people, our allies, and our planet is enough to make someone sick.
But so many people still insist on voting against their own interests by supporting him. It is as if these people are under a spell that prevents them from seeing how little this administration cares about them and just how much worse the problems are becoming.
We need people to stop making excuses for the man who is dedicating every moment of his presidency to undermining the needs of the people.
Garlic would drive a vampire away and protect the wearer.
Apparently, there isn’t garlic in a Big Mac.
But in all seriousness…
We are not going to succeed by attempting to reason with this vampire of a system.
It can’t be done.
The only way that the working class is going to have their needs met is with an Ecosocialist Green New Deal. We cannot continue to allow our people and our planet to be victimized by a parasitic system that doesn’t care about the 99%.
Together, we can drive a stake through the heart of this system.
We're calling on you to help us.
Every donation to this campaign gets us closer to qualifying for matching funds from the FEC.
With that, we want to ask you…
Will you donate $27 to stop the greatest threat of our time and make the Ecosocialist Green New Deal a reality?
Make the choice for a Green future by clicking here to donate now!
Thank you for all of your support. Together we can #BuildToWin!
In solidarity,
## Team Howie

# Hi ,
For months now, I’ve been calling out Trump and challenging him to a debate.
Each time, it’s the same thing…
…silence…
Is he chicken?
And speaking of being chicken, it’s pretty obvious that we can’t count on the media to give us fair exposure. Anything that goes against the two-party system (and actually makes progress in the lives of the working class) just gets left on the cutting room floor.
But we have something that the others don’t:
We have YOU!
History has proven that nothing can stop us when we stand united against the kind of corruption that is literally killing us.
Maybe that’s why Trump and the mainstream media are too chicken to have actual debates and coverage of what’s really happening.
People are coming together to reclaim the political process.
As we refuse to compromise your wellbeing and continue to fight for a better tomorrow, I just have one favor to ask of you.
Can I count on you to make a donation to our campaign today?
Without media exposure, we rely on your contribution to keep gaining momentum in our fight. Your donation goes directly to organizing our efforts on the ground so that we can continue to come to voters (and not the other way around!) to earn their support.
It’s going to every single one of us pitching in to work.
Click the link below to make a donation and help us fight the establishment with an Ecosocialist Green
New Deal!
Our average donation is $27, but we are so appreciative of anything that you can contribute!
P.S. Donald, that debate challenge is still standing… You chicken?

# Hi ,
Are you ready?
Howie and Angela are going live on YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Periscope and Twitch this evening (8 pm EDT) and are going to be answering YOUR questions. You aren’t going to want to miss this!
This will be the NINTH livestream Q&A! Can you believe it?
We can all agree that there are a colossal number of major issues in this country that need to be fixed, but let’s be honest…
With everything going on in the world right now, a lot of people just don’t have the energy to hear or read long lists of issues and proposals to fix them.
We get it.
That’s why these livestreams are so important to us and the campaign. It lets us get DIRECTLY to answering the questions that YOU care about the most.
Be sure to set a reminder on YouTube so that you can join us!
We take questions from the chat, but we also answer questions that were sent in advance!
If you aren’t able to join us live, you can still submit a question through the campaign website!
This is a campaign that is being run for and by the working class. These conversations are important to make sure that we’re focusing on what matters most to you.
There’s never been a campaign like this. We are hyper-focused on fixing this country from the bottom up and we are not compromising on the needs of the people.
With Trump spending every waking moment finding new ways to try to turn us against each other and the Democrats refusing to work WITH Progressives instead of against them, this is the time for us to rise up together as a unified party and take our country back from the corrupt politicians who got us into this mess.
It’s been a hard-fought journey, but we are glad to have you alongside us! Your support is what enables us to keep fighting to protect the interests of the millions of people that the two-party system seems to
have forgotten about.
Unfortunately, this raises a major question: how are we going to keep funding this campaign?
We rely on your donation to keep our momentum in fighting back against Trump and the corporate-owned two-party system.
The average donation to our campaign is $27, but we are so appreciative of anything that you are able to contribute to this cause.
Thank you so much for everything that you do and we look forward to seeing you when we go live!

# Hi ,
On this past Monday, Howie Hawkins appeared on a livestream where he was joined by special guests Kymone Freeman and Will Merrifield, to discuss the national housing crisis, which has been all but ignored in the presidential debates thus far.
Kymone Freeman is an award-winning playwright, a 2010 Green For All Fellow, and the co-founder of We Act Radio (which the Washington City Paper named as DC’s Best Social Justice Radio Station in 2017)!
Will Merrifield is a housing attorney and at-large candidate for DC city council. He is calling for social housing and a Green New Deal for DC while he is running on a platform of human rights and solutions to
the problems created by a lack of affordable housing.
You can watch the replay of this livestream program here.
Both Will and Howie are working toward an expansion of low-income housing, to solve the problem of affordability to decent housing.
These sorts of solutions, including the housing section of the Green New Deal, are the ideas that won't get put onto the public debate if Greens are not on the ballot.
We still have some time before Election Day to get our word out to people who still haven't voted early. Many are still on the fence, and the way to get to them about these solutions is to call or text them. But this takes resources, and we need your help.
Make a donation today by clicking here. Our average donation is $27, but we are so appreciative of anything that you are able to contribute!
Looking forward to interacting with you today at 3:00pm EDT!
And remember:
#NeverSettle

We have a very aggressive goal of reaching at least 7 million people by phone before Election Day. Can you help by signing up to make calls or texts?
The mainstream media is trying to disappear this campaign, so please help get the word out by sharing our content on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and YouTube.

# Hi ,
So… we need to talk about some facts.
Fact #1:
For most people, math isn’t fun. But it’s important to do the math and see just how the numbers truly are.
(Oh, speaking of math…)
We have qualified for Matching Funds status which means that anything that you donate to our campaign is MATCHED. Your $25 donation becomes $50 for the campaign at no extra cost to you!
Fact #2:
$238 an hour.
That’s the hourly rate that you would have had to get paid to earn a billion dollars by the end of this year.
Of course, that assumes that you started working the year 1 AD and worked the “typical” 2,080 hours per year.
Over the average American lifespan, assuming that you went to work the same day that you were born and were finished on the day that you die, you would earn just under $39 million. If you started working at 18 and retire just over the average retirement age at 64, that number drops to $22.7 million.
Oh… yeah…
That’s also assuming that you never spend a penny of that money.
That’s just ONE billion dollars.
Fact #3:
Jeff Bezos was getting that much in just over a week last year. This year, he’s doing even better.
With a net worth of $150 BILLION, the average American would have to work for over 3 million years without spending anything to earn that kind of money.
Fact #4:
It’s past time for the billionaire giants like Bezos to pay their fair share.
So, while math may not be fun, we can see exactly how the numbers fall. Which of course leads us to our next fact…
Fact #5:
Too often, people criticize ideas like the Ecosocialist Green New Deal with the question “How do you expect to pay for that?”
We pay for it by holding the billionaires accountable for paying progressive tax rates, cutting tax loopholes and military spending, creating ecological taxes, and nationalizing the biggest banks (while capitalizing local and state public banks.)
The Ecosocialist Green New Deal and getting this campaign on every ballot in every state is not just some “pie in the sky” wishful thinking.
The numbers don’t lie!
Donate now to get actual WORKERS in the WHITE HOUSE
Fact #6:
We can only make this positive change happen with YOUR support.
We are taking this fight all the way to Donald Trump’s front door and are determined to bring an end to the duopoly that has exploited the working class for far too long.
With your help, we have qualified for matching funds. This means that every dollar that we receive from donors like you is MATCHED by the federal government.
But we won’t have matching funds status forever. We only have until August 27 to get these donations matched. More than ever, we are asking for your help today.
This is how we directly take this campaign to the big leagues and make sure that you are getting the representation that you deserve.
But it takes everyone doing their part for this to succeed and you have to be ready to take action.
We are proud that our average donation is $27. We aren’t selling out to the millionaires and billionaires who are always looking to “buy” movements that they can warp to line their own pockets.
We’re building an unstoppable campaign from the bottom up that is working day and night to make the changes that our country so desperately needs. But it only happens with a grassroots-funded and unified left.
It’s up to you now, friend. Will you donate to keep us in this race and help us reach “matching funds” status?
The average donation to our campaign is $27, but we are so appreciative of anything that you are able to contribute to this cause.
We are proud to stand with you.
In solidarity,
Team Howie

# Hi ,
The race is on to get enough votes to keep the Green Party on the ballot in various states, and we need to contact about 7 million voters to do it, with only one week left to do it.
What are the stakes? If state Green parties can't make their thresholds on Election Day, it means having to collect hundreds of thousands of signatures when ballot petitioning windows re-open next year. It translates to thousands and thousands of dollars in hiring petitioners, setting up systems, paying for gas and [[URL REDACTED]] can imagine how stark the situation is.
* New York needs about 200,000 votes to stay on the ballot.
* Massachusetts needs about 100,000 votes to keep its ballot line.
* Missouri needs about 57,000 votes.
* Oregon needs over 20,000 votes.
These are just a few of the states we need to work hard to hold the line, but also, there are many golden opportunities if we perform well:
If Howie and Angela get just 2% in Texas, the Green Party of Texas will be assured ballot access all the way to 2030.
If they get 5% of the vote in Minnesota, the Green Party of Minnesota will have a ballot line as a minor party.
The way this happens is if we talk to voters. To get to 5 percent of the national vote, which means that states would also achieve their vote thresholds, we need to convince about 7 million voters to vote for Howie and Angela.
We can do it via phone and texts and thereby extend the reach of canvassers on the ground, but it will take money to do it.
Can you kick in a donation today to help us reach our goal? Any amount will do, but most people give about $27.
With one week to go, we can ensure that more and more people are aware that there's still one campaign fighting for a Green New Deal, for Medicare for All, and for peace and justice. We can let them know that there IS a moral choice they can make, instead of simply staying home in disgust.
Please give what you can today.

Hi ,
It’s the 50th anniversary of Earth Day, and this year we find ourselves in the midst of the COVID-19 crisis.
If you’re paying attention to environmental news, now that many urban centers have been under stay-at-home orders, the earth is changing. Air pollution is receding because we’re no longer clogging up highways when we should be using public transportation instead. In fact, the world is on track to see a record 5 percent drop in carbon emissions.
The long-polluted, storied canals of Venice are actually clear for the first time in history.
It’s clear that capitalism’s effect of overconsumption and exploitation of workers and the planet has been put in check, and we finally have a good glimpse into what can be, if we only turn away from capitalism altogether.
And if we had had the kind of aggressive and smart environmental regulations needed to avert climate catastrophe in the first place, the kind that neither Democrats or Republicans will support beyond just lip service, this could have been normal.
The Ecosocialist Green New Deal our campaign advocates would not only provide for human needs within ecological limits, but it would also put people to work in restoring wetlands, forests and mangroves, reversing the damage of centuries of capitalist exploitation.
Conversion to an ecologically sustainable and just economy cannot happen under the capitalist system. Capitalism’s competitive structure drives blind, relentless growth that is consuming and destroying the biosphere. Its competitive international structure breeds wars for resources, markets, cheap labor, and geopolitical military advantages
We need an ecosocialist Green New Deal in order to coordinate the conversion of all production systems to sustainability. We need social ownership of key industries, like the energy sector. Exxon and the Koch Brothers are not going to reinvest their fossil fuel earnings in renewables. We must nationalize big oil. We need a bottom-up democratic process of economic planning so the public sector—public enterprises, infrastructure, and services—is responsive to the people in their communities.
We need a Just Transition to a green economy so that no one is harmed in the process and a restorative process to reverse and rectify the disportionate impact that working-class communities of color have suffered. The Green New Deal must include an Economic Bill of Rights that guarantees everyone a living-wage job, an income above poverty, decent housing, comprehensive health care, a good tuition-free public education from pre-K to college, and a secure retirement.
Let Earth Day 50 mark the day that we decide not to return to what was, and instead, let’s commit to building a new normal that works for all of us, not just the few. We need system change, not business as usual.

# Hi ,
Well, the Democrats have succeeded in knocking Howie and Angela off the ballot in two states: Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. In either case, it was based on bait-and-switch misinformation from the partisan hacks that run the elections offices that misled activists about the proper paperwork, which was then used to rule against us on technicalities in the courts.
It wasn't because we didn't do the work. We collected three times as many signatures as required in Wisconsin. We collected twice as many signatures as required in Wisconsin. In either case, each of our petitions stood up to scrutiny.
It's clear that people want to see the Green Party, especially Howie Hawkins and Angela Walker, on the ballot.
Because we know that what the Democrats and Republicans are offering is not good enough, we are drawing the line in the sand and declaring our political self-determination. We are demanding a sound Green New Deal, Medicare for All, economic relief during the pandemic and after it, peace initiatives and the end to the new nuclear arms race that could annihilate us [[URL REDACTED]] just the most vulnerable.
Our political self-determination is our demand that this system must respond to the increasingly loud voices coming from the working class. We demand system change, nothing less.
Let's be honest: these are legitimate setbacks. But in both Wisconsin and Pennsylvania (and other states), we'll be filed as write-in candidates, so that people who demand change will have a method to make those demands.
We won't take this lying down. We mourn for a moment, and now it's time to organize.
We will be pushing hard in these write-in campaigns, to ensure that the Green state parties of Wisconsin and Pennsylvania and others have a strong foothold to rebuild with an influx of new supporters. Our organizers are ready, and now they need your help to put resources in their hands.
We're launching an aggressive digital and phone/text campaign to state our case directly to the voters. But this is going to take serious resources.
Will you make a contribution today to ensure that we have the resources to fight back, and to fight in the courts later to ensure our write-in votes are counted?
Our objective of political self-determination continues today. We're inviting you to become part of this resistance against bipartisan hacks who actively and shamelessly impede democracy.
Let's fight back together. Please give what you can today.
In solidarity,

Howie Hawkins and Angela Walker, candidates for the Green Party nomination for president and vice president
# Hi ,
It’s hard to overstate the effect of voter suppression.
Every election, countless people are prevented from being able to cast their votes thanks to strict requirements, misinformation, and foul play.
As expected, we’re seeing evidence of this foul play all over the country.
There’s no low that Trump’s team won’t stoop to which means it’s up to all of us to stay alert and call out voter suppression when we see it.
A few key things to look out for (and what to do about them!):
Long lines
Make sure that you have confirmed where your polling location is by checking a trustworthy online source for your area. (If the site’s URL ends in .org or .gov, it’s likely trustworthy!)
Get there early! Lines in polling locations all over the country have been painfully long and some people are reporting that they’ve been in line for over 10 hours. If you get there early, you have better chances of getting in and out quickly!
Fake Ballot Drop Off Boxes
If you prefer to drop off your ballot, make sure that you are dropping it off at an official drop box. Just like checking for your local polling location, make sure that you’re finding the drop box location using a
trustworthy site ending in .gov or .org.
There have been numerous reports of fake “official” ballot drop boxes being set up by Republicans. If you want your vote to be counted, make sure that you are using your county’s actually-official drop-off location.
ID Requirements
Requirements to vote are different from state to state.
You don’t want to wait in a long line only to get to the front and learn that you don’t have something that your state requires for you to be able to vote!
To see what your state requires for voting, click here.
Intimidation and Bullying
“Stand back and stand by”
Trump hasn’t missed any opportunity to get his supporters riled up. Look out for signs of voter intimidation and don’t fall for their tactics.
This includes spreading false information about voting requirements, aggressively questioning people about their voting eligibility or choices, pretending to be election officials, and harassment.
If you see these intimidation and “poll watching” tactics, take action.
These tactics have a long history of being used to suppress minority votes in attempts to illegally sway elections.
A phone call to the Election Protection Hotline (866-687-8683) will get you in touch with a trained election protection volunteer. If you are being threatened with violence, call 911.
Let’s be real…
It is so sad that we are still having to raise awareness of issues like this. Voting should be a process that is meant to be quick and easy so that everyone is able to exercise their democratic right to vote.
Instead, we see these same tactics (many of which have deep roots in Jim Crow) being used today to suppress voters and rig our elections.
From the very beginning, we have been outspoken critics of the rigged voting process and the blatant suppression that is taken as “normal” by people all over this country.
As we continue to fight to open the polls and end voter suppression at every level, we can only continue this mission with your help.
Your donation today is what helps us continue to take action against these tactics and a mainstream media that is attempting to disappear our campaign.
With an average donation of just $27, this campaign has beat the odds in state after state as we continue to push for a society that is free from inequality and a true Ecosocialist Green New Deal.
With 2 weeks left in the campaign season, it’s down to the wire and we need your help now more than ever before.
Will you make a $27 donation TODAY to help us fight voter suppression and get our message out to the people who DESERVE a campaign that ACTUALLY fights FOR them?
And remember:
#NeverSettle

Happy May Day !
Green Party members will be joining with other working people’s organizations to commemorate International Workers Day this year online, given the social distancing we must practice in this coronavirus pandemic. What Greens can to bring to these events is an understanding of the connections between the Red and Green traditions of May Day.
The Red tradition of May Day emerged in the 1880s in the United States. The immediate impetus came from the Haymarket Massacre in 1886. On the night of May 4, 1886, 176 Chicago police attacked about 200 workers who remained after a day long demonstration for the 8-hour day. The police fired live ammunition, killing four and wounding 70. Somebody threw a stick of dynamite. Eight of the labor organizers where charged and convicted. Four of them were hung to death. One of the Haymarket martyrs, Albert Parsons, a white former confederate soldier married to Lucy Parsons, a former slave of African, Indian, and Mexican descent, said at this trial, “What is Socialism or Anarchism? Briefly stated it is the right of the toilers to the free and equal use of the tools of production and the right of the producers to their product.”
Lucy Parsons campaigned across the United States and Europe to have the workers movement commemorate May 1 as International Workers Day. Many workers’ organizations supported her call, including the American Federation of Labor, which then urged its adoption by the Second International of socialist parties. The first international May Day celebration in 1890 was a big success. The demonstrations worried the establishments across the world. After Coxey’s Army descended on May 1, 1894 in the first mass march on Washington, D.C. to demand public works spending to employ the unemployed in the midst of a severe depression, President Grover Cleveland got Congress to declare a federal Labor Day holiday in September in move designed to divide the labor movement.
This year, the parallels to that time are so stark, and it's crystal clear that it's not the rich that hold up the economy. It's us workers. Everything has ground to a halt, and now state governors of both capitalist parties are pretending that the pandemic isn't serious and are ushering us back to work. But now is the time to demand safer workplaces, living wages and [[URL REDACTED]] the basic respect that we deserve as workers.
Howie's comprehensive COVID-19 relief plan is calling for things like:
* Medicare to Pay for COVID-19 Testing and Treatment and All Emergency Health Care
* Defense Production Act to Rapidly Plan the Production and Distribution of Medical Supplies and a Universal Test, Contact Trace, and Quarantine Program to Safely Reopen the Economy
* An OSHA Temporary Standard to Provide Enforceable PPE Protection for Workers
* $2,000 a Month to All Adults Over Age 16 and $500 per Child
* Loans to All Businesses and Hospitals for Payroll and Fixed Overhead To Be Forgiven If All Workers Are Kept on Payroll
* Moratorium on Evictions, Foreclosures, and Utility Shutoffs
* Cancel Rent, Mortgage, and Utility Payments; Federal Government Pays Those Bills;
* High-income People Pay Taxes on this Relief
* Suspend Student Loan Payments with 0% Interest Accumulation
* Federal Universal Rent Control
If you feel this is a plan you can get behind, can you make a donation to Howie's campaign today?
This is a campaign about issues that matter most to the 99%. We are rallying progressives from all across this country to create an unstoppable movement that is THE party of the left.
We cannot settle for the watered-down pseudo-results that we are currently being fed. Lives are on the line.
We need an Economic Bill of Rights that guarantees income above poverty level, jobs, housing, Medicare for All, tuition-free education, and secure retirement.
With Ecosocialism, our country would be a world leader in ensuring the health and wellbeing of both our environment and our people.
In eternal solidarity,
## Team Howie

Howie Hawkins and Angela Walker, candidates for the Green Party nomination for president and vice president
# Hi ,
Big news! We have hit home runs in a few states, thanks to the sweat equity of Greens and allies on the ground petitioning for ballot access, fueled by you!
As of this week, we're officially on the ballot in Alaska and New Jersey. On Saturday, Washington petitioners and our campaign staffers beat 2016's signature total by a couple hundred. Now the Hawkins/Walker will be on the ballot in these three states, as well as others.
The response from people like you who have been taking action and supporting this movement has been truly amazing!
But remember:
Taking action is key.
We are rising up against a system that has spent its entire history exploiting the working class, suppressing the needs/rights of its people, and destroying the planet at a truly terrifying rate.
Speaking of suppression, we still have to work to do to even be on the ballot in several key states, all in the next few days:
* Arkansas needs 1000 signatures by August 3, which will cost $3,000
* Kansas needs 5000 signatures by August 3, which will cost $15,000
* Nebraska needs 2500 signatures by August 3, which will cost $7,500
* Tennessee needs nearly 300 signatures by August 4, which will cost $1,000
* Minnesota needs 2,000 signatures by August 18, which will cost $6,000
* Georgia needs 7,500 signatures by August 14, which will cost $22,500
* Arizona needs 38,000 by September 4, which will cost $114,000
Can you help us score home runs in these states with a donation today?
Without the costly process of petitioning for ballot access, people in these states (Nebraska, Arkansas, and Kansas and the rest) won’t even have the option to vote for us!
There is only one way that this campaign succeeds: we band together and mobilize as a united and independent Left that is unwaveringly dedicated to the wellbeing of people and the planet.
So make a federally-matched donation today to help us get on the ballots in these remaining states.
We only have matching funds status for another few weeks, so we absolutely have to take advantage of this momentum.
Thank you for standing with us!

# Hi ,
Well, we finally made the mainstream media, but while 2016 was all about slandering Stein/Baraka as Russian assets, this year it's that Howie and Angela are tools of the Republican Party that are denying people in Wisconsin their absentee ballots.
Nothing could be further from the truth. The Green Party's track record as being the party of election integrity is clear. We are the ones regularly pressing for integrity from elections authorities around the country. We are the ones pushing to replace bad voting machines with auditable paper ballots and ending voter suppression via racist voter ID laws and party suppression.
The simple solution in Wisconsin is for the Democrats to immediately stop playing games and using delaying tactics to prevent voters from being able to support third-party candidates, get new ballots printed that include Howie and Angela as a choice, and send them out. Both major parties collude to boost their own electoral chances in a myriad of ways and deny voters' and candidates' major rights.
So what exactly is happening in Wisconsin? Here's a quick run-down:
* When we realized that Angela Walker's change of address could become an issue, we took it upon ourselves to inform the Wisconsin Elections Commission.
* After three different sets of instructions over three days, the commission staff finally instructed us to include a notarized statement of candidacy with Angela's new address when we filed the [[URL REDACTED]] we completed to the letter.
* The state law only accepts a maximum of 4,000 signatures to be submitted for a minimum of 2,000 signatures needed to get on the ballot. We actually collected nearly 6,000. The staff of the Board of Elections found that more than 3,000 of the signatures were valid.
* A challenge was filed against our petitions, claiming that the change of address invalidated many of them, which conveniently brought us to below 2,000 signatures.
* None of the signatures were actually ruled invalid.
* We were summoned to a hearing with the Elections Commission, during which we were restricted from offering testimony that pointed out the breakdown in process from the commission staff. Our rights of due process were severely restricted by the chair of the commission, a Democrat appointee.
* The attorney representing the Democratic challenger huddled with the chair of the commission before the hearing to agree on how to restrict our testimony.
* The commission ended up being deadlocked on the validity of the signatures, which means that they are presumed to be valid.
* The commission did uphold the challenge to Angela's address.
* Because of these irregularities, we decided to sue. Because of the time constraints before absentee ballots were to be printed, we sued in the Wisconsin Supreme Court.
* It took time to find an attorney that would represent us, and every Democrat-aligned attorney we contacted ignored us.
* The Court ordered the Wisconsin Elections Commission to provide a list of everyone who has requested an absentee ballot, as well as a list of everyone who has actually received one. That list was due last Tuesday at 5 pm CDT.
* As of our last information, the Elections Commission was not able to provide those lists to the Court. They reported in the media that they were only able to find out information about some of the counties.
* Yesterday, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported that NO county has actually mailed out an absentee ballot.
The Democrats are telling the media that they've mailed out thousands of ballots, when really county elections officials printed mailing labels and count these as ""sent."" This is pure spin and a departure from the truth. They are waging a media battle against us to cover up their own failure to respect the democratic process and to ensure that accurate data was available on demand.
How can we trust that our elections will be fair, when the process is used as a soccer ball between the two ruling parties?
The delay is actually coming from the Democrats, not this campaign or the Green Party. If they would have allowed us to offer a proper testimony in the hearing, they would have been compelled to deny the challenge. If they would have accurate information on county elections data at their fingertips as they should have, there would be no delay.
Further, we have never had any conversations with the state GOP. They are not directing our legal actions. We are compelled by the wishes of nearly 6,000 Wisconsinites who want to see the Green Party on the ballot.
We will not back down from our position that Howie Hawkins and Angela Walker should be placed on the ballot without further delay. Our signatures are solid, the paperwork is in order, and in the interest of serving democracy, the Democrats should abandon the spin and misinformation and step aside so that absentee ballots can be sent out.

The Original
Green New Deal-er
# Hi ,
I hope you are safe, healthy, able to stay at home, and that your loved ones are safe and healthy, too. If you have a job, I hope it remains secure and that if you are going to work, you have the personal protective equipment and safety protocols you need.
With the onset of this COVID-19 virus, reforms that the Greens have been advocating for, like Medicare for All and a guaranteed income above poverty, have become all the more necessary. The coronavirus economic depression has already begun and we will need a full-strength Green New Deal to get out of it.
The crisis is laying bare the fact that capitalism cannot provide for the basic needs of all. It is profit-driven, not need-driven, and therefore has no reason to provide for and protect human life. The crisis has also laid bare the fact that the two-corporate-party government cannot solve our problems, even in this crisis, the most basic problems.
Trump says he wants to send us back to work, school, and public and religious services by Easter Sunday, even though the big liar has no power to make that happen. Biden seems to be hiding out at an undisclosed location.
The slow-moving Congress is finally the verge of passing at a relief package. But it is a rich man’s relief package that provides a generous bailout for big businesses who will not have to maintain payrolls, barebones relief for small businesses if they do maintain payrolls, and insufficient funds for unemployed workers, medical equipment, and state and local governments, which are going broke paying for emergency expenses that the federal government should.
Our first line of defense in this health and economic crisis is mutual aid. We need to take care of ourselves and each other.
We should follow the advice of the public health professionals:
Wash your hands: The COVID-19 virus has a fatty layer around it that just soap and warm water break down and prevent the virus from attaching to human cells. Of course hand sanitizer works, but in this period of shortage, you can take relief that plain soap and water will do the trick. Wash thoroughly, under nails and between fingers and on backs of hands, for at least 20 seconds.
Observe social distancing: China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, and Vietnam have been able to “flatten the curve,” or slow the rate of new virus infections, by either enforcing or strongly suggesting social distancing. Here in the United States, we can get the same effect with a little self-discipline, where possible. Let’s observe the advice to avoid large gatherings, stay in the house except for required work and errands to support life and safety, and keep the recommended six-foot social distancing from other people when out and about.
Use face masks when you’re sick: Face masks available to consumers are not very effective in blocking the intake of airborne pathogens, but they can be fairly effective in keeping you from spreading pathogens when you are sick. Here is a listing of how-to videos with some tips on how to make your own.
Strengthen social bonds with others around you: One of the ways capitalism undermines community is by atomizing us from one another. It fosters dependency on the individualized and commodified satisfaction of needs rather than collective responsibility for the satisfaction of many needs through cooperatives and public goods and services. With the public sector emaciated by decades of neoliberal austerity policies, it is a good time in this time of crisis to get to know your neighbors and find ways we can help each other make it through in the absence of the public sector we ought to have.
Build relationships with fellow co-workers: With much of the economy on lockdown, our notions of “essential personnel” have expanded. We are seeing workers objecting to the lack of protection for their health and safety at the workplace, like the sanitation workers in Pittsburgh, and chicken plant workers in Georgia. These actions are only possible where workers have built relationships with one another and are communicating. If you are still working, organize among your workmates to demand what you need for safety. We can all help workers by speaking out for the right of all workers—from non-unionized minimum wage workers to unionized workers with decent contracts—to healthy, safe workplaces. We can contribute to the strike funds of workers fighting for their safety.
## And what about our campaign?
Our campaign is also doing its part to stop the spread of the virus. We have suspended in-person petition-gathering. Instead, we are working with state Green parties to petition their governments to place the Green Party on the ballot—and to seek relief in court where state governments are not responsive. Visit our Ballot Access page to find out more.
The coronoa virus health and economic crises are exposing more than ever the utter failure of the Democrats and Republicans to solve our problems. A central goal of my campaign is to help build the Green Party into a major party and force in American politics. My campaign just released my ebook, The Case for an Independent Left Party: From the Bottom Up. Click here to read more about it.

Hi ,
As our movement continues to gain traction, we came to realize a few things:
1. The evidence speaks for itself. People have grown tired of having their needs ignored by a corrupt establishment and are rallying to the Green Party to help build a fair and sustainable future for our country.
2. The issues that our campaign is championing truly are the issues that resonate most with the American people. The support that we have received and the stories that you have shared with us only solidify that this movement towards an Ecosocialist Green New Deal is exactly what the country needs to navigate these trying times in our history.
3. It was time to announce a running mate for Vice President.
The ideal running mate had to be someone with experience on the front-lines of these issues. They had to be someone with the ability to communicate with language and conviction that others can understand and believe.
Fortunately, she answered the call!
We are pleased to announce that Howie’s first choice all along, Angela Walker, has accepted the invitation to be the Vice Presidential nominee of our 2020 campaign.
Angela Walker is a veteran working-class activist with decades of experience working for racial and economic justice in social movements, unions, and as an independent or third-party candidate. Angela already has experience running for vice president as the Socialist Party USA picked her as their vice-presidential candidate in 2016.
As a public transit bus driver and Legislative Director of her Amalgamated Transit Union (ATU) local in Milwaukee, Angela was in the middle of the Winter-Spring 2011 Wisconsin Uprising against Gov. Scott Walker’s union-busting attack on the collective bargaining of public employees. In the Fall of 2011, Angela played a leading role in Occupy Milwaukee and the Milwaukee chapter of Occupy the Hood, which sought to represent the interests of oppressed people and bring people of color into the Occupy Movement.
In 2014, Angela ran as an independent socialist for sheriff of Milwaukee County, Wisconsin. Her opponent was the incumbent David Clarke, the cowboy-hat-wearing conservative Fox News regular who had been appointed sheriff by a Republican governor and re-elected three times as a Democrat. Angela won 20% of the vote with the message that the best way to cut street crime and violence was to fight poverty and economic frustration with living wages, affordable housing, grocery stores in food desserts, and access to good health care and public transit. She pledged no cooperation with ICE on the detention of immigrants without court-ordered warrants.
When Howie reached out to Angela in Florence, South Carolina, where she now lives working as a dump truck driver, she said, “How could I not say yes to running? The Green Party is in a great position to amplify the people’s power, and we’ve got to encourage people to use their power. If not now, when?”
Howie had not planned on choosing a running mate until the Green Party convention in July because it did not seem appropriate before the nomination.
Plus, to be honest, making the announcement at the convention would be a good news hook for the media.
But the Ecosocialist movement is continuing to grow and we could not wait to bring Angela’s passion and contagious energy to the team. She is a champion of everything that we value and are campaigning for.
Angela has risen to every occasion and is dedicated to our goal of creating a just and thriving world that honors the needs of human beings and the life of the planet itself.
We are incredibly excited to have her with us!
Watch her on Howie’s Q&A #5 and don’t forget to subscribe to Howie’s channel so that you don’t miss any of the regular live streams where we are taking YOUR questions!
Click here to donate to the campaign today and receive your ebook download of The Case for an Independent Left Party.
Our fundraising comes from grassroots donations. Your donation matters and empowers us to continue to fight to be represented on every ballot in every state.
Be sure to also follow and support Angela on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram!
Thank you for standing with us!

Howie Hawkins and Angela Walker, candidates for the Green Party nomination for president and vice president
# Hi ,
It is always good to remind ourselves why we do the things that we do. In a time where our two-capitalist-party system has become more corrupt than ever, we look to the two fundamental goals that
guide this campaign to create a system that enables its people to have a voice.
Goal 1:
We are building the Green Party as an activist and viable opposition to the tyranny of corporate rule.
To do this, we have to get on the ballot. We still need to get on the ballot in several states:
* Washington needs 1,000 signatures by July 25, which will cost $3,000
* Arkansas needs 1000 signatures by August 3, which will cost $3,000
* Kansas needs 5000 signatures by August 3, which will cost $15,000
* Nebraska needs 2500 signatures by August 3, which will cost $7,500
We need to hire petition gatherers NOW to make this happen, and we need your help to raise the money TODAY.
Goal 2:
To put our ecosocialist program for real political and economic democracy, civil liberties, social justice, ecological sustainability, and peace on to the public agenda.
We have to be honest about these things. The American economy no longer works for the majority of Americans. Millions of families and communities have been left behind while a small group of
billionaires continues to exploit them.
This is exactly why we are humbly asking you to make a federally-matched donation now (recommended $27) and join our cause to create sustainable and responsible change through an Ecosocialist Green New Deal!
Opportunities for this majority of Americans are becoming rarer and rarer as our two-party system continues to ignore this reality. In the coming decade, this problem will only get worse.
It’s time for a party that works for the people and not against us.
Pulling from a lifetime of experience fighting for the rights of the working class, Howie decided to commit his thoughts into a book and wrote The Case for an Independent Left Party.
Our current political establishment has offered no reasonable solutions to the challenges facing families today. These challenges include climate change, rampant violations of human rights, a lack of
healthcare, endless war, and more.
The truth that the capitalist oligarchy does not want you to know is this:
We cannot solve the central problems of our time under a capitalist system.
Over 40% of Americans simply cannot afford an unexpected $400 bill. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to threaten the livelihoods of the working class and Trump doubles-down on his incompetent,
tone-deaf approach to handling this issue, it’s almost certain that this number has increased.
This campaign is about solving the greatest problems of our time by going straight to the source.
Our ask of you is a simple one –
Will you stand with Howie and his team against a broken system to build a new American economy that works for everyone from the bottom up?
Our fundraising comes from grassroots donations. Your donation matters and empowers us to continue to fight to be represented on every ballot in every state.
The time for talk has come and gone. Now is the time for taking massive action!
Thank you for standing with us!

Howie Hawkins and Angela Walker, candidates for the Green Party nomination for president and vice president
# Hi ,
We here at Team Howie just wanted to reach out to you and give you an update on the INCREDIBLE
news!
TWENTY THREE!
That’s right! Howie has won the last 23 Green Party primaries which means that he has won TWENTY THREE of the 25 primaries.
Even better, Howie has MORE THAN TRIPLE the delegates of his closest competition and has nearly 80 percent of the delegates needed to lock in the nomination.
TL;DR: IT’S HAPPENING! Howie is on the clear path to the Green Party nomination!
So now we’re shifting gears and the campaign is in better shape than ever!
We couldn’t do it without you. It is YOUR support and donations that have made this possible and it is your continued support that will get us on EVERY ballot across the nation!
As you probably know, Howie has announced Angela Walker as his running mate! This is a HUGE win for the campaign!
(Seriously! If you haven’t met Angela yet, you NEED to see just how contagious her passion is!)
Angela is a worker with a long history of impactful activism. As an independent socialist and official with the Amalgamated Transit Union in Milwaukee, she challenged Sheriff David Clarke (a right-wing Democrat) in 2014.
Two years later, Angela went on to become the Socialist Party USA’s candidate for Vice President in the 2016 election!
Like Howie, Angela is committed to uniting the left behind a unity ticket and reaching out to the millions of people just like you who feel abandoned by the corporate two-party system and are FED UP with the dismal candidates that the system produces.
These are people from all walks of life. We see workers, young people, people of color, LGBTQIA+, and so much more.
We aren’t accepting excuses and know that the corrupt system’s talk is as cheap as it comes.
Your voice WILL be heard!
Of course, this new stage of the game brings new challenges with it.
The COVID-19 pandemic and the shifting responses from state to state have added an extra dose of uncertainty to this year’s ballot access drive.
Our team is working tirelessly to get on EVERY ballot. This primarily means the painstaking process of challenging signature-gathering requirements in court.
But there’s yet another challenge that we are about to face…
The message is clear and the writing is on the wall.
Getting Howie and Angela on the ballot through court challenges requires a lot of investment.
Things are tougher in you and millions of Americans’ lives than they have ever been before. We know that requesting a donation is a big ask right now.
But we have to look at this honestly…
If we don’t do this now, will we get a chance this good ever again?
The average donation to our campaign is $27, but we are so appreciative of anything that you are able to contribute to this cause.
We have to strike now and we need your continued support to do it.
You see, we are SO CLOSE to qualifying for federal public matching funds. This is an absolute GAME CHANGER if we can hit the threshold.
Qualifying means that nearly all of the money that we have raised so far from the ENTIRE campaign will be DOUBLED.
That’s right! DOUBLED!
Every donation that we have received in every state will be matched up to $250!
For these ballot access fights, matching funds status is the winning ticket.
We can bring an end to Trump’s bumbling of the pandemic response and never-ending Twitter wars. No more of Biden’s hiding and Congress’ bailing out of corporations while leaving the workers to fend for themselves.
We have one shot. This is one of the most important moments in your life right now.
Will you stand with us and make your voice heard?
It’s become clearer than ever…
There is no alternative if we want to bring a stop to this madness.
We hope that you and your loved ones are staying safe and healthy.
Remember: NEVER SETTLE!
In solidarity,

Howie Hawkins and Angela Walker, candidates for the Green Party nomination for president and vice president
# Hi ,
It’s so nice to be able to reach out with good news and, I have to say, this is some of the most exciting news for us to share with you.
With this campaign’s recent victories in Michigan and the Lavender Caucus, Howie Hawkins and Angela Walker have secured enough delegates to be the Green Party’s nominees for President and Vice President for the 2020 election!
How can we thank you enough?
This campaign is a true grassroots movement that is seeking to create change in our country from the bottom up.
Without your help, this wouldn’t have been possible.
Every victory was thanks to you.
You helped share our message online.
You donated to keep our campaign rolling.
Some people may look at us like we’re crazy. To be honest, sometimes it kind of feels that way when we are taking on an entire corporate-owned political establishment.
But you have shown that you believe in Howie and Angela, and we will keep fighting to save our country and pass the Ecosocialist Green New Deal as soon as possible.
You helped us win THIRTY-ONE contests in the Green primaries. While we won’t be able to see you in-person for the Green Party’s Presidential Nominating Convention because of the COVID-19 pandemic, we do look forward to seeing you online as the convention is held July 11.
Make the choice for a Progressive future by clicking here to donate now!
So now the gloves are coming off and we have a clear path forward.
First, we are going to unite the Left and mobilize the most Progressive campaign in our nation’s history.
Then, we’re going to kick Trump out of office and thoroughly sanitize every single room of the White House.
With that done, we are going to push however hard it takes to pass the Ecosocialist Green New Deal and save our country.
We know that you’ve been in our corner and have been working hard to support this campaign. That work is so valuable to us and we know that your continued support makes the difference between a brighter Greener future and four more years of Trump’s incompetence.
We're honored to have you standing beside this campaign and are more appreciative of everything that you do than we could ever fully express.
Let’s do this!
Can Howie and Angela count on your donation to keep our campaign’s momentum going all the way to the White House?
Make a donation now (the average donation is $27) to show Trump that we aren’t playing.
In solidarity,

# Hi ,
As the fight for justice and an end to systemic discrimination continues, it is so important that we continue to call attention to the past and ongoing abuse of Native Americans.
Today should not be called Columbus Day and we should not celebrate the actions of a mass murderer.
This is exactly why we hope you will join us in instead calling this holiday “Indigenous Peoples Day” as we speak out against the continued exploitation of Indigenous People by governments and businesses who seek to gain profits by denying these people their basic human rights and cultural heritage (see Howie's and Angela's statement from today).
The neoliberal system is continuing to wage war against Indigenous Peoples around the world through land grabs, water privatization, and massively destructive resource extraction. These people are forced into poverty with extremely high rates of unemployment, cancer, and death by police.
With the COVID-19 pandemic, these communities have seen infection rates of 3.5 times the rest of the nation’s population.
Furthermore, the blatant suppression of Indigenous voters seeks to continue in Columbus’ tradition of silencing their voices.
Photo ID and postal address requirements, needlessly complex processes, and inaccessible locations for both mail-in and in-person voting are the tools being used to prevent these people from being heard.
So it is our hope that on this Indigenous Peoples Day you will take a stand to end the injustice against Indigenous People.
We are the only campaign that is presenting 100% sustainable energy solutions that stop the wholesale destruction of our planet and Indigenous lands.
We are the only campaign that is introducing an Economic Bill of Rights to guarantee an end to the poverty and illness being suffered by Indigenous People.
And we are the only campaign that is calling on the government to make reparations for the centuries of unfair and illegal treatment of Native Americans starting with the return of illegally-seized land.
Will you make a donation today as we continue to stand with Indigenous People in our fight for racial, economic, and climate justice?
Click here to make a donation TODAY! Our average donation is $27, but we are so appreciative of anything that you are able to contribute in this fight!
And remember:
#NeverSettle

Howie Hawkins and Angela Walker, candidates for the Green Party nomination for president and vice president
# Hi ,
First, we are overjoyed about sharing the news with you that yesterday, Howie Hawkins and Angela Walker won the Green Party nomination for president and vice president, with 59% of the convention vote, in a crowded field of 8 candidates.
Now, the focus turns ever more to the issues facing our country, and Howie and Angela are more than ready to step into the breach to put our progressive issues into the national debate.
There seems to be no shortage of corruption in our current system. Trump has failed to respond appropriately to any issue that has arisen. He has acted in the worst conceivable way at every turn and
proudly encouraged chaos, fighting, and the blatant abuse of the American people.
This is exactly why we are asking you to support our campaign to create a government that works for ALL OF US by making a donation (average of $27) to our campaign today.
It is so important in the wake of rampant Trump-ism that people support their values.
Because, let’s be clear:
If we all stand together, Trump’s days are numbered.
Supporting a campaign that is acting in accordance with your values and is addressing the issues that affect you (and millions like you) head-on is the greatest way to create a better tomorrow.
You deserve a campaign that EARNS your trust and has proven that they will always be there for you.
That is exactly what this about.
We don’t have the millionaire and billionaire backers that so routinely buy the highest position in our country. We aren’t for sale and are standing strong with you to repair the damage that Trump has done
to this country.
But we do have numbers. We have an entire class of people in this country that live and breathe the results of the current administration’s ignorance.
In short, we have you.
So, we're asking you to stand with us and say that “enough is enough.”
The clock is ticking, the stakes are rising, and your donation will be what makes or breaks this campaign.
Can we count on your donation (matched dollar-for-dollar by the federal government) today?

Tomorrow night, Election Night, we will be hosting a very special live stream with some very special guests: Jill Stein, Ajamu Baraka, Cheri Honkala, Margaret [[URL REDACTED]] well as social media personalities and Green candidates. The show starts at 7 pm EST (6 pm CST, 5 pm MST, 4 pm PST).
Please click here to subscribe to the YouTube version.
We'll also be streaming to Facebook, Twitter, Periscope and Twitch. Click on the social media icons above to lead you to these other portals.

We have volunteers making calls and sending out texts now. Can you help us finish strong with a donation tonight? This ensures we still have money to pay for these last calls.
Please give what you can.
We'll also be discussing what's next (hint: we're not going to stop fighting).
Will you join us on YouTube tomorrow night at 7 pm EST?
See you then!

# Hi ,
The private company known as the Commission on Presidential Debates is in a quandary now.
They have offered Trump and Biden a virtual debate, and now Trump refuses to participate.
Howie has said repeatedly, ""I'm ready to debate Trump and Biden, but I'm not sure they're ready to debate me. Any time, any place.""
Howie said today:
We have a feeling that Biden won't take Howie up on his offer.
But fortunately, tonight, at 8 pm Eastern (7 pm Central, 6 pm Mountain, 5 pm Pacific), you will have an opportunity to hear Howie put these issues on the table, whether the Democrats or Republicans are willing to hear them or not.
Tonight's debate is hosted by Free and Equal, and it will be streamed on Facebook. Click here to subscribe to the live stream.
We hope you can join Howie for this debate tonight at 8 pm Eastern.

# Hi ,
We just wanted to take a moment to see how you’re doing.
2020 has been a pretty intense year, so we understand if you’re feeling exhausted.
We’re all in this together and it’s going to take us looking out for each other if we’re going to make a difference.
And honestly, that’s at the heart of everything that this campaign is fighting for.
We need a system that isn’t ruling over the people, but that is made of people looking out for each other.
That means Medicare For All and community control of the police.
It means banding together to take on climate change and save our planet before it’s too late.
In short, it means an Ecosocialist Green New Deal.
In case you haven’t done it today (or even if you have), go ahead and take a deep breath.
2020 is almost over and we’ll be free to start fresh in 2021 before we know it.
So let’s start completely fresh.
I’m talking throwing out the two-party system that keeps making sure that we aren’t able to bring the issues that matter most to people to the national stage.
Let’s get rid of Trumpism, voter suppression, and militarized police forces being mobilized against the people they were sworn to protect.
We’ll do the heavy lifting on the front lines, but we just need some extra help from you to keep the pressure up.
That’s why we're asking you to please make a donation to our campaign today.
With your donation (recommended $27) today, we can make 2020 a thing of the past and secure a brighter (Greener!) future in 2021!
Let's get some Ecosocialism in 2021! Click here to donate now!
In solidarity,

# Hi ,
As empty political promises continue to blast from every possible news source, you can’t be blamed for sighing and shaking your head.
The character of the politician who will say anything to get elected and then, ultimately, not make good on any of their promises is so common that even satire of these people gets stale.
It’s not just irritating… it’s disgusting.
As a campaign of workers that refuses to be bought by anyone for any amount, we know that you are just as sick of the status quo as we are.
That’s why we aren’t just running for office; we’re running to completely overhaul the entire system so that it will benefit YOU!
Right now, our campaign staffers are on the ground with local Green activists and allies to petition in Pennsylvania, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. Soon we'll be on the ground in Iowa as well.
There is still so much work to be done and we still need to get on the ballot in several states:
* Tennessee needs nearly 300 signatures by August 4, which will cost $1,000
* Minnesota needs 2,000 signatures by August 18, which will cost $6,000
* Georgia needs 7,500 signatures by August 14, which will cost $22,500
* Iowa needs 1,500 signatures by August 14, which will cost $4,500
* Arizona needs 38,000 by September 4, which will cost $114,000
Can you help us score home runs in these states with a donation today?
This is the only campaign that is fighting tooth-and-nail for:
Medicare For All: Because you deserve to live a healthy life.
Green New Deal: Because you deserve a world that doesn’t look like a scene from Mad Max.
Economic Bill of Rights: Because your work has value and you should be paid accordingly.
Demilitarized Police: Because you should not be killed by police.
Ending Endless Wars: Because peace is how we move the entire world forward.
Make a donation now to the campaign that's willing to walk the walk and not just talk the talk!
“We need system change, not business as usual.”

# Hi ,
We’ve had some key victories since launching this campaign. A lot of victories, actually.
But the stakes have been raised. To get on the ballot in 50 states plus DC, there's a lot of work to be done.
* Washington needs 1,000 signatures by July 25, which will cost $3,000
* Arkansas needs 1000 signatures by August 3, which will cost $3,000
* Kansas needs 5000 signatures by August 3, which will cost $15,000
* Nebraska needs 2500 signatures by August 3, which will cost $7,500
* Minnesota needs 2,000 signatures by August 18, which will cost $6,000
I hope you will excuse how direct I’m being, but we have to keep our momentum if we are going to put Trump in his place.
You see, Trump knows that his days are numbered. He is going down in history as the most incompetent President to ever claim that title.
His arrogance won’t let him admit it, but the whole world sees that he’s scared.
He’s scared of the uprisings that are showing the world just how much power the PEOPLE have.
He’s scared of how much he’s dropping in his precious polls.
Most importantly, he’s scared that the Left is uniting and mobilizing to take our country back.
And we are.
With an average donation to our campaign of $27, we are reclaiming our country for the working class.
But one of the biggest problems with people like Donald Trump is that, when they get scared, they can be very difficult to “pin down.”
Trump and the Republicans have over $150 Million Cash-on-hand that they are directly preparing to burn to smother any competition.
Trump is spending MILLIONS of dollars on advertising with his platform of misinformation, smearing, and division.
To make things worse, he has restarted his precious rallies and is already stirring his supporters into a frenzy.
But we have already seen that his tactic can be completely dismantled when people come together as, evidenced by the dismal turnout to Trump’s rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma thanks to the coordination of users on TikTok.
But we're not here to be negative. There’s too much of that as it is.
So let’s talk about hope.
There is a brighter future ahead of us that will see us taking our country back from Trump and the entire corrupt establishment.
That’s why our campaign is making a commitment to YOU.
We aren’t going to settle and there is nothing that Trump can do that will make us stop fighting for an Ecosocialist Green New Deal.
We’ve put up with this for far too long.
It’s not about endless speculation and idle chit-chat. Maybe that was acceptable in the past, but we are in a perfect storm of crisis after crisis.
You have to get mad.
You have to take action.
We have a small window right now where donations to our campaign are matched by the federal government. Whatever you can spare, the government is going to match your contribution dollar-for-dollar.
We need to raise enough money that the media can’t silence us anymore. That’s the best opportunity to get someone face-to-face with Trump who is more than happy to tell him what the working class of this country REALLY thinks of his buffoonery.
Donate now (recommended $27) to fuel our efforts and help us secure a Green victory in November!
And if you want to lend your skills to this campaign, we ALWAYS need volunteers to help with this mission!
Sign up to volunteer here!
Remember: NEVER SETTLE!

Hi ,
If you thought Bernie Sanders was the only one facing the wolves this election season, let us inform you that he’s not.
It’s become pretty obvious that there’s all-out war against Bernie Sanders, and the DNC’s picks for the committees that will oversee nomination convention business certainly underscores this reality. And now with Barack Obama threatening to “go public” on his opposition to Sanders, you know the fix is in.
Last week in an open letter, Noam Chomsky, Barbara Ehrenreich, and other progressive luminaries insisted that Howie Hawkins and the Green Party vote Democrat for president in battleground states.
They condescendingly describe Green votes as a self-indulgent ""feel-good activity"" as if Green votes are not votes for urgent climate action, real social and economic justice policies, and peace policies.
Don't they see that the Democrats have joined the Republicans in supporting pro-corporate economic policies and pro-war foreign policies that have generated growing inequality at home and endless wars abroad?
As Howie said in his response to the open letter, “The left cannot outsource fighting the right to the Democrats.”
Howie points out that the Democrats have helped to normalize Trump by joining with him to overwhelmingly support military budget increases, the US Mexico Canada Trade Agreement (NAFTA 2.0), and the prosecution of Julian Assange and persecution of Chelsea Manning.
The Democrats don’t represent us. We need your help to ensure that Howie’s voice continues to represent our values of peace, people, and planet over profit. Can you help with a donation of $51 today?
We need 20 states to achieve the matching funds threshold to ensure our campaign has enough fuel to campaign and petition onto the ballot in all 50 states and DC. Many states are within $2,000 of reaching their threshold.
That’s why we’re asking for your donation today. Can you spare a dollar for each of the 50 states plus the future state of DC?
If we’re to campaign and petition onto the ballot in all 50 states and DC, we need to keep Howie on the campaign trail. Please make a donation today.
In solidarity,
Team Howie

# Hi ,
With more and more voters falling out of love with the two-party system, it can’t be stressed enough just how important this election is.
This is very likely the “once in a lifetime” opportunity to change how elections are done FOREVER.
No party is talking about the type of sweeping changes that have formed the backbone of this campaign from the very beginning.
Instead, they keep pandering to the same lukewarm interests with responses that are so canned you can’t help but wonder if THEY even believe what they’re saying.
This is the election that has the potential to bring an end to the corrupt two-party system!
But we need your help in this fight.
Your donations are what enable us to stay on the frontlines in our fight for open debates, Medicare For All, racial/economic equality, and an Ecosocialist Green New Deal.
Without your help, this once in a lifetime opportunity could pass us by.
We can’t let that happen.
Our country can’t take anymore of the “business as usual” politics that got us into this mess.
Just click the link below to make a donation and send a message loud and clear…
I'm donating to bring an end to Trump and the system that brought him to us!

# Hi ,
Let’s be honest…
What will you do if the worst case scenario happens and Trump is reelected?
Seeing this egomaniac’s behavior in his first term, one can only shudder at how he might act if he is given four more years in office.
He continues to rob the working class to fund the excessive lifestyles of his friends and himself.
He adamantly denies the existence of climate change despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary.
He turns police on nonviolent protestors so that he can emerge from hiding in his bunker for a photo-op while tweeting overtly racist content.
There has never been a president more unhinged, dangerous, and apathetic about the people of this country than Trump. We cannot stand four more years of this madman.
But is the best answer a moderate one?
The concept of voting for the lesser-evil has given us Joe “Shoot them in the legs” Biden.
Do you want to support someone who is content to straddle the fence to gain support or do you want someone who is not scared to take a stance and defend it?
Donate to the candidate who will proudly stand up for your rights and take Trump head-on!
There has never been a time where a third-party is more necessary than right now. We are pushing forward to realize the Ecosocialist Green New Deal that this country needs.
There is no more time for endless speculation about whether a third-party candidate is “viable” or not. If we unite the left of this country to take Trump on ourselves, you won’t need to figure out what your
plan is to survive another four years of Trump.
But you have to TAKE ACTION!
Bring an end to Trump by making a donation (average of $27) today.

Howie Hawkins 2020,mobilize@howiehawkins.us,COVID-19 Stimulus Package Not So Stimulating?,"View this email in your browser.
Howie Hawkins and Angela Walker, candidates for the Green Party nomination for president and vice president
# Hi ,
In the weeks following the initial lockdowns due to the COVID-19 coronavirus, it’s been a constant thought on the minds of people across the country:
“What am I going to do?”
We cannot allow this pandemic and the economic repercussions that come with it to be downplayed.
A one-time payout of $1200 is not enough.
In fact, if you are like most Americans, you watched that $1200 disappear even faster than it was deposited into your bank account. Even then, that is assuming that you even received your stimulus check.
We cannot downplay this emergency.
We are experiencing a coronavirus depression that is quickly becoming deeper and more dire than the Great Depression. As people look to our government for answers and aid, they are met with two things:
1. Radio silence from people like Joe Biden who refuse to step up and be leaders in this time of crisis.
2. Daily bad advice from an orange buffoon who believes that he knows more than the world’s top experts.
Meanwhile, the bills do not slow down while unemployment and small business failures soar. Furthermore, healthcare workers still lack the necessary PPE to safely perform their jobs as sickness and death due to the coronavirus continue to spread.
The answer, contrary to the claims of Donald Trump, is not injecting disinfectant or somehow shining ultraviolet radiation under our skin.
The answer lies in a new, fifth wave of support for Americans. These issues have already been brought up by some members of Congress, but they will not pass if we do not speak up.
We are fighting for:
* Medicare to Pay for COVID-19 Testing and Treatment and All Emergency Health Care
* Defense Production Act to Rapidly Plan the Production and Distribution of Medical Supplies and a Universal Test, Contact Trace, and Quarantine Program to Safely Reopen the Economy
* An OSHA Temporary Standard to Provide Enforceable PPE Protection for Workers
* $2,000 a Month to All Over Age 16 and $500 per Child
* Loans to All Businesses and Hospitals for Payroll and Fixed Overhead To Be Forgiven If All Workers Are Kept on Payroll
* Moratorium on Evictions, Foreclosures, and Utility Shutoffs
* Cancel Rent, Mortgage, and Utility Payments; Federal Government Pays Those Bills; High-income People Pay Taxes on this Relief
* Suspend Student Loan Payments with 0% Interest Accumulation
* Federal Universal Rent Control
* Aid to State and Local Governments Sufficient to Keep Essential Services Running
* Universal Mail-in Ballots for the 2020 General Election
Look…
Now isn’t the time for I-Told-You-So’s, but this pandemic is a vital wake-up call to action for things that we should have already been doing to protect our people and our climate well before the coronavirus hit.
This is why we absolutely need an Ecosocialist Green New Deal as soon as possible.
We cannot settle for the watered-down pseudo-results that we are currently being fed. Lives are on the line.
We need an Economic Bill of Rights that guarantees income above poverty level, jobs, housing, Medicare for All, tuition-free education, and secure retirement.
With Ecosocialism, our country would be a world leader in ensuring the health and wellbeing of both our environment and our people.
This is exactly why we are counting on your support as we continue our 2020 campaign.
This is a campaign about issues that matter most to the 99%. We are rallying progressives from all across this country to create an unstoppable movement that is THE party of the left.
We can do better than the choices of Donald “Childish Dummy” Trump and Joe “Asleep at the Wheel” Biden.
Make the choice for a progressive future by clicking here to donate now!
Together we will make the Green Party into an unstoppable force for good.
Let’s paint the polls Green!

# Hi ,
We wanted to check in and keep you up to date with our latest ballot access developments, because there's a role for you to play!
First, the good news. With your help, we turned in a large excess of signatures over the last few weeks in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Iowa and Minnesota. Since turning in petitions in Iowa on August 15, we have since learned that we're certified for the ballot.
Isn't that great news?
In Minnesota, we turned in nearly 5,000 signatures, and the state minimum was 2,000. We expect to get certified possibly next week.
In Wisconsin, we turned in about 4,000 signatures, but we collected nearly 6,000.
However...
Just before the clock ran out for challenges in Wisconsin, the Democrats filed a challenge on our petitions, saying that the address listed for Angela Walker was a false address.
They didn't seem to realize that Angela moved during the petitioning window, we disclosed the fact to the Elections Commission, and they told us to clear it up when filing the [[URL REDACTED]] we did.
Following the rules and adhering to instructions didn't seem to matter to the Elections Commission, because they were deadlocked on whether to put us on the ballot. The votes against putting us on the ballot came exclusively from the Democrats on the commission, who made broad insinuations that we were lying about Angela's address and didn't even allow us to introduce correcting information during the hearing.
If there was ever an example of political bigotry, that was it.
So now we're going to court. And here's where you come in.
As luck would have it, our matching funds window closes on Monday. That means that every donation, up to a cumulative $250, will be matched dollar for dollar by the federal government. So we're asking you to make a donation today to help cover these new legal fees.
We already have to raise money to cover the $15,000 retainer to defend our petitions in Pennsylvania. Now we have the new burden of defending our petitions in Wisconsin.
Can you make a contribution today, to ensure we have the resources to fight in court and ensure voters have more choices?
We are willing to fight every step of the way, to ensure that progressives can vote for Medicare 4 All, a Green New Deal, a sensible economic relief to the pandemic depression and an end to the new nuclear arms race.
Are you willing to take on this fight by our side? If so, please donate what you can today.
In solidarity,

Howie Hawkins and Angela Walker, candidates for the Green Party nomination for president and vice president
# Hi ,
Since the time that we turned in our petitions to get onto the Pennsylvania ballot, it has been a legal battle.
First, the Pennsylvania Democratic Party challenged our signatures line by line. But they had to drop that challenge.
Then, they challenged the candidate substitution paperwork that PA Greens submitted and managed to get Angela Walker knocked off as the vice presidential candidate.
But the courts ordered Howie (at least) to be placed onto the ballot, and we celebrated a partial victory for a day or so.
But now the Democrats have now appealed. Our response to their court appeal is due on Monday.
The Green Party of Pennsylvania has run out of money to keep defending our ballot line, and so it's up to us to continue the fight. The new expenses could run as high as $20,000.
Will you make a donation now to help us defend our Pennsylvania ballot line?
Without Howie and Angela on the ballot, no one will be talking about moving away from fossil fuels (fracking is a huge problem in PA) to avert climate meltdown. No one will be calling for a 75% reduction in military spending to be reinvested in our communities.
Without our team on the ballot, the real issues we face will never be addressed. Don't let them silence our demands for a proper Green New Deal and more.
Can you give what you can today to ensure Pennsylvania progressives have a choice?

# Hi ,
Today is the 19th anniversary of the attack on the Twin Towers in New York City, on 9/11, in which 3,000 people lost their lives in a ""blowback"" we attribute to US imperialism abroad.
It's a day in which candidates from both capitalist parties give somber speeches about national security and openly call for an escalation of the surveillance state, of ramping up military spending with a covert emphasis on the build up of nuclear weapons that are now deployed in the field and ready to fire at a moment's notice.
It's not just about the red phone in the Oval Office anymore.
We also conveniently forget about the ""Other 9/11,"" or the US-backed coup on the sovereign Chilean people that led to the suicide of democratically elected president, Salvador Allende, yet another example of US imperialist, regime-change policy.
In the name of national security, this country violates the civil rights of Muslims, adds activists and journalists to no-fly lists and uses the spectre of terrorism to justify the crackdown of against dissent at home. Our constitutional right to redress grievances in peaceful protest is threatened now more than ever.
This is not what a ""free"" nation should be like. And this situation is bipartisan in its creation.
It's time to set the course aright and put the nation on a path toward true peace both home and abroad, where whistleblowers like Julian Assange, Reality Winner, Edward Snowden and others are given a proper place in society as truth tellers.
But deep down, you know that this course correction will never come from either capitalist party, with campaign coffers stuffed full of contributions from the military industrial complex and from the corporations that are conducting surveillance on us [[URL REDACTED]] now.
We won't even hear these issues on the debate stage, because the Commission on Presidential Debates is really a private company which elbows out former partners like the League of Women Voters, so they can control the public discourse and keep our focus away from these real threats.
But Howie Hawkins and Angela Walker are still fighting to put the message of peace and justice onto the public agenda, in spite of the mainstream media trying to disappear this campaign and its platform.
In order to level the playing field, this campaign will have to make significant investments into social media and improving our web presence. We need to spend on strong video ads to tell our story and get the word out to a public that is not hearing Howie's and Angela's voice.
Can you make a donation today to ensure we can put a professional ad onto social media?
As Howie says, ""let’s turn the US into the world’s humanitarian superpower instead of its global military empire. Providing aid instead of arms is the best way to promote peace and security. It is time for the US to make friends instead of enemies.""
Can you donate today to ensure this message gets out to a wider audience?

Hi ,
It seems that there is no shortage of people who are giving HORRIBLE advice on how to vote and who to support in the upcoming election JUST for clickbait (or for no reason at all?).
Seriously.
[[URL REDACTED]] this type of thing is everywhere.
It’s to the point where it's hard to know what's ACTUALLY true!
So today:
I’m here to tell you about 3 huge myths that people use to hold themselves back from supporting a political movement that actually serves their interests (and sometimes people use them as an excuse to never take action!)
You might have heard one of more of these myths around the internet or from friends/family who aren’t experts.
So let's talk about these myths – then, reply and tell us: have you ever believed any of these common myths or misunderstandings? Do you wish you knew what to say to others when they repeat them?
Myth #1: Third parties aren’t electable and are a waste of your vote.
Nope, we are plenty electable and act directly in line with what will most benefit people and the planet. Voting for and donating to the Green Party allows us to contend with the two major parties and present a third point-of-view that is laser-focused on what the majority of the country needs.
You just need the willingness to learn and the courage to stand up for your beliefs and the greatest good.
If you're letting discussions about electability hold you back right now, know that the only thing ACTUALLY holding you back is FEAR.
And it's okay to be scared... as long as you feel the fear and take action anyway.
That’s courage.
Myth #2: The Green Party candidates are Russian plants meant to sabotage the election process by stealing votes.
This one…
This one never fails to make us do a double-take.
Is it so hard to believe that there is a movement of people who are unhappy with the lack of representation for their interests and needs in the current two-party system?
Is the idea of an Ecosocialist Green New Deal that is engineered to protect the health and safety of the people and the planet so contrary to the status quo that establishment politicians can only accuse us of sabotage?
The truth:
We, the people, DO need the Ecosocialist Green New Deal.
We aren’t sabotaging the election process. We are creating the platform that is needed to focus on creating a world that is fair and sustainable to all!
The reason we are maintaining such a focused direction and are not willing to compromise on our values?
Our campaign is seeking to BUILD A RELATIONSHIP OF TRUST with voters.
Trust takes time to build. It has to be EARNED.
This is why our campaign is making it a point to be open and actively listen to what you have to say.
Times are hard and it may not be easy to donate to our cause, but ask yourself:
If we don’t do this now, will times ever get any easier?
Your donation allows us to continue to fight and campaign on your behalf. We will not stop until we create a just society that works for ALL.
With an average donation of $27 from people like you, this campaign is the grassroots political movement necessary to create the positive change that we so desperately need right now.
Will you make a secure donation to help push us towards our goal?
Bottom line:
Rumors like this only get started because the establishment can’t ignore our movement anymore. They are scared because the people are rising up to regain control of the political process.
Myth #3: An Ecosocialist Green New Deal isn’t possible.
Friends...
This simply isn't true.
Not only has an Ecosocialist Green New Deal never been MORE possible, but it has also never been more NECESSARY.
Look at what has happened in 2020 alone!
Australian wildfires. A global coronavirus pandemic. The continuing humanitarian crisis on the US southern border.
The list could go on and on.
Meanwhile, the most incompetent president in American history spends his time fanning the flames of misinformation and hate.
But it can’t rain forever. The storm clouds will part and the sun will rise again on a brighter future! It just needs our help!
The Ecosocialist Green New Deal is the only way to begin reversing the damage that has been done to our livelihoods, our environment, and our nation’s morals.
This means investing in green businesses at a mobilization scale that has not been seen since World War II.
It means 100% renewable energy by 2030 along with single-payer healthcare, affordable housing, and a guaranteed job at a living wage.
\---
Now that you see that these myths are complete and utter garbage, don’t let them stop you from standing up for what you believe.
So many people believe these myths and let that stop them from taking action.
Please don't hold yourself back out of fear.
Remember:
We need everyone’s help if we are going to make these much-needed changes to our social and political landscape.
A secure donation of $27 helps us continue to create the change that our nation and world so desperately need.
Look...
In 6 months, we will have what could shape up to be the most important election of our lifetime.
More than ever before, it is critical for the 99% to have CONTROL over the issues that are being discussed AND build a movement in which everyone can thrive in harmony.
So instead of letting all of the untrue rumors hold you back and get in the way of the progress that matters most to YOU...
Donate to the Hawkins/Walker 2020 campaign now to support our effort towards a better future!
It is time to rise above the fear!
In solidarity,
## Team Howie

… but Green looks a whole lot better on you! ;-)
Hi ,
There’s something exciting about being an admitted underdog.
While both the Republicans and Democrats make empty promises and say whatever they think will convince people to elect them (with little to no intention of following through), being a third-party campaign sees us being held to a different (better!) standard.
People need to SEE us putting in the work in real-time to know who we are. They need to be able to look at our track records and see that we aren’t strangers to fighting for progressive action.
There’s no buzzwords. There’s no glamour shots.
There’s just what we do best: putting in the ACTUAL work.
(Psssst… If this sounds like you, we’re always in need of more volunteers to help us continue building this movement from the bottom up!)
Organizing and mobilizing are how we win the hearts and minds of people across this country. With the support of people like you, that’s how we win this race.
Of course, we understand that it isn’t always possible to volunteer your time. Fortunately, you are still able to support our campaign by donating or by purchasing merch.
Honestly, when is the last time an establishment candidate rolled up their sleeves and stood side-by-side with the working class of this country?
Our campaign is changing that. We want to know every single one of you. We want to hear from you and truly value your support as we continue a true grassroots campaign unlike anything this country has ever seen.
Every day we are gaining speed and getting closer to qualifying for matching funds which will nearly DOUBLE ALL OF OUR RECEIVED DONATIONS since we began this campaign.
Trump and Biden are content with the continued support of their billionaire donors (*cough* owners *cough*).
Let them have it.
We are THE campaign of the working class and are proud to represent the Left that has been forgotten in our modern political process.
We’re talking about:
The Left that values the wellbeing of people and the planet over corporate profits.
The Left that looks tirelessly for ways to help our communities.
The Left that is not scared to put in the WORK that is necessary to bring about REAL change.
It’s time to show the establishment that the people are sick and tired of the puppet shows and broken promises.
Will you chip in to help us continue representing the 99% of this country?
The average donation to our campaign is $27, but we are so appreciative of anything that you are able to contribute to this cause.
We are proud to stand with you.
In solidarity,

Hi ,
Howie and the team cannot thank you enough!
Thanks to supporters like you, the official Howie2020 Twitter account has been restored!
You have been pivotal in making it clear that we will not be stopped!
Let’s keep up the momentum. Every follow, like, reply, and retweet matter to get our account back on the Twitter algorithm’s good side. With your continued help, we will be able to ensure that the greatest issues of our time (climate change, growing inequality, and the New Nuclear Arms Race) are at the center of the political discussion.
While we are glad to be back on Twitter, there is a lesson to be learned from this situation:
With the flip of a switch, a single company can silence free speech.
It can be shocking to step back and realize just how much we rely on the Internet in today’s world. It is the ultimate vehicle for bringing people together, sharing ideas, and creating lasting change for the betterment of humanity.
However we find this online space, a pinnacle of freedom of speech and the press, consistently under attack by a select few media monopolies who are happy to place profit over the public good by killing (or should we more aptly describe it as assassinating?) net neutrality.
Not satisfied with only controlling the flow of information, these same monopolies routinely violate YOUR right to privacy and make billions of dollars profiting from YOUR data.
Then, as if to salt the wound, they refuse to pay their fair share in taxes.
A democracy only works when the people are well-informed. These conglomerates are not just undermining our rights as individuals; they are undermining the foundation of our entire political system through censorship and preferential treatment.
All data should be equal. We need net neutrality.
As we’ve seen in the wake of our Twitter account being suspended, it only takes one second (or even less) to silence a movement.
So I have a favor to ask of you.
Our campaign is making waves and we are far from finished playing offense. With your help, we’ve been able to get on the ballot in over half of the states for the election this year. While this is a momentous occasion, we can’t afford to rest on our laurels.
We will not stop until we see Green representation on every ballot in every state. Progressives are tired of empty promises and blatant hypocrisy from those who are expected to be leading this country.
We NEED to be honest with ourselves as a country.
Climate change is getting worse. Grotesque inequality is getting worse. The New Nuclear Arms Race is driving us closer to catastrophe and our current President could not seem to care less.
This is only just beginning and we will not stop. However, we can only stay in this fight with YOUR help.
Fortunately, there are several ways that you can contribute to our success.
You can donate to the Howie 2020 campaign by clicking here.
Every donation helps us continue to advance an Ecosocialist Green New Deal that is specifically designed to solve the greatest threats of our time. We are doing this without selling out to millionaires and billionaires who are always happy to “own” any political movement that they can add to their collection.
If we are going to stand toe-to-toe with these powers, we can only do so with YOUR support.
Follow us on social media for all of the latest updates. We are on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.
Subscribe and enable notifications on Howie’s Youtube Channel so that you don’t miss a single stream. Howie regularly goes live every Tuesday at 8pm Eastern and is ready to answer YOUR questions!
Show your support with the official Howie 2020 merchandise available in the campaign shop.
Together we can do this.
Together we can preserve net neutrality and freedom of speech.
Together we can #BuildToWin
Let’s make #EcoSocialism happen!

Howie Hawkins and Angela Walker, candidates for the Green Party nomination for president and vice president
# Hi ,
Thursday we celebrated the formation of the Black Panther Party 54 years ago in Oakland, California.
The Black Panther Party clearly showed the willingness of regular people to organize and take action to protect their communities.
Today, we find ourselves still calling for the changes that these brave people were fighting for in the 1960s: community control of the police, reparations paid to African Americans, and social/economic
equality.
As we have continued to see the murder of African Americans by police in 2020, names such as George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and Ahmaud Arbery to name only a few, the conversation has to include the importance of community control of the police.
This isn’t a new idea.
The time for this idea has already come and the need for this type of action to regain control of our nation’s police forces has never left.
In fact, it’s never been more necessary.
We’re living in an age where these headlines are blasted into feeds on every social media platform.
Entire generations of minorities and their children have been seeing the news for their entire lives while also seeing the lack of action in addressing the racism and sadism in law enforcement and the criminal justice system.
It has to stop.
As Fred Hampton said,
> ""We got to face some facts. That the masses are poor, that the masses belong to what you call the lower class, and when I talk about the masses, I'm talking about the white masses, I'm talking about the black masses, and the brown masses, and the yellow masses, too. We've got to face the fact that some people say you fight fire best with fire, but we say you put fire out best with water. We say you don't fight racism with racism. We're gonna fight racism with solidarity.""
Yet neither major party is giving this matter the attention that it deserves.
Republicans, as expected, are denying the problem at best and protesting or contributing to it at worst.
Meanwhile, Democrats, as expected, have taken the slogans of organizations like Black Lives Matter to make grand gestures but, ultimately, doing nothing more to solve problem.
This is why the Green Party is so necessary.
Someone has to raise awareness of these issues.
Someone has to spell out plans for how we end the abuse, misconduct, and blatant murders being committed by police officers (who are then only given administrative leave as “punishment”).
Someone has to say plainly that the way to fight crime is to fight poverty (Angela Walker says this).
And most of all, someone has to take action.
That’s why we are asking for your support in this campaign.
It’s about coming together in solidarity to create the changes that we so desperately need in this country and in our communities.
The Black Panther Party did not sit back and spend all of their time theorizing how their communities could look.
> ""If you dare to struggle, you dare to win. If you dare not struggle, then damn it, you don't deserve to win."" --Fred Hampton
They said “enough is enough” and took action to protect their communities from the very same problems that we are seeing today. They knew how their communities should look and took action to
help make it happen.
Now it’s your time to do the same.
By clicking the link below and making a donation to this campaign, you are saying “enough is enough” and standing up against racism, abuse, and hatred.
Will you stand with us?
Choose to be a victor by making a donation (recommended $27) today as we fight back against Trump and the whole corrupt system that brought him here!
> “Their [the police] real power is manifested in the organized guns and force. But we’re saying that the people in this community, the people in this country, don’t have any control over that organized guns, force, and power. We’re saying that the capitalist, the racist, and others have control over it. And we’re saying that we want to change it, that we want to revolutionize it, turn it over into the hands of the people, for a new process to occur. We’re saying we want community control.” – Bobby Seale, Chicago Community Control of the Police Conference, June 1, 1973
And remember:
#NeverSettle

# Hi ,
Take a moment to stop what you are doing and imagine what the future holds.
Do you see a world in which people don’t have to live in fear of their government? Where people are able to live freely and build flourishing communities? Where people are paid fairly for their work and have access to the healthcare that they need?
It’s easiest to say that we’re campaigning to beat Trump, but it goes so much further than that.
You see, this is the kind of world that we are fighting for.
That’s why your donation is so important to our campaign.
With an average donation to our campaign of $27, we are reclaiming our country for the working class.
I don’t want to imagine a future where the greatest threats of our time (inequality, climate change, and the New Nuclear Arms Race) continue to go unaddressed until we find ourselves with no future at all.
For too long, workers have tried to reason with the ruling class. But history has shown that change only happens when people come together and DEMAND reform.
We aren’t asking permission from millionaires and billionaires to launch an Ecosocialist Green New Deal.
Instead, we’re asking you to stand with us and create the sustainable Green future that people deserve.
Without everybody pitching in to help us petition to get on the ballot in EVERY SINGLE STATE, how many people will not know that they have a choice in this election who is ACTUALLY working in their best
interest?
We are running out of time to get on the ballot in several key states and desperately need your contribution to make this happen.
* Washington needs 1,000 signatures by July 25, which will cost $3,000
* Arkansas needs 1000 signatures by August 3, which will cost $3,000
* Kansas needs 5000 signatures by August 3, which will cost $15,000
* Nebraska needs 2500 signatures by August 3, which will cost $7,500
* Minnesota needs 2,000 signatures by August 18, which will cost $6,000
I wish time was on our side, but it’s crunch time.
If ever there was a time to make a donation (which is matched dollar-for-dollar by the government by the way!), it’s now!
Donate now (recommended $27) to help us secure a Green victory in November!
For all you do to support this campaign, we just want to let you know how much we appreciate you.
An Ecosocialist Green New Deal is getting closer every day with your help!

# Hi ,
We don't need to remind you that today is Election Day, because everywhere you turn, everyone is urging voters to show up at the polls.
In case you still haven't voted, we have a state-by-state guide on what you need to do to cast your vote today.
Staff and volunteers are still on the phones today, and if you can make another donation today to help us reach more voters, please do. Remember that some 100 million people who could vote in 2016, didn't, and we need to reach them TODAY.
But today is not the end of the road; in fact, we've only just begun. In the immediate days ahead, our campaign will be in the courts and in the streets if necessary to fight for full and accurate vote counts so the real winners of this year’s elections take office.
Regardless of the relative balance of power after this election between the two corporate parties in the presidency, the Senate, the House, and the state houses, our campaign will mobilize support for our demands and for Green and independent socialist candidates in the next election cycle.
We will not be waiting for future elections to mobilize support for our demands. We will be educating the public, building coalitions, and mobilizing actions to advance our program.
That program includes:
* A full-strength Green New Deal
* An economic bill of rights
* Racial justice
* Peace initiatives
* Democracy reforms
And it also includes helping to strengthen and reinforce Green state and local parties all across the country, to regain or attain ballot lines so that we can run thousands of candidates for local and state offices, as well as Congress.
With a strong Green elected base, we will have people in place who will respond to the demands from below and work in concert with the working class. And because they won't be beholden to corporate dollars and instead will be directly accountable to the people who put them in office, we can be sure that we will have our demands met. They won't simply represent the working class, they will be of the working class.
One of the Green Party's 10 Key Values is Future Focus and Sustainability.
> Our actions and policies should be motivated by long-term goals. We seek to protect valuable natural resources, safely disposing of or 'unmaking' all waste we create, while developing a sustainable economics that does not depend on continual expansion for survival. We must counterbalance the drive for short-term profits by assuring that economic development, new technologies, and fiscal policies are responsible to future generations who will inherit the results of our actions. We must make the quality of all lives, rather than open-ended economic growth, the focus of future thinking and policy.
It's up to us, Greens and Socialists, to work toward a future we all deserve.
Tonight, we will hold our Election Night live stream, with special guests like Jill Stein, Ajamu Baraka, Cheri Honkala, Gloria Mattera and Margaret Flowers. Also scheduled are Lee Camp and Ron Placone, as well as progressive allies like Peter Daou and Ryan Knight. We'll even be hearing from some of the most dynamic Green candidates that have worked hard to represent our shared values.
You can subscribe to that live stream here. The show starts at 7 pm EST (6 pm CST, 5 pm MST, 4 pm PST). We'll be streaming on YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Periscope and Twitch. We hope to see you there tonight!
The future begins now, and we hope you stay on for the ride.

Hi ,
You wouldn’t know it from the corporate media, but Tuesday, March 3 is Super Tuesday for the Green Party, too.
More Green delegates will be allocated by primary than on any other day for the Green Party presidential nominating convention in Detroit, July 9-12.
My campaign has two basic goals: Build the Green Party and Put Green Demands into the National Discussion.
I am running a national campaign that seeks to qualify the Green Party for the ballot in all 50 states and DC. I am the only candidate in the nation in any party with a realistic chance of qualifying for federal primary matching funds, which will be crucial in supporting our ballot petitioners.
With ballot access across the country, we will be in a position to put Green demands into the national presidential debate and policy agenda, including:
* The Green Party’s full-strength Green New Deal to address the climate crisis.
* An Economic Bill of Rights to end poverty and reduce economic inequality through federal guarantees to a living wage-job, an income above poverty, an affordable home, comprehensive health care, lifelong public education from preK through college, and a secure retirement.
* Nuclear disarmament initiatives to reverse the new nuclear arms race.
* Deep cuts in military spending on the order of 75%, with the savings devoted to a Global Green New Deal for climate safety and economic justice to build peace with the planet and among its peoples.
* Reparations for African Americans to redress the grievances of African American families and communities for 400 years of slavery, segregation, and discrimination and finally achieve liberty and justice for all.
* Electoral reforms to establish a multi-party democracy in the US, including proportional representation in Congress and a national ranked-choice popular vote for president.
We are running out of time to solve the life-or-death issues of climate change, economic inequality, and nuclear weapons. The Democrats and Republicans cannot even solve basic problems like providing affordable housing and health care, clean water, and relief from student and medical debt.
Real solutions can’t wait! It is time for the Green Party to fill this political vacuum.
Your vote counts. I’m asking for your vote tomorrow, Super Tuesday, March 3.
For peace, justice, democracy, and ecology,

# Hi ,
How many innocent people have to die before we realize that now, more than ever, we absolutely need community control of the police?
Why do we not have a requirement for FEDERAL prosecution of police brutality when these officers violate a person’s civil rights?
Street crime has been declining for 30 years, but police killings continue a steady pace of 1,000 a year.
You know the names.
George Floyd. Eric Garner. Sandra Bland. Philando Castille. Rekia Boyd. Jonny Gammage. Michael Brown.
The list goes on and grows every day.
Now in response to the uprisings across the nation, we have a president who ignorantly posts that “when the looting starts, the shooting starts” and a Democratic nominee who calls for peace without actually doing the work to talk about the issues.
It can’t be ignored. It has never been more evident that the two-party system does not care enough to view this for what it is:
These uprisings are an expression of not being heard. They are expressions of rage and grief towards the state-sanctioned murder of unarmed black citizens.
This is why we as a country NEED true Progressives to be represented on the political stage.
But the simple truth is that we can’t do it without you. We are calling on everyone who is:
* FED UP with the blatant injustice that has become so commonplace
* SICK AND TIRED of a President who does not care about the citizens of the country that he is supposed to be running and is actively working to make situations WORSE
* Ready for change that will work for ALL people and promote a society that is fair, just, and works for the betterment of EVERYONE
We have seen this campaign gain some incredible traction with YOUR support. But the fight is far from over! Your donation is the difference between creating lasting positive change in our country or four more years (at least) of this tone-deaf madness!
Angela Walker wrote an open letter to black Americans which can be read here. We encourage you to share this with everyone that you can.
As Angela mentions in her letter, this campaign is directly addressing the systemic changes that NEED to be made. Don’t be demoralized by the Republicans’ antagonizing and the Democrats’ noticeable silence.
There is a solution and the Green Party is prepared to bring this solution before the entire country.
But we have to get there first and can only do it with your continued help.
Every share of our campaign and every dollar donated are voices that make it clear:
We are tired of the lies.
We are tired of the hypocrisy.
We are going to fix this country with a solution that works from the bottom up.
It’s time to stand together in absolute solidarity and say that enough is enough.
The average donation to our campaign is $27, but we are so appreciative of anything that you are able to contribute to this cause.
In solidarity,

# Hi ,
First, we are up against a hard-and-fast deadline to get on the ballot, and we need your help TODAY.
Progressives in these following states will have no one to fight for them if we do not get on the ballot:
* Washington needs 1,000 signatures by July 25, which will cost $3,000
* Arkansas needs 1000 signatures by August 3, which will cost $3,000
* Kansas needs 5000 signatures by August 3, which will cost $15,000
* Nebraska needs 2500 signatures by August 3, which will cost $7,500
We need to hire petition gatherers NOW to make this happen, and we need your help to raise the money TODAY.
Please give what you can so that we can get on the ballot in these urgent states.
We’ve all heard the saying that “Those who fail to learn from history are condemned to repeat it.”
In World War II, the federal government either took over or built more than a quarter of the country’s manufacturing capacity. This was done to turn industry on a dime and build an arsenal for democracy that could rise to defeat the greatest threat of the time: the Nazis.
The clock was ticking and we could not rely on profit incentives in the market to meet our needs in the timeframe that we needed them met.
Now the clock is ticking again and we need to rise to meet the greatest threat of our time: climate change.
This is exactly why the ONLY solution to overcoming this threat is that same level of mobilization in the form of an Ecosocialist Green New Deal.
We need a truly Green economy. We need an Economic Prosperity Program that is more than just a Climate Action Program.
We don’t need to choose between jobs and the environment. The truth of the matter is that we create jobs by correcting our relationship with the environment.
Whether we’re talking about the Rust Belt, the inner cities, or rural America, an Ecosocialist Green New Deal is the quickest and most thorough way to revive our economies.
But we are learning from our history too.
When World War II ended, the federal government gave control of the factories back to the super-rich and the corporations. Instead of repeating that, we are fighting to see that wealth spread to workers in the form of worker co-ops that give them the FULL value of the labor that they create.
This is why we are building the Green Party and are determined to be on the ballot in EVERY. SINGLE. STATE.
We are building the Green Party into a major party because the two major parties right now are failing to solve our problems.
They are failing to solve the climate crisis.
They are failing to put a stop to the New Nuclear Arms Race.
They are failing to solve the crisis that each of us (80% of Americans in fact) face every month: how are we going to pay our bills?
While we appreciate that some Democrats like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and others have put a spotlight on these issues, there is still work to be done. It’s not enough to keep the slogans while diluting the content of the argument.
Isn’t it time for a major party that truly represents the people to be presented as an option for voters?
The clock is ticking and we need your support if we are going to succeed.
Donate now and join our cause to create sustainable and responsible change through an Ecosocialist Green New Deal!
We are glad to have you with us!

# Hi ,
Are you ready?
Howie and Angela are going live on YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Periscope and Twitch this evening (8 pm EDT) and are going to be answering YOUR questions. You aren’t going to want to miss this!
This will be the NINTH livestream Q&A! Can you believe it?
We can all agree that there are a colossal number of major issues in this country that need to be fixed, but let’s be honest…
With everything going on in the world right now, a lot of people just don’t have the energy to hear or read long lists of issues and proposals to fix them.
We get it.
That’s why these livestreams are so important to us and the campaign. It lets us get DIRECTLY to answering the questions that YOU care about the most.
Be sure to set a reminder on YouTube so that you can join us!
We take questions from the chat, but we also answer questions that were sent in advance!
If you aren’t able to join us live, you can still submit a question through the campaign website!
This is a campaign that is being run for and by the working class. These conversations are important to make sure that we’re focusing on what matters most to you.
There’s never been a campaign like this. We are hyper-focused on fixing this country from the bottom up and we are not compromising on the needs of the people.
With Trump spending every waking moment finding new ways to try to turn us against each other and the Democrats refusing to work WITH Progressives instead of against them, this is the time for us to rise up together as a unified party and take our country back from the corrupt politicians who got us into this mess.
It’s been a hard-fought journey, but we are glad to have you alongside us! Your support is what enables us to keep fighting to protect the interests of the millions of people that the two-party system seems to
have forgotten about.
Unfortunately, this raises a major question: how are we going to keep funding this campaign?
We rely on your donation to keep our momentum in fighting back against Trump and the corporate-owned two-party system.
The average donation to our campaign is $27, but we are so appreciative of anything that you are able to contribute to this cause.
Thank you so much for everything that you do and we look forward to seeing you when we go live!
In solidarity,

Happy Valentine's Day ,
Many of us on the left support the idea of a universal basic income, because we deeply believe that a rising tide lifts all boats. It's a special love for our fellow human that drives us to consider everyone's needs. In fact, the Green Party platform has long advocated for universal basic income.
So when Andrew Yang dropped out of the presidential race this week after the Democratic primary in New Hampshire, many supporters of the idea of universal basic income were disappointed. However, we remind you that Howie Hawkins has a much better plan, called the Negative Income Tax (NIT), and we're asking you to do everything you can today to show Howie some love and make a donation so that he can continue to talk about NIT.
What's NIT? In short, it's an extension of a progressive tax system, where people below the poverty line receive income to bring them up to the poverty line, with a 50 percent phaseout rate where the NIT payment is reduced 50% for every dollar earned until the taxpayer reaches 200% of the poverty line under their own steam.
NIT would mean that people with low incomes would receive monthly payments from the IRS instead of paying taxes to it. And even better, NIT costs less overall and covers more people (read more, in Howie's Ecosocialist Green New Deal budget, here).
Sounds like a good plan, right? The problem is, without your help, we will not be able to get the word out that the idea of an income guarantee for all is still alive. Can you help with a donation today?
There are plenty of resources to go around, to ensure everyone has a basic guaranteed income. Now we need the political will to make it happen. Please show Howie Hawkins some love today.
In love and solidarity,
Team Howie

# Hi ,
You’ve almost certainly seen the news that Trump and many others in the White House have COVID-19.
By still refusing to encourage responsible practices as we face this pandemic, nearly the entire White House have become “super spreaders” rallying under their Super-Spreader-In-Chief.
In April, Howie published an article titled “Trump Is Killing Us.” From his late and misguided response to his refusal to encourage safe practices by giving people the support they need to survive,
Trump’s actions in April were nothing short of negligent homicide.
But now?
As he has continued to hold his rallies and refused to follow safety guidelines, we can’t call it negligent homicide anymore.
Trump’s behavior makes it painfully obvious:
The President is actively trying to kill us.
If there was ever a time that people needed to support the type of policies that we have dedicated this campaign to fighting for, it’s now.
When you support this campaign, you aren’t just supporting the only party that is fighting for the rights and well-being of the working class.
You’re supporting Medicare For All, monthly financial assistance as families are still wrestling with the economic depression from COVID, and a “Test, Trace, and Isolate” program to stop the spread of this
virus.
Your donation today is the best way to support our campaign as we work tirelessly to fight against Trumpism to protect the rights and well-being of the working class!
Oh, and, one more thing…
While we’re trying to eradicate COVID-19, let’s go ahead and wipe out the virus-like hatred that Trump is so insistent on spreading.
Want to get rid of COVID-19?
Want to get rid of The. Most. Dangerous. President. Ever?
Make a donation today to support our fight against an administration who tries to ignore us, a media that tries to silence us, and an establishment that’s scared of us.
Your $27 donation today is the make-or-break factor for this campaign. Without your help, we won’t be able to keep up the pressure to get rid of Trump’s hateful incompetence and secure a Green New Deal that works for the people.
Can we count on your support?
Stand with Howie and Angela by making a donation (average $27) TODAY to the only campaign fighting for Medicare For All, racial/economic justice, and a Green New Deal!
And remember:
#NeverSettle
In solidarity,
## Team Howie
Donate now (recommended $27) and join our cause to create sustainable and responsible change through an Ecosocialist Green New Deal!

# Hi ,
Yesterday morning, most of us woke to the news that the president is COVID-19 positive. We wish Mr. Trump and the First Lady the best and hope for a speedy recovery - as we do with the millions of others around the world who have been infected with COVID.
For Donald Trump this diagnosis means canceling campaign rallies during the crucial leadup to the election, it means leaving the next debate up in the air and it means placing in doubt his abilities to conduct daily duties -- Mike Pence is standing by. But mostly, of course, it means being not just politically but personally confronted with the months of vehemently denying the existence and extent of the pandemic while more than 200,000 Americans were struck down by the virus, while he had the power and responsibility to do much more.
Donald Trump joins the more than 7 million Americans and more than 34 million people around the world who have contracted this murdering virus. With more than a million deaths so far, we do not care to see anyone else sicken or die from COVID-19, no matter what their party affiliation, where they live or any other irrelevant details. No more deaths.
Our campaign and the work of the Green Party has never been to isolate or target one politician. Behind Donald Trump is an army of Republicans who are cheering him on at every turn. Behind the Republicans is an army of Democrats who agree with the same policies and systems that have led to the catastrophic impact our country is facing. Environmental destruction, economic injustice and pervasive racism are often more than acceptable byproducts of the policies of both major parties.
Climate change increases the spread of many infectious diseases. Air pollution increases virus transmission. Many of the root causes of the climate crisis such as deforestation and massive livestock farming increase the risk of pandemics. NASA is studying how environmental degradation is helping to spread COVID-19.
But even our schoolchildren know this, so how can things ever be different when our elected leadership have all of the knowledge and all of the resources to act, but still keep failing us?
It is only through systemic change that we will turn the tide on the pandemic, its economic fallout that is unsurprisingly hurting poor, black, Latinx, Asian and indigenous people disproportionately, and the healthcare systems rendered woefully inadequate to care for people who are sickened.
It’s a vicious cycle: (1) the pandemic, if not caused by Democrat and Republican-led assaults to our ecosystem, was certainly exacerbated by a government infrastructure built by two parties who are more beholden to corporate donors and Big Industry than to the welfare of the American people. (2) The economic fallout from the pandemic devastates huge layers of workers and their families who were already struggling to survive. (3) Unequal access to housing, medical care, good jobs and social safety nets because of racist systems pushes communities of color even further into despair and makes them more susceptible to COVID-19.
Meanwhile, Jeff Bezos, supporter of both major parties but mostly a Democrat donor, made more than a million dollars in the time it took you to read this message, while thousands and thousands of his vulnerable workers are getting sick with COVID.
Our system is unquestionably broken and we cannot spend one more second scrambling to patch it back up so it limps on to hurt more of us. No more pretending that we don’t need a government that is eco-socialist and truly democratic, or that it isn’t possible to create something better, where neither presidents nor meatpackers are hurt by a preventable virus, where contact tracing and uniform distancing measures are in place and all Americans have accessibility to tests as they do in most other countries.
We deserve better. Our families deserve better. Our communities and the world need better.
The way to make that demand for what we need and deserve is via a vote for Hawkins/Walker 2020.
In solidarity,
## Team Howie
P.S.: We're phone and text banking right now, with a goal of connecting with 7 million voters in the next two weeks. Can you make a donation today to help us meet that goal?

Howie Hawkins and Angela Walker, candidates for the Green Party nomination for president and vice president
# Hi ,
""I know that this email is different than all of the other ones that you’ve received. If you will pardon the intrusion, I just need to write something from my heart.
I’m a volunteer for the Hawkins/Walker campaign. My name isn’t important. I just want to be heard.
Growing up, I was raised with a strong sense of stoicism. The idea was that a man shouldn’t cry or show weakness and I should grow to be a man who can be strong and use that strength to help others.
Less than a week ago, my dad was diagnosed with COVID-19. I don’t think that there’s been a day that I haven’t cried since. It’s almost funny how there’s also a certain sense of shame added to the emotional mix.
When I see people on the news or on social media protesting having to wear masks or calling COVID-19 a hoax, it just hits even harder now. Previously I’d get upset at their ignorance and I would possibly grumble to my roommate about the jerk on my screen. But now it’s like I just grow cold.
How can these people not see what’s going on around them? When I see their behavior, egged on by a President who spews nothing but lies and hatred, I’m speechless.
My dad is a good man and is the hardest working person that I know. The family business went under several years ago and I watched him do any odd jobs that he could to keep himself and my mom afloat. At his age (late 40s at the time), nobody would hire him for any job despite an excellent track record.
He eventually got on with a community center in a nearby rural town. The pay was far less than anything he had made in nearly 20 years, but being able to be on the front lines of helping the most vulnerable people in an already poor area seemed to stir something in him.
We would meet for lunch every week and he would tell me all about the senior citizens who would come up to the community center just to see him. He would organize all sorts of events for them. Bingo nights, karaoke parties, bake sales… He was making a difference in these peoples’ lives and improving the community. While I was happy about that, I was mostly blown away at seeing how this affected him.
For the first time in my entire life, it was like my dad was truly and honestly happy.
As the COVID pandemic began sweeping the country, my dad and a few other workers at the community center volunteered to get a van loaded with food and supplies to deliver to the seniors who were now under quarantine. He was working nearly 70 hours a week to make sure that every single person had what they needed and was still in good health. This kept on until the morning that he couldn’t get out of bed.
He’s having difficulty breathing and his thoughts are scrambled. Mom wants nothing more than to be by his side, but she knows that that’s not an option. As the hospitals in my city fill up and find it necessary to add external refrigeration units to accommodate the sheer volume of the deceased, I can’t help but be overcome with fear at the thought of my dad’s name being among those in the next 40+ page long obituary section of the newspaper.
You think you can imagine the pain of families that are going through this until you find yourself in that situation. With no health insurance and virtually no savings available to speak of, I’m trying not to be bitter at how this system has completely failed my family. I’m trying not to be bitter that while my dad struggles for every small breath that he can get, we have a president who refuses to handle the pandemic responsibly and openly mocks experts.
I’m trying not to be bitter, but I don’t know how well I’m succeeding. It’s not a pretty confession, but it’s just where I’m at.
As I’m doing what I can to help Howie, Angela, and everyone else in this campaign, my mind just can’t help but wonder, “what if we had an Ecosocialist Green New Deal in place?”
I can talk data and speculate statistics all day, but, right now, I mostly just care about my dad. I know that he wouldn’t be fighting for his life against this virus right now. He wouldn’t also be stressed because he doesn’t know where the money for rent is going to come from. He wouldn’t be worried about the treatment costs (which range around 40k-70k). He’d know that the seniors from the community center are taken care of.
He would be able to know that everything is okay.
In my opinion, this campaign is the only one that is clearly taking this seriously. I can only speak for myself, but I’m not sure whether to be more upset at the Republicans or Democrats. As far as I’m concerned, they both contributed to this mess.
I genuinely feel that this may be our last chance to get it right in our election. This campaign is talking about the issues that have affected my family my entire life. Better yet, this campaign is taking action. No Republican ever did that in my life. No Democrat ever did that in my life.
So here I am at my lowest point of vulnerability. I don’t want my dad to die. I don’t want anyone to die or lose their home or go hungry.
I’ve never considered myself an optimist and I won’t start now. Donations to this campaign help keep the fight going. We’re small, but we aren’t scared to stand up for what’s right. We need to get serious about donating to this campaign and spreading the word. As long as there’s even one voice of dissent against the corrupt and uncaring ruling class, we have a chance. But they’ve drawn a line in the sand and made their position clear.
Thank you for letting me tell my story. Please donate to this campaign and reach out to get involved in any way that you can. It’s going to take all of us.
We have qualified for Matching Funds status which means that anything that you donate to our campaign is MATCHED. Your $25 donation becomes $50 for the campaign at no extra cost to you!
In solidarity,
Nameless in Texas""
Join the cause and make your voice heard by making a federally-matched donation (recommended $27) today!
Without having the Green Party in the presidential race to appropriately represent the interests of the working-class and the environment, we will not see real solutions raised from either of the two major parties.
We are at a unique point of time where it is more possible than ever before to pave the way for real change that will actively improve peoples’ lives. The only way to attack real life-or-death issues such as COVID-19, climate calamity, the new nuclear arms race, and the racial and economic inequality that has led to a decline in the life expectancy of the American working class is by approaching these issues with real solutions.
Donating to our ballot access drive is the best and most direct way to combat these crises. Without Greens on the ballot, no one will fight for COVID-19 relief or a Medicare 4 All platform that will protect people like Nameless in Texas' dad.
The clock is ticking on, and we still need to get on the ballot in several states:
* Washington needs 1,000 signatures by July 25, which will cost $3,000
* Arkansas needs 1000 signatures by August 3, which will cost $3,000
* Kansas needs 5000 signatures by August 3, which will cost $15,000
* Nebraska needs 2500 signatures by August 3, which will cost $7,500
We need to hire petition gatherers NOW to make this happen, and we need your help to raise the money TODAY.
With your contribution, we will be able to get on every ballot in every state to show voters that there is no need to settle with their vote.
Also, every donation that we receive from now through August 27th is matched dollar-for-dollar by the federal government as, with your help, we have qualified for matching funds status.
The iron is as hot as it gets. You need to strike right now.
Real change is possible and the fight for an Ecosocialist revolution is more critical now than ever. Every dollar donated helps push us closer to our goal of creating true and lasting positive change!
Click the link below and let us know that you’re standing with us!
I’m with Howie and Angela!
Thank you for keeping the revolution alive!

Howie Hawkins and Angela Walker, candidates for the Green Party nomination for president and vice president
# Hi ,
Progress is inevitable.
While Trump and his kind continue to fight tooth and nail in a campaign fueled by hate and fear, they are growing weaker every single day.
Trump is falling in his polls, consistently becoming even more of a laughingstock on the world stage with every single day, and proving beyond any shadow of a doubt that he is the...
Worst. President. In. History.
As 2020 shapes up to be the most important and decisive election of our time, we have to ask:
Will you be counted among those who stand against Trump’s tyranny?
There has never been a more important time to make a federally-matched donation (recommended $27) and join our cause to create sustainable and responsible change through an Ecosocialist Green New Deal!
We are at the most pivotal moment of this campaign so far.
With your help, we have qualified for Federal Matching Funds status which effectively doubles all of the donations that we receive. Especially for a grassroots campaign that refuses to be bought by millionaires and billionaires, this is huge. With your support, we have taken this campaign further than many people thought possible.
And we won’t stop.
This is not over until we can drive a stake through the heart of Trumpism and the corrupt corporate-owned system that enables it.
But the revolution needs your help.
It is going to take all of us to do this, but we are well on our way to realizing an EcoSocialist Green New Deal. Can we count on you to donate today?
Together we can realize a future that puts the wellbeing of people and the planet over corporate profit.
This is the last week to get on the ballot in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. We are still pushing to get on the ballots in Arkansas, Kansas, and Nebraska, but time is quickly running out. Without
your help, we cannot afford the costly process of petitioning to get on the ballots.
So at this point where Trump is finding himself with no ground to stand on AND donations to our campaign are matched dollar-for-dollar by the government, there is only one question left to ask:
In the most important revolution of our time, will you be counted?
Without your help, we aren’t even able to get on the ballot in some states. This is exactly why we are humbly asking you to make a federally-matched donation now (recommended $27) and join our cause to create sustainable and responsible change through an Ecosocialist Green New Deal!
There is still so much work to be done and we still need to get on the ballot in several states:
* Arkansas needs 1000 signatures by August 3, which will cost $3,000
* Kansas needs 5000 signatures by August 3, which will cost $15,000

# Hi ,
If you ask the mainstream media, you have two options to decide between for your vote: Republican or Democrat.
To be blunt, you do have two options.
But it’s not a choice between Republican and Democrats that we’re talking about…
It’s the choice between being pro-profit or pro-people.
Republicans and Democrats are proving to be two sides of the same coin. Progressives thought that they could gain influence to change the Democratic Party from within, but it has become all too clear that the ONLY solution to put the wellbeing of our people and planet at the center of our political discourse is to organize and mobilize as a united party that sticks to the issues.
The establishment of corporate-owned parties can wish us away as much as they want, but WE ARE HERE TO STAY.
Help take our country back from the corrupt ruling-class by clicking here to donate now!
Our campaign is one focused on the issues that matter most: a democracy that works for the majority, social and economic justice in the face of rising inequality, preserving our environment to build a
sustainable future, and promoting peace both domestically and abroad.
But we still have work to do and need YOUR help to continue our push in creating the most successful grassroots campaign in our nation’s history.
Because this is not a campaign funded by millionaires and billionaires, every single dollar that is donated is able to be directly used in creating the change that we so desperately need.
The biggest (and most costly) step in this is petitioning for ballot access. As it stands, we still need to get on the ballot in several states.
* Washington needs 1,000 signatures by July 25, which will cost $3,000
* Arkansas needs 1000 signatures by August 3, which will cost $3,000
* Kansas needs 5000 signatures by August 3, which will cost $15,000
* Nebraska needs 2500 signatures by August 3, which will cost $7,500
* Minnesota needs 2,000 signatures by August 18, which will cost $6,000
We need to hire petition gatherers NOW to make this happen, and we need your help to raise the money TODAY.
Remember, your donation is matched by the federal government. A $25 donation towards an Ecosocialist future becomes $50 at no extra cost to you!
Thank you for all of your support. Together we can #BuildToWin!
In solidarity,

# Hi ,
Okay, okay, so there’s not actually a bruise on my forehead…
But there should be…
I mean… really…
For four years now, nearly every single morning starts with a full-force facepalm as I read the latest headlines. This year it feels like it’s every hour!
I’m guessing you probably feel the same way.
That’s why I’m humbly asking you to make a donation to our campaign today.
We’re not just taking on Trump. We’re taking on the entire system.
The needs of the working class have been ignored for too long and it’s time that we take back control over our lives.
It’s a hard fight and it’s going to take support from everyone to make this happen.
Make a donation today by clicking the link below so we can take out the trash and get workers in the White House for a change!
I'm ready to donate! Goodbye facepalms! Hello Ecosocialist Green New Deal!
In solidarity,
## Team Howie
Donate now (recommended $27) and join our cause to create sustainable and responsible change through an Ecosocialist Green New Deal!
Want to volunteer to help the campaign? We’d love to have you!
The mainstream media is trying to disappear this campaign, so please help get the word out by sharing our content on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and YouTube.
Don't forget to subscribe to the weekly Tuesday live stream at 8 pm Eastern/7 pm Central/6 pm Mountain/5 pm Pacific.

# Hi ,
Every day, the Trump administration spews more and more lies to the American people. It doesn’t feel like it would be over-exaggerated to say that “every minute.”
This orange buffoon and his gang of cronies has dedicated every waking moment to undermining American democracy, sowing seeds of division amongst our people, and waging an all-out war against
the working class.
If you are wondering what your donation to our campaign is actually accomplishing, that is exactly what we are fighting against.
The average donation to our campaign is $27, but we are so appreciative of anything that you can contribute.
We’ve had four years of nothing but lies and misinformation from the Trump administration. Whether it’s the size of his crowds, the amount of COVID-19 testing that is being done, his asking other countries
to interfere with our election, or anything else, there isn’t a single grain of truth in the Trump administration.
The Washington Post’s “Trump Claims Database” shows that he has made over 19,000 false or misleading claims since assuming office.
Yes. Over 19,000 lies.
Furthermore, for all of their grandstanding, the Democrats seem to be unwilling or incapable of uniting the left to create the Progressive future that we need more today than ever before.
Where are the conversations and solutions to the radical inequality that plagues our society? Where are the actual plans to take action in the face of climate change that threatens to destroy our entire world
as we know it? Why are these leaders being so silent on the New Nuclear Arms Race?
This is what your donation goes toward.
We are a campaign of proud workers who are tired of seeing our class be manipulated and exploited.
We are tired of seeing a noticeable lack of care from our corrupt government about the well-being of the people in our communities.
It has to stop.
You aren’t just donating to a fanciful idea. You’re donating to a campaign that has the traction, expertise, and the track record necessary to retake our government and make sure that it’s working for every one of us.
Times are tough and it pains us to have to ask you to donate, but the reality is that this may be the last chance that the American people have to take back their control of the electoral process.
We are running out of time and the election will be here before you know it.
It’s time to take action and stand up Trump.
Stand up to Trump by making a donation (average of $27) today.
In solidarity,
